PURPOSE OF THE HISTORIC RESOURCES ELEMENT
The Historic Resources Element provides the foundation for the protection and preservation of
historic structures identified in the inventory.
A defining feature of Laguna Beach is its variety and number of older homes and buildings. If
the positive and inviting image of Laguna Beach as a pedestrian community with a unique
village atmosphere and significant aesthetic amenities can be retained, the City will continue to
enjoy prosperity and increased property values.
The loss of numerous older buildings due to the escalating coastal real estate market and changes
in the housing sizes and styles was the catalyst for the original Historic Resources Element
adopted by the City in 1983. The City Council of Laguna Beach recognized the importance of
enacting measures to protect its numerous historic buildings. In 1980 the City Council took a
proactive approach composing a citywide inventory of structures with historic value. The
Historic Resources Element provides guidelines, goals and policies that assist the City of Laguna
Beach in preserving its historic and cultural resources. It establishes a broad framework for both
public and private efforts and outlines an implementation program of both financial and planning
incentives to promote long-term appreciation and preservation of historic resources.
Through the Historic Resources Element and the Historic Preservation Ordinance, the City
incorporates historic preservations as a major component of its local planning process and
recognizes its importance to maintaining the quality of life of its residents, as well as promoting
its attraction to visitors.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE HISTORIC RESOURCES ELEMENT
The Historic Resources Element is not a state-mandated element of the General Plan. Even
though this element is optional, it follows specified procedures developed for mandatory
elements in terms of content, style and process. The Historic Resources Element is composed of
three main components: 1) Introduction, 2) Issues, Goals and Policies, and 3) The
Implementation Plan. The Issues, Goals and Policies section provides a description of the major
issues related to preservation and protection of historic resources. Goals, which are overall
statements of the community's desires, are comprised of broad statements of purpose and
direction. Policies are action statements presented to address these issues. Implementation
measures explain how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented.
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The State of California General Plan Guidelines discusses the need for internal consistency
among elements of a general plan. The goals, policies and implementation measures are
consistent with the applicable elements of the City's General Plan, specifically the Land Use and
Housing Elements. Throughout the preparation of this document, consistency and coordination
has been maintained, not only with the General Plan, but also with other plans, such as the
Vision Laguna Strategic Plan.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Vision Lapruna Strategic Plan
In the spring of 1999, the Laguna Beach City Council appointed the Laguna Beach Vision
Steering Committee to oversee and manage the Vision Laguna Strategic Plan. The mission of
Vision Laguna 2030 was to generate a consensus about the future direction of Laguna Beach.
The Vision Laguna 2030 process required gathering a database, identifllng a shared vision,
developing a strategic plan, and planning for implementation. This update to the City's Historic
Resources Element has incorporated pertinent historic preservation goals and projects fi-om the
Vision Laguna Strategic Plan.
Downtown Specific Plan
Downtown Laguna Beach was one of the first areas of the City to be extensively developed in
the early 1900's. The downtown presence and character distinguishes the community from most
of the surrounding cities. The policies established in the Downtown Specific Plan are for the
purpose of maintaining and enhancing this unique character. Historic preservation is identified
as an important concern in the downtown because of the close relationship to other planning and
design considerations. The goals and policies of the Downtown Specific Plan are consistent with
the policies of the Historic Resources Element of the City's General Plan
Historic Preservation Ordinance
The provisions of the City of Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Ordinance provide a tool for
implementing the Historic Resources Element.               The Ordinance promotes voluntary
implementation and provides incentives for adding to and modifying historic structures while
ensuring preservation of the original architectural integrity of the structure. The incentives
include fee waivers, setback flexibility, parking reductions and a property tax reduction (Mills
Act) for qualified historic structures.
Properties on the historic inventory are rated either "En for Exceptional, "K" for Key or "C" for
Contributive. "E" rated buildings are usually in excellent condition and unique; some are
eligible for the National Register. Structures with a "K" rating are buildings which strongly
maintain their original integrity and demonstrate a particular architectural style or time period.
"C" rated structures contribute to the overall historic character of the neighborhood, but are not
unique or distinctive; however, these properties are still important to the streetscape of Laguna
Beach. The City of Laguna Beach has a total of 745 properties listed on its Historic Inventory,
with 130 "E" rated structures, 351 " K rated structures, and 258 "C" rated structures.
California Environmental Qualitv Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in
response to a public mandate for thorough environmental analysis of any projects that have the
potential to affect the environment. The provisions of the law and environmental review
procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of
CEQA ensures that during the decision-making stage of development, City officials and the
general public will be able to assess the environmental impacts associated with private and
public development projects to historic, archaeological and paleontological resources.
Certified Local Government
The 1980 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 provided for the
establishment of a Certified Local Government (CLG). This program allows for direct local
government participation and integration in a comprehensive statewide historic preservation
planning process. certified Local ~overnmentsare-eligible on a competitive basis for special
         - -
matching grants from a pool of money representing atleast 10                   of California's annual
grant from the National Historic Preservation Fund. Although it is a federal program, the CLG
program is administered by the Office of Historic Preservation in California. A local
government that agrees to enforce state and local legislation for the designation and protection of
historic properties, maintains a review board, maintains a system for the survey and inventory of
historic properties and provides public participation in the local historic preservation process.
California Register of Historical Resources
The California Register of Historic Resources, enacted in 1992, is an authoritative guide to be
used by state and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to identify the state's historical
resources. The California Register program encourages public recognition of architectural,
historic, archaeological, and cultural significance resources; identifies historical resources for
state and local planning purposes; and defines threshold eligibility for state historical grant
funding. Individuals or local governments may directly nominate properties to the California
Register. Local public agencies may assist in the nomination of properties and may comment on
nominations, which originate from private groups or individuals within their jurisdiction.
Property owners must be notified and provided an opportunity to comment upon the
nominations.
National Register of Historic Places
The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the nation's cultural resources
worthy of recognition and preservation. It is a federal program maintained by the National Park
Service and administered by the Office of Historic Preservation in California. Properties qualify
when they (a) are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of history, (b) are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past, (c) embody
the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; represent the work of
a master; possess high artistic values; or represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction or (d) have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history. Any individual or group may prepare a National
Register nomination. Completed applications are submitted to the Office of Historic
Preservation.
Although there are 38 properties eligible, only two properties in Laguna Beach are currently
listed on the National Register of Historic Places; one is Villa Rockledge (c.1918-1921), a
Spanish Mediterranean house designed by noted architect Arthur Benton, designer of the
Mission Inn Hotel in Riverside, CA. Villa Rockledge is located at 2529 South Coast Highway.
The other property listed on the National Register is the Cathedral Chapel of St. Francis By-the-
Sea (American Catholic Church, c.1933), with eclectic architecture and built from the rubble of
the Long Beach earthquake. The Cathedral Chapel of St. Francis by the Sea is located at 430
Park Avenue. Photographs of these two structures follow this section.

I.      Introduction
A.      Purpose and Scope
The California Legislature has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide importance,
and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian,
including farmworkers, is a priority of the highest order.” To accomplish this housing goal, California
Government Code, Article 10.6 (§65580) mandates that each local government adopt a Housing
Element as part of its General Plan. Section 65581 contains the following declarations, which describe
the legislature's intent in enacting Housing Element law:
       (a)    To assure that counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
              attainment of the State housing goal.
       (b)    To assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement Housing Elements which,
              along with federal and State programs, will move toward the attainment of the State housing
              goal.
       (c)    To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by it
              to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal, provided such a determination is
              compatible with the State housing goal and regional housing needs.
       (d)    To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments in order to
              address regional housing needs.
The Housing Element provides citizens and public officials with an understanding of the housing needs
of their community, sets forth the City’s strategy to preserve and enhance the community’s residential
character, and expands and preserves housing opportunities. The 5th Housing Element planning cycle 1
covers the period 2013 to 2021.
The City of Laguna Beach adopted its first Housing Element on October 2, 1974. Revisions to the
Housing Element were subsequently made in 1981, 1985, 1990, 2001, and 2012. With the ultimate goal
of meeting the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the
State requires the Housing Element to include the following data:
        •     An assessment of population and employment trends
        •     An assessment of household characteristics
        •     An assessment of special housing needs
        •     An assessment of the effectiveness of the community’s prior housing programs and policies
        •     An assessment of the City’s ability to accommodate its fair share of the regional housing
              need
        •     An assessment of low or moderate income housing at-risk of conversion
        •     An inventory of land suitable for residential development
        •     An assessment of governmental and non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
              improvement, or development of housing
1
    The 2013-2021 period is the fifth Housing Element cycle since the comprehensive overhaul of California housing

        •     An assessment of opportunities for energy conservation
        •     A statement of goals, policies and quantified objectives
        •     A five-year housing program for the preservation, improvement, and development of
              housing
B.      Citizen Participation
Formal citizen involvement in City housing matters has occurred on a continuous basis since 1972,
when a citizen’s committee was appointed to assist in preparing the City’s first Housing Element.
Following adoption of the Housing Element in 1974, a Housing Committee was appointed by the City
Council to act as an advisory body on housing issues. The committee has since been expanded in scope
and is now the Housing & Human Services Committee.
During the 2013-2021 Housing Element revision process, a series of public meetings and workshops
were conducted by the City’s Housing & Human Services Committee, the Planning Commission, and
the City Council. The purpose of the meetings was to solicit public input on the draft Housing Element.
In order to solicit public input from all members of the community and low-income housing advocates,
the City ran press releases in two local newspapers, the Coastline Pilot and the Laguna News-Post,
which are distributed to the entire community. Additionally, public notices for each public meeting and
workshop were sent to a number of housing interest groups including but not necessarily limited to, the
Orange County Community Housing Corporation, Orange County Health Care Agency, the Friendship
Shelter, the Kennedy Commission, Orange County Housing Providers, the Public Law Center, and the
League of Women Voters. The draft Housing Element was provided to interested individuals and
organizations, and was available for review on the City Hall bulletin board, on the City’s website, and at
the Laguna Beach public library. For additional information regarding the public participation process,
please refer to Appendix A.
C.      Information Sources
A number of sources were used in preparing the Housing Element update. The sources used for
population, income, employment and housing data included the U. S. Census Bureau, the California
Department of Finance (DOF), the California State University, Fullerton Center for Demographic
Research (CDR), the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the
California Employment Development Department (EDD), the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Data for
housing sales and rents was obtained from market reports and DataQuick. The regional housing needs
assessment (RHNA) was provided by SCAG. All data related to existing housing and residential
building sites in Laguna Beach was obtained from the General Plan, Municipal Code, property files,
building permit data and the City’s Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and California Coastal Zone
law (Mello Act). And lastly, comparison of development fees was provided by the City Planning
Department.

II.     Existing Conditions
A.      Introduction
This Chapter examines general population and housing characteristics and trends, such as age, race and
ethnicity, employment household composition, size and household income. Characteristics of the
existing housing stock, including number of units and type, age, conditions and costs, have also been
evaluated to better understand the nature and extent of unmet housing needs in the community.
The analysis utilizes the most recent available data from the U.S. Census Bureau, demographic
estimates from the California Department of Finance (DOF), employment data from the California
Employment Development Department (EDD), and other relevant sources as cited within the following
sections.
B.      Population and Employment
Population
Since 1990, the Laguna Beach population has been stable. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the
Laguna Beach population was 22,723, and the California Department of Finance estimates that the 2013
population has increased slightly to 23,105. However, the City has still not regained the population lost
during the decade 2000-2010, as depicted in Table II-1. Future growth in Laguna Beach is expected to
remain relatively low as opportunities for housing development continue to diminish due to the limited
availability of developable land. According to the California State University at Fullerton Center for
Demographic Research, the Laguna Beach population is projected to increase to about 23,385 by 2035,
an increase of just 662 persons (2.9%) compared to 2010.

The preceding table indicates that the average annual growth rate decreased from prior years for both the
City and County after 1990. During the decade 2000-2010 the City actually lost population. Population
growth between 2010 and 2013 is estimated by the California Department of Finance at 0.56% on
average annually for Laguna Beach and 0.79% on average annually for the County. The City’s
population decrease between 2000 and 2010 is attributable primarily to an increase in the vacancy rate
                                                                     II-1

from 11.2% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2010. As with many beach and resort communities, a substantial
number of units are second homes that are not occupied on a permanent basis.
Table II-2 below indicates that the largest segment of the City’s population in both 2000 and 2010 was
between the ages of 25 and 44 years, despite a sharp decline in this population during the decade. The
following table compares the age distribution between 2000 and 2010. The greatest percentage change
in population during the decade was in the 55-64 and 65+ age groups, which both increased by more
than 32%. These age groups represent a portion of the “Baby Boom” generation born between 1946 and
1964. Due to the significant number of Baby Boomers in Laguna Beach, a variety of housing types and
affordability, and the provision of senior services and resources are imperative. While the 18 to 24 age
group posted a small increase, high land and housing costs make it difficult for young adults to live
independent of their parents in Laguna Beach.

The racial and ethnic composition of Laguna Beach, as depicted in Table II-3, is significantly different
than the county as a whole. Non-Hispanic white persons comprised 85.7% of the population in 2010
compared to just 44.1% for the county. The second largest racial/ethnic group in Laguna Beach was
Hispanic or Latino, with 7.3% of the population, followed by Asians who represented 3.5% of the City’s
population. Comparatively, Orange County had a more diverse population in 2010 with an overall
minority population of 55.9%, versus 14.3% in Laguna Beach.

Employment
The Laguna Beach economy is comprised primarily of tourism, the arts and resident-serving businesses.
Not only is the service industry the largest industry in Laguna Beach, it is also the largest industry in the
County, followed by retail trade and durable manufacturing. In 2008, the largest Laguna Beach
employers were: Montage Resort (777 employees), Mission Hospital Laguna Beach (250 employees),
City of Laguna Beach (302 winter employees and 540 summer employees), Surf and Sand Hotel (300
winter and 330 summer employees), Laguna Beach Unified School District (314 employees), Laguna
Playhouse (225 employees), Las Brisas Restaurant (168 employees), and Hotel Laguna (65 winter
employees and 90 summer employees).
According to recent Census American Community Survey (ACS) estimates2, about 66% of city
residents age 16 and above were in the labor force, and 3.5% were unemployed. A majority of Laguna
Beach residents are employed in “white collar” occupations. According to recent Census estimates 3,
about 61% were involved in management, business, science and arts occupations, 23% were employed
in sales and office occupations, 10% worked in service occupations, 3% were employed in the natural
resources, construction, and maintenance sectors, and 3% worked in production, transportation and
material moving occupations. An upward trend has continued in the proportion of residents employed in
management or professional occupations from 48.8% in 1990 to 57.7% in 2000 to 60.8% most recently,
reflecting an increase in the number of educated and higher-income residents.
C.      Household Characteristics
The federal government defines a household as an occupied dwelling unit. Households are classified as
“family” households or “non-family” households. “Family” households are those in which the head of
household lives together with one or more related persons. “Non-family” households consist of a group
of unrelated persons or a single person living alone. Persons who are institutionalized or living in a
group setting such as a nursing home are classified as “persons in group quarters.”
Existing household characteristics such as size and type indicate the future housing requirements of a
community. A community with a large proportion of family households would typically have a
corresponding demand for ownership housing. Communities having a large proportion of single-person
households, particularly senior citizens living alone, may require smaller dwelling units, such as second
residential units also known as “granny units,” mobile homes or affordable apartments.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, family households in Laguna Beach held a slight majority with
53.5% of households compared to 46.5% non-family households. Single persons living alone
represented more than one-third of all households in the City, and 28.7% of all households contained a
member age 65 or over. When compared to the County as a whole, Laguna Beach has a smaller
proportion of family households, fewer households with children under 18, more senior citizens, and a
smaller average household size.

Citywide the average household size has remained relatively constant over the past 30 years, with an
average of 2.08 persons per household in 1980 and an average of 2.09 persons per household in 2010.
This household size is considerably less than the countywide average of 2.99 persons per household in
2010.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S. Census
Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person per room,
excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are more than 1.5 occupants
per room. Table II-6 summarizes recent overcrowding data for the City of Laguna Beach compared to
the County as a whole. The table shows that overcrowding is much less prevalent in Laguna Beach than
throughout the County.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates “area median family
income” (AMI) annually. A set of factors is used to calculate income limits by family-size; these income
limits are used to categorize households by income. The 2013 HUD estimated AMI for Orange County
is $87,200 for a family of four. The following is an explanation of the HUD income categories:
        •    Extremely-Low Income Households: Those households whose income is not more than 30
             percent of the region’s median income, adjusted for household size.
        •    Very-Low Income Households: Those households whose income is not more than 50
             percent of the region’s median income, adjusted for household size.
        •    Low-Income Households: Those households whose income is between 51 percent and 80
             percent of the region’s median income, adjusted for household size.
        •    Moderate-Income Households: Those households whose income is between 81 percent and
             120 percent of the region’s median income, adjusted for household size.
        •    Above-Moderate-Income Households: Those households whose income exceeds 120 percent
             of the region’s median income, adjusted for household size.
Table II-7 provides the household income distribution for Laguna Beach by income group. More than
two-thirds of Laguna Beach residents fell within the moderate to above-moderate income range, while
31.4% fell within the extremely-low to low income range. The households at the lower end of the
income range may be living from paycheck to paycheck, which places them at-risk of becoming
homeless.

The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) adopts HUD’s income
limits for use in State programs. Table II-8 below represents the HCD Official State Income Limits for
2013 for Orange County. These income limits have been adjusted for family size and high housing cost
in the County. The income limits for household size, other than four persons, are calculated using the
four-person income limit as the base.

D.       Housing Stock and Condition
Housing Stock
As depicted in Table II-9 the 2013 State Population and Housing estimate shows a total of 12,958
Laguna Beach housing units. The estimated housing stock is comprised primarily of low-density, single-
family detached housing. Attached and detached single-family units represented 71.2% of the housing
stock, and multi-family structures represented 26.7% of units. Mobile homes represented approximately
2.2% of the City’s total estimated housing units in 2013.

This table illustrates the decline in multi-family units over the past two decades from 31.6% to 26.7% of
all housing units, reflecting the need to preserve rental housing. The number of mobile homes in Laguna
Beach increased from 183 in 2000 to 289 in 2013.
Housing Conditions
The condition of existing housing stock is determined by its age, quality of original construction and
continued level of maintenance. Favorable housing conditions enhance neighborhood quality, which in
turn promotes housing maintenance and improvement. Quality housing stock also correlates with the
income and social stability of a neighborhood. According to the California Building Code, which has
been adopted by the City of Laguna Beach, a “substandard building” is defined as “any building or
portion thereof that is determined to be an unsafe building in accordance with Section 102 of the
                                                                   II-6

City of Laguna Beach                                                                     II. Existing Conditions
Building Code, or any building or portion thereof, including any dwelling unit, guest room or suite of
rooms, or the premises on which the same is located, in which there exists any of the conditions
referenced in this section to an extent that endangers the life, limb, health, property, safety or welfare of
the public or the occupants thereof, shall be deemed and hereby are declared to be substandard
buildings.”
According to the City Building Official, the majority of the City’s housing stock is in good-to-fair
condition, and very few housing units in the City are not in full compliance with applicable Building and
Safety codes and related ordinances. Additionally, the few housing units considered to be substandard
are so only because of limited seismic bracing and/or the application of less stringent building
requirements that were in effect at the time those residences were constructed.
A major fire in October 1993 destroyed 286 homes and damaged another 35 homes in Laguna Beach.
Most of these homes were located in the Mystic Hills and Canyon Acres areas of the City. Repair and/or
reconstruction of fire-damaged homes began immediately. In response to the need of homeowners and
residents to return to safe housing, the City enacted policies to expedite the processing of zoning plan
checks and building permit applications. Nearly all of the homes that were damaged or destroyed have
now been reconstructed.
On June 1, 2005, a major landslide in Bluebird Canyon damaged 41 properties and resulted in the
demolition of 13 homes. In December 2007, reconstruction of Flamingo Road and major drainage
infrastructure in the landslide area was completed, enabling property owners to repair or rebuild their
homes.
Housing Costs and Vacancy Rates
According to DataQuick, during 2012 the median single-family home price in Laguna Beach was
$1,273,000 and the median condo price was $773,000. These housing prices were considerably higher
than the Orange County median single-family home price of $500,000 and median condo price of
$287,000. According to recent ACS data, the median monthly rent in Laguna Beach was $1,771, or
about 10% higher than the Orange County median monthly rent of $1,604, as shown in Table II-10. Due
to the high cost of property in Laguna Beach, mortgage payments are typically much higher than rental
rates, in part because the rental housing stock comprises relatively smaller and older housing in the City.

According to the California Department of Finance, the housing vacancy rate in Laguna Beach was
16.3% in 2013 compared to 5.4% for the County as a whole. Due to its attraction as a vacation
destination, a significant portion of vacant units are second homes used occasionally. The City has
adopted a Short Term Lodging Ordinance, which allows short-term (30 consecutive days or less) rental
of residential units, subject to the approval of an Administrative Use Permit. As an action within the
Housing Program of this Element, the City will be reviewing the Short-Term Lodging Ordinance to
ensure that the conversion from long-term to short-term occupancy will not negatively impact the City’s
long-term housing stock (see Chapter VII, Program 18).

E.      Low/Moderate Income Housing At-Risk for Conversion to Market-Rate Housing
The State of California requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low- and/or moderate-income
housing units which may be at risk losing their affordability restrictions due to expiration of covenants.
The law requires that the analysis cover a ten-year period, or 2013 to 2023 for the current Housing
Element period. Table II-11 provides an inventory of the City’s low- and moderate-income housing
projects and potential affordability expiration dates.

The City’s low-to-moderate income housing inventory totals 164 units, and only Harbor Cove, a 15-unit
senior citizen apartment complex, is eligible for conversion to market-rate units during the next 10
years. Due to the potential conversion of Harbor Cove, a program of the Housing Program within this
Element addresses preserving the affordability of these units beyond the projected conversion dates
(Program 23).
Cost Analysis
The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving low-income housing include:
        1.       Acquisition costs – depends on size, location, current sales figures.
        2.       Rehabilitation costs – average cost to rehabilitate - $40,000 (based on data compiled by the State
                 Department of Housing and Community Development’s Multifamily Housing Programs).
        3.       New construction costs – depends on size, construction materials, financing costs, and off- and
                 on-site improvements.
        4.       Rental assistance – depends on the income of the household and Fair Market rents. As of 2013,
                 Fair Market rents for Orange County are as follows:
                 Efficiency - $1,061
                 1-bedroom - $1,219
                 2-bedroom - $1,527
                 3-bedroom - $2,137
                 4-bedroom - $2,379
                                                                II-8

                                                                                                   Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                                         II. Existing Conditions
Based on state income limits, a very-low-income household of four persons can afford to pay $1,204 per
month (including a utility allowance) for housing. This would require a monthly rental subsidy of $323, or
$3,876 per year for a 2-bedroom unit. Therefore, if affordability covenants were to expire on the 15 units in
the at-risk project, a total cost of approximately $58,000 per year would be required in order to provide rental
subsidies for 15 existing apartment units. Replacement through new construction would be very difficult due
to the scarcity and high cost of buildable land.
Preservation Resources
Efforts by the City to retain at-risk housing units must draw upon basic resources as follows:
        Organizational Resources - The following local agencies are potential organizations with experience
              and capacity to assist in the preservation of at-risk units:
               a.    Orange County Community Housing Corp. (Santa Ana)
               b.    Jamboree Housing Corp (Irvine)
               c.    Mary Erickson Foundation (San Clemente)
               d.    National Community Renaissance of California (Rancho Cucamonga)
        Financial Resources – The following is a list of potential financial resources to be considered as part of
              the City’s overall financial plan to retain affordable housing units.
             a.     Community Development Block Grant funds.
             b.     Orange County Housing & Community Development Department – The County receives
                    annual funding from HUD to administer the Section 8 Housing Voucher Choice Program
                    and the HOME Program.
             c.     Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) – LIHTC is a competitive affordable housing
                    grant program funded by the federal government.
F.      Coastal Zone Housing
Article 10.7 of the California Government Code (§65590, et al.) establishes special requirements for the
replacement of low or moderate income dwelling units that are converted to non-residential uses or
demolished, and provision of low and moderate-income housing in conjunction with new development
within the State Coastal Zone. The entire City of Laguna Beach, with the exception of the Sycamore
Hills area, is located in the Coastal Zone.
California Government Code §65590(b) requires that:
       The conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by persons and
       families of low or moderate- income, as defined in §50093 of the Health and Safety Code, shall
       not be authorized unless provision has been made for the replacement of those dwelling units with
       units for persons and families of low or moderate income. Replacement dwelling units shall be
       located within the same City or County as the dwelling units proposed to be converted or
       demolished. (Provisional language within this Code Section specifies certain types of low or
       moderate-income residential demolitions/conversions that are exempt from this requirement.)
California Government Code §65590(d) requires the following:
    New housing developments constructed within the Coastal Zone shall, where feasible, provide
    housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income, as defined in §50093 of the
                                                       II-9

                                                                                            Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                                  II. Existing Conditions
    California Health and Safety Code. Where it is not feasible to provide these housing units in a
    proposed new housing development, the local government shall require the developer to provide such
    housing, if feasible to do so, at another location within the same City or County, either within the
    Coastal Zone or within three miles thereof. In order to assist in providing new housing units, each
    local government shall offer density bonuses or other incentives, including, but not limited to,
    modification of zoning and subdivision requirements, accelerated processing of required applications,
    and the waiver of appropriate fees.
A third option to the preceding State requirements is to establish an affordable in-lieu housing fee,
which is used to facilitate development of affordable housing in the City. A fee may be paid by the
developer for 10 or fewer units, in-lieu of providing the required affordable housing either on- or off-
site. The City has established an In-lieu Housing Fund, which is described in Section V.C – Laguna
Beach Housing Trends and Strategies (page V-1). Additionally, Housing Element Policies HE-1.8 and
HE-2.1 require the replacement or payment of an in-lieu housing fee for the removal of low- or
moderate-income rental housing in the Coastal Zone.
California Government Code §65588 requires the Housing Element of jurisdictions located in the
Coastal Zone include the following:
       1.    Number of new residential units approved for construction after January 1, 1982.
             It is estimated that 1,890 housing units were completed between January 1, 1982 and
             March 31, 2000. After deducting 681 residential units constructed in the Sycamore Hills
             area, outside the Coastal Zone, the estimated number of Coastal Zone units constructed
             within the Laguna Beach City limits between January 1982 and March 2013 is 1,337. Of the
             1,337 residential units, 165 are restricted to occupancy by low or moderate income
             households.
       2.    Number of residential units for low and moderate-income households required to be
             provided either within the coastal zone or within three miles of it.
             Since 1982, the City has required the provision of four moderate-income for-sale housing
             units in Hidden Valley, in compliance with the City’s 25% subdivision inclusionary housing
             requirement. Additionally, the City has utilized in-lieu housing funds toward the
             development of 24 very-low income rental units for the disabled at Hagan Place, and 26
             very-low income studio apartments at Alice Court. Between 2006 and 2012 three second
             residential units were added to the City’s housing stock and qualify toward the City’s
             moderate income RHNA allocation although they are not deed-restricted. In October 2011
             the City approved the development of one deed-restricted low-income artists’ live/work unit,
             which has not been constructed as of May 2013.
       3.    Number of residential units occupied by low and moderate-income households and
             authorized to be demolished or converted since January 1, 1982.
             In 1996, 268 mobile homes were removed from the Treasure Island site in South Laguna for
             the subsequent development of the Montage Resort, including 14 market-rate condominiums
             and 13 single-family residences. Approximately half of the mobile homes were occupied by
             low or moderate-income households, and subsidies were provided as discussed in #4 below.
             In 2007, the City removed six low or moderate income residential units from a site at the
             northeast corner of Third and Mermaid Streets in the downtown for the development of a
             Community and Senior Center. In compliance with Housing Element Policy HE-2.1, which

             requires replacement housing or the payment of an in-lieu fee for the removal of each low or
             moderate income housing unit in the Coastal Zone, a total fee of $631,680 would be required
             based on the six units totaling 3,948 square feet. It was determined by the City Council that
             the development of Alice Court, which includes 26 very-low income residences at 450
             Glenneyre, equated to replacement housing because in addition to providing the land for the
             project, the City had subsidized the low-income project in the amount of $814,000 from the
             parking fund. The $814,000 subsidy was $182,320 more than the required replacement fee
             for the removal of the six low/moderate income units at Third and Mermaid Streets.
       4.    Number of units for low and moderate-income households required either within the coastal
             zone or within three miles of it in order to replace those being demolished or converted.
             As a result of the Treasure Island Mobile Home Park closure, rental subsidies and relocation
             fees were provided to Treasure Island residents. Additionally, the land at 450 Glenneyre
             (Alice Court) was purchased in part with the in-lieu housing fees paid by the property owner
             for the subsequent development of 26 very-low-income rental units and one manager’s unit.

III. Housing Needs
A.      Housing Cost in Relation to Ability to Pay
According to the Department of Housing and Community Development, housing is generally the largest
single expense item for most households. Housing is considered affordable whenever a household
spends 30% or less of its household income for shelter. Gross rent or gross monthly owner costs
determine a household’s monthly payment for shelter. Gross rent includes the contract rent, plus
utilities. In most cases, the contract rent includes payment for water, sewer, and trash collection. Gross
monthly owner costs include mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities, condominium fees and site
rent for mobile homes.
The provision of affordable housing to Laguna Beach households is one of the City’s most critical
housing issues. With high land values some households are forced to: 1) pay more than they can
reasonably afford for housing; 2) accept inadequate accommodations; or 3) relocate outside of the
community. This section assesses the City’s need for more affordable housing by evaluating the number
of households that overpay for housing.
Housing assistance need is generated when housing costs exceed household ability to pay. The
inventory and assessment of housing needs for Laguna Beach is based on the following requirements
established by the state for local Housing Elements.
        •      An analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections and a
               quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels.
               [§65583(A)(1)]
        •      Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
               compared to ability to pay…. [§65583 (a)(2)]
Table III-1 provides income classifications for Laguna Beach and Orange County, as reported by

The preceding data assists the City in determining its affordable housing needs, based on the income of
the existing population. Table III-2 below depicts recent Census Bureau estimates for households by
income category. About 13% of households had annual incomes below $25,000 while almost half had
incomes of $100,000 or more.

Table III-3 provides recent Census Bureau estimates of the percentage of income that the City’s
households spend on housing, and further distinguishes owners from renters. Based on the data provided
in this table, 45.1% of all Laguna Beach’s households were paying 30% or more of their incomes for
housing. Approximately 43% of owners and 48% of renters were found to be overpaying. The similar
percentage of overpayment among renters and owners is indicative of a shortage of both low income
rental and ownership housing. Although overpayment for housing is an important statistic, some
households that are overpaying may be doing so by choice because they desire accommodations with
amenities that are not available at an affordable cost. Due to the scarcity of developable land, combined
with the desirability of Laguna Beach, some households are willing to pay more for housing. The
Housing Program in Chapter VII sets forth policies and actions to encourage and facilitate the
development of affordable housing in response to the City’s need.

Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30 percent of gross
household income. Table III-4 displays recent estimates for overpayment by household income level.
This table shows that approximately 60 percent of all lower-income owner households and 80 percent of
all lower-income renter households in Laguna Beach were overpaying for housing. Households in the

lowest income categories generally suffer the greatest cost burden. Although homeowners enjoy income
and property tax deductions and other benefits that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-
income homeowners may need to defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to
deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up, resulting
in overcrowding and related problems.

Extremely Low Income
Extremely low income (“ELI”) refers to households with incomes of no more than 30% of the county
median ($28,900 for a family of 4 in Orange County in 2013). As seen in Table III-4 above, HUD
estimated that 89% of the 270 ELI owners and 75% of the 355 ELI renters in Laguna Beach were
overpaying for housing. As shown during the discussion of housing growth needs during the 2013-2021
planning period (see Table III-11), the City’s projected growth is two housing units of which none are
assigned to the ELI category.
B.      Housing Special Needs Populations
There are segments of the community that need special consideration in their attainment of housing.
Special housing needs refer to persons and households that live in a housing situation or have a housing
need that is not typical of the average Laguna Beach household. As identified in State Housing Element
law, six household types are included within the meaning of special housing needs. The City has
identified a seventh category of special needs household as very low income persons employed in
Laguna Beach. Designation of this special needs population was based on a survey completed by the
Housing and Human Services Committee prior to adoption of the 2000 – 2005 Housing Element. The
survey was updated by the Committee in March 2013 and the results once again showed the need for
affordable workforce housing in Laguna Beach. Identification of this unmet housing need resulted in the
development of Alice Court in 2004, which includes 26 very-low-income studio apartments with one
manager’s unit in the downtown. Since that time the City has broadened the scope to include low- and
moderate-income persons employed in Laguna Beach, as discussed below. The special needs
populations include:
        •      Disabled Persons
        •      Senior Citizens

Persons with Disabilities
Disabilities may include mental, developmental, physical, and/or medical limitations. The two most
prevalent housing needs for persons with disabilities are accessibility and affordability. Most individuals
who are mobility impaired need housing that can provide ease of access and accommodate or be
adaptable to wheelchairs.
Recent ACS data estimated that there were 1,700 persons with some type of disability in Laguna Beach,
which represented approximately 7% of the City’s population (Table III-5). As expected, the elderly had
the highest rates of disabilities, with about 10% reporting an ambulatory difficulty.

The County of Orange Health Care Agency (HCA) promotes the development of supportive transitional
and permanent affordable housing opportunities for the mentally ill and recovering substance abusers. A
primary concern of the HCA is the mentally disabled who are homeless and also have a substance abuse
problem and/or history of incarceration for minor offenses. The lack of adequate income and related
resources contributes to the significant number of homeless mentally disabled individuals. The County
estimates that mental illness affects 3% of the general population. Based on that ratio and the Laguna

City of Laguna Beach                                                                        III. Housing Needs
Beach population estimate of 23,105 persons in 2013, approximately 693 Laguna Beach residents are
estimated to have been mentally ill. HCA indicates that approximately 20% to 50% of these persons are
capable of living semi-independently in their own housing units with adequate support services.
1.     Persons with Acquired Immune Deficiency
       The housing needs of people with HIV and AIDS depend largely on the stage of the person’s
       illness. Generally, during early stages AIDS patients may live independently. However, as the
       disease progresses a congregate care facility may be necessary. Congregate care facilities, which
       offer reasonably priced housing and medical care on a regular basis, could provide relief and
       comfort to those who suffer from the disease.
       In order to provide affordable housing that offers the services necessary for persons with AIDS,
       the City assisted a private, non-profit corporation in the development of a 24-unit project for
       persons disabled by AIDS. Hagan Place, an adaptive reuse housing development for persons with
       AIDS, provides housing and support services.
       The City’s Building Department implements and enforces State codes that require accessibility.
       Continued application of Building Code requirements will ensure that adequate accessibility is
       provided for the disabled. Every unit at Hagan Place and at Alice Court, a 26-unit very-low-
       income rental project in the downtown, is adaptable to the needs of the residents. Additionally,
       Housing Element Program 47 requires a portion of all new low- and moderate-income housing
       units to be physically accessible or adaptable to accommodate persons with disabilities.
2.     Developmental Disabilities
       As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an
       individual that:
              •     Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
                    physical impairments;
              •     Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
              •     Is likely to continue indefinitely;

       The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration on
       Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be
       defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can
       live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled
       individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
       affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and
       physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first

       issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
       living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
       The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
       services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
       through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
       community-based facilities. The Regional Center of Orange County (RCOC) is one of 21
       regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people with
       developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts
       with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental
       disabilities and their families.
       Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated before age 18
       is eligible for services. Services are offered to people with developmental disabilities based on
       Individual Program Plans and may include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/
       consultation; behavior management programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living
       services; infant development programs; information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal
       diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy; transportation;
       consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. RCOC also coordinates the state-
       mandated Early Start program, which provides services for children under age three who have or
       are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability. According to the RCOC, a total of 18
       persons age 3 and over in Laguna Beach received services as of 2012.
       The mission of the Dayle McIntosh Center is to advance the empowerment, equality, integration
       and full participation of people with disabilities in the community. The Center is not a residential
       program, but instead promotes the full integration of disabled persons into the community. Dayle
       McIntosh Center is a consumer-driven organization serving all disabilities. Its staff and board are
       composed of over 50% of people with disabilities. Its two offices service over 500,000 people in
       Orange County and surrounding areas with disabilities. The Center’s South County branch is
       located in Laguna Hills, a few miles from Laguna Beach.
       In addition to these resources, the City’s housing programs that facilitate development of
       affordable housing and transitional/supportive housing and promote fair housing, help to address
       the needs of those with developmental disabilities. In 2010, the Planning Commission approved a
       Conditional Use Permit for the establishment and operation of Glennwood House, a safe and
       supportive living environment for 50 developmentally disabled adults at 2130 South Coast
       Highway. Rehabilitation of the former assisted living facility commenced in September 2012, and
       the project was occupied in April 2013.
Senior Citizens                                                                                             Renters

The senior citizen population has been identified as the fastest-
growing age group in Orange County, and has been designated by
the City as a high priority with regard to housing opportunities.
According to the 2010 Census, 4,163 Laguna Beach residents were
age 65 years and older. This figure represents 18.3% of the total
population, and is a substantial increase from the 13% share in
                                                                           Owners

                                                                        Figure 1 - Senior Citizen Households by Tenure

Laguna Beach population by 2020. The Orange County Grand Jury called attention to this issue in its
2008 report 4 “No County for Old Boomers.”
Of the City’s 2,089 senior citizens, 1,128 (54.0%) were living alone, and about 3% of senior households
had incomes below the poverty level. Recent ACS data estimated that about 17% of Laguna Beach
senior citizen households were renting, as shown in Figure 1 - Senior Citizen Households by Tenure.
For comparison, about 22% of senior citizen households in Orange County as a whole were renting. The
quantity and cost of housing options available, as well as the desire of senior renters to convert to
homeownership, impact the percentage of senior renters.
Recent ACS data estimated that 16.7% of non-institutionalized senior citizens in Laguna Beach had
some type of disability. As shown in Table III-6, the most prevalent types of disabilities among seniors
were sensory, ambulatory, and independent living difficulties.

The housing needs of senior citizens include affordability, proximity to services and transportation, and
design features to accommodate physical needs. There is a wide variety of housing suitable to meet the
needs of the diverse senior citizen population. The different types of housing for seniors include private
residences, shared housing, senior and retirement housing developments and assisted and congregate
care facilities. Shared housing is an option for senior homeowners living alone. Some senior and
retirement developments, as well as assisted living and congregate care facilities, require appropriate
support services that include recreation, transportation, property management, and other staff services.
Between 1984 and 1989, three new senior citizen housing projects were developed in Laguna Beach,
with assistance from the City. In each of these projects the City provided zoning relief, financial

assistance, or monetary grants toward their development. All of the 111 units within those developments
are currently affordable to senior citizens. The developments include: Vista Aliso (71 units); Mermaid
Terrace condominiums (25 units); and Harbor Cove apartments (15 units). The potential loss of
affordable senior citizen housing is not anticipated until 2019, when the 15 units at Harbor Cove could
convert to market-rate housing. Policy HE-1.14, which states “Encourage the preservation and
continued affordability of low and moderate-income housing in the City,” and related Program Action
23 calls for the preservation of at-risk, low- and moderate-income housing from conversion to market
rate units.
No new senior or retirement housing developments have been constructed in recent years. The City’s
Senior Center provides assistance to senior citizens seeking housing opportunities in Laguna Beach. The
Senior Services Coordinator disseminates information regarding the locations and types of senior
housing opportunities in the City, Section 8 certificates, shared housing opportunities and other related
assistance. Laguna Beach Seniors, a non-profit organization, has recently initiated an outreach program
that includes a Case Management Coordinator to help senior citizens receive necessary services,
including housing-related resources.
To address the housing needs of seniors in Laguna Beach, Housing Program 36 requires the formation
of a task force, as a high priority, to provide recommendations to the Planning Commission regarding 1)
senior citizen housing options (including but not limited to residential care homes, assisted living
facilities and congregate care facilities) and 2) housing-related services (including but not limited to
“non-medical home assistance” and “home health care”), to enable Laguna Beach seniors to live
independently in their homes with necessary services. Housing Program Action 36 requires the
formation of a task force to review the City’s Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance to ensure that it
adequately addresses the access and mobility issues of seniors and persons with disabilities, and provide
recommended modifications to the Planning Commission. The primary intent is to satisfy an important
unmet need of locating assisted living opportunities and related services for the elderly in Laguna
Beach.
Female-Headed Households
Recent Census estimates indicate that there were 3,282 female-headed households in Laguna Beach
(Table III-8). This equates to 30.3% of the City’s total households. Of the 292 female-headed
households with children under 18, 47 (16.1%) were below poverty level. Housing needs of female-
headed households include affordability, proximity to schools, childcare, public transportation, services
and employment.

Families and Individuals in Need of Emergency Shelter
State legislation has mandated that the special needs assessment of the Housing Element include an
analysis of the City’s homeless population and need for emergency shelter. For purposes of this
document, “homeless” are described as: “Local persons and families who lack a fixed, regular and
adequate nighttime residence and includes those staying in temporary or emergency shelters.” The State
defines “emergency shelter” as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be
denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
Laguna Beach Shelter Facilities
       1.    Year-round Emergency and Transitional Shelter – In 2009, the City approved a pilot
             emergency shelter program at the Act V parking lot in Laguna Canyon. In June of 2010,
             after successfully operating for a year, the shelter was relocated to a long-term site at 20652
             Laguna Canyon Road. The site is owned by the City and is located in the Institutional Zone.
             With the opening of this alternative sleeping location for the homeless, the City’s cold
             weather shelter program, which operated from local churches for more than 20 years, was
             discontinued because adequate capacity was provided for the City’s homeless at the Act V
             site and the Friendship Shelter.
             Since November of 2009, the City has tracked the number of local homeless persons
             accessing the alternative sleeping location. Based on records of actual counts maintained
             during 2013 at the City’s emergency shelter alternative sleeping location (ASL), the Laguna
             Beach homeless population averages 44 persons. This data represents year-round conditions,
             including seasonal fluctuations. The shelter provides sleeping accommodations for 45
             persons per night. Preference is given to homeless persons with local ties to the Laguna
             Beach community, and records confirm that the average overnight occupancy is 44 persons.
             Therefore, the City’s emergency shelter capacity of 45 persons meets the shelter need of the
             local homeless population. Whenever fewer than 45 local homeless persons stay at the
             shelter, overnight accommodations are provided to transient homeless persons based on a
             lottery system. The City contracts with Friendship Shelter and Mercy House to operate the
             shelter. The shelter program was established by City policy, based on the need in the
             community and compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood, rather than by specific
             zoning standards.
             According to data collected at the City’s emergency shelter and Friendship Shelter, the local
             homeless population ranges in age from 18 to 86 years old. The majority of homeless
             persons are between 35 to 55 years old; 78% of the homeless are male and 22% are female.
             The majority of homeless are single persons and very few homeless families are found in
             Laguna Beach. Individuals with a disability (physical, mental health and/or substance abuse)
             comprise the greatest majority of Laguna’s homeless at 80%, while the other 20% are
             considered transitional. Transitional is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the
             movement of homeless individuals and families to permanent housing.
       2.    Other Emergency and Transitional Housing - Friendship Shelter, a non-profit, privately
             owned and operated facility, provides a year-round emergency and transitional shelter
             program for homeless adults who are able to regain self-sufficiency and rebuild productive
             lives in the community. Friendship Shelter was established in 1987 by City policy and State
             law related to residential care facilities, and provides an important resource to the
                                                   III-9

City of Laguna Beach                                                                         III. Housing Needs
             community. The shelter is located in an apartment building on South Coast Highway in the
             C-1 Local Business District. Thirty-two adults reside and participate in the Laguna Beach
             shelter program for approximately 130 days. Friendship Shelter assists homeless persons
             that are able to transition to independent living, and the 130-day time period qualifies the
             non-profit as an emergency shelter. Residents receive housing and meals in addition to vital
             support services and counseling, including legal and financial counseling and life-skills
             coaching to help rebuild their lives. These services provide a transition from homelessness to
             the ability to seek employment and long-term housing opportunities. Residents must be
             sober and free of drugs and are required to work and save money. All services are free to
             admitted residents of Friendship Shelter, and there is typically a three- to four-week waiting
             period prior to entering the program. The City has been very supportive of the Friendship
             Shelter, including a $206,000 grant from the City’s in-lieu housing fund, which assisted in
             the purchase of its building on South Coast Highway. The City also allocates community
             assistance funds to the Friendship Shelter from the annual budget.
       3.    Youth Shelter - The Community Services Program Youth Shelter, also an emergency
             shelter, is located in a residence the R-2 Medium Density Residential Zone. The City has
             provided in-lieu housing funds to support the Community Services Program (CSP) Youth
             Shelter, which serves homeless youth and focuses on reuniting adolescents with their
             families. Temporary housing is provided at the Youth Shelter for young people, ages 11
             through 17. The crisis intervention program is voluntary and requires parental involvement.
             The Youth Shelter can accommodate 16 individuals with a maximum stay of three weeks.
             Adolescents in the program are provided food, tutoring, and individual, group, and family
             therapy. The City allocates community assistance funds to the Shelter from its annual
             budget. The Youth Shelter is an asset to the community and is compatible with
             neighborhood.
       4.    Homeless and Low-Income Household Services - In 1993 the Laguna Relief and Resource
             Center (LRRC), a non-profit organization, was organized to provide emergency food to
             families who were displaced by the 1993 fire that destroyed or damaged nearly 300 Laguna
             Beach homes. Today the LRRC operates the Laguna Food Pantry to provide food to needy
             families and individuals.
Senate Bill 2 (SB 2) requires all local jurisdictions to establish a zone where emergency shelters are
allowed as permitted uses, without a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary review, to adequately
serve their homeless populations. Section 65583(a)(4)(C) of the California Government Code states that
a local government that can demonstrate the existence of one or more year-round emergency shelters
within its jurisdiction that can accommodate the jurisdiction’s need for emergency shelters may comply
with the requirement of SB 2 to identify a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed without
a conditional use permit or other discretionary review. Friendship Shelter provides 32 emergency/
transitional shelter beds and 45 beds are provided at the emergency shelter in Laguna Canyon. In March
of 2013, the City amended the Institutional Zone to comply with SB 2.
In combination, the City’s emergency shelter in Laguna Canyon and Friendship Shelter on South Coast
Highway exceed the number of beds needed to accommodate the homeless population in Laguna Beach.
Senate Bill 2 also requires zoning to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential use,
subject only to the restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.

               rental housing for homeless individuals and families to live between six months and two
               years. Transitional housing may include supportive services to assist the formerly homeless
               to gain necessary life skills to attain independent living.
        2.     Supportive housing, as defined in §Section 50675.14 of the California Health and Safety
               Code, has no length of stay limit and includes on-site or off-site services. Supportive
               housing is occupied by a target population which includes the following persons: low
               income with mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or
               persons whose disabilities originated prior to attaining age 18.
Transitional and supportive housing are permitted as residential uses, subject to the same regulations as
apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone, in compliance with SB 2.
Large Families
Large households are defined as those with five or more persons. Large households require sufficient
space to meet functional housing needs such as adequate areas for sleeping, studying, and food
preparation. Overcrowding reflects the financial inability of households to buy or rent sufficient size
housing for the number of persons within the household.

Figure 2 above reveals that nearly three-quarters of Laguna Beach households have only one or two
persons. Data from the 2010 Census indicates that only 4.2% of the City’s households are considered
“large households.”
The most detailed information for computing overcrowding is the U. S. Census data that relates to
number of persons per room. The U. S. Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 or
more persons per room. As noted previously in Chapter 2 (Table II-6), the incidence of overcrowding in
Laguna Beach is very low compared to other areas of the county.

Farm Workers
Laguna Beach has two areas of land that are zoned for agricultural use, both of which are located within
established residential neighborhoods in residential zones. However, there are presently no commercial
agricultural activities conducted on these properties. The lack of farming employment opportunities in
Laguna Beach has resulted in few farmworkers seeking housing opportunities in the City. Due to the
limited and diminishing number of farming opportunities in the immediate vicinity, there is not a
significant housing need for farmworkers in Laguna Beach.
Extremely Low, Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income Persons Employed in Laguna
Beach
In 2013 the Housing & Human Services Committee updated a survey that was previously conducted by
the Committee in 1997 for the purpose of determining how many full- and part-time employees had
salaries equal to or less than the very-low income rate of $16.22 per hour. Of the 108 Laguna Beach
businesses responding to the survey it was determined that there were 654 full time employees and 446
part-time employees for a total of 1,100 employees. The survey results indicate that 57% of full-time
employees earned salaries at or below the very-low income range and 85% of part-time employees earn
very low income wages. The purpose of the survey was to determine the affordable housing need for
individuals employed in Laguna Beach. The results also concluded that only 254 persons or 23% of the
very-low income Laguna Beach wage earners actually lived in the City at that time. Based on the
outcome of the survey, housing for extremely-low and very low-income Laguna Beach wage earners has
been targeted by the City as a high priority.
In-lieu housing fees collected from the Treasure Island reuse project were used by the City toward the
purchase of a property located at 450 Glenneyre. The development of 26 apartments (Alice Court) in
2004 increased residential opportunities for extremely low-income and very-low income persons
working in Laguna Beach.
In 2005 Soka University of America, located in Orange County, prepared an economic report for South
Orange County. The study evaluated employment, the business climate, the housing market, and
population data. Part of the study evaluated the average weekly pay for persons employed within South
County cities, as reported by the California Employment Development Department. The cities evaluated
in the study included Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel,
Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Newport Beach, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Clemente, and San Juan
Capistrano. The study found that the average weekly salary in Laguna Beach was $676. As noted in
Table III-9, Laguna Beach’s salary was eleventh out the 12 cities evaluated. Dana Point was the only
south county city to have a lower average weekly salary, which was $630. Newport Beach had the
highest average weekly salary of $1,203, which was 56% higher than the average weekly salary in
Laguna Beach.

A salary of $676 equates to a monthly salary of $2,929 and an annual salary of $35,152. According to
the 2005 income limits established by HUD, a salary of $38,400 was very-low income for a family of
four, and a salary of $34,550 was very-low income for a family of three. Additionally, the Soka
University report showed that in 2006 Laguna Beach had the highest median home price ($1,863,500) of
the 12 South County cities evaluated, as shown in Table III-10. The high real estate values in Laguna
Beach are a significant constraint to housing the employees of local businesses. Although there was a
decline in recent housing values due to the “great recession”, housing values in Laguna Beach began
trending upward in the Spring of 2013 and will continue to be relatively high due to the scarcity of
developable land, high desirability of the coastal community and limited housing supply.

Another population the City Council considers in need of affordable housing is City of Laguna Beach
employees. The City has determined it imperative that certain safety personnel and other employees live
near City Hall to respond to emergencies in a timely manner. To address this housing need, the City has
established a program of equity sharing to house necessary emergency and public works personnel. The
City Council has determined that a program to subsidize housing for local workers is necessary to attract
and retain qualified workers who also share a vested interest in the community. Other employers with
similar concerns regarding the ability of employees to live in Laguna Beach include the School District,
                                                                  III-13

City of Laguna Beach                                                                     III. Housing Needs
and Mission Hospital. According to the 2013 income limits established by HUD, the Orange County
area median-income was $87,200 for a family of four and $104,650 for a moderate-income family of
four.
Since the data concludes that the average salary in Laguna Beach has remained relatively low with
Laguna Beach housing prices significantly higher than the rest of the County, the designated special
needs population has been expanded from very-low income individuals to include low- and moderate-
income individuals employed in Laguna Beach.
The City is committed to meeting its projected needs for extremely-low, very-low, low and moderate
income housing through the policies and actions set forth in the Housing Program in Chapter VII of this
Element. The Housing Program encourages the production of affordable housing including, but not
limited to, the establishment of an inclusionary housing policy and related in-lieu housing fee to provide
funding for such housing, reducing or waiving planning and development fees for affordable housing
projects, reducing or waiving zoning standards, assisting affordable housing developers in the
attainment of federal and State funding, and expediting affordable housing applications.
C.      Regional Housing Needs
The primary intent of Housing Element legislation is to attain State housing goals through cooperation
of government entities, such as the City of Laguna Beach. Multi-jurisdictional agencies or Councils of
Governments (COGs) are given the responsibility of distributing the State’s housing needs in an
equitable manner that attempts to avoid the disproportionate distribution of very-low and low-income
households. This “fair share” allocation concept attempts to ensure that each jurisdiction is responsible
for the housing needs of its resident populations as well as for the jurisdiction’s projected share of
regional housing growth for all income categories.
The City of Laguna Beach is within the jurisdiction of two Councils of Government: the larger Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the Orange County Council of Governments
(OCCOG). Through a cooperative process, SCAG and the State of California produced a Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The RHNA represents the amount of new housing construction
each community is required to plan for through the identification of adequate sites with appropriate
zoning that are available for development during the Housing Element planning period. SCAG considers
the following factors in allocating the region’s future housing needs to each jurisdiction: 1) market
demand for housing; 2) employment opportunities; 3) availability of suitable sites and public facilities;
4) commuting patterns; 5) type and tenure of housing; 6) loss of units in assisted housing developments;
7) over-concentration of lower income households; and 8) geological and topographical constraints. The
RHNA establishes each jurisdiction’s construction need by income category.
Income Group Goals
       The income group goal is to ensure that each jurisdiction within a COG attains its share of the
       State housing goal without any relative disproportionate distribution of household income groups.
       The household income groups are defined according the HUD Area Median Income (AMI) as:
       Extremely-low (0-30%), Very-low (31-50%) of AMI), Low or Lower (51-80% of AMI), Moderate
       (81-120% of AMI) and Above-moderate (greater than 120% of AMI).

Construction Needs
       Construction needs are derived from State household growth projections, vacancy need, and
       replacement need. The income group proportions are applied toward the construction need, which
       results in a goal for the quantity of housing units, by income group, for each jurisdiction. Between
       2014 and 2021, the City of Laguna Beach has been allocated a construction need of 2 housing
       units: one very-low income unit and one low income unit (Table III-11).

IV. Resources and Constraints
A.       Land Inventory and Site Availability
Laguna Beach is very near build-out, with limited development opportunities. The majority of vacant
land within the City is environmentally sensitive due to the location of high value habitat and/or steep
topographic conditions. Some of these environmentally sensitive lands have been purchased by the City
and most of them have been zoned as Open Space, in order to preclude environmentally damaging
development, or R/HP Residential/Hillside Protection, which allows limited residential development
opportunities.
State Housing Element law requires each city to provide a summary of the sites suitable for residential
development within the planning period of the Housing Element. The following table identifies land in
Laguna Beach, which is comprised of individual in-fill lots that are suitable for residential development
during the 2013-2021 planning period. The following residential land inventory is based on aerial
photographs, the City’s Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Community Development property
files, and projects that are in the planning, development and/or rebuilding processes. In addition to the
sites identified on Table IV-1 and Table IV-2, there is the potential for the development of residential
units in mixed-use commercial developments, as well as second residential units in the R-1 and R/HP
single-family residential zones and artists’ work/live units in several zones throughout the City.

Based on an estimate of 2.75 acres in the R-2 and R-3 Zones, there is the potential for development of
up to 29 low-to-moderate income residential units within those Zoning Districts, up to ten second
residential units with seven estimated as low/moderate income based on second residential unit
approval/development during the prior Housing Element planning period, and one low-income artists’
live/work unit in the M-1A Zone, for a total low- and moderate-income housing capacity of 37 units.

B.      New Housing Development Opportunities
Laguna Beach is a highly desirable coastal community. The demand to live in Laguna Beach, combined
with the lack of housing supply, has created land values that are considerably higher than most Orange
County cities. Limited housing growth is a result of the decreasing quantity of vacant residential
property available for development. The low supply of vacant developable land and high land values in
Laguna Beach, have contributed to a decline in the quantity of new low- and moderate-income housing
being produced.
R-1 and Other Single-Family Residential Zones
The majority of the City’s undeveloped residential building sites are located in the hillside areas of the
City. The R-1 Residential Low Density Zone provides the greatest potential for new residential
development in Laguna Beach. As of June 2013, the R-1 Zone consists of 134 undeveloped building
sites. Some of these lots are encumbered by environmentally sensitive conditions, which may include
steep terrain, riparian habitat, natural watercourses, and rock outcroppings. Additionally, many of the
lots offer the potential for ocean and city-lights views. In combination, these physical site constraints
and amenities render affordable housing development opportunities infeasible in the R-1 Zone.
Another zone offering very limited residential development opportunities is the R/HP
Residential/Hillside Protection Zone, with 22 building sites as of June 2013. The intent of the R/HP
Zone is to allow for low-intensity residential development that is designed to protect public health and
safety and is sensitive to the environmental constraints of the undeveloped hillsides. The R/HP Zone
encompasses a substantial amount of the City’s undeveloped hillsides. Environmental constraints that
require the more protective zoning standards adopted for the zone include sensitive biological habitats,
unique landforms, scenic hillsides, potential danger from fire, slope failure and erosion, and difficulty of
emergency evacuation. Protection of the physical environment, public views, and aesthetics qualities
associated with undeveloped hillside lands located in the R/HP Zone is of critical importance to Laguna
Beach.
Design Review is the only discretionary review for single-family residences in the R-1 and R/HP Zones
that are not part of a new subdivision. For a complete analysis of the City’s Design Review process,
refer to Governmental Constraints (Section IV.D).
Second Residential Units
       The City’s Second Residential Unit Ordinance offers the potential for increased density within
       zoning districts limited to single-family residential development. Second units are allowed in the
       R-1 and R/HP residential zoning districts, subject to a minimum lot size, a maximum second unit
       size, and the provision of parking. Laguna Beach has 3,689 building sites of 6,000 square feet or
       more in the R-1 and R/HP Zones, which is the minimum lot size for the development of second
       residential units. Three second residential units were developed during the 2006-2013 Housing
       Element planning period; nine have been approved and two were under construction as of June
       2013. Based on the last planning period, the City anticipates the approval and potential
       development of 10 second residential units during the 2013-2021 Housing Element planning
       period. Comparable rental data of studio and one bedroom units leased in Laguna Beach between
       January and August of 2009, showed that 20 rental units of 640 square feet or less had monthly
       rents between $700 (very-low income) and $1,695 (moderate income), with an average rent of
       $1,230 per month (low income).

                                                                                            Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                            IV. Resources and Constraints
       The City also conducted a survey of existing second residential units in 2012. Of 85 surveys
       mailed to second residential unit owners, 31 (36%) were completed and returned to the City. Of
       those returned, 3 second-residence units are used as guest units or have never been occupied. Of
       the 29 second-residence units that have been or are currently occupied by residents, 18 or 62%
       are/were rented for monthly rates that fall into the extremely-low- to low-income rate; 3 or 10%
       are/were rented for monthly rates that fall into the moderate-income rate; and 7 or 24% were
       rented for monthly rates that were above-moderate. The units rented at above-moderate income
       rates are located predominantly in highly desirable locations, such as on larger lots and/or those
       with views. Based on these percentages, the City estimates that approximately 70% of new second
       units would be affordable at low- and moderate-income rents.
       In 2012, the City Council amended the City’s Second Residential Unit Ordinance to encourage the
       development of second residential units as lower-cost housing in the community. In addition to
       removing the requirement for Design Review, lowering the on-site parking requirement to one
       space that may be uncovered, and lowering the minimum lot size for detached second residential
       units, the amended Ordinance also provides incentives for the provision of deed-restricted (55
       years), long-term low- and moderate-income units. By eliminating the on-site parking requirement
       and refunding planning and building fees, the City anticipates a continuing source of deed-
       restricted low- and moderate-income housing.
       In combination, the Laguna Beach rental housing data from local brokers, the City’s second
       residential unit survey, and adopted incentives to encourage the development of low- and
       moderate-income second residential units substantiate rental rates that fall into the low- and
       moderate-income categories and provide rental housing opportunities for households of extremely-
       low to above-moderate income.
       Potential in-fill and redevelopment opportunities within other low-density residentially-zoned
       areas are very few, and many have similar characteristics found in the Diamond Crestview
       Specific Plan (DCSP) area. The neighborhood of Diamond Crestview supports many natural
       features including natural watercourses, riparian habitats, prominent rock outcroppings and scenic
       vistas. The DCSP contains 161 building sites, 45 of which are undeveloped. Land values in the
       Canyon Acres and Sarah Thurston Park neighborhoods are lower than those in other residential
       zones, due to the lack of view opportunities. However, neither neighborhood offers opportunities
       for low- and moderate-income housing, with the exception of potential second units in the R-1 and
       R-HP Zones.
       Other single-family residential zones include Treasure Island Specific Plan, Arch Beach Heights,
       Three Arch Bay, Lagunita, Sarah Thurston Park and the Village Community Zones. Based on
       aerial photographs from the City’s Geographic Information Systems website of these planning
       areas, all five are built-out neighborhoods with minimal opportunities for housing development on
       vacant, subdivided in-fill lots.
       The Arch Beach Heights Specific Plan is located in a hillside area, northeast of Coast Highway,
       in central Laguna Beach. The 95-acre residential district has a General Plan designation of Village
       Low Density (3-7 DU/acre). The original subdivision of the Arch Beach Heights area in 1911
       created approximately 1,800 25 x 100-foot parcels. The 103-acre grid subdivision does not
       coincide with the steep topography and related inaccessibility, which renders more than 200 lots
       unbuildable. Only those vacant lots abutting streets that are improved to the City’s standards are
       building sites. Due to the complexity of the hillside terrain, environmental sensitivity of the land
       and small, narrow lots, a specific plan was adopted for this planning area in 1974. Many of the lots

City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
       feature ocean and/or canyon views and therefore, command prices in the above-moderate income
       range. Arch Beach Heights is considered built-out, as most of the remaining vacant lots are non-
       building sites or part of contiguous building sites. As of June 2013, 31 in-fill building sites remain
       undeveloped.
       The Three Arch Bay Zone is an 88-acre gated community located in South Laguna. The General
       Plan designation is Village Low Density (3-7 DU/Acre). Upper Three Arch Bay is located on the
       northeast side of Coast Highway and lower Three Arch Bay is located on the coastal side of Coast
       Highway. The Three Arch Bay Zone provides low-density, single-family residences within a
       hillside setting. Like Arch Beach Heights, many of the lots capture ocean and city lights views,
       and Three Arch Bay includes ocean-front lots. The desirable coastal location and amenities of
       Three Arch Bay has resulted in above-moderate income housing prices. Developed primarily in
       the 1950s and 1960s, Three Arch Bay has been a built-out community for a number of years, and
       has the development capacity of 8 building sites as of June 2013.
       Sarah Thurston Park (STP) is located one mile from the Pacific Ocean, on the east side of
       Laguna Canyon Road. STP comprises a 27-space mobile home park and a mixture of single-
       family and 44 small multi-family residential units (four units or less). The Sarah Thurston Park
       Specific Plan was adopted in 1983 for an area that was originally subdivided by the County in the
       1930s as a campsite. The purpose of the Specific Plan is to address problems related to the unique
       campsite subdivision including: 1) smaller lots; 2) six-foot paths or lanes, rather than streets; and
       3) potential flooding and liquefaction hazards. Notwithstanding the physical and environmental
       constraints, a strong pedestrian orientation and natural setting have increased the desirability of the
       STP neighborhood over the years. One in-fill lot remains undeveloped in June 2013, with an
       average lot size of 3,502 square feet. Although some of the smaller, multi-family units would rent
       for low-to-moderate income rental rates, sales prices of single family residences and multi-family
       units are within the above-moderate income range.
       The Village Community Zone is located on the northeast side of Coast Highway in South
       Laguna. The 42-acre residential district was developed in the 1930s and 1940s and is characterized
       by moderately sloping lots that vary in size. The General Plan designation is Village Medium-Low
       Density (8 – 10 DU/Acre). The lots are accessed by narrow, private streets. Although higher in
       density and more affordable than residences in Arch Beach Heights and Three Arch Bay, the
       single-family housing within the Village Community Zone, like the majority of housing in Laguna
       Beach, sells for above moderate-income prices. The Village Community Zone is built-out with 10
       development opportunities on vacant in-fill lots as of June 2013.
       Design Review is the only discretionary review for single-family residences in the Arch Beach
       Heights, Three Arch Bay, Sarah Thurston Park, and Village Community Zones that are not part of
       a new subdivision. For a complete analysis of the City’s Design Review process, refer to
       Governmental Constraints under Section IV in this Chapter. Most residential building sites in
       Laguna Beach that have not been developed are unimproved due to various site constraints.
       Therefore, potential housing development could be quite costly and not appropriate for the
       provision of low-income housing. There are potential opportunities to increase the City’s housing
       stock in situations where older homes were built across more than one lot. However, recent
       pressures for the development of larger, more expensive homes may hinder potential development
       of smaller homes on smaller lots.

R-2 Residential Medium Density Zone
       There are very limited vacant R-2 zoned lots remaining in Laguna Beach. A maximum of two
       units are allowed on each lot in the R-2 Zone. Based on the “duplex” zoning of one unit per 2,000
       square feet of lot area, the eight remaining vacant building sites would yield a maximum of 15
       new units (Table IV-3).

       Water and sewer services are available to each of these in-fill properties, and housing development
       within established neighborhoods within the Residential Medium Density zone would not create
       environmental impacts. Design Review approval is required prior to issuance of a building permit
       for development on vacant lots. Although land prices in the R-2 Zone are in the above-moderate
       income range, a number of housing policies and actions, outlined in Chapter VII, will help to
       subsidize and facilitate the development of extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income residential
       units if desired by the property owners. Program 24 requires the provision of incentives such as
       fees reductions/waivers, density bonuses, developer assistance with federal and other funding
       applications, and In-lieu Housing Fund contributions for the development of extremely-low-, very-
       low- and low-income housing that offers long-term affordability. Program 25 directs the City to
       identify a non-profit housing developer or Housing Trust to develop, acquire, and retain long-term
       affordable housing.
       In compliance with these policies, the City has prepared a Housing Assistance Information Guide
       that outlines City incentives available to developers of affordable housing. The RHNA requires
       the City to plan for the provision of one -very low- and one low-income residence, and the City
       has adopted policies and actions to accommodate this housing need in the R-2 and R-3 Zones, as
       well as through second residential units. Additionally, housing units in the R-2 Zone are allowed
       by-right, pursuant to California Housing Element Law, California Government Code, §65583.2(i),
       which does not exempt the use from Design Review.
       A considerable percentage of property zoned for the development of two units is currently
       underutilized, supporting just one unit on parcels larger than 4,000 square feet. Policy HE-1.8
       carries forward in the requirement to replace or pay an in-lieu housing fee for the removal or
       conversion of two-family residential units that comply with the density standard of the R-2 Zone.
       This policy has resulted in the retention of rental housing in the community. Design Review is the
       only discretionary review for two-family residences that are not part of a new subdivision in the
       R-2 Zone. For a complete analysis of the City’s Design Review process, refer to Governmental
       Constraints under Section IV.D.

R-3 Residential Medium Density Zone
       The majority of new residential units in the R-3 Zone will consist of expanding development
       opportunities on underutilized lots. The R-3 Zone allows one unit for every 2,000 square feet of
       lot area, in addition to the provision of open space, setback and parking standards. There are
       currently two undeveloped parcels located in the R-3 Zone, with the development capacity of 14
       units.
       Water and sewer services are available to these vacant sites. Design Review approval is required
       prior to issuance of a building permit for development on vacant lots. Although land prices are
       within the above-moderate income range, a number of housing policies and actions within Chapter
       VII will help facilitate the development of extremely-low- and very-low-income residential units
       in the R-3 Zone. Policy 2-8 calls for the provision of incentives such as reduced or waived fees,
       density bonuses, developers’ assistance with federal and other funding applications, and In-lieu
       Housing Fund contributions for the development of extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income
       housing that offers long-term affordability. Program 25 directs the City to identify a non-profit
       housing developer or Housing Trust to develop, acquire, and retain long-term affordable housing.
       In compliance with these policies, the City has prepared a Housing Assistance Information Guide
       that outlines the City’s incentives available to developers of affordable housing.
       As noted in the discussion of the R-2 Zone above, the R-3 Zone also provides opportunities to
       address the City’s RHNA allocation for lower-income housing. As shown in Table IV-4 below,
       there are two vacant R-3 zoned sites with capacity for 14 lower-income units (excluding any
       density bonus), based on the land use designation of Village High Density (VHD), which allows
       up to 22 dwelling units per acre. Approval of a 30% density bonus would allow the development
       of 18 units on these parcels.

Commercial Zones
       Residences located within mixed-used developments are permitted in most commercial zones of
       the City, subject to a Conditional Use Permit and Design Review approval. Water and sewer
       services are provided to existing building sites. Unfortunately, the relatively small size of the
       City’s commercially zoned land limits new development potential, and in turn, potential
       residential development. Many improved commercially zoned properties do not comply with
       current zoning standards, including parking requirements. Since redevelopment of these sites
       would require compliance with the current zoning standards, such opportunities are minimized.
       Application of Density Bonus law is supported by the City to encourage the development of
       extremely-low- to moderate-income residences in mixed-use developments. Housing policies and
       actions within Chapter VII, such as Program 24 described in the affordable housing discussion
       regarding development in the R-2 and R-3 Zones, will also help facilitate the development of
       extremely-low- to moderate-income housing in commercial zones. Artists’ joint living and
       working units and efficiency units or Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units, as lower-cost housing,
       are also encouraged in commercial zones. Efficiency/SRO units in commercial zones require a

       Conditional Use Permit, Coastal Development Permit, and Design Review, with the exception of
       the CBD Office District in the Downtown Specific Plan area, which requires only Design Review
       and a Coastal Development Permit. The City waived project fees, provided In-lieu housing funds,
       and granted a 29% density bonus for Alice Court, a 27-unit extremely-low-income efficiency unit
       apartment development. The City also donated the land for development, which was constructed
       in 2004. Project entitlements included a Coastal Development Permit and Design Review for a
       new structure in the CBD Office District of the City’s Downtown Specific Plan. In combination,
       the parking reduction, density bonus, fee waivers, land donation, and fast-tracking the entitlements
       facilitated the development of this project for long-term (55-year) affordability.
M-1A Light Industrial Zone
       Residential use is not permitted in the light industrial zone; however, artists’ joint working and
       living units are allowed in the M-1A Zone, subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit,
       Coastal Development Permit, and Design Review. The City, as an artist colony, encourages
       artists’ work/live units as a method of providing lower-cost housing opportunities for artists.
       Laguna Beach also offers affordable housing incentives to developers of low-income artists’
       work/live units throughout the City. For example, Program 24 requires the provision of incentives
       such as reduced or waived fees, density bonuses, developers assistance with federal and other
       funding applications and In-lieu Housing Fund contributions for the development of extremely-
       low, very-low and low income housing that offers long-term affordability.
       In 2011, the City Council approved a Tentative Parcel Map, Coastal Development Permit,
       Conditional Use Permit, Design Review and a Variance from the rear yard setback for a four-unit
       artists’ live/work condominium subdivision, which includes one unit that was reserved for low-
       income artists’ households for a minimum of 55 years. As incentives for the provision of a long-
       term low-income unit, the project was fast-tracked and planning and building fees related to the
       low-income unit and the Variance were waived by the City Council.
C.      Retention of Lower Cost Housing
Due to the limited availability of affordable housing sites, it is essential that the City consider measures
to assist in the retention of the existing low-income housing stock. The Section 8 senior citizen
apartments in Harbor Cove will be eligible to convert to market-rate housing in 2019. To minimize the
potential for conversion of the City’s low income housing stock, Policy HE 1.13 has been adopted to
“Preserve existing extremely-low- to moderate-income housing for long-term affordability.” A housing
program action requires the identification of affordable housing subsidy programs and funding sources
to preserve “at-risk” low- and moderate-income housing from converting to market-rate, and to work
with property owners toward extending the existing affordability. Following is a list of potential
financial resources that may be utilized to retain the City’s affordable housing stock, as well as to
provide new affordable housing in the community.
       1.     HOME Program – The HOME Program was created under Title II of the Cranston-
              Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act enacted in November, 1990. HOME funds are
              made available on an annual competitive basis through the California Department of
              Housing and Community Development (HCD) small cities program. HOME funds are
              available to develop and support affordable rental housing and home ownership
              affordability. Activities include acquisitions, rehabilitation, construction, and rental
              assistance.

       2.    Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds – The City of Laguna Beach
             applies for CDBG funding, through the County of Orange, for various affordable housing
             projects and programs on an annual basis. The most recent allocations of CDBG funding in
             Laguna Beach were for the City’s shelter program and Hagan Place, a very-low-income
             project for disabled persons. CDBG funds may be used for rental and owner housing
             rehabilitation activities, infrastructure, public facilities, and public services. Proceeds from
             those activities are deposited into a revolving loan fund established from low-interest loans
             for rehabilitation and could be a resource for preservation activities.
       3.    Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) – Federal law requires that banks, savings and
             loans, thrifts and their affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries, annually evaluate the credit needs
             for public projects in communities where they operate. Part of the City’s efforts in
             developing preservation programs will be to meet with local lenders to discuss future
             housing needs and the applicability of the CRA. Although the CRA is an unpredictable
             resource, it is important that the City establish a working relationship to acquire whatever
             potential funding sources may be available to preserve low-income housing in the
             community.
       4.    Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) – The LIHTC Program provides
             Federal and State tax credits for private developers and investors who agree to set aside all
             or an established percentage of their rental units for low-income households for a minimum
             period of 30 years. Tax credits are also available for rehabilitation, thereby enhancing the
             City’s preservation program. Developers and investors begin the LIHTC process by
             applying for an allocation of tax credits from the California Tax Credit Allocation
             Committee (CTCAC). Tax credits are awarded on a competitive basis at varying times.
             Compliance is monitored according to the rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue
             Service (IRS).
       5.    The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) and Community Investment Program (CIP)
             are facilitated by the Federal Home Loan System for the purpose of expanding the
             affordable housing supply. Local service is provided by the San Francisco Federal Home
             Loan Bank District. Subsidies are awarded on a competitive basis, usually in the form of
             low-interest loans, which must be used to finance the purchase, construction, and/or
             rehabilitation of rental housing.
       6.    The Predevelopment Loan Program (PDLP), conducted through the State Department of
             Housing and Community Development (HCD), provides the funds to pay the initial costs of
             preserving affordable housing developments for the existing tenants. Priority is given to
             projects that acquire and preserve existing government-assisted rental housing at-risk of
             conversion to market rate.
       7.    The Multi-family Housing Program (MHP) is conducted through HCD and provides
             deferred payment loans for new construction, acquisition and rehabilitation, preservation or
             conversion of non-residential structures for affordable rental housing. Assistance is in the
             form of low interest permanent loans. Local government agencies, private non-profit and
             for-profit organizations are eligible applicants.
       8.    The CalHome Program provides grants and loans to public agencies and non-profit
             organizations for homeownership assistance to very-low- and low-income households.

D.      Housing Supply Constraints: Governmental and Non-Governmental
The purpose of this section is to analyze potential and actual governmental and non-governmental
constraints on the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in the City of Laguna Beach.
The following summarizes the City’s efforts to remove constraints, as well as efforts to promote energy
conservation.
Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulation of housing development protects the public welfare and is intended to maintain
a particular standard or quality of development within the community. Governmental regulations may
also result in constraints on the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. Those impacts
are examined below:
       1.    Land Use Controls – The General Plan establishes patterns of land use in Laguna Beach.
             The General Plan not only specifies the location and amount of land that will be allocated to
             residential development, it also establishes the intensity of development in terms of unit
             densities and total number of units. Although most elements of the General Plan contain
             goals and policies that influence residential development, the Land Use Element has the
             most direct influence on the overall development of housing in the City.
             In addition to the R-1 Residential Low Density, R-2 Residential Medium Density, and R-3
             Residential High Density Zoning Districts, Laguna Beach has several residential specific
             plan areas and comparable residential zoning districts. Like the R-1 Zone, those areas and
             districts are intended to provide single-family residential development.
             The types and quantity of housing units permitted in the City’s various zones are dependent
             upon zoning standards and land use density designations (Table IV-5). Density limitations
             and development standards impact the cost of housing since land and construction costs are
             lower for high-density housing. Low and moderate-income housing, in particular, are
             constrained by density limitations. While building site coverage guidelines are applied to
             single-family residential zones, open space standards are applied whenever two or more
             residences are constructed, excepting units constructed under the Second Residential Unit
             Ordinance. Although open space is necessary for recreation and to maintain public health
             and safety, such reduction in building area further constrains the provision of affordable
             housing. No development within the City is subject to growth controls, and the minimum
             residential unit size is approximately 300 square-feet or the minimum size of an efficiency
             unit.

                In response to potential development constraints Policy HE-2.7 has been adopted to
                “Encourage the production of privately-sponsored low- and moderate-income housing in
                residential and mixed-use developments.” Housing Program 24 requires the City to
                “Continue to provide incentives such as reduced fees, density bonuses, developer assistance
                with federal and other funding applications, and In-lieu Housing Fund contributions for the
                development of housing that offers long-term affordability to extremely-low-, very-low-,
                low- or moderate-income households and persons.” These incentives are outlined in a
                Housing Assistance Information Guide available on the City’s website and at the Planning
                Counter.
                Table IV-7 specifies the zoning standards applicable to the various residential zones in
                Laguna Beach. An exception to the development standards includes potential relief from
                such standards for the provision of low-income housing utilizing density bonus criteria
                and/or incentives for the long-term provision of affordable housing.

                  The City’s commercial zoning districts also promote housing opportunities. For example,
                  residential use within mixed-use developments is promoted in several commercial zoning
                  districts, while artists’ work/live units are promoted in residential, commercial and light-
                  industrial zoning districts.
                  Mobilehomes and manufactured housing provide opportunities for lower-cost housing and
                  are accommodated in the City’s regulations. Mobile homes are permitted within the Mobile
                  Home Zone, while manufactured housing that meets the Uniform Building Code standards
                  are permitted in any residential zone, subject to the Design Review process. Manufactured
                  homes are required to comply with zoning standards such as setbacks, structure height and
                                                                    IV-14

City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
             site coverage; however, California Government Code §65852.3 allows only limited design
             review such as roof overhang, roofing material and siding material.
       2.    Codes and Enforcement – Building codes establish minimum standards for construction
             that are essential for ensuring protection of the public health, safety and welfare. All
             building construction, alterations, demolitions or repairs to property in Laguna Beach are
             subject to the provisions of the California Building Code (CBC) and Title 14 of the Laguna
             Beach Municipal Code. These requirements result in incremental increases in the cost of
             housing construction, yet are necessary to ensure that buildings in Laguna Beach are
             structurally sound and safe to occupy. No amendments to the Building Code have been
             made that would reduce housing development in the City, and the City does not link code
             enforcement activities to housing rehabilitation programs.
             In order to promote the long-term preservation of Laguna Beach’s historic buildings, State
             and City building codes allow some alterations that do not comply with all requirements,
             provided that health and safety can be maintained.
       3.    On-Site and Off-Site Improvements – Subdividers are required to install streets, curbs,
             gutters, sidewalks, waterlines, and sewer lines. Because the City is essentially built-out and
             the majority of new housing development is in-fill, much of the necessary infrastructure,
             such as water and sewer service, is available with minimal improvements and connection
             requirements. The costs of these improvements vary with the cost and location of the
             development, such as on flat land or hillside areas. The Municipal Code establishes the
             City’s street design standards. Local residential streets require a 50-foot right-of-way, with a
             minimum pavement width of 20 feet for two travel lanes, excluding parking. Local street
             turnarounds require 62 feet in diameter with 54 feet diameter minimum paving. Hillside
             local streets require a 40-foot right-of-way, and also have a minimum pavement width of 20
             feet, excluding parking. Hillside local street turnarounds are required to be 54 feet in
             diameter with 50 feet diameter minimum paving. Five-foot wide sidewalks are required only
             in some neighborhoods of the City, based on the specific needs of the area to be served.
       4.    Local Entitlement and Processing Fees – The Department of Community Development is
             responsible for processing applications for development within the City. Planning and
             zoning applications typically include, land divisions, lot line adjustments, road extensions,
             conditional use permits, variances, design review and zoning, General Plan, and Local
             Coastal Plan amendments. Many of these projects require a significant amount of staff time
             for review and analysis, as well as for public hearings. Building plans are reviewed for
             compliance with building, electrical, and plumbing codes. Related fees are collected by the
             City in order to cover the costs of application processing and inspections.
             Two aspects of local government have been cited as placing undue burdens on the ability of
             the private sector to build affordable housing. Those aspects include: 1) fees or other
             exactions required to obtain project approval; and 2) time delays caused by the review and
             approval process. Critics contend that lengthy review periods increase financial and carrying
             costs and that fees and exactions increase expenses.
             Project processing time varies from one project to another and is directly related to the size
             and complexity of the proposal, as well as the number of applications related to a particular
             project. Another common delay in processing time results from increased building activity
             and a limited number of staff to expedite the numerous applications.

City of Laguna Beach                                                            IV. Resources and Constraints
             Ministerial project approvals require the review of plans for compliance with the City’s
             zoning standards. An example of such projects is a minor addition to a single- or multi-
             family residence in any residential zone. Most minor additions that comply with the zoning
             standards do not require discretionary review by the City’s Design Review Board, which
             may reduce the processing time by approximately a month.
             Design Review is required for all new residences (with the exception of second residential
             units), residential building additions of 50% or more, and height increases more than 15 feet
             above grade in all residential zones. The intent of the Design Review process is to: 1) ensure
             that development complies with applicable development standards and design guidelines and
             criteria; 2) to focus on quality designs within neighborhoods; and 3) to minimize potential
             view impacts to neighboring properties. All new structures and building remodels in
             commercial zones require approval of the Design Review Board.
             The Design Review process has been in place since the early 1980s and is supported by the
             community for preserving community and neighborhood character and minimizing view
             impacts. The Design Review Ordinance and Residential Design Guidelines are available on
             the City’s website, at the public counter, and are discussed with all applicants and architects
             prior to project submittal and during the zoning plan check process. The Residential Design
             Guidelines clarify design criteria for property owners, design professionals and the decision-
             making bodies. Property owners and their design professionals are informed of the
             requirements and potential issues associated with their proposed development prior to the
             Design Review hearing, thereby reducing the project review time and cost in obtaining
             project approval. The Design Guidelines provides direction regarding the design of new
             residences and remodels to compliment the scale and design of development in the various
             neighborhoods, and to consider neighboring views across the subject properties. The design
             review criteria evaluated by the Design Review Board includes building design articulation,
             massing and materials, historic preservation, landscaping, lighting and glare, neighborhood
             compatibility, privacy, and view equity. The Design Guidelines and Design Review process
             has been refined over time to reduce development constraints and establish objective criteria.
             Additionally, proposals for long-term low- to moderate-income and other special needs
             housing is subject to the incentives outlined in Program 24 and will be given priority
             handling through the entitlement process.
             In addition to the Design Review process, other projects subject to discretionary review by
             the Planning Commission include Conditional Use Permits, Variances, Coastal Development
             Permits, and Temporary Use Permits. Discretionary review projects that are reviewed by
             both the Planning Commission and City Council include Tract and Parcel Maps, Planned
             Residential Developments, Road Extensions, Zone Changes and General Plan Amendments.
             New development within the Mobilehome Zone requires a Conditional Use Permit to
             establish a new mobilehome park or to increase the density of an existing park. The
             development of multi-family housing in appropriate zones and new mobilehomes in existing
             parks are not subject to a Conditional Use Permit, which reduces the overall processing time.
             Additionally, new mobilehomes that do not increase the density do not require Design
             Review.
             Parking standards also have an impact on housing supply and affordability. Zoning
             Ordinance Section 25.52.006(G) allows the City Council to reduce the parking standards for

City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
             very-low- or low-income housing and/or housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s
             residential parking standards require the following:
                   •      Single-family or two-family residence: 2 covered parking spaces, plus an extra
                          space for 3,600 square feet or more; Arch Beach Heights & Three Arch Bay
                          Zones require 4 parking spaces – 2 covered and 2 in the driveway.
                   •      Multi-family residential: 1.5 spaces for every studio or 1 bedroom; 2 spaces for 2
                          or more bedrooms and 1 additional guest space for every 4 units.
                   •      Mobilehomes: 2 covered parking spaces (only one must be covered).
                   •      Second Units: 2 parking spaces (one covered)
             The residential zones of Arch Beach Heights and Three Arch Bay require four parking
             spaces with two spaces in a garage and two spaces in the driveway, due to minimal on-street
             parking in those neighborhoods. To accommodate two vehicles a driveway must be at least
             17’4” wide by 18’ deep. Most of the building sites in Arch Beach Heights are 25 feet wide,
             which allows only for on-site parking and precludes on-street parking in front of the
             residence. In the Three Arch Bay Zone two parking spaces are required in each driveway
             because a portion of each residential driveway is located within the private right-of-way,
             thereby reducing the availability of on-street parking. There is no impact of the Arch Beach
             Heights and Three Arch Bay parking requirements on the cost and supply of housing, as the
             additional two parking spaces are provided within a driveway located in the required front
             yard.
             The parking requirement for multi-family development is 1.5 spaces for each studio or one
             bedroom unit and 2 spaces for each unit with two or more bedrooms. Housing Program 31 is
             included in Chapter VII to evaluate the typical number of occupants in these smaller units to
             determine if this parking standard should be lowered to encourage the development of multi-
             family residences. Although the City’s parking standards could impede affordable housing
             development, the Parking Ordinance allows the City Council to grant a Conditional Use
             Permit to reduce the quantity of parking required for extremely-low-, very-low- or low-
             income housing, or housing for persons with disabilities. This incentive was adopted to
             encourage the production of special needs housing.
             Fees, land dedications, and/or improvements are required for new subdivisions, as
             authorized by the Subdivision Map Act and Title 21 of the Laguna Beach Municipal Code.
             Such fees and improvements assist in the provision of adequate public parkland and
             necessary public services and infrastructure such as streets, sewers, and storm drains. As an
             alternative to providing necessary improvements or dedications, a subdivider may pay in-
             lieu fees for public parkland, drainage improvements and affordable housing, based on the
             size of the proposed development. The formulas for these fees are outlined within Title 21 of
             the Municipal Code. While such costs are paid by the developer, they are typically passed on
             to the ultimate consumer in the form of higher housing prices and rents. However, studies of
             inclusionary housing programs have shown that developers required to provide affordable
             housing incorporate the cost of such housing provision into the project and negotiate a lower
             land price.
             •     In-lieu Park Fee – The Subdivision Map Act and Title 21 of the Municipal Code
                   authorize the City to require either the dedication of land, payment of a fee or a
                                                    IV-17

                                                                                              Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
                   combination of the two as a condition of approval for a tract or parcel map. The
                   quantity of land required for park dedication is determined by the density and based
                   upon the fair market value of quantity of land that would otherwise be required for
                   dedication. In-lieu park fees are approximately $12,058 per 6,000 square-foot lot with
                   one unit and adjust annually.
             •     Drainage Fee – The Subdivision Map Act and Municipal Code Title 21 also authorize
                   the City to collect drainage fees. The City is divided into three drainage areas.
                   Subdivisions within the north and west local drainage areas are not required to pay
                   drainage fees; however, they are required to construct drainage facilities necessary to
                   conduct storm waters within and from the subdivision. Subdividers of property within
                   the central local drainage area are required to pay drainage fees based on the intensity
                   of development and the fee averages approximately $12,637 per acre. The drainage fee
                   also adjusts annually.
             •     In-lieu Housing Fee – Section 65590(d) of the California Government Code requires
                   new housing developments within the Coastal Zone to provide, where feasible,
                   housing units for persons or families of low or moderate income. Where such housing
                   is not included as part of a proposed development project, the City requires payment of
                   an in-lieu fee. In conjunction with the 2008 - 2013 Housing Element update, an In-lieu
                   Housing Fee Analysis was prepared by Economic & Planning Systems, Inc. to
                   determine whether or not the fee should be amended to more accurately reflect the cost
                   of providing extremely-low- to moderate-income housing and replacement housing.
                   Completion of the analysis included a survey of non-profit and for-profit developers in
                   the Laguna Beach area. Based on the results of the analysis and public participation,
                   the City Council adopted a revised methodology, which includes both land and
                   construction costs. The City Council concluded that the financing gap methodology
                   provides the most accurate fee based on land and affordable housing development
                   costs. The revised inclusionary in-lieu housing fee represents the subsidy that would
                   be paid by a developer of affordable housing, and is less than the prior fee. Based on
                   the revised data, the in-lieu housing fee is applied only to the required affordable units
                   in the development, rather than all units in the development as previously applied. The
                   revised fee is approximately $154,884 for each required affordable rental unit or
                   $260,249 for each affordable for-sale lot or unit. The In-lieu housing fee adjusts
                   annually, and the calculation is explained in Chapter V, Section C of this Housing
                   Element.
                   The City has a separate in-lieu housing fee, which helps to preserve or replace existing
                   housing units that would be very costly and difficult to replace. The fee is applicable in
                   the following three situations:
                   1.     Whenever one or more residential units within an existing two-family or multi-
                          family development is removed or converted, and the property is located in a
                          zone that allows medium or high-density housing development, such units
                          removed or converted shall be replaced one-for-one in the City at the same time
                          such removal or conversion is taking place, or the property owner may pay a fee
                          based on the square footage of the unit(s) being removed or converted. Such fee
                          shall be equal to the most current building valuation fee as established by the

City of Laguna Beach                                                            IV. Resources and Constraints
       5.    Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities – According to the federal Fair
             Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is the responsibility of
             local governments to provide reasonable accommodation in their zoning and land use
             regulations whenever necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
             enjoy a dwelling. The City strives to accommodate persons with disabilities in their homes
             and may approve applications for adapting existing housing units. The Zoning Ordinance
             provides for a variety of residential options that would accommodate persons with
             disabilities. Residential uses approved for persons with disabilities in recent years include
             Hagan Place, a 24-unit housing development for disabled persons, and residential substance
             abuse recovery homes. Rest homes and nursing homes are also allowed and encouraged in
             the Institutional Zone and several residential, commercial zones. The City also incorporates
             the California Building Code handicapped access and use requirements into the Laguna
             Beach Building Code and a portion of all new affordable housing units are designed to be
             either handicapped accessible or handicapped adaptable. All 26 extremely-low- and very-
             low-income apartments at Alice Court are either handicapped accessible or handicapped
             adaptable.
             Applications for residential handicapped retrofit are processed at the building and zoning
             counter in the same manner as residential remodels are processed. Most retrofit applications
             to accommodate those with physical disabilities, such as widened doorways, grab bars and
             access ramps, are processed over-the-counter. More extensive remodels such as, but not
             necessarily limited to, those that increase the building envelope may require Design Review.
             However, handicapped access is carefully considered during the Design Review process, and
             if compliance with the zoning standards is not possible to achieve the proposed access
             improvements and there are no feasible alternatives, variances may be granted in support of
             reasonable accommodation. The Parking Chapter of the Zoning Ordinance currently allows
             the City Council to grant a conditional use permit to reduce parking standards for disabled
             housing.
             In compliance with the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, group homes or
             residential care facilities serving six or fewer disabled persons are considered a residential
             use and allowed in all residential zones of Laguna Beach. Residential care facilities or rest
             homes serving seven or more individuals require a Conditional Use Permit.
             To address the issue of reasonable accommodation requests for the disabled, in 2010 the
             City adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance to streamline requests for deviation
             from development standards that may impede access to individuals with disabilities. The
             City has no maximum concentration requirements for residential care facilities, nor any site
             planning requirements that may constrain housing for persons with disabilities.
             The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines “family” as “one or more persons living together as a
             single housekeeping unit within a dwelling unit.” This definition accommodates different
             household types, including unrelated persons living together, and does not impede the
             development and rehabilitation of housing for persons with disabilities.
       6.    Priority Water and Sewer Service Procedures for New Housing for Lower Income
             Households – Senate Bill 1087 requires all local governments to distribute their updated
             Housing Element to area water and sewer providers to ensure that such providers grant
             priority to proposed housing developments for lower-income housing in their current and
             future resource or service allocations. The City of Laguna Beach Public Works Department

                Table IV-9 serves as an easy reference for property owners and developers who are
                considering various types of residential development, conversion, or demolition in Laguna
                Beach.

        7.      State and Federal Policies – Actions and policies of governmental agencies can impact the
                ability of the private sector to provide adequate housing to meet consumer demands. Federal
                budgeting and funding policies can either stimulate or depress various aspects of the housing
                industry. Local or state government compliance or the enactment of sanctions (e.g., sewer
                connection or growth moratoriums) for noncompliance with the Federal Clean Air and
                Water Pollution Control Acts can impact all types of development.
                State agencies and local government compliance with State statutes can complicate the
                development of housing. The Coastal Act and actions of the Coastal Commission have
                combined to lengthen the permit approval process for housing in areas under its jurisdiction.
                Other statutes such as the California Environmental Quality Act and sections of the
                California Government Code relating to rezoning and General Plan amendment procedures
                                                                  IV-21

City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
             can also act to prolong the review and approval of development proposals by local
             governments. In many instances, compliance with these mandates establishes time
             constraints that cannot be altered by local governments.
             Local governments exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers which directly
             impact residential development within their respective jurisdictional boundaries. These
             powers establish the location, intensity, and type of units that may or may not be developed.
             The City’s General Plan, zoning regulations, project review and approval procedures,
             development and processing fees, utility infrastructure, public service capabilities, and
             development attitudes all play important roles in determining the cost and availability of
             housing opportunities in Laguna Beach.
In response to all potential governmental constraints on the development of affordable housing, Policy
HE-2.7 has been adopted to “Encourage the production of privately-sponsored low- and moderate-
income housing in residential and mixed-use developments.” Housing Program 24 requires the City to
“Continue to provide incentives such as reduced fees, density bonuses, developer assistance with federal
and other funding applications, and In-lieu Housing Fund contributions for the development of housing
that offers long-term affordability to extremely-low-, very-low-, low- or moderate-income households
and persons.” These incentives are outlined in a Housing Assistance Information Guide available on the
City’s website and at the Planning Counter.
Non-Governmental Constraints
The private market influences the selling and rental prices of all types of housing. This includes new and
existing residential units. While actions of the public sector influence housing cost, the private sector
affects residential markets through such mechanisms as supply costs (e.g., land, construction, financing)
and value of consumer preference.
       1.    Availability of Financing – Another constraint affecting housing costs is the cyclical nature
             of the housing industry. Housing production can vary widely from year to year with periods
             of above-average production followed by periods of below-average production. Fluctuations
             are common in most industries but appear to be more dramatic in the homebuilding sector
             because of susceptibility of the industry to changes in federal fiscal and monetary policies.
             A significant contributor to overall housing cost is financing. After decades of slight
             fluctuations in the prime rate, the 1980s saw a rise in interest rates that peaked at
             approximately 18.8% in 1982. As the decade closed and the economy weakened, the
             prevailing interest rate was approximately 10%. In the 1990s, interest rates dropped
             dramatically, fluctuating between 6 and 8%. Between 2007 and 2013, the rates on a 30-year
             fixed rate mortgage have varied between approximately 3.5% % and 6%. Low interest rates
             and the widespread use of adjustable rate mortgages contributed to the rapid upward spiral in
             home prices until the crash of 2008 and the “Great Recession” that followed.
             While home mortgages for borrowers with good credit are now available at historically low
             rates, underwriting standards have become extremely strict and borrowers with lower credit
             scores find that mortgages are very difficult to obtain.
       2.    Cost of Land – The cost of residential land has a direct impact on the cost of a new home
             and is, therefore, a potential non-governmental constraint. The higher the cost of land, the
             higher the price of a new home. Based on developed residential land sales in 2012, the
             average cost of residentially-zoned developed land was $2,672,000 per acre in Laguna

                                                                                            Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                            IV. Resources and Constraints
             Beach. This represented a $1,728,000 reduction over the 2007 average land value due to the
             drop in sales prices during the recession.
             Developable land is continuing to become scarcer in Laguna Beach, with the City rapidly
             approaching build-out. Even with regular market dips, the overall value of vacant residential
             land will continue to remain high in Laguna Beach. In order to counteract limited land
             availability, the City promotes innovative housing concepts such as mixed-use development,
             second units, artists’ live/work quarters, mobile homes, and the rehabilitation of existing
             historic homes.
       3.    Cost of Construction – The costs of labor and materials have a direct impact on the cost of
             housing. Residential construction costs vary greatly depending upon the quality and size of
             the residence and the materials being used. Rising construction costs also limit the ability of
             property owners to provide needed rehabilitation of substandard residential units.
             According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Price Index of New Single‐Family Houses Under
             Construction, construction costs declined during 2007-2010 but have been rising again as
             the economy continues to improve. The 2012 construction cost index stood at 98.4 compared
             to the 2005 benchmark index of 100.
             Product design and consumer expectations also influence the types and styles of units being
             constructed in this area. Today’s new homes are quite different than those produced in the
             1960s. Numerous interior and exterior design features make it difficult to make direct
             comparisons in costs over the years. In a highly competitive and sophisticated market such
             as Southern California, many consumers consider the “extra touches” as necessities when
             buying a new home. Due to the use of upgraded building materials and design features in
             most Laguna Beach homes, the City has modified the ICC average, thereby establishing
             construction value as $205.82 per square foot for habitable area and $77.30 per square foot
             for decks and garages.
Constraint Removal Efforts
The City’s primary constraint removal effort is to process development applications in a timely manner.
As noted above, time delays result in a significant increase in development costs. The processing fees
charged by Laguna Beach are necessary to cover staff review time. Therefore, there is little opportunity
for the reduction of processing fees in order to reduce housing costs. Development of low-income
housing, however, may qualify for fee reductions and/or waivers, as determined appropriate by the City
Council.
E.      Opportunities for Energy Conservation
There are two basic and interrelated approaches to creating energy conservation opportunities. Those
two approaches are conservation and development.
       1.    Conservation – Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-
             consuming items, or by physically modifying existing structures and land uses. In 1978, the
             California Energy Commission first adopted energy conservation standards for new
             construction. The standards, which are contained in Title 24 of the California Administrative
             Code, contain specifications relating to insulation, glazing, heating and cooling systems,
             water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several other items, and are updated periodically.

                                                                                              Housing Element
City of Laguna Beach                                                              IV. Resources and Constraints
             Specific design provisions differ throughout the State, depending upon local temperature
             conditions. Because of Laguna Beach’s mild coastal climate, some of the insulation and
             heating standards are significantly less stringent.
             Conventional building construction and the manufacturing of building materials have
             numerous impacts on the environment, including electricity consumption, greenhouse gas
             emissions, raw materials use, landfill waste and water consumption. All levels of
             government are attempting to address these construction-related environmental impacts. In
             2004, the State adopted legislation requiring LEED (Leadership in Energy and
             Environmental Design) certification for new and renovated public buildings to incorporate
             “green” or sustainable building technology. A green building program addresses a broad
             range of issues including community and site design, energy efficiency, water conservation,
             resource-efficient material, indoor environmental quality, construction management, and
             building maintenance. A comprehensive green building program ensures that buildings
             minimize the use of resources, are healthier for people who inhabit them, and minimize
             impacts to the environment. LEED certification is one part of a coordinated green building
             program. Some cities have adopted LEED regulations for public buildings, as well as LEED
             certification for larger commercial and residential developments. The approved Laguna
             Beach Community and Senior Center has been designed to achieve a minimum LEED
             certification level of 26 points. The City is attempting to achieve 33 points during building
             construction, which is equivalent to the LEED Silver Certification level.
             The consumption of energy for transportation is also impacted by land use policies. The
             historic pattern of growth and development in Southern California, creating urban sprawl,
             has made necessary an intricate network of freeways and surface streets. As the region
             becomes more decentralized, residences and places of employment have become more
             scattered over large areas and mass public transit (e.g., trains, subways, buses) have become
             less feasible. Such a land use pattern renders the automobile a necessity.
             Although the regional pattern has already been established, opportunities still exist for
             energy sensitive land use and transportation decisions on a local level. The concentration of
             higher density housing and employment centers along major transportation corridors
             increases the convenience of public transit and may encourage reduced use of automobiles
             and a corresponding reduction in vehicular fuel consumption. Mixed-used developments
             provide the opportunity for people to live within walking distance of employment and/or
             shopping. Mixed-use development is most feasible and effective when applied to large
             parcels of land, which do not exist in the commercial zones of Laguna Beach.
       2.    Development – The incorporation of LEED certification and green building techniques
             extends to development as well as conservation, as discussed above. The selection of
             sustainable construction materials and products, such as recycled materials, zero or low off-
             gassing or harmful air emissions, zero or low toxicity, sustainable harvested materials,
             durability, longevity, and local production, all promote resource conservation and efficiency.
             The use of recycled-content products creates markets for recycled materials that are diverted
             from California’s landfills, as mandated by the Integrated Waste Management Act. Water
             efficiency can be obtained by use of ultra-low-flush toilets, low-flow shower heads and other
             water conserving fixtures, recirculating hot water systems, point-of-use hot water heating
             systems for more distant locations, micro-irrigation (which excludes sprinklers and high-
             pressure sprayers) to supply water to non-turf areas, and use of state-of-the-art irrigation
             controllers and self-closing nozzles on hoses.

             Solar energy is a viable energy source in Laguna Beach. There are two basic types of solar
             systems; active and passive. In passive solar systems, the structure itself is designed to
             collect the sun’s energy, then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a greenhouse.
             Passive buildings are typically designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar
             exposure, and are constructed with dense material such as concrete or adobe to better absorb
             heat. Properly placed windows, overhanging eaves, and landscaping can all be designed to
             keep a residence cool.
             Active solar systems collect and store energy in panels attached to the exterior of a
             residence. This type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool
             air, while heated water flows directly into the hot water system of the residence. Solar cells
             absorb the sun’s rays, which generate electricity and result in a lower electric bill.
             Technology has made the cells increasingly efficient and has reduced their cost to a level
             that may make them more popular with the average consumer. Although passive solar
             systems generally maximize use of the sun’s energy and are less costly to install, active
             systems have greater potential application to both cool and heat a residence as well as to
             provide hot water and electricity. In 2007 the City Council waived the permit fees related to
             solar energy installations for residences and businesses in Laguna Beach.
             Additional efforts to educate the community about energy conservation include the provision
             of information regarding energy efficient rehabilitation techniques and referrals to energy
             conservation programs, including hand-outs at the Building Counter.

V.      Housing Issues and Trends
The intent of this chapter is to identify State, regional and local housing issues and trends, which set
forth a foundation for the City’s housing program.
A.      State Issues and Policies
As discussed in Section I of this document, the State of California amended the Government Code in
1980, by enacting Article 10.6 pertaining to Housing Elements. This statute established the highest
priority of decent housing for every California family, and required cooperative participation of the
government and private sector in attaining the state’s housing needs.
State housing element law establishes detailed requirements for the content and procedure for
establishing regional housing needs and the preparation of local housing elements.
B.      Regional Housing Policies
The Southern California Associate of Governments (SCAG) is responsible for the development of
regional housing policies for the six-county Southern California region. The Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) directly affects local housing elements by providing an analysis of area-wide
needs as well as a “fair-share” distribution mechanism to assign responsibility for accommodating
housing needs for all economic segments of the community.
Under SB 375 of 2008, the RHNA must be consistent with the Regional Growth Forecast and the
Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The RHNA allocation for Laguna
Beach is consistent with these regional planning documents, and is discussed in Chapter III, Housing
Needs.
C.      Laguna Beach Housing Trends and Strategies
Trends
The following summarizes the housing trends in Laguna Beach:
        •    Over the previous Housing Element cycle, the housing program was effective in addressing
             the City’s mandated housing goals.
        •    Laguna Beach has provided additional affordable housing opportunities, even though the
             City’s population has grown slowly due to its near build-out status.
        •    Providing new affordable housing opportunities will continue to present a challenge as the
             City approaches build-out and land values continue to remain high. As sites available for
             residential development continue to become scarcer, several issues are presented, including
             high housing prices and intensification pressure.
Six trends impacting housing supply and affordability in Laguna Beach are:
       1.    High property values and rental rates that exceed the median household income.
       2.    Increased demand for larger housing, resulting in expensive remodels and/or rebuilding of
             older, lower-cost housing.

       3.    Market pressure to convert two and three unit properties into single-family residences,
             reducing the City’s overall housing stock and exacerbating escalating housing costs that
             reflect supply and demand pressures, necessitating continuance of the City’s policy to
             require replacement or the payment of in-lieu housing fees for rental housing conversion.
       4.    Market pressure to convert more affordable housing located in mixed-use developments to
             office or other commercial uses. This necessitates that the City continue its policy to require
             replacement or the payment of in-lieu housing fees for the conversion of housing in mixed-
             use developments.
       5.    Market pressure to convert rental housing units to condominiums or tenants-in-common
             ownership, necessitating that the City continue and expand its policy to require replacement
             rental housing to tenants-in-common ownership of five (5) or more units, as well as
             condominium conversions.
       6.    Many employees of Laguna Beach businesses, including but not limited to the City, Laguna
             Beach Unified School District, and South Coast Medical Center, are unable to live in
             Laguna Beach due to high housing prices and rental rates.
Strategies
Prior to the development of a program-specific housing strategy, it is necessary to establish the relative
priorities of the identified housing needs and to assess the nature and extent of the City’s existing
housing programs. The process of prioritizing housing needs requires the identification of target
households, as well as a preliminary analysis of the most appropriate housing programs and/or resources
to meet those needs.
Target Households
       The diminishing availability of vacant land, combined with high land values and construction
       costs, impede the expansion of the City’s housing stock. Therefore, preservation and enhancement
       of the existing density and affordable housing stock is vital to the community. Based on
       recommendations of the City’s Housing & Human Services Committee, and a 2005 study by Soka
       University indicating that the average weekly pay in Laguna Beach is the 11th lowest out of 12
       South County cities, the City Council has identified the households most in need of affordable
       housing opportunities as follows: 1) very-low-, low- and moderate-income persons employed in
       Laguna Beach; 2) emergency City employees and City employees that need to live in close
       proximity to City facilities; 3) senior citizens; and 4) other special needs persons and households,
       including disabled persons and persons with a mental health diagnosis who are not capable of
       independent or semi-independent living in their own units.
Existing Housing Programs/Resources
       A number of affordable housing opportunities have been provided and/or housing has been
       preserved due to the programs implemented by the City. Those programs include:
             1.    25% inclusionary housing requirement or payment of an in-lieu housing fee
                   (applicable to new subdivisions of two or more lots or units and three or more new
                   residential units on existing building sites);

             3.    Second Residential Unit Ordinance;
             4.    Density Bonus provisions;
             5.    CDBG and other federal funding;
             6.    Historic Preservation Ordinance;
             7.    Mixed-use development;
             8.    Artists’ Work/Live Ordinance;
             9.    Support for local shelters; and
             10.   Senior Services Coordinator to assist senior citizens with housing-related needs.
Program Guidelines for the Inclusionary Housing Requirement/In-Lieu Housing Fund
       Laguna Beach Housing Element policy HE-2.4 requires 25% of the residential units within new
       subdivisions of two or more lots or units, and new residential development of three or more units
       on existing building sites, to be affordable to households of low or moderate income. A developer
       of a residential project with ten or fewer lots or units may, as an alternative, pay a pre-determined
       fee for each affordable unit in the project into the City’s in-lieu housing fund, based on 30% of the
       units within the development. For example, the subdivision of two unimproved residential lots into
       six lots, which would allow the development of six residences, requires the provision of two
       extremely-low- to moderate-income units. The developer/subdivider may either construct the units
       or pay an in-lieu housing fee based on 30% of the number of units in the development (e.g., 1.8
       units). As discussed in Section IV.D, the in-lieu housing fee for 2013 is $154,884 for each
       “affordable” rental unit and $260,249 per “affordable” for-sale lot or unit based on the financing
       gap fee, which is the equivalent of the subsidy that would have been provided by a developer that
       constructs and manages affordable housing. For example, a six-unit subdivision that does not
       include two affordable housing units would be assessed $468,448, which represents the subsidy
       that would be paid for 1.8 units or 30% of the six-unit subdivision. The fee is based on the average
       weighted value of vacant residential land sales for the prior 12 month period (land sales price
       based on lot size).
       In order to apply an appropriate in-lieu housing fee, numerous factors involved in developing
       affordable units were analyzed and discussed with local realtors and architects. Under California
       law, there are two types of development costs that the City is able to directly subsidize for the
       development of affordable housing: land costs and improvement costs. The inclusionary In-lieu
       Housing fee during the 2000-2005 Housing Element cycle was based only on residentially-zoned
       unimproved land. Because of this, the fee did not reflect the cost of both on-site improvements and
       land values. Additionally, in recent years much of the remaining undeveloped land does not
       constitute building sites, as defined by the Municipal Code. In years where there are a number of
       sales of non-building sites the resulting in-lieu fee is disproportionately lower than values of
       developable residential land. For this reason it was determined that the inclusionary in-lieu
       housing fee should represent both land and construction costs.
       In October 2008, the City contracted with Economic & Planning Systems, Inc. to prepare an In-
       Lieu Housing Fee Analysis to determine whether or not the In-lieu housing fees accurately reflect
       the cost of providing affordable housing in Laguna Beach. Based on the evaluation of five
       different fee methodologies, including the land cost methodology that the City had been
       implementing, it was determined that the Financing Gap Fee was the most accurate as it includes
       both land and construction costs, as well as the “gap” or subsidy that would have been provided by
                                                     V-3

City of Laguna Beach                                                              V. Housing Issues and Trends
       a developer had the affordable housing units been constructed either on or off-site in Laguna
       Beach. The analysis assumes all affordable housing will be multi-family rather than single-family
       units, due to the cost variables in the different types of structures. Based on the In-lieu Housing
       Fee Analysis, the City Council revised the fee to the Financing Gap methodology, as explained
       below.
Financing Gap Inclusionary In-Lieu Housing Fee
       The In-lieu inclusionary housing fee is based on the subsidy required to construct multi-family
       units of the same tenure (rent vs. sale) as the market-rate units being developed. The subsidy is the
       net difference between total development costs (land acquisition, labor, materials, architecture,
       entitlement, marketing, etc.) and the prices that income-qualified households can afford to pay.
       The result is two fees, one for for-sale housing and the other for rental housing. The fee is based
       on the subsidy required for a single unit type (multi-family or single family housing).
       The Financing Gap Fee is also calculated based on the following assumptions:
              1.    It is assumed that fees from rental developments are used to subsidize rental units,
                    while fees from for-sale developments are used to subsidize for-sale units. Because of
                    different development costs and unit values for rental and for-sale units, this
                    assumption results in different in-lieu fees depending on the type of market-rate
                    project.
              2.    Multi-family parking is assumed to be at-grade with a requirement of 2.25 spaces,
                    which includes guest parking.
              3.    The average unit size in a multi-family project is assumed to be 1,100 square feet (net
                    size 950 square feet subtracting shared lobbies, hallways, etc.) with two bedrooms
                    suitable for three people, and a density of 30 units per acre (which includes a 35%
                    density bonus thereby increasing the maximum R-3 density of 22 units per acre to 30).
              4.    To calculate values of the affordable units, assumptions must be made regarding the
                    applicable income level (extremely-low, very-low, low and moderate) and the percent
                    of income spent on housing costs). Additionally, translating these assumptions into
                    unit prices and values requires estimates of operating expenses, capital reserves,
                    capitalization rates, and for-sale financing factors (such as mortgage interest rates,
                    repayment period, and down payments). The income levels assumptions are:
                    Extremely Low Income = 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI); Very Low Income
                    = 50% of AMI; Low Income = 65% of AMI; Moderate Income = 100% of AMI. The
                    assumed maximum allowable payment of gross household income is 30% for all
                    affordable income levels. The assumed housing costs for for-sale units includes
                    mortgage, $4,800 annual homeowner’s association fee, and property taxes at 1% of the
                    unit cost. Assumed mortgage terms are a 30-year fixed mortgage, 6.5% interest rate,
                    and 5% down-payment. Assumed housing costs for rental units is 30% of the gross
                    household income, excluding utilities.

City of Laguna Beach                                                                V. Housing Issues and Trends
Financing Gap Fee Calculation
       As described above, both affordable rental and for-sale unit models have been used to calculate the
       fee. Four main steps have been followed to calculate the in-lieu fee using these models.
               1.     Unit value analysis per rental and for-sale product types: Based on the development
                      program and revenue-based assumptions described above, the unit value analysis
                      calculated a total unit value per affordable income level based on the capitalized value
                      of the calculated net operating income for rental units, and the supportable sale price
                      (mortgage plus down payment) calculated for for-sale units.
               2.     Development cost analysis per rental and for-sale product types: Based on the
                      development program and cost assumptions described above, the development cost
                      analysis determined a total unit development cost per rental and for-sale product types.
               3.     Financing gap pro-forma analysis: The financing gap represents the per-unit subsidy
                      that a developer would contribute toward the development and operation of the
                      required affordable units. By comparing the estimates of unit value to the estimates of
                      development costs, the total financing gap per housing type and income level has been
                      calculated. A financing gap has been calculated for both the for-sale product type and
                      the rental product type as provided in Table V-1.
               4.     Calculation of in-lieu fees: The inclusionary housing requirement for affordable units
                      is 25% if the units are provided within the development or at another site within the
                      City. The affordable requirement is 30% of the number of units in the development if
                      the developer will be paying fees in-lieu of developing the required affordable
                      housing. The 30% requirement assumes that 5% of the units will be affordable to
                      extremely-low income households, 7% of the units will be affordable to very-low
                      income households, 8% of the units will be affordable to low income households, and
                      10% of the units will be affordable to moderate income households.
       Table V-1 provides the financing gap fee calculation for both for-sale and rental housing based on
       the weighted average financing gap for extremely-low, very-low, low, and moderate incomes.

         Inclusionary housing programs typically result in higher cost and a lower supply of housing. Due
         to the limited availability of developable land and high desirability of Laguna Beach, property
         values remain high and property owners have not been dissuaded by the inclusionary housing
         policy from developing the limited remaining land. To encourage the development of low- and
         moderate-income housing within new developments the City offers a number of incentives,
         including fee reductions, etc., as outlined in Housing Program 24.
Year 2000 Amendment to In-Lieu Housing Fund Requirements
         Prior to adoption of the 2000-2005 Housing Element, the City had experienced the loss of its
         housing stock from the conversion of two and three-unit residential units into fewer units, as well
         as the conversion of existing residential units in mixed-use developments into commercial uses.
         Although this loss had not created a significant impact on the City’s housing supply, the
         continuation of this trend would have created cumulative impacts.
         A prior Housing Element policy had prohibited condominium conversions unless an equal number
         of rental units were constructed to replace the rental units lost since 1985; however, Policy
                                                                       V-6

City of Laguna Beach                                                             V. Housing Issues and Trends
       HE 1.10 was amended to allow the payment of an In-lieu housing fee rather than requiring
       replacement housing. In addition to preserving rental housing, it is imperative that the City
       preserve housing stock that conforms to the density standards of the zone. This is of particular
       importance in zoning districts that allow higher density and mixed-use developments, as higher-
       density housing is more affordable than single-family housing. Additionally, there is less land
       zoned for medium and high density housing in Laguna Beach, than land zoned for low density or
       single-family residences.
       Due to cumulative impacts upon the City’s housing stock created by the removal of existing
       housing units, the 2000 Housing Element established policies that discourage the depletion of
       existing housing stock while attempting to provide for future replacement of the housing removed.
       Policies HE-1.8 and HE-1.9 require the payment of an in-lieu housing fee to subsidize the
       replacement of housing that is removed from zones that allow medium and high-density develop-
       ment, as well as housing that is removed from existing mixed-use developments in commercial
       zones. During the 2000-2005 Housing Element planning period, it is estimated that Policies HE-
       1.8 and HE-1.9 effectively protected approximately 25 housing units from conversion to fewer
       units or other uses, based on property owner and real estate sales person discussions with Planning
       Division staff.
       Another modification to the In-Lieu Housing Fund in the 2000-2005 Housing Element was the
       establishment of two separate fees. As discussed above, the inclusionary In-lieu housing fee
       methodology was changed to the Financing Gap methodology. The fee represents the significant
       increase in Laguna Beach land values over the past Housing Element planning period. Although
       the provision of affordable housing or such fees are considered a constraint to potential housing
       development, they are necessary for the City to meet its State affordable housing requirements set
       forth by the California Coastal Act and the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), which
       require the provision of affordable housing opportunities and will increase in the City’s affordable
       housing stock on very limited land remaining for residential development.
       The revised replacement housing fee is also based on the Financing Gap methodology used to
       calculate the inclusionary housing fees. This fee is based on the Financing Gap weighted average
       of extremely-low- to moderate-income units. In 2013 a replacement housing fee of $141 per
       square-foot of the unit to be removed or converted is applied to the following types of housing
       demolition and development.
             1.    Removal or conversion of any low- or moderate-income housing units, whenever it is
                   determined infeasible to replace such housing one-for-one in the City, during the same
                   time as the proposed removal or conversion.
             2.    Density Decrease - Removal or conversion of one or more residential units within an
                   existing two-family or multi-family development that is located in a medium- or high-
                   density zone, whenever the property owner elects not to replace the removed or
                   converted units at another location in the City during the same time as the
                   removal/conversion.
             3.    Removal or conversion or one or more residential units in a mixed-use development
                   that is located within a commercial zone, whenever the property owner elects not to
                   replace the removed or converted units at another location in the City during the same
                   time as the removal/conversion.

Anticipated In-lieu Housing Fund Revenues 2013-2021
       As of July 2013, the In-lieu Housing Fund was approximately $352,930, as the majority of In-lieu
       housing funds were used toward the development of 26 very-low income apartments at Alice
       Court. The In-lieu Housing fees are based primarily on approved subdivisions and are collected by
       the City at the time the subdivider files the Final Map. It is difficult to project how much the In-
       lieu Housing Fund will increase between 2013 and 2021, as the City is essentially built-out, there
       are very few subdivisions of three or more lots or units, and future development is subject to
       market fluctuations. Based on potential future subdivisions and fees paid in-lieu of replacing
       converted low income and/or rental housing, it is anticipated that the In-lieu Housing Fund will
       increase to approximately $466,000 by 2014.

VI. Review of Previous Housing Element
California law requires the City to review its Housing Element to evaluate the following:
       1)    The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the
             attainment of the State housing goal.
       2)    The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals
             and objectives.
       3)    The progress of the city, county or city and county in implementation of the Housing
             Element.
Appropriateness of Goals, Objectives and Policies
       In the process of administering the previous Housing Element and preparing the 2013-2021
       revision, the City determined that the adopted goals and policies of the Housing Element have
       contributed to the attainment of the State housing goals. As such, the City’s goals and policies did
       not require significant modification. Housing programs and policies that have not been effective
       have been modified or replaced with new programs.
Effectiveness of the Housing Element
       Table VI-1 describes the City’s accomplishments for each of the program actions contained in the
       prior Housing Element, and Table VI-2 shows the progress toward the quantified objectives
       established in the prior element.

VII. Housing Program
The intent of this Housing Action Plan is to develop policies and programs to assist the City in
achieving its goals of preserving, improving, and developing housing in Laguna Beach. The housing
program includes many components, such as the establishment of goals, objectives and programs, which
in combination provide a foundation upon which housing activities can be developed and implemented.
State Housing Element law requires that objectives be quantified.
A.      Goals and Policies
The housing goals and policies of the Laguna Beach General Plan are as follows:
Goal HE-1: Preserve and Enhance Existing Housing and Neighborhoods
       Intent - Initiate all reasonable efforts to preserve the availability of existing housing opportunities
       and to conserve, as well as enhance, the quality, historic significance, and energy efficiency of
       existing residences and neighborhoods.
Goal HE-2: Provide and Maintain Housing Diversity and Affordability
       Intent - Initiate all reasonable efforts to provide housing opportunities that are sufficiently
       diversified in cost, size, type, and tenure to meet the affordability needs of the City’s present and
       future households.
Goal HE-3: Enhance Housing Opportunity and Accessibility
       Intent - Initiate all reasonable efforts to provide adequate housing opportunities and accessibility
       for individuals and households regardless of race, color, religion, income, sex, marital status,
       sexual orientation, family size, national origin, ancestry, age, or disability.
Table VII-1 contains the City’s policy statements that provide more specific direction in furtherance of
these goals.

                         residences comply with the density standards of that zone. As an alternative, the same property owner may construct unit(s) comparable in square footage and number
                         of bedrooms at another location in the City, during the same time such removal/demolition is taking place. Artists’ live/work units shall not be considered to be

                         place; or if replacement is determined infeasible, require the payment of an in-lieu housing fee for each residence that is being removed or converted. (Programs 7, 10,
                         18, 19, 23)
          Policy HE-2.2  Pursue financial assistance opportunities and establish incentives for housing rehabilitation and historic preservation, with a particular emphasis on assisting low-income

C.      Quantified Objectives Summary
Based on the preceding objectives, approximately 31 residential units are anticipated for construction,
rehabilitation, and preservation between 2013 and 2021. The provision of one very-low income unit, one
low-income unit, and 19 above-moderate income units would meet SCAG’s RHNA allocation for
Laguna Beach. The additional rehabilitation and preservation of 10 above-moderate income units
reflects the rehabilitation of nine existing residences for better energy conservation and the preservation
of one historic residence.

City of Laguna Beach                                          VIII. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
VIII. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
State law requires that the General Plan and its elements “. . . comprise an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies . . .” Internal consistency of the General Plan serves to
avoid potential policy conflicts and to provide clear policy direction for the future development,
maintenance and improvement of housing in the City. There are currently eight mandated elements of
the General Plan: Land Use, Housing, Safety, Circulation, Growth Management, Noise, and Open Space
and Conservation. The Laguna Beach Circulation and Growth Management Elements have been
combined, as well as the Open Space and Conservation Elements. Government Code §65302 requires
local jurisdictions to include analyses and policies regarding flood hazard and flood management
information in the Safety and Conservation Elements of their General Plan after January 1, 2009.
Because areas of Laguna Beach are located in the 100-year floodplain and floodway, both the Safety
and Open Space/Conservation Elements of the City’s General Plan, as well as the City’s Municipal
Code, address flood hazards and flood management procedures. Additionally, any residentially-zoned
sites identified in the Housing Element as suitable for housing development must comply with the flood
management requirements of the City and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Therefore, the City is in compliance with Government Code §65302. The Laguna Beach Housing
Element has been reviewed and determined to be consistent with all the City’s General Plan elements,
and is particularly related to the Land Use Element. The City also ensures that internal consistency
among all General Plan Elements will be maintained over the course of the 2013-2021 planning period.
Land Use Element: The Land Use Element establishes the quantity, location, and maximum density of
land designated for residential development. The land use densities specified within the Land Use
Element are consistent with the goals and policies of the Housing Element. Land Use designations were
developed in recognition of the City’s established pattern of land use, with residential use as the City’s
predominant land use. Land use policies have been developed using information regarding areas subject
to flooding (both canyon-related and ocean-related), liquefaction, landslides, seismic zones and faults,
significant wildlife corridors, habitats and resources, and other significant environmental constraints
identified in the Safety and Open Space/Conservation Elements.
Safety Element: The Safety Element is a primary tool for identifying natural hazards that must be
considered in planning the location, type and density of development in the City. In some cases, the
policies of the Safety Element can serve to restrict the availability of land for housing development or
add to the cost of housing by requiring special construction measures. The planning standards
established in the Safety Element, however, are essential for providing safe housing and should not be
compromised under any circumstances. The policies and programs of the Housing Element must fully
recognize the standards of the Safety Element. Observance of the Safety Element policies will promote
the construction of safe housing. Since the majority of new housing development within the City will be
redevelopment and in-fill, the policies of the Safety Element will not have a significant impact on the
Housing Element policies.
Transportation, Circulation and Growth Management Element: This Element provides basic
parameters for traffic generation and flow, and establishes performance standards and growth
management policies based on the regional context of the City. In order to balance new housing
opportunities with remaining capacities, the Transportation, Circulation and Growth Management
Element establishes policies on street capacities and acceptable service levels. Such policies are not
anticipated to have a restrictive effect upon new affordable housing development, since the majority of
housing development opportunities are redevelopment, with fewer in-fill opportunities.

City of Laguna Beach                                           VIII. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Noise Element: The City’s goal for noise control is to promote, conserve, and restore natural quiet and
tranquility for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, and for the health and enjoyment
of present and future residents. Noise impacts on residential and other noise sensitive areas are
addressed in the Noise Element and traffic is cited as one of the leading contributors to noise. The Noise
Element specifies that residential projects located within a contour of 60 CNEL or higher should be
reviewed for compliance with interior noise level standards. Mitigation measures incorporated to
decrease noise levels may be necessary to reduce interior noise. This could incrementally add to the cost
of housing construction, primarily within mixed-use projects along Coast Highway. However, these
costs are unavoidable and are not likely to have a significant impact on overall housing prices.
Open Space/Conservation Element: The Open Space/Conservation Element sets forth goals and
policies to protect and preserve the City’s sensitive hillside and coastal open space areas. The Open
Space/Conservation Element includes specific recommendations for the use of the City's significant
open space areas, including beaches, parkland and other recreational resources, and identifies significant
resources to be protected, restored, or enhanced. While open space preservation does affect the amount
of land available for housing production, local areas of high open space value are not generally suitable
as sites for affordable housing development. Therefore, the goals and objectives of the Housing Element
are consistent with the Open Space/Conservation Element.

Appendix A – Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the Housing Element update. Government Code
§65583(c)(8) states that “The local government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation
of all the economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the
program shall describe this effort.” Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a Land Use Plan that
determines the extent and density of future residential development in the community.
City residents and other interested parties were given numerous opportunities to identify housing issues
of concern, recommend strategies, review the draft element, and provide recommendations to decision-
makers on the 2013 Laguna Beach Housing Element update.
The notification list for all meeting notices is shown in Exhibit A-1. In addition, notices were posted on
the City’s website, and published in the local newspaper in advance of the meetings. Copies of the draft
Housing Element were made available for review at City Hall and were also posted on the City website.
Listed below are the meetings and public hearings held during the preparation of the 2013 Housing
Element. Exhibit A-2 summarizes the comments offered during these meetings along with a brief

  What is included in housing cost and affordability data?             Housing affordability includes the cost of rent or mortgage plus
                                                                       property taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and

  Could the City limit unit size to increase affordability?            In some circumstances, limits on unit size may be appropriate,

    I n order t o p r o v i d e an ongoing mechanism f o r i d e n t i f y i n g and evaluating
    community human needs and coordinating services and programs t o meet those
    needs, t h e f o l low1ng recommendations are made:
    1. E s t a b l i s h a Human Services Comnittee.               This committee should be t h e
            c a t a l y s t f o r focusing on t h e huma~needs i n t h e community and
            presenting appropriate requests and s o l u t i o n s t o t h e C i t y Council.
    2.      Establ i s h an- Appropriate S t 8 f Position,             This
            pos i t ion i s an essent i a l l i nKage between t h e commr ttee,. community ,
            and c i t y s t a f f resources.         I f t h e committee i s t o be e f f e c t i v e , i t
            needs a s t a f f p o s i t i o n t o do some o f t h e necessary legwork and
            research. With t h i s p o s i t i o n , various human service programs and
            a c t i v i t i e s now administered by c i t y departments and both p u b l i c and
            p r i v a t e agencies and o t h e r groups i n . t h e community c a n - b e - w e l l coordinated.
    3.      Develop Plans f o r a Comnuni t y Center. An adequate and permanent
            center would serve as a c o o r d i n a t i n g and communication center, n o t
            only f o r individual c i t i z e n s , but also f o r organizations w i t h i n the
            community.
    4.      Develop a Thorough Corrmuni t y Needs Assessment. A b i-annua l community
            survey i s needed t o provide comprehensive information. Accurate
            i d e n t i f i c a t i o n o f changing community needs i s necessary.
    SECTION 2.0:               THE BASIC GOALS: A PERSPECTIVE
    Both t h e National League o f C i t i e s and t h e League o f C a l i f o r n i a C i t i e s have
    c i t e d t h e need f o r l o c a l governmn+s t o play a more a c t i v e and c o o r d i n a t i v e

    as c i t i e s a r e t h e u n i t s o f goverqment c l o s e s t t o t h e i n d i v i d u a l . The
    National League o f C i t i e s has p l a c e d t h e problem i n c l e a r perspective:
              The most important resources i n t h e n a t i o n ' s c i t i e s a r e t h e
              c i t i e s ' people. F a i l u r e t o develop and conserve t h e c i t i e f
              people i s a f a i l u r e t o support the purposes o f urban conserva-
              t i o n . Therefore, t h e human resources development e f f o r t s o f
              a l l l e v e l s o f government must be d i r e c t e d toward t h e u l t i m a t e
              goals o f improving t h e q u a l i t y o f l i f e o f t h e c i t i e s f people
              by increasing t h e i r s o c i a l , economic, and physical health,
           s e c u r i t y , independence, personal m o b i l i t y , and o p p o r t u n i t y
           f o r choice.
          W i t h i n t h e urban environment, c i t i z e n s must have a v a i l a b l e t o
          them a p p r o p r i a t e and a c c e s s i b l e avenues f o r i n d i v i d u a l develop-
          ment, expression and Involvement. Each person should be a b l e
          t o apply h i s I n n a t e t a l e n t s t o t h e f u l l e s t p o s s i b l e e x t e n t and
          t o c o n t r i b u t e i n h i s own way t o t h e improvement o f h i m s e l f , h i s
          famihy and h i s community. Every I n d i v i d u a l should have an
          o p p o r t u n i t y t o a t t a i n a q u a l l t y education, t o achieve and
          m a i n t a i n good h e a l t h , and t o work and l i v e i n comfort, s a f e t y and
          decency. Wherever p o s s l b l e , t h e o p p o r t u n i t i e s t o f u l f i l l these
          goals should be developed by u s i n g t h e resources, systems, and
          f a c i l i t i e s already a v a i l a b l e I n t h e urban community.*
The above statement c o n t a i n s some very obvious b u t b a s i c human s e r v i c e
g o a l s w i t h which few people can disagree.                      However, t h e r e a r e areas
w i t h i n t h e community where evenr these g o a l s a r e n o t being met and which
need t o be exposed and d e a l t w l t h so t h a t each i n d l v i d u a l may f u l f i l l h i s
c r e a t i v e , p r o d u c t i v e and cooperative r o l e s toward t h e smooth-flowing
advancement o f s o c i e t y .
The C i t y o f Laguna Beach has already i d e n t i f i e d many o f i t s human needs
and has e s t a b l i s h e d p o l i c i e s t o meet t h o s e needs through t h e adoption o f
o t h e r elements o f t h e General Plan, such as housing, t r a n s p o r t a t i o n , open
space and conservation, noise, and s c e n i c highways.                              A l l general p l a n
elements have human and s o c i a l concerns a t t h e i r r o o t s :                      t h e y a r e responses
t o expressed s o c i a l needs.                 I n a very r e a l sense, t h e r e f o r e , t h i s element
should be used i n g u i d i n g f u t u r e amendments t o , and decisions upon, o t h e r

    o f d e t e c t 1on.
    There i s mounting evidence t h a t 3 u r so-called c r i m i n a l j u s t i c e system
     i s counter-productive.                    In spite   ~f     more s o p h i s t i c a t e d law-enforcement
    techniques, crime r a t e s have r a p ~ j l yincreased.                           Our penal i n s t i t u t i o n s
    have become outmoded and o v e r c r s r j e d , a t an i n c r e a s i n g c o s t t o t h e
    general p u b l i c .          Instead o f r e n a b ~ l i t a t i n gc r i m i n a l s t o become m r e
    c r e a t i v e and p r o d u c t i v e members a f society, t h e system seems t o have

     I s c l e a r t h a t a completely f r e s h look a t t h e system I s l n order.
 The burden f o r c o r r e c t i n g these s o c i e t a l i l l s has t o o o f t e n been placed

  r e h a b i l i t a t i v e , and s u p p o r t i v e r o l e s a t o u r l o c a l l e v e l .    While t h e complex
 problems need s o l u t i o n s through s t a t e and n a t i o n a l l e g i s l a t i o n and o t h e r
 changes i n p o l i c y , much can be done a t t h e l o c a l l e v e l through an increased
 awareness o f t h e prob l ems and opportun i t i e s f o r new r o l e s i n t h e
 We have noted several problems unique t o o u r community,                                       l a r g e l y emanating
 from t h e g r e a t i n f l u x o f v i s i t o r s every summer season.                        I t i s estimated
 t h a t t h e p o p u l a t i o n can quadruple from t h e q u i e t e r w l n t e r months t o warm
s u r n r weekends             .
                                                         The summer i n f 1 ux b r i ngs w i t h it accentuated

  be noted t h a t t h e more congestion we can keep o u t of .town,
  e s p e c i a l l y i n t h e c r i t l c a l summer months, t h e more p o l i c e e f f o r t can be

 Based upon t h e more general and h l g h e r p r i o r i t y problems i n t h e areas of
criminal justice,                r e h a b i l i t a t i o n and p r o t e c t i v e serviees, t h e r e appear t o
be f o u r broad, o v e r r i d i n g g u i d e l i n e s which should guide o u r approach t o '
personnel recruitment, program f o r m u l a t i o n s , and. management techniques:
1.    I n e s t a b l i s h i n g p r i o r i t i e s f o r action, we should be concerned p r i m a r i l y
      w i t h p r o t e c t i n g people as we1 I as-property.                                                   I
2.    The guiding motivation behind a l l p r i o r i t y enforcement a c t i v i t i e s
      should be both p u b l i c and personal s a f e t y r a t h e r than punishment.
3.    Utmost d i s c r e t i o n i n t h e a p p l i c a t i o n and enforcement o f laws i s
      needed, w i t h i m p a r t i a l it y toward a1 1 cl'tizens--young and old, l o c a l s
      and v i s i t o r s - - i n order t o avoid c r e a t i n g a d d i t i o n a l antagonism
      toward the law enforcement processes.
4.    I n order t o avoid unnecessary overburdening o f the already over-
      stressed c r i m i n a l j u s t i c e and penal systems, a d d i t i o n a l diversionary
      programs need t o be developed and e x i s t i n g programs need t o be
      understood, u t i 1ized , and more f u l l y supported.
With t h e above f o u r g u i d i n g needs i n mind, t h e f o l l o w i n g more-detailed
needs have been derived, based upon what appear t o be d e f i c i e n c i e s ' i n
o u r e x i s t i n g approach and a p p l i c a t i o n o f t h e law.                   They a r e d i v i d e d i n t o
two c a t e g o r i e s , programs and personnel, both o f which a r e o b v i o u s l y
coordinated through adept management.
A.    PROGRAMS
      1.     There should be a h i g h p r i o r l t y focus on ctlme-prevention planning,
              i n c l u d i n g d i v e r s i o n a r y and rehabi l l t a t l v e programs.           This i s
             p a r t i c u l a r l y c r i t i c a l f o r o u t youth,          I n o r d e r t o prevent them from

      2.     Educational programs t o promote awareness o f t h e p o s i t i v e aspects
             o f crime p r e v e n t ion, d i vers ionary programs and rehab 1 l it a t i o n
    o p p o r t u n i t i e s need t o be developed, n o t o n l y f o r t h e p r o t e c t i v e
    services s t a f f ,           b u t a l s o f o r the general pub1 ic, who are most
    a f f e c t e d by crime.            The pol i c e department shal l engage i n
    preventat i ve measures such as commun i t y information programs
    i n order t o educate t h e pub1 i c about b u r g l a w prevention,

   area o f consumer fraud needs s i m i l a r a t t e n t i o n .
3. The treatment o f v i c t i m s o f crime needs a d d l t l o n a l a'ttention.
   Recent s t a t e and federal legislation has created new payment
   programs f o r some crime v i c t i m s whfch most people a r e not y e t
   aware o f .           We have t h e o b l l g a t i o n a t t h e local level t o inform
   victims, as well as suspected criminals, o f t h e i r r i g h t s and
   opportun it ies.
4. Inter-departmental c m u n l c a t i o n ,              coordi n a t i o n and f r a t e r n l t a t i o n should
   be I ncreased, w l t h t a s k forces o r sl m i l a r means estab I 1shed between t h e

   5.  ~ o i n use  t       of f a c i l i t i e s w i t h o t h e r departments and neighboring

       i n t h e beach areas and i n t r a f f i c enforcement have received wide
       acceptance i n t h e past and should be encouraged.

CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH 

  LAND USE ELEMENT 

                Adopted by the City Council
                          February 7,2012
                        Ordinance No.1 559
                        MISSION STATEMENT 

To ensure that the City of Laguna Beach will endure for future generations as a thriving,
sustainable community that respects and nurtures our scenic natural surroundings, village
character, and quality ofIife.
                        GUIDING PRINCIPLES 

The following guiding principles provide the basis for detailed policies included in the General
Plan elements.
     1. 	 Strengthen our sense of community. The General Plan envisions Laguna Beach as a
          place of abundant scenic natural beauty, small-town village charm, and cultural
          diversity. Laguna residents take great pride in their community, which has a tradition of
          promoting the arts, historic preservation, and participation in civic and community
          organizations. The community is made up of quiet, close-knit neighborhoods of
          beachside and hillside homes. The residential neighborhoods are complemented by
          amenities such as the beaches, trails, shops, and restaurants, and these amenities are
          easily accessible to residents and visitors. Ongoing public education, civic participation,
          and monitoring regional growth are keys to maintaining and enhancing the positive
          characteristics of the community.
    2. 	 Preserve and enhance the community's natural environment and distinctive setting
          in the region-a picturesque seaside community surrounded by hillside open space.
          The City'S built environment is shaped and influenced by its natural setting. Scenic
          views of the Pacific coastline, hillsides, and canyons are distinctive elements of this
          setting and greatly enhance the community's image and sense of place. Ensuring that
          the City's environmentally sensitive surroundings are maintained as open space is vital
          to maintaining its character. As stewards of the environment, community members
          understand the importance of preserving environmentally sensitive open spaces, marine
          resources, water quality, and air quality for future generations. The City is committed to
          sustainable development patterns by ensuring that all future development complies with
          General Plan policies and development standards and that land zoned for open space is
          maintained in its natural condition.
    3. 	 Enhance recreational opportunities for residents and visitors, while protecting
          environmentally sensitive natural resources. Laguna Beach is situated in one of the
          most scenic settings in the State. Picturesque views of the Pacific coastline, hillsides,
          and canyons attract many visitors to the community year-round. Laguna Beach also has
          numerous environmentally sensitive areas and habitat that must be protected and
          preserved. The General Plan responds to this challenge directly and proactively, through
          a comprehensive, integrated strategy to facilitate and manage the influx of visitors in
          ways that deliberately avoid adverse effects on local resources. The General Plan
                                                                                              2-7-12
      provides multiple policies designed to integrate resource protection with active planning
      to accommodate visitors.
4. 	 Minimize the impact of the automobile on the character of Laguna Beach and
      emphasize a more pedestrian-oriented environment, safer sidewalks/pathways,
      landscaped buffer zones, and alternative means of transportation. Transportation
      alternatives are a high priority for Laguna Beach, particularly during the summer festival
      season. During the summer months and on holidays and weekends Laguna Beach is
      frequently impacted by traffic. Through its General Plan policies, the City continually
      strives to facilitate the movement of traffic in a safe and uncongested manner consistent
      with a pedestrian-oriented community. The proximity of some commercial and
      residential land uses in the City and mixed-use development are ideal for pedestrian and
     bicycle use. General Plan policies promote and encourage a pedestrian-oriented
     community by developing a system of bicycle rights-of-way and pedestrian paths,
      increasing alternative transit opportunities, and discouraging high-speed traffic along
     City streets.
5. 	 Enhance the downtown by preserving its village character and ensuring a variety
     of unique businesses and activities. The City strives to preserve the village
     atmosphere of the downtown, which is characterized by its pedestrian orientation, low­
     scale buildings, a variety of commercial, restaurant, office, residential and public
     facilities uses, Main Beach, historic landmarks, and diverse architectural styles. The
     Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) is the primary means of implementing the General Plan
     policies to preserve the downtown. The DSP preserves the unique qualities of the
     downtown by establishing design guidelines and criteria for maintaining a balanced mix
     of land uses and addressing potential safety hazards.
6. 	 Foster and promote a balance of retail opportunities for residents and visitors.
     Laguna Beach is a highly desirable beach community and prime tourist destination. In
     order to preserve and provide a balanced mix of uses for both residents and tourists, the
     City has established districts for the location of visitor commercial and resident-serving
     uses.
7. 	 Ensure development is responsive to individual site constraints. The General Plan
     recognizes that most development and/or redevelopment will inevitably involve infill
     projects or building on difficult sites, sites that are characterized by multiple constraints.
     General Plan policies set forth our philosophy that development, including remodels and
     the creation of new building sites, should begin with an awareness of constraints
     inherent in the particular site being developed. Planning, access, siting, and design
     choices should reflect a response to the particular characteristics and challenges
     associated with the site; examples include constraints related to the presence of
     significant natural resources and safety hazards as well as those related to the need for
     infill projects to be compatible in design, scale, and character with the surrounding
     neighborhood. Design guidelines, in conjunction with the applicable zoning standards,
     guide the Design Review Board toward approval of well-designed buildings,
     landscaping, and open spaces all of which reflect the quality and values of the
                                             11 	                                          2-7-12

      community, enhance the visual character of neighborhoods, and preserve views and
      privacy to the greatest extent feasible. The General Plan sets forth the philosophy
      avoidance of negative impacts is preferred to mitigation of those impacts.
8. 	 Ensure that infrastructure is strengthened and maintained. The City's public
      infrastructure supports the type, distribution, and intensity of land uses designated in the
     General Plan. Standards for capital facilities and public services such as streets, parks,
      storm drainage, water, sewers, and fire safety are established to ensure that growth does
     not exceed capacity. Although the community is essentially built-out, the General Plan
     reinforces the City's commitment to maintain and upgrade its aging infrastructure.
9. 	 Encourage cultural, ethnic, and social diversity. Culture and the arts have been the
     cornerstones of the community for many years. Laguna Beach is widely known as the
     home of the summer art festivals and numerous local artists. Local playhouses, an art
     museum, an art college and numerous galleries are indicative of the art influence in the
     community. To reinforce its commitment to the arts, the City has established the Arts
     Commission to review and recommend public art and to promote art-related uses
     throughout the community. The City has also adopted a Historic Resources Element and
     a related ordinance to encourage the long-term preservation of historically significant
     buildings. The General Plan policies promote social diversity by planning for a range of
     housing types from single-family dwellings to multiple units and mixed-use
     developments, artists' live/work units, and low-income disabled, senior citizen, and
     studio housing.
10. Ensure that safety and disaster preparedness are considered in all City decisions.
     Hazard and risk evaluation is important in determining the appropriateness of land use
     changes, especially in the steep hillsides, rugged canyons, flood plains, and varied
     terrains of Laguna Beach. These topographic features accentuate geologic, hydrologic,
     and fire hazards and require thorough evaluation and analysis as a part of the land use
     and design planning processes. The Land Use Element contains numerous policies that
     address hazard and safety planning. The City's Safety Element addresses emergency
     planning/response, hazardous materials, geologic hazards, fire hazards, flood hazards,
     and shoreline protection.
11. Ensure that sustainability guides City policy. The City recognizes the magnitude of
     the challenge that climate change poses. The City can move toward sustainability and
     reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the way it manages land development and
     building construction, conserves habitats and natural resources, provides efficient
     transportation and mobility systems, and develops its infrastructure and public services.
     Sites should be planned, buildings designed, and infrastructure developed to reduce the
     consumption of energy, water, and raw materials, generation of waste, and use of toxic
     and hazardous substances. The General Plan establishes a framework to ensure that the
     City is sustainable, resilient, and regenerative for residents, visitors, and future
     generations.

 Section 1: Introduction
 General Plan and Land Use Element Purpose
 The responsibility for land use planning has rested with local government for many years. The
 State of California first enacted legislation in 1937 that required cities and counties to prepare
 and adopt Master Plans. Initially, these Master Plans were rudimentary and perfonned a limited
 role in long-range community development. In later years, however, the General Plan, as it is
 currently referred to, matured in meaning and importance to become the cornerstone of local
 land use planning. As a long-range blueprint guiding community development, the General Plan
 consists of seven mandatory elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Open Space,
 Conservation, Safety, and Noise.
The General Plan addresses a broad range of issues and is the controlling document in land use
 regulation. The Plan is implemented by regulations such as those found in the zoning ordinance,
 specific plans, the subdivision ordinance, and building codes. The text, policies, and diagrams
 within each General Plan element must be consistent with one another. The Zoning Ordinance
and other General Plan implementation tools must be consistent with the General Plan.
The Land Use Element (LUE) designates the type, intensity, and general distribution of land uses
and is a guide for decision makers, the public, and planners with regard to future public and
private land use and development.          As the element with the broadest scope, the LUE is
considered to be most representative of the General Plan. Essentially, the goals, policies, and
actions of the LUE provide a long-range context for short-tenn decisions. The LUE also
coordinates the policies of the other elements and synthesizes them in the land use plan and may
even go beyond physical planning to address social and economic issues.
State law requires the LUE to be organized into two principal components: text describing goals,
policies, and implementing action and land use plan maps and diagrams. The text describes the
existing community land use and issues, sets forth goals and policies for the future and actions to
implement the goals, and establishes categories for population density, building intensity, and
development control. The maps and diagrams establish the distribution and types of land use in
graphic fonn.
History of Laguna Beach Land Use Element
The first attempt at comprehensive planning by the City of Laguna Beach occurred in 1955,
when it adopted a Master Plan that addressed growth and development within the City and the
surrounding area. In 1959, a more fonnal and comprehensive General Plan was adopted,
consisting of three separate elements--Land Use, Circulation, and Recreation. This General Plan
provided the direction for growth in the City until 1972, when the City Council adopted a new,
expanded Land Use Element.
Since 1972, the purview of the City's General Plan has increased dramatically. The advances in
the City's comprehensive planning efforts are due to a combination of factors, including growing
public interest in community planning, the emergence of new State planning requirements, and
                                                 1- 2                                       2-7-12 

 changes in the financial profile of the City, which require a closer examination of service costs
 versus community benefits.
 Since the last comprehensive LUE update in 1983, the City's planning area has expanded
 considerably with the annexation of South Laguna, Old Top of the World, and Allview Terrace
 in 1987 and the Laguna Canyon area in 1989.
 Time Frame
 There are two reasons for designating a time frame for the LUE: 1) it establishes an
 implementation schedule for achieving community goals through implementing actions and 2) it
 sets long-term policy for day-to-day decision-making. Implementing changes in land uses and
 community goals takes considerable time. A short time frame such as 5 years may be too brief
 to provide for realistic planning. A very long-range plan, however, may not be responsive to
 economic and social changes. In the past, jurisdictions typically chose 15 to 25 years as the time
 frame for a LUE. Today, the long-term horizon for the General Plan is typically 15 to 20 years.
For purposes of this Land Use Element, a IS-year time horizon has been selected as a basis for
measuring community growth and policy development. This time should provide the City with
the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing community interests, values, and priorities. The
 IS-year time horizon does not establish an end point but rather sets forth a general context in
which to make shorter-term decisions.
The LUE actions, which are strategies to carry out a General Plan policy in order to achieve
community goals, have designated specific time frames. Actions that have been prioritized for
implementation within a relatively short time period are designated "short-term" for a maximum
3-year implementation.       "Medium-term" is for a maximum 8-year, and "long-term" for a
maximum IS-year implementation time frame.
Geographic Application
The LUE must by law encompass the entire jurisdiction of the community. The Element,
however, extends to areas outside its jurisdiction. These areas are usually the City's "sphere of
influence," but they may simply be areas which in the City's judgment "bear relation to its
planning" (Government Code Section 65300).
The City of Laguna Beach is surrounded by open space. This open space encompasses
approximately 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped lands and includes Laguna Coast Wilderness
Park, Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park, Crystal Cove State Park, and Laguna Laurel
Ecological Reserve. This public open-space land is principally under the jurisdiction of the State
and the County of Orange and physically separates the City from the urbanization occurring
elsewhere in the County. These lands provide density relief and open space and share with the
City watersheds, drainage systems, road and trail linkages, air space, recreational resources, and
interdependent biological communities. Because of this relationship, the LUE establishes a
planning area which includes these open-space lands. This area formal recognition of the impact
of this spectacular open space on the community, the City'S past participation in its acquisition,
                                                1- 3                                        2-7-12 

 and its desire to continue to participate in the future.
 While the City cannot directly control land use within these State and County open-space lands,
 it can influence the outcome of State and County decisions regarding the area and can establish a
 cooperative relationship with these governmental agencies to maintain the greenbelt as a regional
open-space and conservation resource in the face of mounting developmental pressures.
Relationship to the Coastal Plan
Like all coastal communities in California, the City of Laguna Beach must observe the
provisions of the California Coastal Act of 1976. In contrast to most coastal communities;
however, most of the entire City is included in the coastal zone. Only the 522-acre Sycamore
Hills area within the City is excluded.
This coastal zone designation has created the need for close coordination between coastal
planning and the City's General Plan. The Coastal Act requires that land uses in cities' coastal
zones be regulated by a Local Coastal Plan. Because the Local Coastal Plan covers so much of
Laguna Beach, the LUE Map is virtually identical geographically to the Coastal Plan Map.
In addition, the issues and policies of the two plans often overlap. For example, both plans
address parking and circulation, watercourse protection, hillside development, and recreational
lands. The Local Coastal Program, however, maintains a slightly different orientation from the
General Plan, with particular emphasis placed on coastal-related issues such as tide pools,
shoreline access, and coastal bluffs.
Given the interrelationship between these subjects and the City's General Plan, the Coastal Plan
has been physically integrated into this element and the Open Space/Conservation Element.
These elements contain policies and development standards related to the Coastal Plan and are
intended to implement the provisions of the Coastal Act.
Citizen Participation and the Visioning Process ·
Public participation has traditionally performed a valuable function in the planning process,
particularly in reflecting community values, needs, and goals. In the City of Laguna Beach,
citizen participation has been a particularly important feature of the local planning process,
providing residents an opportunity to express their thoughts and viewpoints and interact in the
decision-making process. This community participation has added quality and credibility to
planning studies and engenders public understanding of, and support for such plans.
Citizen involvement played an instrumental role in the early development of the LUE. In the
early 1980s, the Laguna Beach City Council formed citizen advisory committees to study the
various elements of the General Plan. The principal responsibility of the committee was the
identification of significant planning issues and formulation of goals, objectives, and
implementation measures.
In 2001, the Vision Steering Committee, with the input of more than 2,000 community members
                                                   1-4                                     2-7-12 


and over 100 groups, completed a two-year vIsIOning process which culminated in the
completion of the Vision Laguna 2030 Final Report and Strategic Plan. The basis of the Plan is
a shared vision for the future of Laguna Beach. This shared vision includes preserving and
enhancing the following community aspects: 1) community character as it relates to people and
place, 2) resident and visitor mobility, 3) environmental responsibility, 4) arts and culture, 5)
economic sustainability, and 5) governance and civic participation.
The Planning Commission and Planning Commission Subcommittee held numerous public
workshops during the LUE update, and the concepts and themes of the Vision Laguna Plan were
incorporated into the Goals, Policies, Actions and Implementation Program set forth in LUE
Section 7.
Organization of the Land Use Element
The LUE is organized into seven sections. Following this introduction, Sections 2-5 address the
physical setting of the City, its population and economic characteristics, and its existing land
uses. Section 6 describes the categories utilized on the land use plan map. Section 7 consists of
a series of goals, policies, actions and implementation procedures dealing with the major land
use concerns identified by the community and the City Council. Considerable detail has been
included in these issue statements because it is important for the community to understand the
reasoning that led to each policy.
These sections work together like chapters in a book. Different chapters are important at
different times and in different situations. The background sections, for example, will be used to
provide information on the characteristics and values of the community, whereas the land use
map and the goals, policies, actions and implementation section will be utilized to evaluate
development requests for consistency with the General Plan.

                         PHYSICAL SETTING 

This is the first of four sections that collectively describe the physical, social, and economic
characteristics of the City. This community profile forms the factual basis for the policies and
land use designations in the Land Use Element. The profile begins with the physical setting of
Laguna Beach-its geography, soils, and climate, the characteristics that give form to the City's
environment.

 Section 2: Physical Setting
 Geomorphic Regions
 The City of Laguna Beach is situated in an unusual setting not found elsewhere in the County of
 Orange. This site results from both the location of the City as a seaside community and its
 physical elements, characterized by steep hillsides, rugged canyon bottoms, prominent
 ridgelines, and large areas of open space. These conditions physically separate Laguna Beach
 from the urbanization occurring elsewhere in the County and provide a natural open-space buffer
 around the community.
 The particular physical features of the City can be divided into three geomorphic regions:
 Coastal Fringe; Hillsides, Canyons, and Ridges; and the Central Basin.
 Coastal Fringe. The coastal fringe is composed of the coastal terrace and the Pacific shoreline.
The coastal terrace is traversed by the Pacific Coast Highway and flanked by urban development.
It is generally level, although gullies and arroyos cut across the terrace, which terminates at
wave-cut sea cliffs that range in height from a few feet to nearly 140 feet above sea level.
The Pacific shoreline measures about 3.5 miles along the general coastal outline and 6.2 miles
along the actual detailed water line. This difference is a reflection of the topographic irregularity
of the coastline created by the presence of prominent headlands and small pocket beaches. The
cliffs and headlands in Laguna Beach are famous for their unusual rock formations.
Some of these rock formations are more susceptible to erosion than others as a result of their
particular geologic composition and exposure to erosion elements. Most of the prominent
headlands, for example, are composed of hard and resistant volcanic and/or cemented
sedimentary rock, hence their continued prominence along the City's shoreline. In contrast,
coves that contain small pocket beaches are a reflection of weaker bedrock that weathers, erodes,
and retreats more rapidly than headland formations.
Hillsides. Canyons. and Ridges. The major canyons of the Laguna Beach area--Laguna Canyon,
Hidden Valley, Rimrock Canyon, and Bluebird Canyon--were initially formed by geologic
uplifting of the San Joaquin Hills and subsequent stream cutting that gradually eroded weaker
rock formations into deep canyons. Common features of these canyons are steep slopes that
expose bedrock where surface topsoil has been eroded and displaced downstream into the Pacific
Ocean. These canyons reveal evidence of geologically problematic dip-slope conditions where
the topographic slope surface conforms in angle to the inclination of the underlying bedrock
strata.
Central Basin. This area is characterized by the broad, nearly level expanses of land situated at
the confluence of Laguna Canyon and the Pacific Ocean. This area exhibits soft, non-expansive­
to-locally-expansive soil conditions resulting from stream sedimentation. These alluvial
sediments range from a few feet to over 100 feet thick. Groundwater levels in the central basin
are relatively high, with seasonal fluctuations ranging from 5 to 15 feet below ground surface.
                                             2-2                                              2-7-12 


 Geology
 Geologic Structure. Five predominant rock formations underlay the City of Laguna Beach. 1)
 Marine and Continental Terrace Deposits made-up of conglomerate, gravel, sand and silt; 2) the
 Monterey Formation, made-up of interbedded silty and silicious shale and siltstone; 3) volcanic
 rock; 4) the San Onofre Formation, a sedimentary breccia and conglomerate with coarse sand
 boulders and quartzite locally interbedded with sandstone and sandy siltstone; and 5) the
 Topanga Formation, generally consisting of silty sandstone and interbedded siltstone and porous
 rock.
 The geological formation of the Laguna Beach area began approximately 15-20 million years
 ago as layers of sediment were deposited beneath the sea, followed by volcanic activity, which
 injected hard rock into fissures . Fine volcanic ash was also deposited, sometimes incorporated
 with sand and silt, occasionally as a distinct layer. While these processes were occurring,
 seismic forces folded, faulted, and lifted the mass above sea level, allowing erosion to attack the
 layers ofrock tilted from their original, nearly horizontal position.
 Local landforms within the city were primarily caused by uplift of the San Joaquin Hills and
erosion and wave action working on the hard and soft layers of rock. The harder and more
 resistant layers tended to remain as outcroppings, sometimes forming steep cliffs, while the
 softer rock was more readily removed, allowing stream action to form canyons.
The current phase of geological development began with a series of intermittent uplifts that have
continued at a diminished rate into the present. During the pause between uplifts, the sea was
able to attack the rock located at sea level, cutting a bench or terrace. These elevated coastal
terraces are prominent features in the topography of Laguna Beach, and their broad, nearly level
expanses invited early development.
During and following the last ice age a dramatic 300+ foot fall and subsequent rise of sea level
resulted in the deposition of the alluvial central basin area in Laguna Canyon. This process was
not quite complete when the first Anglo settlers arrived and they found the mouth of this canyon,
which is now the downtown basin, somewhat swampy.
Faults. The City of Laguna Beach lies in a seismically active zone vulnerable to ground shaking
and related geologic hazards. There are four major active faults in the region: the nearby
Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone (5 miles west), the San Joaquin Hills Thrust Fault (underlying all
of Laguna Beach), the more distant San Jacinto Fault (50 miles northeast) and the San Andreas
Fault (55 miles northeast). Locally, Laguna Beach has three major inactive fault systems,
including the Laguna Canyon, Temple Hills, and Pelican Hill faults. The Laguna Canyon Fault
is best revealed by the steep scarps at the back of Bluebird and Rimrock Canyons. Erosion rather
than current faulting is responsible for these exposures. This fault can be followed from South
Laguna to the vicinity of the University of California at Irvine (UCI) campus. The Temple Hills
Fault is not as conspicuous, trending in an east-west direction generally perpendicular to the
Laguna Canyon Fault. Its trace runs from the upper portion of Bluebird Canyon to the
downtown basin. The Pelican Hill Fault extends from North Laguna to Irvine near UCI.
                                             2-3                                             2-7-12
 Technically, all of these faults are inactive, which means that geological evidence shows that no
 motion has occurred for 11,000 to three million years.
 Slope. Slope is an important consideration in land use planning. Slope stability is dependent
 upon a number of factors. The most important factor is the type of earth materials such as
 bedrock, sediment, or soil and the related characteristics such as structure, strength, vegetative
 cover, and the steepness of slope. Rainfall, erosion, earthquakes and human activities such as
 grading and irrigation also strongly affect slope stability.
 Ancient landslides are present underlying the hillsides in a number of locations throughout the
 city. Some of these ancient landslides have been reactivated as a result of periods of above­
 average rainfall (Bluebird Canyon, 1978). In other areas, rainfall may result in new landslides
 (Bluebird Canyon, 2005). In general, these features occur in sedimentary bedrock units that have
 predominantly siltstone layers and a structural orientation that is adverse as related to
 topography.
 Surficial instability, mudflows, and soil slumps can occur on the steeper natural slopes within the
City during and shortly after periods of heavy rainfall (Laguna Canyon, 1998).
Soil development within the City relates to the geomorphic setting and the underlying geologic
fonnation. In the hillside areas soil development is relatively slow, and the composition relates
to the underlying rock type such as sandstone, siltstone, or conglomerate. Soil development on
the coastal terrace is influenced by the underlying, relatively sandy terrace deposits as well as the
materials transported from the adjacent hillside. Soil deVelopment within the central basin is
related to stream deposition from Laguna Canyon. Depending on the parent material, some soils
are fine-grained, expansive, and/or compressible while others are coarse and dense.
Groundwater
Groundwater is present at a shallow depth within the central basin. Elsewhere, groundwater is
generally perched at the bedrock-terrace contact in the coastal terrace as well as within the more
penneable layers of the various bedrock units. Additionally, groundwater is located in the
canyon bottoms, most notably in the winter and spring.
Climate
Climate plays an important role in the physical setting of Laguna Beach. The City's
temperature, rainfall, and wind are typical of a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild
winters, wann summers, moderate rainfall, and general year-round sunshine with the exception
of coastal morning fog during the spring and summer months.
Temperatures in Laguna Beach typically range from 59 0 F to 85 0 F during the summer and from
300 F to 80 0 F in the winter. The average rainfall in Laguna Beach is 12 to 13 inches per year but
can be over 30 inches in extreme years. Over 90 percent of the rainfall occurs between late
                                             2-4                                             2-7-12 


October and early April. The distribution of rainfall can be extremely irregular, with torrential
downpours in one area while another receives only light showers.
Some of the rain that falls on the crest and on the side slopes of the San Joaquin Hills emerges in
wet years as springs and seepages near the foot of the northern slopes and generally at the base of
the terrace deposits where impermeable rock is encountered. These springs remain active during
most of the summer, as illustrated by those in the Heisler Park area.
Wind, in combination with other climatic and geographic features, is a significant aspect of the
City's physical setting. Prevailing winds in Laguna Beach are sea breezes that are generally low
in velocity, attaining speeds of 10 to 20 mph. Typically, sea breezes are beneficial to the
community because they propel air pollutants inland and provide a cooling effect during the
warm summer months.
In addition to prevailing sea breezes, the City receives strong seasonal winds, generally during
the fall and winter months. Referred to as Santa Ana winds, they are hot, dry northerly-to­
northeasterly winds that often attain velocities in excess of 40 mph. Santa Ana winds are
particularly damaging because they frequently occur during the driest season of the year,
increasing the risk of rapidly spreading fires.

 Section 3: Population Characteristics
 Historic Perspective
 Laguna Beach has experienced continuous growth in population since its incorporation in 1927.
 In that year, the City's population approached 1,500 residents~ The original city limits consisted
 of only 690 acres, which generally encompassed the downtown basin and surrounding flat areas.
 In subsequent years, as the City continued to expand its jurisdictional limits, the population in
 Laguna Beach similarly increased. The City of Laguna Beach has 8.84 square miles of territory
 and a population of23,727 residents according to the 2000 Census.
 The actual growth rate in Laguna Beach has fluctuated over the years, with an annual increase of
 12.5% between 1930 and 1940, 4.9% between 1940 and 1950, and 3.9% between 1950 and
 1960. The annual increase between 1970 and 1980 was 2.3%; between 1980 and 1990, it was
 2.9%. Since 1990, the average annual increase in population has slowed to .2%. Table 3-1
 provides a summary of population totals since incorporation of the City.

JThe large population increase that occurred between 1980 and 1990 was largely the result of the annexation of
South Laguna (1987) and Laguna Canyon (1989). South Laguna added approximately 4,500 residents and the
Laguna Canyon Annexation added approximately 200 residents to the City. Of the 29.4% growth between 1980 and
1990, the annexations of South Laguna and Laguna Canyon contributed close to 90%.

Current and Projected Trends
The City's growth will likely continue but at decreasing rates when compared with historical
trends because of the diminishing supply of buildable land in the City and the unlikely prospect
of annexing substantial areas ofland. The majority of vacant land is constrained by steep terrain,
access difficulties, and environmental hazards. These constraints may result in greater attention
to land recycling or rehabilitation in the older developed areas of the City, such as the downtown
                                                    3-2                                               2-7-12 

 basin and the coastal plain. Some properties that are currently underutilized in terms of zoning
 density, such as the R-2 lots in North Laguna, may gradually redeveloped to more intensive use.
 This development trend toward intensification includes not only adding residential units to an
 underutilized lots but also increasing the size of an existing house. Table 3-2 depicts the
 estimated growth in Laguna Beach to the year 2020, based upon historical trends, new
 development potential, redevelopment opportunities, and land use constraints.

The City'S popUlation is influenced by the influx of seasonal residents and visitors during the
summer months, non-summer weekends and holidays. It is estimated that the resident
population increases to approximately 45,000 and that the daily influx of visitors is between
25,000 and 35,000 people during July and August. During the past decade, the number of
visitors during non-summer weekends and holidays has increased.              The large seasonal
concentration of both residents and daily visitors impacts City services and the demand on
existing and planned infrastructure systems.
Age and Income Profile
The social and economic characteristics of the City's residents have gradually changed over the
years. Table 3-3 shows the age distribution of the community from 1980 to 2000. Several trends
can be derived from the information contained in this table. Although the largest segment of the
City's population remains the age group 25-44, this age group has declined from 50% of the
population to 37% in 2000. At the same time, the older adult population (age group 45-64) has
increased from approximately 20% of the population to 34% in 2000. Both the oldest age group
(65 and over) and the youngest (17 and under) have stayed fairly consistent at approximately
13% and 15% of the population, respectively.
The biggest rate of change occurred with the age group 55-64 with a 49.6% mcrease m

population between 1990 and 2000. Not surprisingly, the population in Laguna Beach, as in
many other communities, is aging.

The 2000 U.S. Census reported a substantial rise (44%) in family median income in Laguna
Beach in the previous decade, increasing from $70,219 in 1989 to $100,778 in 1999. At the
same time, the median family income for Orange County rose 26%. Table 3-4 shows the
historical trend in income for the City, demonstrating that Laguna Beach has evolved from a
bohemian and artists' enclave in 1969 to a very high-income city by 1999. In 1969, the Laguna
Beach median family income was one-third of the County's, yet by 1999, the median family
income in Laguna Beach was 55% higher than the County's figure.

While the median income for all Laguna Beach households is higher than the County median,
Table 3-5 shows that not all households in Laguna Beach are equal. Nonfamily households and
single/unmarried female householders represent median income levels that are approximately
50% of the married-couple families' median income.

                       CHARACTERISTICS 

This section is an overview of the City's economy and its pattern of revenues and expenditures.
It is included in the Land Use Element because the City's designation of land uses can strongly
influence its economic growth and viability by determining the amount of land that can be
devoted to a particular use. Land use designations should encourage local business activity and
employment opportunities while achieving community objectives of providing homes, open
space, and recreation. Land uses that require significant expenditures for City services must be
carefully evaluated in light of expected revenues while planned amenities must be tied to future
sources of income.

 Section 4: Economic Characteristics
 Employment and Business
 As indicated in Table 4-1, the total number of estimated employees, for all business
 establishments in the City increased from 9,017 in 2003 to 12,709 in 2008. Visitor-serving
 businesses made a substantial contribution to the employment of wage-earners in Laguna Beach.
 As evidenced by the figures in Table 4-1, the "Hotels and Lodging" industry provided 1,626 jobs
 and "Eating and Drinking" establishments provided 1,608 jobs, which made up over 25 percent
of all employment in the City. "Health Services" represented 8.5 percent of the workforce,
providing 1,085 jobs, and the "Government" sector maintained 7.5 percent of the workforce,
providing 953 jobs.
As indicated in Table 4-2, the estimated number of businesses in the City in 2008 was 2,122.
The "Service" sector included 957 businesses (45.1 %), the category of "Other Services" 621
businesses (23.9%), and "Health Services" 134 businesses (6.3%). The "Retail Trade" sector
included 532 businesses (25.1 %). From the information presented in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, it
appears that businesses in both the "Service" and "Retail Trade" sectors tend to be fairly small.
The "Service" sector employs an average of 6.8 people per establishment and the "Retail Trade"
sector an average of 5.9 people per establishment.
City Revenues and Expenditures
An important aspect of the City's economy is its revenue sources and expenditures. A review of
the City's total revenues for the past five fiscal years indicates a 55.52% increase in revenues
between 2003 and 2007 (Table 4-3). However, overall revenues have increased at a variable rate
during that time period. From 2004 to 2005 revenues increased by 17%, and from 2005 to 2006
revenues increased by 8%.
Property taxes in Laguna Beach represent the largest percentage of the City's total revenue,
ranging from 35% of 2003 revenues to 37% of 2007 revenues. Revenue from the sales tax and
the transient occupancy tax (TOT) made up approximately 23% of revenues over the five-year
period from 2003-2007. Charges for services, which include planning and building fees,
contributed approximately 13% of annual revenues.          Parking meters and lots and parking
permits contributed approximately 8% of total revenues, while investments and rental revenue
contributed approximately 4% of revenues during the same five-year period.
The City's revenues are directly related to its expenditures. These expenditures are divided into
six basic categories: general government, community development, public safety, public works,
recreation and social services, and capital expenditures. The expenditures listed in Table 4-4
reflect balancing of revenues and City needs between 2003 and 2007. A review of the
expenditures for this time period indicates that the greatest percentage of expenditures occurred
in the categories of public safety and public works. The combined total of these two categories
represented 62% to 68% of the total expenditures for each of the five years.

                        EXISTING LAND USE 

The uses to which land is already committed influence the future use of vacant or
underdeveloped land. This section of the Land Use Element identifies the development pattern
that now exists, projects future trends of land use based on current regulations and establishes the
framework for actions to control and direct new growth in favor of the community's interest.

 Section 5: Existing Land Use
 The City of Laguna Beach is situated on a spectacular stretch of Pacific coastline, has an area of
 8.84 square miles. It includes that that is zoned for residential, commercial, light industrial,
 institutional, recreational, open space, agriculture-recreation, and public lands uses. Open space,
 recreational, and environmentally sensitive lands make up approximately 59% of the total area.
 Residential land use makes up 35%, commercial uses approximately 4%, and industrial and
 institutional are 1% each of the developed land within the City boundaries. The following
 summarizes the historical perspective and existing conditions from which issues can be identified
 and polices implemented to guide future development of the City.
Residential Development
Historical Perspective. The majority of early subdivision activity within Laguna Beach occurred
 between 1887 and 1925. Generally, these first subdivisions encompassed the central portion of
the City, the flatter coastal plain region and later extended to the southern and northern sections
 of town. Eventually development activity spread to less compatible terrain along the hillsides of
the community. Several early subdivisions were recorded with the County of Los Angeles prior
to incorporation of these lands into either Orange County or the City of Laguna Beach.
As a result of the less restrictive subdivision requirements in effect during these early years, a
number of developmental problems were created, many of which still exist today. Examples can
be found in the Arch Beach Heights and Diamond/Crestview subdivisions, which have
substandard lots, access constraints, and environmental hazards. Many the undeveloped lots
remain unbuildable because they do not meet the building site criteria and conflict with the
developmental standards and policies, adopted to protect community members and
environmentally sensitive lands.
The first residential development occurred in the downtown basin and along the bluffs above
Main Beach Park, where relatively level land was accessible from existing roads. Most of the
early residential development was intended for part-time seasonal use during the summer or
weekend retreats. As the City gained distinction as an art colony, housing was constructed in a
number of secluded areas removed from the main activity of the town. Many homes built in the
southern end of the City were originally intended as beach cottages for seasonal occupancy;
however, North Laguna attracted more year-round residents because of more favorable access
and proximity to the developing community center.
Existing Conditions. Laguna Beach is rapidly approaching build-out, with limited opportunities
for development. The majority of new residential development between 1990 and 2004 has been
infill development, primarily in the Diamond-Crestview Specific Plan area. According to the
U.S. Census, the City's housing stock consisted of 12,846 units in 1990 and 12,965 units in
2000. The 119 housing-unit increase during that decade represents only a .93% increase in the
City'S housing stock, indicative of the build-out situation.
Future Growth Potential. Historically, residential development in the City has been guided by
the physical conditions of property such as slope and topography. Since the majority of the
property most physically conducive to development has already been subdivided and developed.
Development of remaining vacant lands is less feasible because of physical constraints such as
                                                5-2                                      2-7-12 

 geologic hazards and/or environmentally sensitive conditions.
 Future residential development in the City will be derived from vacant legal parcels, the
 redevelopment of underutilized residential land to more intensive residential uses, or the
 redevelopment of commercially zoned properties to mixed use projects that include residential
 units. This development will affect the supply and demand for housing, impose an additional
 burden on the City's infrastructure and services, and inevitably change the physical character of
 the community by increasing population.
 The development possibilities by zone are as follows:
 The R-l Residential Low Density Zone offers limited opportunities for the development of new
 housing. Review of 2008 aerial maps and subsequent building permits indicated that only 94 of
 5,431 building sites remain undeveloped as of July 2008. Some of the undeveloped lots have
 been combined with adjacent building sites to expand the yard areas; however, those lots may be
 developed as separate building sites in the future.
 An opportunity to increase the City's housing stock in the R-1 Zone is the development of
 Second Residential Units. Second residential units are subject to a minimum lot size of 9,000
 square feet, the provision of additional parking, and compliance with other zoning standards.
 Potential development of second residential units is not easy to quantify because such
development typically depends on the needs of the owners (i.e., occupancy by aging or other
 family members). However, second residential units are not limited to occupancy by family
members. They may be rented to tenants and they provide a much-needed opportunity for lower­
cost rental housing.
The following zones and specific plan areas are comparable to, and incorporate some of the
standards of the R-1 Zone. The total number of building sites and number of unimproved
building sites referenced in each of the zones is based on the review of Citywide 2008 aerial
maps and building permit records.
The Arch Beach Heights Specific Plan (ABHSP) was adopted in 1974 to provide guidelines that
address the constraints of the area, some of which include very narrow lots, typically 25 feet by
 100 feet the related deficiency of on-street parking in the neighborhood, very steep topographic
conditions, and environmentally sensitive areas. Because of topographic conditions that limit
safe access and the presence of high value-habitat in much of the area, most of the unimproved
lots that are not building sites are unlikely to be developed in the future. Approximately 26 of
795 building sites in the ABHSP area were unimproved as of July 2008.
Adopted in 1992, to protect the unique physical characteristics and circumstances of the area, the
Diamond-Crestview Specific Plan (DCSP), provides zoning standards for the development of
single-family residences. Approximately 47 of the 161 building sites remained unimproved as of
July 2008.
The Lagunita Zone, formerly zoned R-1, was adopted in 2003 to establish specific standards to
preserve ocean views and privacy that could potentially be impacted by redevelopment pressures
in the Lagunita neighborhood. The majority of the 65-10t Lagunita neighborhood was developed
in the 1950s and 1960s and is essentially built-out. Approximately two building sites remained
unimproved as of July 2008.
                                               5-3                                    2-7-12

 The Sarah Thurston Park Specific Plan (STPSP) was adopted in 1983 to preserve the
 neighborhood character, preserve housing opportunities for the lower-income population in the
 neighborhood, and encourage private investment in neighborhood revitalization. According to
 the Specific Plan, the neighborhood includes 28 single-family residences, three structures with a
 total of seven apartments, three duplexes, one multifamily residence with a total of three units,
 and 27 mobile homes, for a total of 68 residences. Approximately 8 building sites remained
 undeveloped as of July 2008.
 The Three Arch Bay Zone (TAB) was adopted in 1989 to maintain, enhance, and promote the
 unique character of the neighborhood, which was developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The TAB
 Zone is predominantly built-out, except for the development of approximately 13 new residences
 on unimproved building sites.
 In 1999, the City adopted the Treasure Island Specific Plan (TISP) for the redevelopment of the
 Treasure Island Mobile Home Park. It established a shoreline protection program and
development standards for a hotel and resort. The Plan established development standards for 14
 single-family residences and 14 condominiums.           The TISP is built-out except for the
development of seven single-family residences.
In 1989, the Village Community Zone (VC) was adopted to preserve the neighborhood
characteristics of the South Laguna Village.          Development standards were established
specifically for smaller-lot development. Approximately 12 lots remain undeveloped.
In 1995, the City established the Residential Hillside Protection Zone (RlHP). This zone
promotes development sensitive to the environmental constraints of the land, including unique
landforms, scenic hillsides, sensitive biological habitat, and conservation of existing natural
open-space lands. Many undeveloped lots in the RlHP Zone are large building sites or non­
building sites. Of the 71 building sites in the RlHP Zone, eight are currently unimproved.
Depending upon compliance with the RlHP development standards, including property sizes and
slope conditions, there may be an opportunity for some of these lots to be subdivided in the
future to create additional building sites. Second Residential Units are also allowed in the RlHP
Zone. All eight building sites in the RlHP Zone meet the current minimum lot size of 9,000
square feet for the potential development of second residential units.
The R-2 Residential Medium Density Zone has 1,053 building sites. The four remaining vacant
R-2-zoned lots in the City could yield a total of eight residences. A large percentage of the 720
lots that are 4,000 square feet or more are currently underutilized, supporting just one unit.
Maximum potential development could provide up to 1,440 units on lots of 4,000 square feet or
more and 333 single-family residences on lots under 4,000 square feet, for a total of 1,773
residential units within the R-2 Zone.
The R-3 Residential High Density Zone has 504 building sites. Because only two vacant
building sites are currently zoned R-3, the majority of new residential units in the R-3 Zone
could result from expanding development opportunities on existing underutilized lots. Using the
density standard of one unit for every 2,000 square feet, a total of three units could be developed
on the three remaining building sites. As discussed in the Housing Element, the limited supply
of land and the high desirability of Laguna Beach has increased the demand for single-family
residences. Because of such pressures over the past decade, the City has experienced an increase
                                              5-4                                       2-7-12 


 in the conversion of two-family and multifamily units to single-family residences. Potential
 impacts related to the decrease in the rental housing stock have led to the adoption of housing
 policies to protect the limited quantity of available rental housing.
 In 1989, the City adopted the MH Mobile Home Zone to provide low- or moderate-income
 housing opportunities. Only one area of the City, Laguna Terrace Park is zoned MH and has IS8
 mobile home spaces.
 The Municipal Code permits limited residential development opportunities in the following
 commercial zones.
 The C-l Local Business District conditionally permits residential units as part of a commercial
development at a density of one unit per 2,000 square feet of lot area, provided that the
residential use does not exceed SO% of the gross floor area of the structure and is located above
the ground floor.
The C-N Commercial-Neighborhood Zone conditionally permits residential units as an integral
part of commercial development, provided that the residential use is limited to no more than SO%
of the gross floor area and there is at least 2,000 square feet oflot area for each dwelling.
The DSP Downtown Specific Plan allows residential development in most districts in
conjunction with commercial development. The CBD Office Zone of the DSP provides limited
opportunities for residential development. The DSP CBD-Multiple-Family Residential District
allows residential development subject to the standards of the R-3 Zone. Multifamily residential
uses in the CBD include a IS-unit low-income senior citizen development on Broadway, a 2S­
unit median-income condominium development at the southwest corner of Third and Mermaid, a
24-unit apartment development for very-low-income disabled persons, and a very-low-income
development of 27 studio apartments on Glenneyre Street.
The LBP Local Business-Professional Zone allows residential units at a ratio of one unit per
2,000 square feet of gross floor area. The allowable number of units is reduced by one unit for
each 1,000 square feet of commercial floor area.
The SLV South Laguna Village Commercial Zone conditionally permits residential uses as an
integral part of commercial development limited to no more than SO% of the gross floor area.
All commercial zones in the City conditionally permit artists' joint living and working units.
The M-IA Light Industrial Zone conditionally permits artists' joint living and working units.
However, other residential uses are prohibited because of the potential incompatibility of land
uses.
In conclusion, approximately 200 new residential units could be constructed in the City without
additional subdivision approvals. This figure does not represent the maximum developmental
potential, because it does not include commercial/residential mixed-use projects, artists'
live/work units, second residential units, subdivisions, and redevelopment of underutilized
property.
Commercial Development
Downtown Specific Plan - Central Business District. The Laguna Beach Central Business
District (CBD), located in the Downtown Specific Plan area, emerged as the City'S first
                                                 S-S                                     2-7-12 


 community focal point. Today, this area represents the commercial as well as the physical,
 economic, and social center of the community. The CBD encompasses some 48 acres of land
 situated in the downtown basin of the community, generally delineated by Pacific Coast
 Highway on the south, Cliff Drive to the west, Laguna Canyon Road to the northwest, Loma
 Terrace to the north, and Legion Street to the east. Existing land use is characterized by a broad
 range of civic and art-related uses and commercial-related services, including visitor-serving
uses such as restaurants, art galleries, and custom boutiques and local retail establishments
catering to the needs of the resident population. In addition, the CBD supports an increasing
number of office/professional uses and financial buildings. The heterogeneous pattern of land
use in the Central Business District has attracted a rich diversity of people and community
interests t~ this area, adding to the vitality and ambiance of this important center of the City.
Commercial Facilities. Laguna Beach offers a considerable number of commercial facilities,
which have developed along a linear pattern dictated in large part by proximity to the Pacific
Ocean and accessibility from Pacific Coast Highway. The majority of these facilities are
interspersed along the length of that roadway, with the largest concentration of commercial uses
being located in Central and North Laguna. Much of the property situated adjacent to Coast
Highway is currently zoned and utilized for commercial facilities.
The City'S reputation as a popular coastal-resort community has influenced the nature of
commercial services, producing an excellent variety of both resident- and visitor-serving
businesses. Many of these businesses feature tourist-oriented services such as restaurants,
antique shops, art galleries, custom jewelry stores, and specialty shops. Additionally, there are
34 motellhotel and bed-and-breakfast facilities, totaling 1,479 rooms as of July 2008.
A shortage of suitable vacant land limits development for additional visitor-serving facilities.
Because of the size and configuration of the property, topographic constraints, and access
problems these have limited potential for visitor-serving uses. These limitations reinforce the
need to preserve the existing supply of such facilities. The stock of commercial facilities may
also be expanded by rehabilitating and/or converting older nonconfonning residential structures
and dilapidated commercial buildings to modem visitor-serving facilities.
Neighborhood Commercial Facilities. Traditionally, resident shopping needs have been
interspersed with visitor-serving facilities and other miscellaneous land uses, creating problems
of access and convenience and land use inefficiencies, with residents and visitors competing for
limited parking opportunities. Although the City lacks sufficient vacant commercial land to
centralize or integrate these services, the Downtown Specific Plan establishes policies to locate
services and retail opportunities for residents in the CBD Resident-Serving District.
In recent years, however, several small-scale neighborhood-oriented commercial areas have
emerged. An example of this is the gradual transition in certain areas of the City, such as
Glenneyre Street, where many small neighborhood businesses and professional offices have
appeared. Historically, this area supported a mixture of single-family and multifamily
development, but with increasing traffic and noise on Glenneyre Street and its direct and
convenient proximity to surrounding residential development, many residences have been
converted to business establishments.
This evolution has been supported by changes in zoning from residential to commercial use, such
as the Local Business-Professional Zone. Other sections of the City have also experienced a
                                                 5-6                                      2-7-12 

 gradual transition, including the northern portion of the Central Business District and several
 blocks along North Coast Highway.
 Mixed Commercial and Residential Uses. Laguna Beach has traditionally maintained a high
 percentage of specialty shops, particularly arts and crafts related . These shops are interspersed
 among the City's commercial zones, and some are attached to small studio apartments or other
 living quarters, where the shop owner or caretaker resides. The integration of residential and
 commercial uses provides a cost-efficient lifestyle and promotes the vitality of the City'S
 commercial areas by encouraging a more active streetscape after normal working hours.
 Housing located within commercial developments has also proven attractive to senior citizens
 because of reduced housing costs and proximity to needed commercial services. In order to
 preserve relatively lower-cost housing opportunities in commercial zones, the City has adopted a
 General Plan policy to preserve housing in mixed-used developments.
 Industrial Development
The industrial section of the City is confined to Laguna Canyon, where approximately 65 acres
 of land is zoned for light industrial and limited commercial activities. Industrial uses are
generally light in nature, in keeping with the scale and intensity of development elsewhere in the
 community. This area of the City includes many nonconforming residential and commercial
uses that were established prior to the industrial zoning. Consequently, some conflicts in land
use persist today. Industrial uses include an assortment of activities such as auto repair garages,
food processing and packaging, electronics, and art studios. The architectural and aesthetic
appearance of new development along Laguna Canyon is particularly important, given its
proximity to the Central Business District and the entrance to the community.
Public Recreational Lands
The City has a considerable diversity of public recreational opportunities for both visitors and
residents. Although many facilities are shared between these user groups, certain recreational
facilities are more popular with the tourist population, such as oceanfront parks and beaches.
The City currently has 29 oceanfront parks and viewing areas totaling approximately 24.7 acres.
The oceanfront parks include Main Beach Park (2.64 acres), Heisler Park (11.02 acres), Crescent
Bay Park (0.80 acres), and Treasure Island Park (5.5 acres) . Aliso Beach, which is under the
jurisdiction of the County of Orange, provides 28 acres of coastline recreation to Laguna Beach
residents and visitors. In addition, the City's 6.2 miles of coastline provide excellent beach
recreational opportunities, with public access to approximately 82 acres of sandy beach,
including the 7.2 acre beach at Treasure Island and Aliso Beach. These areas, combined with the
City'S oceanfront parks, provide approximately 106.7 acres of recreational opportunities to
visitors and residents alike.
Community recreational needs are further supplemented by 13 neighborhood parks, totaling 11 .3
acres, and 25 acres of outdoor recreational facilities provided by the Laguna Beach Unified
School District. Combined with public beaches, total public recreational acreage in Laguna
Beach is approximately 143 acres. Collectively, these recreational facilities represent a park-to­
population ratio of 6 acresll ,000 population.
Recreational opportunities in Laguna Beach have traditionally played a significant regional role.
The demand for these facilities, however, has been supplemented by the development of large­
                                               5-7                                     2-7-12 


scale regional parks in areas surrounding the community.
In the immediate vicinity of the City of Laguna Beach there are approximately 30,000 acres of
State and County parks, recreation areas and open space, a portion of which is still proposed for
acquisition. These areas provide various recreational opportunities, including picnicking, hiking,
camping, and bicycle and horseback riding. Northwest of the City is Crystal Cove State Park,
which includes 2,791 oceanfront and canyon acres. A portion of the 2,650 acres between the
State park and the Laguna Beach City boundary has been dedicated to the County as Laguna
Coast Wilderness Park, while another portion is proposed to be acquired and managed by the
County of Orange and kept as permanent open space. The area to the northeast of the dedication
land, which includes Laguna Laurel Ecological Reserve and the James Dilley Preserve, has been
designated by the County as a portion of the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. This park provides
a 600+- acre link between the open spaces to the west and east. Southeast of the Laguna Coast
Wilderness Park are 3,616 acres, some of which have been dedicated and some proposed as
recreation/open space in the Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park.

                    LAND USE CATEGORIES 

This section establishes the land use categories that will guide the future development of the
City. The categories describe the principal use, orientation, and intensity of development; their
distribution throughout the community is shown on the Land Use Plan Map that is available on
the City'S website and at City Hall.
                                           6- 1                                          2-7-12 

 Section 6: Land Use Plan Map
Description and Interpretation
The California Government Code stipulates that City general plans must include "a diagram or
diagrams and text setting forth their objectives, principles, standards and plan proposals." The
diagram, in this case, is the Land Use Plan Map contained in this document, which graphically
illustrates the general location and distribution of land use. The map also establishes general
standards for population density and building intensity in each of the land use categories.
The Land Use Plan Map illustrates land use in a generalized fashion because it is designed as a
long-term statement of broad public policy. For example, the categories do not reflect specific
parcel boundaries or land ownership as zoning maps do. Consequently, category boundary lines
may cross parcel lines, and the particular application of such boundary lines will sometimes
require judgment and interpretation by decision-makers.
Land Use Categories
The land use categories described below and illustrated on the Land Use Plan Map depict the
location and distribution of future growth and development in the City. These categories
establish the broad foundation for all land use planning in the community, as well as the
framework for future zoning. The uses denoted for each category are not necessarily intended to
be all-inclusive but rather serve to represent the general orientation of land use for each category.
Residential/Hillside Protection. This category is intended to promote a balanced management
program focusing on the preservation of open-space lands and environmentally sensitive areas,
while allowing for limited residential development. The area encompassed by this category
includes the City's remaining un subdivided vacant hiIlside lands, totaling approximately 1,065
acres.
The parameters for hillside development in the community are based upon slope/density
relationships. Slope conditions have proven to be a decisive factor in the development capability
of the City's hillside lands, affecting road accessibility and grading requirements, slope stability
and soil erosion, and quantities of water runoff. Guidelines for the density of development are
provided by the following matrix:
                                       Slope                         Density
                                      0-10%                      3.0 Units/Acre
                                    10+ -15%                     2.5 Units/Acre
                                     15+ - 20%                   2.0 Units/Acre
                                    20+ - 25%                    1.5 Units/Acre
                                    25+ - 30%                    1.0 Units/Acre
                                     30+ -35%                    0.5 Units/Acre
                                    35+ - 40%                    0.2 Units/Acre
                                    40+ - 45%                    0.1 Units/Acre
                                       45+%                       o Units/Acre
                                              6-2                                              2-7-12 

 Although slope characteristics perfonn an important function in hillside development, other
 factors must also be examined in conjunction with new development, including infrastructure
 capacities, environmental hazards, preservation of environmental goals, and public service costs.
 For this reason, emphasis must be placed on the fact that these provisions represent the
maximum allowable building density for a given property or maximum yield of housing units.
The actual number of housing units may be significantly lower than that designated by the above
provisions because of localized conditions identified during the site-specific planning process.
The actual development capability of hillside lands is therefore established by analysis of
physical constraints and implementation of natural resource protection policies and ordinance
requirements. This procedure enables the City to regulate the location and density of hillside
development while protecting environmentally sensitive areas and open-space lands in
accordance with General Plan policies and local ordinance requirements.
 Village Low Density. These lands provide for single-family residential development at urban
densities in areas that are predominantly developed and support existing detached single-family
residences. This classification is intended to provide a quiet living environment free from
rooming and boarding houses and commercial and industrial activities. Building density ranges
from I to 7 dwelling units per acre and limits development to one house per parcel.
Village Medium-Low Density. This classification is intended for detached single-family
residential uses in areas that are already developed and support existing homes. This district is
intended to provide a residential living environment that is adjacent to local services and
businesses. Mobile home parks are also pennitted in this district. Building density ranges from
1 to 10 dwelling units per acre.
Village Medium Density. These lands are situated within the existing urban fabric of the City
and frequently function as transition or buffer areas between the City's commercial corridor and
low-density single-family neighborhoods.             Detached single-family residences, 2-unit
condominiums, and duplex structures are pennissible uses, subject to compliance with applicable
property development standards. Building density ranges from 1 to 22 dwelling units per acre.
Village High Density. This classification is intended for high-density residential use. The
pennitted number of housing units will vary, depending on lot size and surrounding land use,
proximity to major streets and public transit, environmental constraints, and the availability of
public services and facilities. High-density urban residential uses are pennitted, including
condominiums, mUltiple family structures, rest homes and lodges. Building density ranges from
1 to 22 dwelling units per acre.
Affordable housing projects are also pennissible at densities above the standards of this category,
subject to the City approving an affordable housing plan, consisting of the following minimum
prOVIsIOns:
1. 	 Housing units shall be made exclusively available to households earning 120% or less of the
      County median income.
2. 	 Housing units shall be offered for sale or rent at affordable levels as defined below:
                                             6-3 	                                    Draft 10-14-09
      a.    Selling price shall be equal to or less than an amount that produces a monthly payment
      (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and homeowner's association dues) that is no
      more than 30% of the monthly household income.
      b. 	 Monthly rent paid by the tenant shall not exceed 30% of monthly household income.
 3. 	 Provision shall be made to ensure continued housing affordability for a minimum duration
      of 50 years after completion of the project.
 4. 	 The maximum permissible density for affordable housing projects shall be un-prescribed but
      should take into account on-site constraints, infrastructure capabilities, and design and
      aesthetic factors.
Local Business/Professional.         This category allows a mixture of limited commercial
development and office-professional uses to serve the needs of the resident population. Local
retail uses are allowed, as are office-professional uses that cater to the needs of the community.
Residential development is also considered a permissible use. Mixed-use developments
combining residential and commercial/professional uses are also permitted. Residential uses are
encouraged with commercial uses requiring a conditional use permit.
Commercial/Tourist Corridor. The principal permitted uses of this category are visitor-serving
facilities such as hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, museums, specialty shops, and beach­
related retail uses. Other non-visitor-serving facilities (including service and residential uses) are
also permitted, subject to a conditional use permit. Non-visitor-serving uses shall not exceed 50
% of the gross floor area of the entire structure and shall be located above the ground floor level.
Central Business District. The CBD represents the commercial as well as physical, economic,
and social center of the community. In keeping with the diversity of land use within the CBD, a
broad range of commercial uses is permitted in this category. These uses may include financial
institutions and government buildings, tourist-related businesses such as specialty shops,
theaters, restaurants, retail clothing stores, drug stores, and professional offices. Visitor-serving
and residential uses shall be conditional uses. However, in the area designated CBD seaward of
Pacific Coast Highway, visitor-serving uses shall be the principal uses. All other uses of the
CBD shall be conditional uses in this location.
Industrial. This category refers to the industrial or manufacturing base of the City and allows a
mixture of light and heavy industrial uses as defined in the Municipal Code. Residential uses are
prohibited, except for "artists-in-residence" activities.
Public/Institutional. This category refers to the community's public and educational facilities.
These facilities include government buildings and public facilities, public festivals, public and
private schools, libraries, police and fire stations, special needs housing, charitable uses, and
recreational uses.
Public Recreation and Parks.        Lands designated for public recreation are those owned and
maintained by the City, County, or State and developed for active or passive recreational
activity. These park facilities are distributed throughout the community, with neighborhood
parks principally serving the needs of local residents and oceanfront beach parks performing a
more regional function . (Unclassified beaches and tidelands are designated as Public Recreation
                                               6-4 	                                  Draft 10-14-09

 and Parks.)
 Open Space. This category is intended to preserve land in its natural state for open-space
 purposes. Lands within this category are typified by special ecological, wildlife, or scientific
 study potential and are areas of topographical, geological, and historical importance. Passive
 recreational uses such as walking and hiking are encouraged in appropriate areas. Additional
 low-impact passive uses may be permitted, subject to a conditional use permit, where the City
 Council finds that those uses will not conflict with the open-space uses described above and will
 not have a significant effect on the environment. Compatible support facilities may also be
 allowed subject to a conditional use permit.
Permanent Open Space. This category of land uses is intended to protect and preserve publicly
owned open-space lands of ecological, scenic, cultural, and/or scientific value so that such lands
remain a permanent community resource. Lands designated Permanent Open Space must be
zoned as either "Open Space/Conservation" or "Open SpacelPassive." Uses permitted on lands
within this General Plan land use designation are greenbelts, watershed areas, wildlife preserves
and marine preserves. For those lands zoned Open Space/Passive the following additional us.es
are allowed: hiking trails, historical preserves, scientific study and vista points. Additional low­
impact passive uses may be permitted, subject to a conditional use permit, where the City
Council finds that those uses will not conflict with the open-space uses described above and will
not have a significant effect on the environment. Any improvements proposed for these lands
shall be subject to Planning Commission approval and shall be consistent with design objectives
and guidelines adopted by the City to ensure a minimal scenic and environmental impact from
any such improvements.
Amendments to Permanent Open Space Provisions
Until December 31, 2028, the text within the "Land Use Categories" paragraph of this Section 6
of the General Plan Land Use Element, entitled "Permanent Open Space," and added to the
General Plan by Ordinance No. 1342, may be amended or repealed only by the voters of the City
of Laguna Beach in a City election.
Until December 31, 2028, the lands designated "Permanent Open Space" by the Laguna Beach
Open Space Initiative adopted in 1998 may be re-designated to another land use category only by
the voters of the City of Laguna Beach in a City election.
                                              6-5                                    Draft 10-14-09

          GOALS, POLICIES, ACTIONS AND 

             IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM 

The first six sections of this element describe the current and projected characteristics of the City and the
land use categories that describe the use and intensity of development. These projections raise a number
of issues that are addressed by the land use goals and policies established in this section. Additional
issues and policies have been included as a result of citizen participation. These policies are of central
importance because, in addition to representing the goals and priorities of the community, they function
as regulations by which development projects will be measured. Zone changes and subdivision maps, for
example, cannot be approved unless they are consistent with the policies in this section. This section also
outlines the implementation/action of goals and policies. The City's adoption of the Land Use Element is
a commitment to carry out the goals, policies, actions, and implementation program.

Section 7: Goals, Policies, Actions, and Implementation Program
While the policies of the General Plan establish the actions and requirements necessary to direct
land use in the City, they must be implemented by detailed measures that collectively form the
implementation program. Without these specific implementation measures, the General Plan
cannot be effective as a commitment to future action.
The City's Land Use Element includes actions that range from measures necessary to ensure
consistency between the City's General Plan and zoning to those required to fulfill the policies in
the plan. The actions include an implementation time frame of short-term (1-3 years), medium­
term (3-5 years), and long-term (5+ years).
GOAL 1: 	       Create a community that is sustainable, resilient, and regenerative.
Intent - The City is committed to meeting its ongoing needs without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet their own needs. The City recognizes the magnitude of the
threat that climate change poses. The City can move toward sustainability and a reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions by the way it manages land development and building construction,
conserves habitats and natural resources, provides efficient transportation and mobility
systems, and develops its infrastructure and public services. Sites should be planned,
buildings designed, and infrastructure developed to reduce the consumption of energy, water,
and raw materials, generation of waste, and use oftoxic and hazardous substances.
Policy 1.1 	   Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 (also
               refer to Goal 7).
               Action 1.1.1 Protect natural assets and open-space areas to maintain their role as
               "carbon sinks." (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
               Action 1.1.2 Revise and update the Transportation, Circulation, and Growth
               Management Element and continue to encourage and promote the use of mass
               transit and other high-occupancy vehicles, bicycling                walking, and
               telecommuting as a means to reduce the City'S greatest local contributor to global
               warming. (Short-term implementation.)
               Action 1.1.3 Create a Sustainability/Conservation Element with policies that
               promote energy and resource efficiency, water efficiency, conservation, recycling,
               and the protection of ground and surface waters. (Short-term implementation.)
               Action 1.1.4 Support technology and business practices that enable people to
               reduce vehicle miles traveled from home to work. These include the use of home
               office and technology such as wireless communication and video conferencing.
               (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
               Action 1.1.5 Support State and/or Federal action to implement vehicle emission
               standards that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (Ongoing implementation
               - short-to-Iong-term.)
                                            7-2 	                                          2-7-12

            Action 1.1.6 Evaluate and consider eliminating or significantly reducing the cost 

            of parking permits for fuel-efficient or alternative-fuel vehicles. (Medium-term 

            implementation.) 

            Action 1.1.7 Make fuel efficiency and clean air important criteria in the 

            acquisition of all city vehicles, including fire engines, buses, trucks, etc., and for 

            non-specialty uses consider instituting a policy of purchasing only highly fuel­

            efficient or alternative-fuel vehicles. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long­
            term.) 

            Action 1.1.8 Continue to offer incentives to businesses that encourage employees 

            to use buses, bikes, and carpools (or vanpools) to commute to work. Facilitate 

           telecommuting and/or allow employees to work extended hours for fewer days 

           per week. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long-term.) 

           Action 1.1.9 Maintain the existing free trolley/bus service and pursue extension

GOAL 2: 	       Preserve, enhance and respect the unique character and identity of Laguna's
                residential neighborhoods.
Intent - The residential neighborhoods of Laguna Beach are diverse in housing design and
are characterized by a strong neighborhood identity. Styles range from traditional to
contemporary, with a majority of neighborhoods being of an eclectic mix. Pressures for
development created by Laguna Beach's spectacular coastal and hillside settings and
consistently high property values are perceived as creating cumulatively negative aesthetic and
other impacts on these unique neighborhoods. In response to such impacts, Goal 2 sets forth
policies and actions to preserve, enhance, and respect the character and identity that make
Laguna Beach a highly desirable community in which to live through actions such as 1)
amending zoning ordinances, including the implementation of long-term anti-mansionization
standards; 2) changing the Design Review guidelines and process; 3) encouraging the
preservation of historic residences; and 4) strengthening the Landscape and Scenic Highways
Resource Document.
Policy 2.1 	    Maintain the diversity and uniqueness of individual neighborhoods. Development
               standards and design review guidelines shall minimize the scale and bulk of new
               construction and/or renovation and require development to be compatible with the
               surrounding residences.
               Action 2.1.1 Evaluate the adopted building envelope and lot coverage standards
               and amend as necessary to ensure that the building scale of proposed development
               is compatible in scale and mass with surrounding residences. Methods to be
               investigated include, but are not necessarily limited to, a revised building site
               coverage standard, floor area ratios, volumetrics (cubic feet), plate height
               limitations (floor-to-ceiling height limits), and maximum residence size. (Short­
               to-medium-term implementation.)
               Action 2.1.2 Implement the long-term anti-mansionization policies and standards
               adopted on September 24, 2002. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
               Action 2.1.3 Evaluate and, if necessary, reduce the allowable site coverage on lots
               over 8,000 square feet to ensure compatibility with existing developed building
               sites in the neighborhoods. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
Policy 2.2 	   Encourage the preservation of historically significant residential structures and
               protect the character-defining components of Laguna Beach's traditional
               neighborhoods.
               Action 2.2.1 Update the City's Historic Resource Inventory.            (Short-term
               implementation.)
               Action 2.2.2 Receive an annual report from the Heritage Committee regarding
               preservation issues related to historically significant structures and amend
               preservation policies and ordinances as necessary to address identified issues.
               (Short-to-Iong-term implementation.) (Same as Action 3.3.1.)
                                             7-5 	                                         2-7-12

           Action 2.2.3 Adopt incentives to preserve residential structures that contribute to
           the cultural and/or architectural character and heritage of the community. (Short­
           to-medium-term implementation.)
Policy 2.3 Preserve and enhance the qualities that contribute to the character of the
           residential community, including quiet neighborhoods, pedestrian use of streets,
           and appropriate levels of illumination and nighttime activity and seek to mitigate
           the effects of high-volume thru-traffic.
           Action 2.3.1 Continue to evaluate construction-related impacts upon residential
           neighborhoods through the Design Review process and mitigate such impacts
           using methods such as, but not necessarily limited to, the adoption of staging
           plans and noise and dust mitigation. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
           Action 2.3.2 Adopt a lighting ordinance to minimize potential impacts on night
           views and ambiance. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
           Action 2.3.3 Evaluate the Noise Ordinance periodically to ensure that
           neighborhood noise impacts, including construction nOIse, are minimized.
           (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long-term.)
           Action 2.3.4 Investigate streets cape improvements, street design, and regulations
           that will help reduce the speed and negative impacts of traffic on residential
           streets. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
           Action 2.3.5 Modify the Corridor Progression Traffic Analysis Model thresholds 

           to accurately reflect the unique nature of the City's residential streets. (Ongoing 

           implementation.) 

           (Same as Action 8.2.3) 

Policy 2.4 Create specific plans or overlay zones to address design issues related to new
           construction and remodels in individual neighborhoods where a majority of
           property owners desire standards that maintain and enhance neighborhood
           character.
           Action 2.4.1 Investigate methods to encourage neighborhoods to establish overlay
           zones or special development standards to address neighborhood-specific
           development impacts. (Short-to-long-term implementation.)
Policy 2.S Encourage the use of variable · setbacks and building heights and innovative
           construction techniques, such as green building technology.
Policy 2.6 Require the preservation of significant trees in conjunction with development
           proposals. The Design Review Board may grant exceptions to this provision
           when its strict enforcement would deny a property owner reasonable use of
           hislher property.
                                         7-6                                            2-7-12

               Action 2.6.1 Update the City's Landscape and Scenic Highways Resources 

               Document and adopt it as an element of the General Plan. (Short-term 

               implementation.) 

               (Same as Actions 2.B.l and 3.9.1.) 

Policy 2.7 	   Evaluate the impact of proposed development on hillsides and along ridgelines
               and require building design, location, and arrangement to avoid continuous and
               intrusive impacts on hillside view areas and skyline profiles.
Policy 2.8 	  Require building design and siting to be compatible and integrated with natural
              topographic features, minimize significant alteration of natural topography and/or
              other significant onsite resources, and protect public views as specified in the
              Design Guidelines and the Landscape and Scenic Highways Resource Document.
              Action 2.8.1 Update the City'S Landscape and Scenic Highways Resources 

              Document and adopt it as an element of the General Plan. (Short-term 

              implementation.) 

              (Same as Actions 2.6.1 and 3.9.1.) 

              Action 2.8.2 Establish criteria for placement of new development on the most 

              suitable area of the lot to maximize the preservation of sensitive resources. (Same 

              as Action 3.10.1) 

Policy 2.9 	  Require the use of appropriate landscaping, special architectural treatments,
              and/or siting considerations to protect public views for projects visible from major
              highways and arterial streets.
Policy 2.10 	 Maximize the preservation of coastal and canyon views (consistent with the
              principle of view equity) from existing properties and minimize blockage of
              existing public and private views. Best efforts should be made to site new
              development in locations that minimize adverse impacts on views from public
              locations (e.g., roads, bluff top trails, visitor-serving facilities, etc.).
              Action 2.10.1 Discourage the addition of second stories in established
              neighborhoods where view equity has historically been achieved through one­
              story construction. (Short-to-long-term implementation.)
              Action 2.10.2 Ensure that the Design Guidelines sufficiently protect public views.
              (Short-to-long-term implementation.)

GOAL 3:          Preserve, enhance, and respect the unique, small-scale village character and
individual identity of Laguna Beach's commercial areas.
Intent - Laguna Beach's commercial areas are predominantly low-scale, which contributes to
the pedestrian-oriented street environment. The village charm ofLaguna Beach is a character
that community members have long worked to preserve and enhance. An example of such a
preservation technique is the Downtown Specific Plan, adopted in 1989 to preserve the
"village atmosphere." The following policies apply to all commercial areas of the City and
encourage compatibility of uses, the creation of small businesses, pedestrian orientation and
access, art-related uses, enhanced and appropriate landscaping, and the preservation of
historically significant commercial structures.
Policy 3.1 	    Promote development that is compatible with the pedestrian-oriented village
                character of the downtown (e.g., small lot sizes and height limitations).
                Action 3.1.1 Consider adopting appropriate incentives for small commercially
                zoned lots to encourage a continuation of historic development patterns of small
                buildings on small lots. Examples of such incentives could include relaxed
                parking and setback standards. (Medium-term implementation.)
Policy 3.2 	    Encourage expansion of the village character, as defined in the Downtown
                Specific Plan, to other commercial areas of the City.
                Action 3.2.1 Consider adopting design standards appropriate for commercial 

                areas outside the downtown. (Medium-to-long-term implementation.) 

                (Same as Action 3.4.1) 

Policy 3.3 	    Encourage the preservation of historically significant buildings and protect the
                character-defining components of Laguna Beach's commercial neighborhoods.
                (Similar to Policy 2.2.)
                Action 3.3.1 Receive an annual report from the Heritage Committee regarding
                preservation issues related to historically significant structures and amend
                preservation policies and ordinances as necessary to address identified issues.
                (Short-to-long-term implementation.) 

                (Same as Action 2.2.2) 

                Action 3.3.2 Develop City incentives to preserve significant/special commercial
                buildings in Laguna Beach. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
                Action 3.3.3 Consider the establishment of a land trust or other mechanism to
                purchase historically significant and special commercial structures.
Policy 3.4 	    Ensure that development standards and design review guidelines result in
                commercial development that is compatible in scale and design with the
                surrounding and immediate area, including commercial and residential structures
                and neighborhoods.
                                              7- 8	                                       2-7-12
             Action 3.4.1 Consider adopting design standards appropriate for commercial
             areas outside the downtown. (Medium-to-Iong-term implementation.)
             (Same as Action 3.2.1.)
Policy 3.5   Promote safe and adequate pedestrian access to and within commercial areas.
             Action 3.5.1 Evaluate the adequacy and safety of sidewalks and pedestrian
             circulation in commercial zones and amend policies and standards as necessary.
             (Medium-term implementation.)
Policy 3.6   Encourage creation of public spaces and sidewalk areas as part of new
            development and major remodels. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong­
            term.)
Policy 3.7  Encourage retention and attraction of small businesses throughout the community.
            Action 3.7.1 Consider funding of an in-house or contract Economic Development
            Director position to retain, attract, and create conditions favoring small businesses
            that contribute to the village character of the downtown and other commercial
            areas. (Medium-to-Iong-term implementation.)
            Action 3.7.2 Evaluate the impact of combining suites in existing buildings on the
            retention and attraction of small businesses. If necessary, adopt guidelines
            regulating the practice. (Short-term implementation.)
Policy 3.8  Encourage pedestrian access and orientation in all commercial areas.
Policy 3.9  Maintain the landscape guidelines set forth in the City's Landscape and Scenic
            Highways Resource Document.
            Action 3.9.1 Update the City's Landscape and Scenic Highways Resources
            Document and         adopt it as an element of the General Plan. (Short-term
            implementation.)
            (Same as Actions 2.6.1 and 2.8.1.)
Policy 3.10 Require building design and siting to be compatible and integrated with natural
            topographic features, minimize significant alteration of natural topography or
            other significant on-site resources, and protect public views as specified in the
            Design Guidelines and Landscape and Scenic Highways Resource Document by
            maintaining the low-profile character of structures. Require use of appropriate
            landscaping, special architectural treatments, and siting considerations for projects
            visible from major highways and arterial streets. Best efforts should be made to
            site new development in locations that minimize adverse impacts on views from
            public locations (e.g., roads, bluff-top trails, visitor-serving facilities, etc.).
                                           7-9                                                  2-7-12

 GOAL 4:        Recognizing that Laguna Beach is a worldwide visitor destination, enhance
 the visitor experience while maximizing protection of the community's coastal and other
 natural resources.
 Intent - The increasing number of visitors to Laguna Beach requires the protection of the
 community's sensitive coastal and other natural resources. The intent of the following
policies and actions is to enhance the visitor experience along the coast, while minimizing
 impacts on Laguna Beach's natural resources. The primary method of implementing this
goal is through development of a Coastal Resources Protection Program. Elements of such a
program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 1) Potential rezoning of
designated areas adjaceJlt to the coast to provide visitor-serving uses that include a mix of
 commercial uses and public services and facilities. Potential sites would be designated based
on their potential to accommodate high levels of visitor traffic with minimal impact on
 sensitive coastal resources and minimal effects on neighboring land uses. The intent of
potential rezoning would be to serve the City's increasing l1umber of beach visitors and
el1hance coastal access, while redirecting beach activity from locations identified as more
environmentally sensitive to less sensitive beach areas. 2) Ongoing coastal resource protection
through enforcement al1d public education. 3) Potential impact fee on new visitor-serving
land uses benefiting from visitor activity that would help offset costs associated with protecting
coastal resources from the increasing number ofcommunity visitors. 4) Identification ofa site
for development ofa Coastal Resources Interpretive Center.
Policy 4.1 	   Develop and adopt a program to protect sensitive coastal resources.
               Action 4.1.1 Compile an inventory of the City'S coastal resources and prepare a
               Coastal Resources Protection Program. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
               Action 4.1.2 Evaluate and, if appropriate, adopt a program to rezone and
               encourage redevelopment of properties in specified areas of the coast to better
               provide public coastal access while protecting sensitive coastal resource areas.
               (Medium-to-long-term implementation.)
               Action 4.1.3 Evaluate and, if appropriate, establish a fair-share impact fee for
               land uses and development benefiting from visitor activity for the purpose of
               offsetting costs related to the Coastal Resources Protection Program. (Medium­
               to-long-term implementation.)
               Action 4.1.4 Update the Open Space Conservation Element to address the
               proposed Coastal Resources Protection Program and update the City's resource
               maps. (Medium-to-long-term implementation.)
Policy 4.2 	   Promote policies to accommodate visitors, reduce conflicts between Vlsltor­
               serving uses/infrastructure and residents, and reduce impacts on the City's natural
               resources.
               Action 4.2.1 Prepare a Coastal Resources Protection Program that includes
               policies to accommodate visitors, reduce conflicts between visitor-serving
                                             7 - 11 	                                      2-7-12

            uses/infrastructure and neighborhoods/residents, and reduce impacts on the City's
            natural resources (e.g., potentially provide shuttles from satellite parking areas
            and visitor destinations that group facilities such as shops/restaurants/restrooms
            and establish methods to ensure that designated beach access points and street
            ends are safe, welcoming and pedestrian-friendly).            (Medium-to-long-term
            implementation.)
            Action 4.2.2 Enforce State's Marine Life Management Act and identified Marine
            Life Protected areas within the City and local regulations for the protection of
            marine life and intertidal resources and to conduct educational and outreach
            programs. (Medium-to-long-term implementation.)
            Action 4.2.3 Support a volunteer docent program by a nonprofit organization to
           provide public coastal resources education.                    (Medium-to-long-term
            implementation.)
            Action 4.2.4 Evaluate and, if considered desirable and feasible, designate a site
           for a Coastal Resources Interpretive Center.                   (Medium-to-long-term
           implementation.)
           Action 4.2.5 Plan and develop a peripheral parking program to increase mass
           transit access to Laguna Beach's visitor-serving beaches and other amenities. The
           peripheral parking program shall include an investigation of the concept of shared
           parking, such as the use of public parking lots and underutilized private parking
           lots that could serve as peripheral parking locations. The implementation of such
           a program would require a coastal development permit. (Medium-term
           implementation.)
           (Same as Action 8.4.7)
Policy 4.3 Maintain and enhance access to coastal resource areas, particularly the designated
           public beaches, by ensuring that access points are safe, attractive, and pedestrian­
           friendly.
           Action 4.3.1 Continue to pursue dedication and acceptance of beach access and
           other offers-to-dedicate throughout the City. The City shall maintain an inventory
           of public access and open space dedication or offers-to-dedicate to ensure such
           areas are known to the public and are protected through the coastal development
           permit process. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long-term.)
           (Same as Action 6.9.1)
           Action 4.3.2 Maintain and improve public pedestrian access to and along beaches
           and oceanfront bluff using public rights-of-way and public easements. Protect,
           and where feasible, formalize, continued public use over areas used historically
           by the public (i.e. public prescriptive rights) to gain access to and along beaches,
           oceanfront bluffs, and other recreational areas. (Ongoing implementation - short­
           to-long-term.)
                                        7 - 12                                           2-7-12

 Action 4.3.3 Discourage the use of unimproved public accessways to coastal
 areas by vehicles unless necessary for reasons of public safety. (Short-to-Iong­
term implementation.)
Action 4.3.4 All beach amenities available to the general public on the City's
public beaches (including those owned and operated by the City and County) shall
be available to all members of the general public on an equal basis. A reservation
system for public beach amenities may not be established by private entities.
(Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
Action 4.3.5 Maintain a range of parking fees at public beaches and parks, in
order to maximize public access and recreation opportunities. Changes to existing
time limits or hours of operation and substantial changes to parking fees which
have the potential to change the intensity of public use of the beach or public
access to the ocean shall require a Coastal Development Permit. (Ongoing
implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
Action 4.3.6 A public beach closure/curfew cannot apply to the area of Coastal
Commission original jurisdiction (State tidelands, submerged lands and public
trust lands) including but not necessarily limited to the area seaward of the mean
high tide line. Public access to the water's edge and at least 20 feet inland of the
wet sand of all beaches shall be permitted at all times. Closure to public use of
any portion of the beach inland of the mean high tide line is not encouraged and
requires a coastal development permit which must maintain the public's right to
gain access to State tidelands. Measures that limit public use of the beach shall be
limited to those necessary to address documented public safety events that cause a
risk or hazard to the general public and shall be the minimum necessary to address
the potential risk or hazard to the general public. The need for continuation of
safety measures that limit public access shall be reassessed on a periodic basis to
assure maximum public access is provided. (Ongoing implementation - short-to­
long-term.)
                             7 - 13                                          2-7-12 


GOALS: 	        Promote compatibility among land uses in the community.
Intent - Laguna Beach has a varied mix of land uses in close proximity to one another. For
example, residential zones abut commercial and light industrial zones and building sites abut
sensitive open space, creating the potential for incompatible land uses. Spillover parking from
commercial areas negatively impacts some residential neighborhoods. Pressures to develop
larger structures in all areas of the City have resulted in negative aesthetic and other impacts
upon the community. In order to counteract the negative effects and avert future conflicts
among land uses, the following policies and actions address the need to evaluate and, where
appropriate, amend zoning standards and consider rezoning areas that are incompatible,
establish compatibility guidelines for new development and subdivisions, and consider the
adoption ofneighborhood parking programs.
Policy 5.1 	   Establish standards and review procedures to ensure that infill development
               and/or redevelopment is neighborhood-compatible.
               Action 5.1.1 Improve design guidelines and review procedures to more
               effectively     evaluate    development      projects.      (Short-to-medium-term
               implementation.)
               Action 5.1.2 	 Develop policies to mitigate short-term construction impacts.
               (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
               Action 5.1.3 Promote preservation of historic structures and adaptive reuse of
               existing buildings. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
Policy 5.2 	   Ensure that all new development, including subdivisions and the creation of new
               building sites and remodels that involve building additions, is adequately
               evaluated to ascertain potential negative impacts on natural resources and adjacent
               development, emphasizing impact avoidance over impact mitigation. Required
               mitigation should be located on-site rather than off-site. Any off-site mitigation
               should be located within the City's boundaries and in close proximity to the
               project.
               (Similar to Policies 7.4 and 10.3.)
Policy 5.3 	   Evaluate and, if necessary, modify the commercial parking standards for new
              development and/or changes of use, especially when such occurrences impact
              adjacent residential or visitor-serving areas.
Policy 5.4 	  Preserve and maintain the residential character and livability of neighborhoods
              adjacent to commercial districts and/or individual businesses by regulating and
              minimizing impacts from commercial activities, including but not necessarily
              limited to deliveries, amplified music, light trespass, alcohol-related impacts, and
              employee or valet parking. Establishment of any new preferential parking
              districts in the coastal zone shall be prohibited.
                                             7 - 14 	                                      2-7-12
             Action 5.4.1 lnvestigate, fonnulate, and implement solutions to problems created
             in residential areas related to entertainment and alcohol service in adjacent
             commercial areas. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
Policy 5.5 	 Preserve and maintain the residential character and livability of neighborhoods
             adjacent to industrial districts by regulating and minimizing impacts from
             industrial activities, including but not necessarily limited to smoke, odor, dust and
             dirt, glare, and noise.
             Action 5.5.1 Evaluate and, if feasible, rezone Laguna Canyon to resolve issues
             related to incompatible land uses. (Long-term implementation.)
Policy 5.6 	 Consider conflicts and recognize the value of existing light industrial uses when
             considering the approval of potential uses that may not be compatible (e.g.,
             location of artists' live/work units adjacent to an existing industrial use).
                                           7 - 15 	                                        2-7-12 

GOAL 6: 	      Provide a diversity of land uses that enhance the community.
Intent - Laguna Beach currently provides a diverse mix of land uses. The following policies
are designed to encourage a broad range of uses that will benefit community members and
visitors. The various uses promoted include 1) resident-serving businesses; 2) rental housing;
3) low- and moderate-income housing; 4) artists' live/work units; 5) recreational and
conservation lands; 6) retention ofa local hospital; and 7) mixed-use development.
Policy 6.1 	   Promote, encourage and retain resident-serving businesses throughout the
               commercial zones of the community.
               Action 6.1.1 Establish incentives to encourage retention and attraction of
               resident-serving businesses. (Medium-to-Iong-term implementation.)
Policy 6.2 	   Preserve and encourage an increase of the City's stock of affordable motel and
               hotel rooms available for short-term visitors. Protect, encourage, and where
               feasible provide, affordable overnight accommodations.
               Action 6.2.1 Continue to enforce existing ordinances and coastal policies that
               limit changes in use of existing hotels and motels to preserve visitor-serving uses.
               Action 6.2.2 Investigate and, if appropriate, amend the Municipal Code to ensure
               that affordable hotels and motels are maintained for short-term visitor occupancy.
               A method to define whether a facility providing overnight accommodation is low,
              moderate, or high cost shall be evaluated as part of the investigation. Establish
              standards that would require new high-cost visitor accommodations provide
              affordable overnight accommodation or pay an "in-lieu" fee.                 (Ongoing
              implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
              Action 6.2.3 Maintain an inventory of the number of existing motel and hotel
              rooms and room rates. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
              Action 6.2.4 Any hotel/motel rooms for which a certificate of occupancy has
              been issued on or before the effective date of adoption of this Land Use Element
              shall not be permitted to convert to a Limited Use Overnight Visitor
              Accommodation. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-Iong-term.)
Policy 6.3 	  Prohibit Limited Use Overnight Visitor Accommodation such as timeshare,
              condo-hotel, and fractional ownership projects. (Ongoing implementation - short­
              to-long-term.)
              Action 6.3.1 Monitor the actions and policies of the California Coastal
              Commission concerning condominium-hotel (condo-hotel) projects and other
              Limited Use Overnight Visitor Accommodations. (Ongoing implementation.)

              households, including City employees.
                                            7 - 16 	                                         2-7-12

            Action 6.4.1 Explore housing solutions that include public/private partnerships.
            (Short-to-long-term implementation.)
            Action 6.4.2 Investigate, fonnulate, and implement siting of emergency shelters,
            transitional housing and supportive housing in compliance with Senate Bill 2.
            (Short-term implementation.)
Policy 6.5  Create neighborhood pocket parks and community gardens.
            Action 6.5.1 Identify sites that are appropriate for pocket parks and/or community
           gardens, including an evaluation of City-owned sites for such use. Continue to
           transfonn vacant lots and unused and/or underutilized public land (including
           excess rights-of-way) into pocket parks with benches, bike racks, shade trees, and
           patios with tables to accommodate pedestrians and bicycle riders. (Ongoing
           implementation - short-to-long-term.)
           Action 6.5.2 Create an incentive program to purchase property to create
           neighborhood parks and community gardens. (Medium-term implementation.)

           irrigation whenever possible. (Medium-term implementation.)
Policy 6.6 Preserve and promote an increase in the stock of residential rental units in the
           City.
           Action 6.6.1. Consider establishing development incentives, such as relaxed open
           space and setback requirements, to maintain higher, nonconfonning density in
           older, nonconfonning multi-family residences.                 (Short-to-medium-term
           implementation.)
           Action 6.6.2 Evaluate increasing the allowable residential square footage within
           mixed-use developments and create incentives to encourage residential
           development above the street level in commercial zones. (Short-to-medium-term
           implementation.)
Policy 6.7 Continue to increase the City ' s stock of recreational and conservation properties.
           Action 6.7.1 Continue and enhance the City policy of purchasing land for public
           uses through budgeted open-space acquisition funds, tax sales, and other
           opportunities such as donations and grants. (Medium-term implementation.)
Policy 6.8 Require the dedication and improvement of public trail easements as a condition
           of development approval whenever possible.
                                         7 - 17                                          2-7-12
Policy 6.9 	   Provide public access to designated public areas wherever safe and legally and
               environmentally appropriate.
               Action 6.9.1 Continue to pursue dedication and acceptance of beach access and 

               other offers-to-dedicate throughout the City. (Ongoing implementation - short­
               to-long-term.) 

               (Same as Action 4.3.1.) 

              Action 6.9.2 Maintain an inventory of open space dedications or offers-to­
              dedicate to ensure such areas are known to the public and are protected through
              the coastal development permit process. (Ongoing implementation - short-to­
              long-term.)
              Action 6.9.3      Where feasible, identify possible segments for inclusion in the
              California Coastal Trail (CCT) system and provide signage incorporating the
              State adopted CCT logo. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long-term.)
              Action 6.9.4 Work with private landowners and acquire public access rights
              necessary to provide a trail connection to the coast from Aliso Creek Regional
              Park for connectivity to the CCT. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long­
              term.)
              Action 6.9.5 Encourage municipal           land acqUISItIons, trail design, and
              development to provide a public access connection to the coast from Laguna
              Coast Wilderness Park for connectivity to the CCT. (Ongoing implementation ­
              short-to-long-term.)
              Action 6.9.6 Pursue improvements of CCT "missing links" to provide safe
              pedestrian and bicycle access adjacent to State Highway 1 between the cities of
              Laguna Beach and Dana Point. (Ongoing implementation - short-to-long-term.)
Policy 6.10 	 Support retention of a full-service, acute-care hospital offering emergency
              services in Laguna Beach.
Policy 6.11 	 Maintain a locally held fanners' market.

              encourage the provision of lower-cost housing and to reduce traffic trips.
              Encourage ground floor uses to be commercial and where appropriate, visitor
              serving.
              Action 6.12.1 Evaluate incentives for the development of affordable residential
              units in conjunction with mixed-use development in commercial zones.
              (Medium-to-long-term implementation.)
                                           7 - 18 	                                     2-7-12

Policy 6.13 	 Prohibit all residential condominium conversions and new residential
              condominiums on sites previously occupied by rental housing unless an equal
              number of rental units of comparable square footage and number of bedrooms are
              provided in the City during the same time as the conversion. Artists' live/work
              units shall not replace residential rental units. Under no circumstances shall a
              conversion be allowed that does not comply with existing development standards.
              (Long-term implementation.)
Policy 6.14 	 Encourage art-related uses and art in public places in appropriate zones.
              Action 6.13.1 Develop incentives to encourage art-related uses and public art

                                          7 - 19 	                                      2-7-12 

GOAL 7: 	       Protect, preserve, and enhance the community's natural resources.
Intent - Having an abundance of scenic coastal, hillside, and canyon areas, the community
has a lengthy history of stewardship to ensure the environmental protection of its natural
resources. Long-term preservation of dedicated open space and coastal resources is of the
highest priority. Policies in both the Land Use and Open Space/Conservation Elements
require the protection and preservation of our magnificent natural resources for community
members, visitors and future generations.
Policy 7.1 	   Protect dedicated and accepted open space.
               Action 7.1.1 Ensure that the Open Space/Conservation Element includes policies
               to protect land dedicated for open space to the greatest extent. (Short-to-Iong-term
               implementation.)
Policy 7.2 	   Maintain the General Plan designation of Permanent Open Space and the Zoning
               designations of Open Space/Conservation and Open Space/Passive as a method of
               protecting natural resources.
Policy 7.3 	   Design and site new development to protect natural and environmentally sensitive
               resources, such as areas of unique scenic quality, public views, and visual
               compatibility with surrounding uses and to minimize natural landform alterations.
               (Sane as Policy JO. 2.)
               Action 7.3.1 Evaluate and, if necessary, adopt an Open Space/Conservation
               Element policy to ensure that environmentally sensitive species and/or habitat
               located within homeowners' associations are protected.                (Medium-term
               implementation.)
               Action 7.3.2 Review all applications for new development to determine potential
               threats from coastal and other hazards. (Ongoing implementation.)
               Action 7.3.3 Design and site new development to avoid hazardous areas and
              minimize risks to life and property from coastal and other hazards. (Ongoing
               implementation.)
              Action 7.3.4 Require new development to assure stability and structural integrity,
              and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or
              destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction
              of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms along bluffs
              and cliffs. (Ongoing implementation.)
              Action 7.3.5 Prohibit development on oceanfront bluff faces, except public
              improvements providing public access, protecting coastal resources, or providing
              for public safety. Permit such improvements only when no feasible alternative
              exists and when designed and constructed to minimize landform alteration of the
              oceanfront bluff face, to not contribute to further erosion of the oceanfront bluff
                                            7 - 20 	                                         2-7-12
 face, and to be visually compatible with the surrounding area to the maximum
 extent feasible. (Ongoing implementation.)
 Action 7.3.6 Require new development on oceanfront blufftop lots to incorporate
 drainage improvements, removal of and/or revisions to irrigation systems, and/or
 use of native or drought-tolerant vegetation into the design to minimize threats to
 oceanfront bluff recession. (Ongoing implementation.)
 Action 7.3.7 Require swimming pools located on oceanfront bluff properties to
 incorporate leak prevention and detection measures. (Ongoing implementation.)
 Action 7.3.8 On oceanfront bluff sites, require applications where applicable, to
 identify and remove all unpermitted and/or obsolete structures, including but not
 limited to protective devices, fences, walkways and stairways, which encroach
 into oceanfront bluffs. (Ongoing implementation.)
 Action 7.3.9 Ensure that new development, major remodels and additions to
existing structures on oceanfront and oceanfront bluff sites do not rely on existing
or future bluff/shoreline protection devices to establish geologic stability or
protection from coastal hazards. A condition of the permit for all such new
development on bluff property shall expressly require waiver of any such rights to
a new bluff/shoreline protection device in the future and recording of said waiver
on the title of the property as a deed restriction.
Action 7.3.10 Allow oceanfront and oceanfront bluff homes, commercial
structures, or other principal structures, that are legally nonconforming as to the
oceanfront and/or oceanfront bluff edge setback, to be maintained and repaired;
however, improvements that increase the size or degree of nonconformity,
including but not limited to development that is classified as a major remodel
pursuant to the definition in the Land Use Element Glossary, shall constitute new
development and cause the pre-existing nonconforming oceanfront or oceanfront
bluff structure to be brought into conformity with the LCP.
Action 7.3.11 Require all coastal development permit applications for new
development on an oceanfront or on an oceanfront bluff property subject to wave
action to assess the potential for flooding or damage from waves, storm surge, or
seiches, through a wave uprush and impact report prepared by a licensed civil
engineer with expertise in coastal processes. The conditions that shall be
considered in a wave uprush study are: a seasonally eroded beach combined with
long-term (75 years) erosion ; high tide conditions, combined with long-term (75
year) projections for sea level rise; storm waves from a 100-year event or a storm
that compares to the 1982/83 El Nino event. (Ongoing implementation.)
Action 7.3.12 Site and design new structures to avoid the need for shoreline
and/or oceanfront bluff protective devices during the economic life of the
structure (75 years). (Ongoing implementation.)
                              7 - 21                                         2-7-12
            Action 7.3.13 Limit the use of shorelinelbluff protective devices to the minimum
            required to protect existing development in danger from erosion. Site and design
            any such protective devices as far landward as possible. "Existing development"
            for purposes of this policy shall consist only of a principle structure, e.g.
            residential dwelling, required garage, or second residential unit, and shall not

             treatment for the City. (Medium-term implementation.)
            Action 9.7.2 Evaluate and encourage the use of reclaimed water. (Medium-term
            implementation.)
Policy 9.8  Avoid the extension of community facilities, roads, and other infrastructures into
            environmentally sensitive areas when surplus capacities could facilitate or
            discourage extension of new development detrimental to those areas. Avoid the
            extension of roads and other infrastructure for the support of cellular/radio
            communication towers into environmentally sensitive areas and to protect public
            coastal views whenever feasible.

GOAL 10:        Ensure that proposals for new development, subdivisions, and major
remodels are sufficiently evaluated to protect public health and safety and natural
resources.
Intent - In a community with extremely high land values and minimal developable land,
pressure has increased to develop larger buildings, including development on environmentally
sensitive lots has been increasing. Larger structures and development into environmentally
sensitive areas have the potential to create numerous impacts on the environment and
surrounding neighborhoods. Some potential impacts include 1) water quality impacts, 2) land
movemellts, 3) a decrease in safety response times on steep hillside roads during emergencies,
and 4) the potential cumulative impacts to sensitive biological and coastal resources from
which community members and visitors derive health bellefits. The following policies are
adopted to ensure that applications for new subdivisions, the creation of building sites, new
development, and major remodels are thoroughly evaluated to mitigate potential health and
safety impacts related to new development.
Policy 10.1 	   Require that all subdivisions, including parcel maps, are compatible with
               neighborhood character including building pad elevations, visual and physical
                relationships to natural topography, open space, view corridors and surrounding
               residences, and neighborhood access.
               Action 10.1.1 Require a visual impact analysis for subdivision to identify the
               buildable area or building bulk of each proposed lot to determine potential
               impacts to view corridors, visual and physical relationships to natural topography
               or scenic features, neighborhood character and compatibility, and view equity.
Policy 10.2 	  Design and site new development to protect natural and environmentally sensitive
               resources such as areas of unique scenic quality, public views, and visual
               compatibility with surrounding uses and to minimize landform alterations.
               (Same as Policy 7.3)
               Action 10.2.1 Adopt standards that require new development and related
               improvements to be located on the most suitable areas of the site so as to
               maximize safety and the preservation of sensitive resources. (Short-to-medium­
               term implementation.)
               Action 10.2.2 Evaluate the slope/density formula applied to the R-HP Residential
               Hillside Protection Zone and amend as necessary to ensure a density that is
               compatible with the topography. (Medium-term implementation.)
               Action 10.2.3 Develop criteria by which applicants shall provide a slope analysis
               to determine the best location for development on a site. (Medium-term
               implementation.)
               Action 10.2.4 Encourage open space dedication to guarantee preservation of
               natural and sensitive resources whenever appropriate. (Ongoing implementation ­
               short-to-long-term.)
                                            7 - 34 	                                       2-7-12

               Action 10.2.5 On bluff sites, require applications where applicable, to include a
               geologic/soils/geotechnical study that identifies any geologic hazards affecting the
               proposed project site, any necessary mitigation measures, and contains statements
               that the project site is suitable for the proposed development and that the
               development will be safe from geologic hazard for its economic life. For
               development on oceanfront bluffs, such reports shall include slope stability
               analyses and estimates of the long-tenn average bluff retreat/erosion rate over the
               expected life of the development. Reports are to be prepared/signed by a licensed
               professional Engineering Geologist or Geotechnical Engineer. (Medium-term
               implementation.)
               Action 10.2.6 Require all new development located on an oceanfront bluff top to
              be setback from the oceanfront bluff edge a sufficient distance to ensure stability,
               ensure that it will not be endangered by erosion, and to avoid the need for
              protective devices during the economic life of the structure (75 years). Such
               setbacks must take into consideration expected long-tenn bluff retreat over the
              next 75 years, as well as slope stability. The predicted bluff retreat shall be
              evaluated considering not only historical bluff retreat data, but also acceleration of
              bluff retreat made possible by continued and accelerated sea level rise, future
              increase in storm or EI Nino events, and any known site-specific conditions. To
              assure stability, the development must maintain a minimum factor of safety
              against landsliding of 1.5 (static) or 1.2 (pseudostatic, k=O.15 or determined
              through analysis by the geotechnical engineer) for the economic life of the
              structure.
              Action 10.2.7 Require all new development located on oceanfront bluffs to be
              sited in accordance with the stringline but not less than 25 feet from the bluff
              edge. This requirement shall apply to the principal structure and major accessory
              structures such as guesthouses and pools that require a structural foundation. The
              setback shall be increased where necessary to ensure geologic safety and stability
              of the development.
              Action 10.2.8 On oceanfront bluffs, require new minor accessory structures such
              as decks, patios and walkways that do not require structural foundations to be
              sited in accordance with stringline but not less than 10 feet from the bluff edge.
              Require accessory structures to be removed or relocated landward when
              threatened by erosion, geologic instability or other coastal hazards.
Policy 10.3 	 Ensure that all new development, including subdivisions, the creation of new
              building sites and remodels that involve building additions, is evaluated to
              ascertain potential negative impacts on natural resources, ESHA and existing
              adjacent development. Proposed development shall emphasize ESHA impact
              avoidance over impact mitigation. Any mitigation required due to an unavoidable
              negative impact should be located on-site rather than off-site, where feasible.
              Any off-site mitigation should be located within the City'S boundaries and III
              close proximity to the project.
              (Similar to Policies 7.4 and 5.2.)
                                           7 - 35 	                                          2-7-12
               Action 10.3.1 Continue preparation of initial studies, pursuant to the California
               Environment Quality Act (CEQA), for any proposed development, including
               single-family residences, located within environmentally sensitive areas.
               (Same as Action 7.4.2.)
               Action 10.3.2 Continue to require in-depth analysis of constraint issues for
               properties, especially those designated on the City's hazard maps so that the
               nature of the constraint and the best options for mitigation or avoidance will be
               considered at all stages of the approval process since these constraints may affect
               what development is appropriate for the property.
Policy 10.4 	  Implement and define "lot area" as the total area of the lot minus the area/property
              located westerly of the building setback lines as described in Section
              25.50.004(B)(1 )(2)(3) or the oceanfront bluff ('"oceanfront bluff edge" as defined
              in LCP Glossary), whichever is more restrictive.
Policy 10.5 	 Require payment of an environmental impact fee for development whenever
              mitigation is not feasible and a nexus exists.
              (Same as Policy 7.5.)
              Action 10.5.1 Adopt appropriate mitigation measures that require payment of
              environmental impact fees whenever impacts on environmental resources cannot
              be mitigated to a level of insignificance. (Short-to-medium-term implementation.)
              (Same as Action 7.5.1.)
Policy 10.6 	 Require all fuel modification to be located within the site being developed.
              Exceptions may be granted for existing legal building sites when findings can be
              made by the approval authority that other alternatives are not available and a strict
              application of this provision would endanger environmentally sensitive resources
              or deny a property owner reasonable use of an already existing legal building site.
              Fuel modification performed by private property owners cannot go beyond
              property lines without agreement by the adjacent property owners. Fuel
              modification on public land to protect existing development should be avoided
              whenever feasible; if avoidance isn't feasible, measures must be employed to
              minimize the amount offuel modification necessary on public land.
              (Similar to Policy 7.6.)
              Action 10.6.1 The development proposal should address the required fuel
              modification as part of the initial application and should integrate fuel
              modification provisions into the site plan in such a way as to minimize impact on
              existing native vegetation and areas of visual prominence. Any required thinning
              of flammable vegetation shall be conducted outside of the bird nesting season if
              feasible. Alternative means to thinning and/or removal of native vegetation for
              fire hazard management such as minimizing the building envelope, and/or siting
              of the structure( s) away from hazard areas, and/or use of fire retardant design and
              materials are preferred where feasible.
                                            7 - 36 	                                        2-7-12
               Action 10.6.2 Equivalent methods of fire risk reduction shall be determined on a
               case by-case basis by the City and may include the following, or a combination of
               the following, but are not limited to: compliance with Building Code and Fire
               Code requirements for projects; tile roof treatments; irrigated buffer zones;
               installation of masonry or other non-combustible fire resistant wall; boxed eaves;
               reduced landscaping; other alternative construction to avoid the need for
               vegetation thinning, pruning or vegetation removal.
               Action 10.6.3 No new division ofland shall be allowed which would require new
               fuel modification (e.g. vegetation removal) or new fuel breaks in environmentally
               sensitive habitat areas or on public open space or park lands to protect new
               development within the resultant lots.
               Action 10.6.4 Update the Safety Element to incorporate current fuel modification
               and fuel break practices and requirements.
Policy 10.7 	 Protect marine resources by implementing methods to mmImIze runoff from
              building sites and streets to the City's storm drain system (e.g., on-site water
              retention).
              (Same as Policy 7.7.)
              Action 10.7.1 Continue to evaluate and update criteria to minimize nonpermeable 

              hardscape improvements. (Short-term implementation.) 

              (Same as Action 7.7.1.) 

              Action 10.7.2 Periodically review the City's Water Quality Control Ordinance 

              and related policies for protecting marine resources and update as appropriate. 

              (Short-term implementation.) 

              (Same as Action 7.7.2.) 

Policy 10.8 	 A void creation of building sites that will result in significant adverse impacts on
              the community.
              Action 10.8.1 Evaluate subdivision proposals that include cul-de-sacs for
              alternative street design that may provide more efficient access and trails linking
              any potential new neighborhood to nearby areas of the community. (Medium­
              term implementation.)
              Action 10.8.2     Review the City'S Subdivision Ordinance for potential revisions
              to implement 	updated General Plan policies and provide methods to ensure
              neighborhood compatibility and to prevent significant environmental effects.
              (Medium-term implementation.)
Policy 10.9 	 Continue to prohibit the approval of newly created building sites that do not
              conform to Municipal Code standards, including the creation of flag lots.
                                            7 - 37 	                                       2-7-12

Policy 10.10 	 Prohibit lot line adjustments that are inconsistent with the Municipal Code,
               General Plan, and Subdivision Map Act. Existing building sites which maintain a
               legal nonconforming lot or lots may adjust the lot lines provided that the
               adjustment does adversely increase the extent of nonconformities.
               Action 10.10.1 Enforce existing ordinances and General Plan policies. (Ongoing
               implementation - Short-to-Iong-term.)

GOAL 11:         Proactively participate in the planning activities of regional and adjacent
 jurisdictions.
Intent - Throughout the years, Laguna Beach has been impacted by the decisions of regional
and adjacent jurisdictions. By actively participating in regional and jurisdictional planning
activities, the City is better able to educate the public and promote a positive outcome for
Laguna Beach, such as the decision by Orange County voters to deny the construction of a
commercial airport at the former El Toro Marine Base. The following policies promote
monitoring the planning activities ofregional and surrounding jurisdictions and participating
in problem-solving strategies.
Policy 11.1      Monitor the planning activities of regional entities and adjacent jurisdictions to
                 stay informed of potential development that may impact the quality of life in the
                 City of Laguna Beach.
                Action 11.1.1 Evaluate the impact of proposed changes to regional growth
                 policies and the policies and projects of adjacent jurisdictions and address
                 potential impacts. (Short-to-long-term implementation.)
Policy 11.2      Oppose the establishment of offshore oil facilities along the Orange County
                coastline.
                 (Same as Policy 7.8.)
                Action 11.2.1 Monitor the federal government's offshore oil leasing program to
                ensure that the impacts of the program on the coastal environment are known and
                considered. (Ongoing implementation ­ short-to-long-term.)

Definitions
1. 	   Action - An activity or strategy to be carried out in response to an adopted policy set forth to
       achieve a goal. Whenever possible, actions should be quantifiable and identify an
       implementation time frame.
2. 	   Affordable Overnight Accommodations - Overnight visitor facilities-including, but not
       limited to hotels, motels, campgrounds, recreational vehicle parks and hostels-that offer low
       to moderate cost accommodation rates.
3. 	   Affordable Housing - For-sale or rental housing that is made available at below-market
       prices. Income guidelines are determined on a county-by-county basis and are based on the

       housing: extremely low, very low, lower, median and moderate income. Each income
       category is adjusted based on the number of persons in the household from one to eight. To
       be affordable, housing must be rented or purchased at a cost of no more than 30% of a
       household's income (mortgage payment to include principal, interest, taxes, insurance and
       association dues).

        the proposed project.
21. 	   Capital Improvements Program (CIP) - A program established by a City and reviewed by
        its Planning Commission that schedules permanent improvements, usually for a minimum of
       five years in the future, to fit the projected fiscal capability of the local jurisdiction. The
       program generally is reviewed annually for conformance to and consistency with the General
        Plan.
22. 	  Carrying Capacity - Used in determining the potential of an area to absorb development:
        1) The level of land use, human activity, or development for a specific area that can be
       accommodated permanently without an irreversible change in the quality of air, water, land,

                                                 A-4	                                            2-7-12

        should be compatible with the eXIstmg development in the neighborhood and respect
       neighborhood character. Neighborhood character is the sum of the qualities that distinguish

31 .   Consistent with - Free from significant variation or contradiction. The various diagrams,
       text, goals, policies and programs in the General Plan must be consistent with each other, not
       contradictory or preferential. The term "consistent with" is used interchangeably with "in
       conformance with." The courts have held that the phrase "consistent with" means "in
       agreement with; harmonious with." "Conformity" means "in harmony therewith or agreeable
       to" (Sec. 58 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 21, 25 [1975]). California law requires that the General
       Plan be internally consistent and also requires consistency between a General Plan and
       implementation measures such as the Zoning Ordinance. As a general rule, an action
      program or project is consistent with the General Plan if, considering all its aspects, it will
       further the objectives and policies of the General Plan and not obstruct their attainment.
32. 	 Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs) - Restrictive limitations that may be
      placed on property and its use and usually are made as conditions of holding title or lease.
33. 	 Cumulative Impact - As used in CEQA, the total environmental impact resulting from the
      accumulated impacts of individual projects or programs over time.
34. 	 Dedication - The transfer of an interest in property by an owner or developer of private land
      for public use and the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having
      jurisdiction over the public function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks,
      open space, school sites, or other public uses often are made conditions for approval of a
      development by a City or County.
35. 	 Dedication, In lieu of - Cash payment that may be required of an owner or developer as a
      substitute for a dedication of land and is referred to as an in-lieu fee. (See "Exaction" and
       "In-Lieu Fee. ")

        California Density Bonus law for additional information.)
39. 	   Design Review - A discretionary review process adopted by the City that is intended to
        provide the following: 1) that development projects comply with the applicable standards and
        design guidelines and criteria; 2) that development projects focus on quality designs within a
        neighborhood context that results in creative design solutions for the City; 3) that
        development occur with an orderly and harmonious appearance, including associated
        facilities such as signs, landscaping and parking areas; 4) that public and private views are
       considered; 5) that public health, safety and general welfare throughout the City are
       considered; and 6) that there is effective implementation of the applicable General and
       Specific Plan policies that encourage the preservation and enhancement of the particular
       character and unique assets of the City.
40. 	  Endangered Species - A species of animal or plant whose prospects for survival and

       located on the oceanfront; 3) a City-mapped watercourse; 4) geologic conditions such as
       slide-prone formations, potentially active fault, inactive fault, landslide potential, liquefaction
       potential, and soft coastal headlands; 6) hillside slopes greater than 45%; 7) adjacent
       wildland area, which requires fuel modification; and 8) major or significant ridgelines.

INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive program for including noise
management in the planning process. It is a tool for local planners to use in achieving and
maintaining land uses that are compatible with environmental noise levels. The Noise
Element identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas of noise
impact for the purpose of developing programs to ensure that Laguna Beach residents will be
protected fkom excessive noise intrusion. The original Noise Element of the General Plan for
the City of Laguna Beach identified aircraft noise fiom Marine Corps Air Station El Toro as
the primary noise source impacting the City. The base is now closed and motor vehicle
traffic is the primary noise source in the City. Motor vehicle noise and other noise sources of
concern within the City are addressed in the goals, policies and implementation program
developed for the City.
It is important that the Noise Element be consistent with other elements of the General Plan
Of particular relevance are the Land Use and Transportation Circulation and Growth
Management Element and Housing Element. Of these, the Transportation Circulation and
Growth Management Element has the most direct effect on community noise levels. Review
 of these elements indicates that adequate consideration for noise is included and that the
Noise Element is consistent with these General Plan Elements. In particular,
the Transportation, Circulation, and Growth Management Element contains policies related
to motor vehicle noise'.
 The Noise Element follows the revised State guidelines ("General Plan Guidelines,"
 Governors Office of Planning and Research, November 1998, and Preliminary Draft of
 revised guidelines, Year 2002) and State Government Code Section 653021(f). The element
 quantifies the community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for both
 near and long-term levels of growth and traffic activity. The information will become a
 guideline for the development of land use policies to achieve compatible land uses and
 provide baseline levels and noise source identification for local noise ordinance enforcement.

The Element is divided into five sections and the Technical Appendix. Included in the
Technical Appendix is detailed data and a glossary that defines a number of key terms used
in noise assessments. The Noise Element is organized as follows:

1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND INVENTORY OF NOISE CONDITIONS
This section contains a detailed description of the current and projected noise environment
within the City. This description of the noise environment includes identification of noise
sources and noise sensitive land uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise
contour maps.
To define the noise exposure, this section of the report defines noise terminology, describes
the noise measurement results and identifies the major sources of noise in the community.
The sources of noise in Laguna Beach include: motor vehicles, aircraft overflights,
construction, commercial areas, and general neighborhood noises. To completely assess the
noise environment in the City, noise sensitive receptors must also be identified. As
mandated by the State, noise sensitive receptors include, but are not limited to, areas
containing schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term medical or mental care hcilities, or any
other land use area deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.
Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and the location of sensitive
receptors, a noise measurement survey was conducted. The survey has two functions. The
frst is to determine the existing noise levels at noise sensitive land uses. A second function
is to obtain an accurate description of the ambient noise levels in various neighborhoods
throughout the City.
Noise Contours for all of the major noise sources in Laguna Beach were developed. These
contours were based upon traffic mix, traffic levels, and street conditions such as vehicle
speed and roadway gradient. The contours are expressed in terms of the Community Noise
Equivalent Level (CNEL). The existing conditions scenario is derived fiom the most recent
traffic counts taken in the city.

1.1 Definitions
        Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness (amplitude) and frequency
       (pitch) of the sound. The standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is
       the Decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all
       eequencies, a special fi-equency-dependent rating scale has been devised to relate
       noise to human sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale (&A) performs this
       compensation by discriminating against fiequencies in a manner approximating the
        sensitivity of the human ear.
       Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale compresses the
        wide range in sound pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a manner
        similar to the way that the Richter scale is used to measure earthquakes. In terms of
       human response to noise, a sound 10 &A higher than another is judged to be twice
        as loud; and 20 dBA higher four times as loud; and so forth. Everyday sounds
        normally range fiom 30 dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very loud). Examples of various
        sound levels in different environments are shown in Exhibit 1.
       Noise has been defined as unwanted sound and it is known to have several adverse
        effects on people. From these known effects of noise, criteria have been established
        to help protect the public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human
        activities. This criteria is based on such known effects of noise on people as hearing
        loss (not generally a factor with community noise), comrnunication interference,
        sleep interference, physiological responses and annoyance. Each of these potential
        noise impacts on people are briefly discussed in the following narratives:
                  HEARING LOSS is, in general, not a concern in community noise
                 problems. The potential for noise-induced hearing loss is more
                 commonly associated with occupational noise exposures in heavy
                 industry or very noisy work environments with long-term exposure.
                  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
                 identifies a noise exposure limit of 90 dBA for 8 hours per day to
                 protect fiom hearing loss. Noise levels in neighborhoods, even in
                 very noisy airport environments near major international airports, is
                 not sufficiently loud to cause hearing loss. It is significant to note
                  that in recent years hearing loss is being caused more and more by
                 recreational exposure to noise, such as off-road vehicle riding, loud
                 music, target and skeet shooting, etc.

               COMMUNICATION INTERFERENCE is one of the primary concerns in
               environmental noise problems. Communication interference includes
               speech interference and activities such as watching television.
               Normal conversational speech is in the range of 60 to 65 dBA and
               any noise in this range or louder may interfere with speech. There are
               specific methods of describing speech interference as a fbction of
               distance between speaker and listener and voice level.
               SLEEP INTERFERENCE is a major noise concern in noise assessment
               and, of course, is most critical during nighttime hours. Sleep
               disturbance is one of the major causes of annoyance due to
               community noise. Noise can make it difficult to fall asleep, create
               momentary disturbances of natural sleep patterns by causing shifts
               from deep to lighter stages and cause awakening. Noise may even
               cause awakening, which a person may or may not be able to recall.
               Extensive research has been conducted on the effect of noise on sleep
               disturbance. Recommended values for desired sound levels in
               residential bedroom space range fiom 25 to 45 dBA. The lower noise
               level recommendations are generally for continuous noise sources
               such as heating and ventilating systems and the higher part of the
               recommended range is for intermittent noise such as outdoor noise
               event intrusion into the sleeping area.
               PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES are those measurable effects of noise
               on people, which are realized as changes in pulse rate, blood pressure,
               etc. While such effects can be induced and observed, the extent is not
               known to which these physiological responses cause harm or are sign
               of harm. Generally, physiological responses are a reaction to a loud
               short term noise such as a rifle shot or a very loud jet overflight.
               ANNOYANCE is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe.
               Annoyance is a very individual characteristic and can vary widely
               from person to person. What one person considers tolerable can be
               quite unbearable to another of equal hearing capability. The level of
               annoyance, of course, depends on the characteristics of the noise (i.e.;
               loudness, frequency spectra, time, and duration), and how much
               activity interference (e-g. speech interference and sleep interference)
               results fiom the noise. However, the level of annoyance is also a
               function of the attitude of the receiver. Personal sensitivity to noise
               varies widely. It has been estimated that 2 to 10 percent of the
LAGUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                              Page 8
               population is highly susceptible to noise not of their own making,
               while approximately 20 percent are unaffected by noise. Attitudes
               are affected by the relationship between the person and the noise
               source. (Is it our dog barking or the neighbor's dog?) Whether we
               believe that someone is trying to abate the noise will also affect our
               level of annoyance.
       Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with time. Under
       conditions of non-steady state noise, some type of statistical metric is necessary in
       order to quantify noise exposure over a long period of time. Several rating scales
       have been developed for describing the effects of noise on people. They are
       designed to account for the above known effects of noise on people.
       These scales are: the Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night Noise Level
       (LDN), and the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). These scales are
       described in the following paragraphs.
                LEQ is the "energy" average noise level during the time period of the
                sample. It is a number that represents a decibel sound level. This constant
                sound level would contain an equal amount of energy as a fluctuating sound
               level over a given period of time. LEQ can be measured for any time
               period, but is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1 hour or 24 hours.
                LDN is a 24 hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. Time-weighted
               refers to the fact that noise which occurs during certain sensitive time
               periods is penalized for occurring at these times. In the LDN scale, those
                events that take place during the night (10 pm to 7 am) are penalized by 10
                dB. This penalty was selected to attempt to account for increased human
                sensitivity to noise during the quieter period of a day, where sleep is the
               most probable activity.
                CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an additional 5 dBA
               penalty for events that occur during the evening (7 pm to 10 pm) time
               period. Either LDN or CNEL may be used to identify community noise
                impacts within the Noise Element. Example noise environments in terms of
               the CNEL metric are shown in Exhibit 2.

1.2 Noise Mmuremenfs
  Twenty six sites were selected for measurement of the noise environment in Laguna Beach.
  A review of noise complaints and identification of major noise sources in the community
  provided the initial base for development of the community noise survey. The measurement
  locations were selected on the basis of proximity to major noise sources and noise sensitivity
  of the land use. The measurement locations are depicted in Exhibit 3.
  There were three types of measurements conducted. At five locations noise masurema@
  were made for a 24 hour period using a noise monitor that was installed in the private yard
  area d a residence. At sixteen sites noise meamstmen& were made of the s h a t term Leq
  values. These measurements provide a short 'smpshat' view of the noise envir0~nWnt. At
  five additional sites, short term L q noise meItSiEremtnts were made prior to and during the
  summer festival season. These latter measurements were done to describe %he change in
  noise environment associated with the increased activity during the summer months.
The results of the short term noise measurements are shown in Exhibit 4. These figures also
depict the date and time of the measurement and the primary noise source affecting the noise
environment The quantities measured were the Equivalent Noise Level (Leq), the maximum
noise level (Lmax) and the minimum noise levels. The results of the 24 hour long
measurements are shown in Exhibit 5.
When examining the short term data shown in Exhibit 4 it is important to note that most of
these sites were in the front yards of homes and are quite close to the road. These data are
intended to identify noise levels over a broad range of the City and are not an assessment of
impacts at these sites. In all cases the major sources of noise are motor vehicles on local
streets. The predominant noise source is Coast Highway. Exhibit 4 shows this very clearly,
the sites nearest Coast Highway are the loudest sited in the City. The maximum noise levels
are usually due to trucks or loud cars. The minimums occur when WIC        is very light or no
cars are passing by. The instantaneous minimum noise levels ranged from 29 dBA on at Site
18 (Mystic View) to 52 dBA a t Site 9 (residential behind Mosun Sushi and Club). The
instantaneous maximum noise levels ranged from 59 dBA at Site 14 (Alta Laguna Park) to
89 dBA at Site 6 (Coast Highway) and Site 9 (residential behind Mosun Sushi and Club).
The maximums at both locations were due to motor vehicle traffic. The logarithmic average
or Leq noise levels ranged from 42 dBA at Site 14 (Alta Laguna Park) to 71 dBA at Site 2
(Coast Highway near Aliso Creek) and Site 6 (Coast Highway).

LAGUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT
In examining Exhibit 5 the daily twenty-four hour variation in noise levels can be seen. The
horizontal line in Exhibit 5 is the CNEL (weighted 24 hour logarithmic average). The hours
that have high peaks usually correspond to heavy traffic hours or some very loud peak noise
events(s). There is a morning peak hour after which traff~cnoise remains somewhat consistent
throughout the day. In the evening traffic and noise decrease to very low levels. These are
typical variations for a suburban area. In Laguna Beach the morning peak hour is more
pronounced than the evening peak hour. For example, Site 13 located on Alta Laguna
Boulevard and overlooking Top of the World Elementary school has a very pronounced peak
period for 7 to 9 am associated with the start of school. It is significant to note that the
measurements made on Park Avenue (site 12) were influenced by construction noise. At this
location the construction at Thurston Middle School, a new home on Park Avenue, and
remodeling activity on Hillview Drive all contributed to the increase in noise. The extremely
low noise levels measured at night at this location (34 dBA hourly Leq) is lower than is
typically measured in an urban or suburban environment, and contrasts with the construction
trucks operating on Park Avenue during the day (58 dBA hourly Leq with maximum noise
levels near 80 dBA). The low night noise levels reflect the lack of activity in the hills of
Laguna and the large distance from Coast Highway. The range of CNEL of sites tested
measured from a low of 53 dBA (Site 13 on Alta Laguna and Site 5 on Nyes Place) to a high of
61 (site 10 on Legion Street).
  1.3 Sources of Noise.
  The sources of noise in Laguna Beach fall into three basic categories. These are: motor
  vehicle noise, aircraft overflights, and stationary sources. Each of these sources and their
  impacts on the noise environment of Laguna Beach are summarized in the following
  paragraphs.
  The most common sources of noise in Laguna Beach are transportation related noise sources.
  These include automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and aircraft. Motor vehicle noise is of
  LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                             Page 23
concern because it is characterized by a high number of individual events which often create
a sustained noise level and its proximity to areas sensitive to noise exposure. Aircraft
operations, though infrequent, may generate high noise levels that can be disruptive to human
activity.
The City of Laguna Beach is served by 2 major highways (Coast Highway and Laguna
Canyon Road), a small number of arterial roadways, and the local street system. T r a f i c
noise on surface streets is a significant source of noise within the community, particularly
Coast Highway.
The City of Laguna Beach has commercial sources of noise at a number of locations
throughout the City. The primary commercial noise sources are the restaurants and bars that
serve the downtown area. Other commercial sources include the large supermarkets located
in the City. The types of noise disturbance from these activities can range from short-
duration, loud events such as trucks accessing the facility to continuous noise such as from
refrigeration units or compressors. Late night activity associated with restaurants and bars is
also a concern (noise measurement locations 9 and 20 were located outside very active
restaurants and bars). Also, during the summer months the three local art festivals are the
source of some noise. The Pageant of the Masters includes orchestra music and amplified
public address system and the Sawdust Festival includes live music. Note also that the
festival grounds are used for special events at various times of the year and these events may
include live music or amplified recorded music. The City of Laguna Beach also sponsors a
'concert in park' series during the summer at Bluebird Park. It should also be noted that on
weekends a small number of the local restaurants currently attract motorcycle enthusiasts to
the City.
1.4 Noise Sensitive Receptors.
The City of Laguna Beach has a number of noise sensitive land uses. Within the City are
three public, several private schools, day care centers, retirement homes and a hospital. The
majority of land uses within the City are noise sensitive residential uses. The distribution of

these residential areas varies from lower density single family homes in the hillside areas,
higher density single family homes in the downtown village and coastal areas, to higher
density apartments, duplexes and condominiums in the downtown and coastal areas.
1.5 Community Noke Contours.
The noise contours for the City of Laguna Beach are presented in Exhibits 6 and 7 for
existing and future conditions respectively. The existing contours are based on the existing
conditions of traffic volumes and other sources of noise in the community. The traffic
volumes and speeds used to generate the noise contours are detailed in the appendix. Note
that the future traffic volumes were estimates using an assumed linear growth rate of 1% per
year for the next 20 years. The use of this growth rate is not based on any traffic projections,
but is used to show how noise may change as MIC       increases. This growth rate was used on
Coast Highway, Laguna Canyon Road and El Toro Road only. The rational for this
assumption is that traffic growth on the local streets in Laguna Beach is limited by the very
small amount of housing development that may occur. The major roads like Coast Highway
and Laguna Canyon may experience future increases in trafFic as a result of greater visitor
traffic to the City. The historical traffic numbers for these roads are presented in the
appendix.
The noise contours were generated using a mathematical model developed by the Federal
Highway Administration ("FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model," FHWA-RD-
77-108, December 1978 including the noise characteristics of a typical California population
of motor vehicles as published by Caltrans - Calveno Noise Curve). The FHWA model uses
traffic volume, vehicle mix, average vehicle speed, roadway geometry, and sound
propagation path characteristics to predict hourly A-weighted Leq values adjacent to a road.
Vehicle mix is reported in terms of the number of automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy
trucks. The truck categories are defrned in the FHWA model by number of axles and weight.
In order to compute a CNEL value for roadways the hourly data for a 24 hour period are used
according to the CNEL formula. Vehicle distribution over the 24 hour day must be known,
LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                                Page 25
i.e., the percent of vehicles in the daytime period (7 am to 7 pm), evening period (7 pm to 10
pm) and night period (10 pm to 7 am). The mix of automobiles, medium trucks and heavy
trucks has an effect on noise levels. The assumption used to model noise is based on known
traffic mix data. For arterial roadways the vehicle mix data are obtained from mix data
collected by the County of Orange during extensive surveys of 53 intersections within the
County. The arterial roadway mix data are provided in Table 1.
Table 1
Arterial Roadway Vehicle Mix Data
(Traffic distribution per time of day in percent of Average Daily Traffic  - ADT)
 VEHICLE TYPE          .       DAY         EVENING        NIGHT       TOTAL

Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the contour lines on a
topographic map are lines of equal elevation. The contours shown on the map are the 60,65
and 70 dB CNEL noise level. The noise contours presented can be used as a guide for land
use planning (see Section 3.0, Findings). The 60 dB CNEL contour defines the Noise
Referral Zone. This is the noise level for which noise considerations should be included
when making land use policy decisions.
The contours presented in this report are a graphic representation of the noise environment.
These distances to contour values are also shown in tabulated format in the appendix.
Topography and intervening buildings or barriers have a very complex effect on the
propagation of noise. To present a worst case estimate, the topographic affect is not included
in these contours to present a worst case projection. Exhibit 6 presents the CNEL noise
contours for existing conditions and Exhibit 7 presents estimated contours for 20 years in the
future (2023).

LAGUTLA BEACH NODE ELEMEMT
2.0 ISSUE IDEN TIFlCATlON
 The City of Laguna Beach, located along the coast in southern Orange County, is subject to a
  variety of different types of noise typical of an suburban area. The City adopted a General
 Plan Noise Element in 1W4. This document provided a comprehensive description of
 existing noise levels, but lacked a comprehensive set of implementing actions needed to
 accomplish the goals of reducing urban noise.
 It is important to note that the City of Laguna Beach is essentially built out, and thus
 experiences a set of noise problems unique to a mature city, unlike the land use planning
 problems facing undeveloped areas with high growth rates.
 In this update of the General Plan Noise Element, the technical description of noise in
 Laguna Beach has been updated and a series of comprehensive goals, policies, and
 implementing actions are developed. The process of updating the Noise Element included a
 review of existing City policies concerning environmental noise.
 Noise problems were grouped into the following 5 categories: late-night entertainment,
 construction and maintenance, machinery, passenger and delivery vehicles, and general
 population noise. A summary of these issues is as follows:
          Late night entertainment noise concerns restaurants and bars. The primary noise
          sources are people and their automobiles at very late hours and live or recorded
          music emanating from the establishments.
           Construction and maintenance noise concerns both the noise from home or
          commercial maintenance or remodeling and adequate consideration of construction
          noise impacts during the planning, review and approval of projects in or adjacent to
          established residential areas.
          Machinery noise concerns use of mechanical equipment in or near residential areas
          and includes air conditioners, pool and spa mechanical equipment, other mechanical
 UGUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                              Page 29
         equipment that may be associated with home hobbies such as woodworking
         equipment, automobile maintenance and other equipment associated with the artist
         community such as kilns, mechanical equipment used in sculpting, etc.
         Passenger and delivery vehicle noise is a primary noise source in Laguna Beach and
         is associated with the motor vehicle traffic in the City. In addition to automobiles,
         motorcycles are a contributor to noise levels. The Circulation Element is the part of
         the General Plan that sets policy for motor vehicle movements within the City.
         General population noise recognizes that in higher density urban areas the noise is
         higher than in lower density rural environments. The more people are put together
         the greater the noise. In such neighborhoods it may be advantageous to use a
         mediation technique to help neighbors resolve their differences and and be more
         considerate of their noise.
Noise mitigation can be distilled into three major topics. These include Transportation Noise
Control, Noise and Land Use Planning Integration, and Community Noise Control for Non-
Transportation Noise Sources. These are described below.
2.1 TransportatibnNoise Control
Within the City of Laguna Beach are a number of transportation related noise sources
including major arterials, aircraft overflight corridors, and collector roadways. These sources
are major contributors of noise in Laguna Beach. Cost effective strategies to reduce their
influence on the community noise environment are part of a Noise Element. However, the
City of Laguna Beach is limited in controlling certain noise sources due to preemption by
Federal and State law. Specifically, Federal law preempts the City from adopting any
regulation of aircraft in flight. Federal Air Regulation Part 36 establishes noise standards for
aircraft and Federal Air Regulation Part 91 contains operating flight rules and limits the
operation of aircraft to aircraft meeting the Part 36 noise standards. The California Motor
Vehicle Code establishes noise limits for motor vehicles in several sections of the code.
Included in the Motor Vehicle Code (MVC) are the following sections that govern vehicle
noise limits: Sections 27200 (new vehicle sales), 27204 (vehicle noise limits), 27150
LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                                Page 30
(adequate muffler), 27151 (muffler modification), 27150.3 (no whistle-tip muffler), 27202
(motorcycle limits), 27150.2 (exhaust systems), and 27007 (sound amplification devices). In
addition there are limits on off-road vehicle noise emissions in other sections of the Code.
2.2 Noise and Land Use Phnnittg Integration
Information relative to the existing and forecast noise environment within Laguna Beach
should be integrated into future land use planning decisions. This Element presents the noise
environment in order that the City may include noise impact considerations in development
programs.
2.3 Community Noise Controlfor Non-Transportation Noise Sources
Residential land uses and areas identified as noise sensitive must be protected from excessive
noise from non-transportation sources including commercial activities, construction noise,
late-night entertainment, spa and pool equipment and air-conditioner noise to name a few.
These impacts are most effectively controlled through the adoption and application of a City
Noise Ordinance.
LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                                Page 31
The predominant noise sources in Laguna Beach, as in most other communities, come from
mobile noise sources, including motor vehicles. A number of arterial roadways expose the
City to significant noise levels, particularly in those areas directly adjacent to Coast
Highway. Aircraft operating to and fiom John Wayne Airport, helicopter operations, and
aircraft (including but not limited to aerial banner towing aircraft) operating parallel to the
coast result in some single event disturbance fiom overflights. The noise environment in
Laguna Beach varies fiom the busy high density corridor along Coast Highway to the lower
density residential communities on the hillsides.
Other sources of noise within the City are fiom non-transportation sources including
commercial activities, construction activities and associated vehicular truck traffic. Within
the City are a number of restaurants and bars that cater to a late night patronage.
Noise affects all types of land uses and activities, although some are more sensitive to high
noise levels than others. Land uses identified as noise sensitive include residences of all
types; hospitals, rest homes, places of worship and schools. Within the City are a number of
public and private schools, and day care centers (generally in-home day care centers).
As described in Section 1.5, the noise environment for Laguna Beach can be described using
noise contours developed for the major noise sources within the City. The noise contours are
used to identify areas of existing or potential noise impacts. The contours are developed for
existing conditions and future conditions estimated for 20 years in the future and are
presented in Exhibits 6 and 7 respectively. Both the 60 and 65 dB CNEL contour levels are
shown on these maps. Any existing or proposed land use within a 65 Ldn contour should be
considered for noise mitigation programs. For example, within the 60 dB CNEL contour,
which represents a "Noise Referral Zone," any proposed noise sensitive land use should be
evaluated on a project specific basis and the project may require mitigation to meet City or
State standards. The 65 CNEL represents zones where residential development should be
LAGVNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                               Page 32
carefully reviewed to ensure that proper mitigation is included as part of the project to ensure
that no private outdoor yard or patio areas are exposed to noise levels above 65 CNEL.
The sources of noise in Laguna Beach can be divided into two basic categories,
transportation sources and non-transportation sources. A local government has little direct
control of transportation noise at the source because of preemption by the State and Federal
Government. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to control the noise fiom the
source, such as vehicle noise emission levels. The most effective method the City has to
mitigate transportation noise is through reducing the impact of the noise onto the community.
Measures that can be used to reduce noise include, but is not limited to noise barriers, land
use planning, site design review, circulation improvements, truck access restrictions. Note
that truck access restrictions on public streets are difficult to implement for existing uses.
However, during the project planning review for conditional use permits or other land use
permits, truck mitigation conditions of approval can be included such as providing access
fiom non-residential streets, restricting the hours of delivery, or submission an approved
truck route plan.
Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise barrier (wall, berm, or combination
walyberm) is the most common way of alleviating traffic noise impacts for new
development. The effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on the geometry between
the noise source and the receiver. A noise barrier effect occurs when the "line of sight"
between the source and receiver is penetrated by the barrier. The greater the penetration, the
greater the noise reduction. It is difficult and often impossible to retrofit such noise barriers
into existing neighborhoods. Along Coast Highway a few homes were developed with or
added noise barriers where the access to the horn is fiom another street. However, most of
the homes adjacent to Coast Highway have curb cut access fiom Coast Highway or are
located on hillsides or bluffs overlookig Coast Highway making noise barrier construction
impractical or impossible (a space in the noise barrier for the curb cut access would render
the noise barrier ineffective).
Noise concerns should be incorporated into land use planning to reduce future noise and land
use incompatibilities. This can be achieved by establishing standards and criteria that specify
LAGUNA BUCH NOISE ELEMENT                                                                  Page 33
acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the City. These criteria are
designed to integrate noise considerations into land use planning to prevent noiselland use
conflicts. Table 2 presents the recommended criteria used to assess the compatibility of
proposed land uses with the noise environment. These criteria are the basis for the
development of specific Noise Standards. These recommended Standards, presented in
Table 3, presents the recommended City policies related to land uses and acceptable noise
levels. These tables are the primary tools, which allow the City to ensure integrated planning
for compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise.
The Land Use/Noise Compatibility Matrix shown in Table 2 is used in the land planning
stage of the development process. It is used to identify project opportunities and constraints.
In conjunction with the Noise Contour Maps (Exhibits 6 and 7), this matrix may be used to
determine whether a certain type of land use is appropriate in a particular CNEL zone. For
example, a residential use in a 60-70 CNEL zone would only be appropriate with certain
mitigation. This matrix is particularly helpful to assist in the layout and design of large
mixed-use projects because it identifies the noise sensitivities of various land use types.
Such consideration permits the location and layout of noise sensitive uses in lower noise
exposure areas.
The Interior and Exterior Noise Standards shown in Table 3 are the actual design standards to
be used in the project design stage. Compliance with these standards should be required in
the Conditions of Approval or other project requirements and evaluated as part of City
Development Review and building permit plan check.
The most effective method to control community noise impacts fiom non-transportation
noise sources is through application of the Community Noise Ordinance. The City should
consider amending the Community Noise Ordinance to help ensure that City residents are not
exposed to excessive noise levels fiom non-transportation noise sources. The Noise
Ordinance is designed to protect quiet residential areas fiom stationary noise sources. The
noise levels encouraged by the ordinance are typical of a quiet residential area. It should be
noted, as will be discussed later, that while some noise problems are resolved through

4.0 GOAL STATEMENT
Based on issues, background, inventory and understanding of noise concerns in Laguna
Beach, the foilowing are statements of the desired objectives of the Noise Element for the
City of Laguna Beach.
      I. Provide for the reduction of noise where the noise environment is
         unacceptable, where feasible.
      2. Protect and maintain those areas having acceptable noise environments.
      3 Provide sufficient information concerning the commundy noise levels so that
         noise can be objectively considered in land use planning decisions.
The following section, Section 5, lists the goals, policies and implementation actions.
5.0 POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATlON
In order to achieve the goals of the Noise Element, the following goals, policies and
implementation actions are necessary:
   Goal I:      Provide for measures to reduce noise impactk from transportawn noise
                sources:
                Policy I.1 Investigate the opportunity to construct barriers to mitigate sound
                             emissions where necessary and where feasible. Actively participate
                             in the development of noise abatement plans fbr arterial roads and
                            rapid transit, and the planning of road improvements that may affect
                            traffk in Laguna Beach. (Action 1.1)

                                        improvements in or affecting Laguna Beach traff~cwith
                                        respect to existing noise sensitive land uses. The City
                                        should ensure the employment of noise mitigation
                                        measures in the design or improvement of arterial
                                        roadways consistent with fimding capability and
                                        support efforts by the California Department of
                                        Transportation to provide for acoustical protection for
                                        existing noise sensitive land uses affected by these
                                        projects.
                        Action 1.2      Provide for continued evaluation of truck movements
                                        and routes in the City to provide effective separation

                         Action 1.3     Encourage the enforcement of State Motor Vehicle
                                        noise standards for cars, trucks, and motorcycles
                                        through coordination with the California Highway
                                        Patrol and Laguna Beach Police Department.
                                        Encourage adoption by the state, legislation that
                                        prohibits the modification of motorcycles exhaust
                                        systems that result in noise levels in excess of those
                                        permitted in the Motor Vehicle Code.
                         Action 1.4     Evaluate regularly the Master PIan of Arterial
                                        Highways and transportation planning efforts of the
                                        Orange County Transportation Agency and the
                                        Transportation Conidor Agency for opportunities to
                                        reduce noise impacts or prevent noise impacts in
                                        Laguna Beach.
                         Action 1.5     Evaluate consistency between Noise and Transportation
                                        Circulation and Growth Management Elements upon
                                        next Transportation Circulation Element update.
                        Action 1.6      Encourage incorporation of traffic calming techniques
                                        in public projects and private developments which
                                        result in a reduction of traffic noise levels.

                measures will be achieved through the following policies as they apply to
                completed projects, not construction actions.
               P o k y 2.1 Establish acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout
                            the community. Zoning changes should be consistent with the
                            compatibility of the projected noise environment. (Action 2.1)
LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                              Page 39
               Policy 2.2 Ensure acceptable noise levels near schools, hospitals, residences
                           and other noise sensitive areas. (Action 2.2)
               Policy2.3 Encourage acoustical mitigation design in new construction.
                           (Action 2.3)
                       Aciion 2.1       Establish standards that specify acceptable limits of
                                        noise for various land uses throughout the City as part
                                       of the Zoning Ordinance. These criteria are designed to
                                        fully integrate noise considerations into land use
                                       planning to prevent new noise/land use conflicts. Table
                                       2 shows criteria recommended to assess the
                                       compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise
                                       environment. These criteria are the basis for the
                                       development of specific Noise Standards.             The
                                       recommended standards, presented in Table 3, define
                                       the City policies related to land uses and acceptable
                                       noise levels. These tables are the primary tools which
                                       allow the City to ensure noise integrated planning for
                                       compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise. For
                                       any project in an area louder than 60 CNEL contour,
                                       the project should be flagged for review for compliance
                                       with interior noise level standards.
                       Action 2.2      Through the Zoning Ordinance, incorporate noise
                                       reduction features during site planning to mitigate
                                       anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive
                                       land uses. The noise referral zones identified in
                                       Exhibits 6 and 7 (areas exposed to noise levels greater
                                       than 60 dB CNEL) can be used to identify locations of
                                       potential conflict. New developments would be
                                       permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are

                                        included such that the standards contained in this
                                        Element are met.
                        Action 2.3      Continue to Enforce the State of California Uniform
                                        Building Code that specifies that the indoor noise levels
                                        for residential living spaces not exceed 45 dB CNEL
                                        due to the combined effect of all noise sources. The
                                        State requires implementation of this standard when the
                                        outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL. The Noise
                                        Referral Zones (60 dB CNEL) can be used to determine
                                        when this standard needs to be addressed. The Uniform
                                        Building Code (specifically, the California
                                        Administrative Code, Title 24, Part 6, Division T25,
                                        Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 4, Sections T25-28)
                                        requires that "Interior community noise levels
                                        (CNEWLDN) with windows closed, attributable to
                                        exterior sources shall not exceed an annual CNEL or
                                        LDN of 45 dB in any habitable room." The code
                                        requires that this standard be applied to all new hotels,
                                        motels, apartment houses and dwellings other than
                                        detached single-family dwellings. The City should
                                        also, as a matter of policy, apply this standard to single
                                        family dwellings.
   Goal 3:     Develop measures to control non-transporfation noise impacts.
               Policy 3.1 Establish a new revised Community Noise Ordinance to mitigate
                           noise conflicts. (Actions 3.1 and 3.2)
               Policy32 Improve enforcement of required noise mitigation measures in
                           building design. (Action 3.3)
               Policy 3 3 Consider new means of controlling late night noise from bars and
                           restaurants (Action 3.4)
LACUNA BEACH NOISE ELEMENT                                                              Page 4 1
                Policy 3.4 Establish and maintain coordination among the city agencies
                            involved in noise abatement (Action 3.5)
                        Action 3.1      Amend the existing noise ordinance to ensure that City
                                        residents are not exposed to excessive noise levels from
                                        stationary noise sources. The purpose of the ordinance
                                        is to protect people from non-transportation related
                                        noise sources such as music, machinery and pumps and
                                        air conditioners. The Noise Ordinance does not apply
                                        to motor vehicle noise on public streets, but it does
                                        apply to vehicles on private property. The Noise
                                        Ordinance is designed to protect quiet residential areas
                                        from stationary noise sources. The noise levels
                                        encouraged by the Ordinance are typical of a quiet
                                        residential area. The Noise Ordinance should establish
                                        specific noise level limits that can be enforced by
                                        scientific measurements, but should also recognize that
                                        some neighborhood noise problems are best handled
                                        through action by public safety personnel (for example,
                                        loud parties, barking dogs, or other activities that may
                                        be difficult to make noise measurements or the
                                        measurements may interfere with the activity, i.e.,
                                        causing the dog to bark) and some through enhanced
                                        communication between neighbors. This latter idea is
                                        meant to address the more human side of noise
                                        complaints between neighbors.
                                        To address the human side of some noise problems,
                                        particularly those between arguing or feuding neighbors
                                        (residential or commercial or mixed use), enhanced
                                        communication between neighbors may bring the best

                                    resolution to these types of problems. The City should
                                   encourage mediation to address these problems.
                        Action 3.2 Review and revise the Noise Ordinance to address
                                   observed difficulties in enforcing the existing
                                   ordinance. This revision should include, consideration
                                   of the following concepts:
                                    1. Specific noise level limits for various land uses for
                                       day and night periods with specific guidance to
                                        project applicants on where the noise measurements
                                       are to be taken.
                                   2. Consider using the noise metric "Equivalent Noise

                                       quicker measurements. This will reduce the
                                       complexity of equipment needed to do the
                                       measurements and result in a clearer more readily
                                       usable measurement result.
                       Action 3.3  Require that new commercial projects, to be built near
                                   existing residential land use, demonstrate compliance
                                   with the City Noise Ordinance prior to approval of the
                                   project. Require that all Building Permit applicants,
                                   including contractors, sign a form acknowledging
                                   requirements of the noise ordinance, and assuming
                                   responsibility for compliance with the Noise Ordinance.
                                   This is particularly important for the non-resident
                                   contractor installing mechanical equipment.

                        Policy 4.1    Consider incorporating the following provisions into
                                      the Noise Ordinance to address the problems of
                                      construction noise:

                                      expressly prohibit construction on Saturday, Sunday
                                      and Holidays.
                        Action 4.2    Consider exempting the residentlbuilders in single
                                      family zones from the Saturday, Sunday, and Holiday
                                      construction ban for maintenance purposes only,
                                      provided such maintenance is limited to the hours
                                      specified in the Noise Ordinance or meets the noise
                                      limits set in the Noise Ordinance.
                        Action 4.3    During the environmental review of all projects
                                      requiring extensive construction, determine the
                                      proximity of the site to the established residential areas.
                                      If the project will involve pile driving, night time truck
                                      hauling, blasting, 24 hour pumping (important in
                                      coastal excavations), o r any other very high noise
                                      equipment, the environmental review shall include a
                                      construction noise alternative analysis. From this
                                      analysis specific mitigation measures shall be
                                      developed to mitigate potential noise impacts. This
                                      may include but not be limited to:
                                         requirements to use quieter, potentially costlier
                                      construction techniques.

                           Application of the foregoing measures should be
                           determined on a project by project basis depending on
                           the type of noise generation proposed and the source
                           proximity to established residential areas. It should

                           this case, the construction noise mitigation analysis
                           must be submitted for review as part of building permit,

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND METHODOLOGY
 1, Introduction
This section presents background information on the characteristics of noise and
summarizes the methodologies used to study the noise environment. This section will give
the reader an understanding of the metrics and methodologies used to assess noise
impacts. This section is divided as follows:
          Properties of sound that are important for technically describing sound
          Acoustic factors influencing human subjective response to sound.
          Potential disturbances to humans and health effects due to sound.
           Sound rating scales used in this study
           Summary of noise assessment criteria
2. Characteristics of Sound
Sound Level and Frequency. Sound can be technically described in terms of the sound
pressure (amplitude) and frequency (similar to pitch). Sound pressure is a direct measure
of the magnitude of a sound without consideration for other factors that may influence its
perception.
The range of sound pressures that occur in the environment is so large that it is convenient
to express these pressures as sound pressure levels on a logarithmic scale which
compresses the wide range of sound pressures to a more usable range of numbers. The
standard unit of measurement of sound is the Decibel (dB) which describes the pressure of
a sound relative to a reference pressure.
The frequency (pitch) of a sound is expressed as Hertz (Hz) or cycles per second. The
normal audible frequency for young adults is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Community noise,
including aircraft and motor vehicles, typically ranges between 50 Hz and 5,000 Hz. The
human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies, with some frequencies judged to be
louder for a given signal than others. As a result of this, various methods of frequency
weighting have been developed. The most common weighting is the A-weighted noise
curve (dBA). The A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by
discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the human
ear. In the A-weighted decibel, everyday sounds normally range from 30 dBA (very quiet)
to 100 dBA (very loud). Most community noise analyses are based upon the A-weighted
decibel scale. Examples of various sound environments, expressed in dBA, are presented
in Exhibit A-1 .
Propanation of Noise. Outdoor sound levels decrease as the distance from the source
increases, and as a result of wave divergence, atmospheric absorption and ground
attenuation. Sound radiating from a source in a homogeneous and undisturbed manner

travels in spherical waves. As the sound wave travels away from the source, the sound
energy is dispersed over a greater area decreasing the sound power of the wave.
Spherical spreading of the sound wave reduces the noise level at a rate of 6 dB per
doubling of the distance.
Atmospheric absorption also influences the levels received by the observer. The greater
the distance traveled, the greater the influence of the atmosphere and the resultant
fluctuations. Atmospheric absorption becomes important at distances of greater than 1000
feet. The degree of absorption varies depending on the frequency of the sound as well as
the humidity and temperature of the air. For example, atmospheric absorption is lowest
(-i.e.,sound carries farther) at high humidity and high temperatures. A schematic diagram of
how weather including temperature gradients and wind can affect sound propagation is
shown in Exhibit A-2. Turbulence and gradients of wind, temperature and humidity also
play a significant role in determining the degree of attenuation. Certain conditions, such as
inversions, can channel or focus the sound waves resulting in higher noise levels than
would result from simple spherical spreading. Absorption effects in the atmosphere vary
with frequency. The higher frequencies are more readily absorbed than the lower
frequencies. Over large distances, the lower frequencies become the dominant sound as
the higher frequencies are attenuated.
Duration of Sound. Annoyance from a noise event increases with increased duration of
the noise event, i . ~ . the
                           , longer the noise event, the more annoying it is. The "effective
duration" of a sound is the time between when a sound rises above the background sound
level until it drops back below the background level. Psycho-acoustic studies have
determined the relationship between duration and annoyance and the amount a sound
must be reduced to be judged equally annoying for increased duration. Duration is an
important factor in describing sound in a community setting.
The relationship between duration and noise level is the basis of the equivalent energy
principal of sound exposure. Reducing the acoustic energy of a sound by one half results
in a 3 dB reduction. Doubling the duration of the sound increases the total energy of the
event by 3 dB. This equivalent energy principal is based upon the premise that the
potential for a noise to impact a person is dependent on the total acoustical energy content
of the noise. Defined in subsequent sections of this study, noise metrics such as CNEL,
DNL, LEQ and SENEL are all based upon the equal energy principle.
Channe in Noise. The concept of change in ambient sound levels can be understood with
an explanation of the hearing mechanism's reaction to sound. The human ear is a far
better detector of relative differences in sound levels than absolute values of levels. Under
controlled laboratory conditions, listening to a steady unwavering pure tone sound that can
be changed to slightly different sound levels, a person can just barely detect a sound level
change of approximately one decibel for sounds in the mid-frequency region. When
ordinary noises are heard, a young healthy ear can detect changes of two to three decibels.
A five decibel change is readily noticeable while a 10 decibel change is judged by most
people as a doubling or a halving of the loudness of the sound. It is typical in environmental
documents to consider a 3 dB change as potentially discernable.

 Maskina Effect. The ability of one sound to limit a listener from hearing another sound. is
 known as the masking effect. The presence of one sound effectively raises the threshold of
 audibility for the hearing of a second sound. For a signal to be heard, it must exceed the
 threshold of hearing for that particular individual and exceed the masking threshold for the
 background noise.
 The masking characteristics of sound depend on many factors including the spectral
 (frequency) characteristics of the two sounds, the sound pressure levels and the relative
 start time of the sounds. Masking effect is greatest when the frequencies of the two sounds
 are similar or when low frequency sounds mask higher frequency sounds. High frequency
 sounds do not easily mask low frequency sounds.
 3. Factors Influencing Human Response to Sound
 Many factors influence sound perception and annoyance. This includes not only physical
characteristics of the sound but also secondary influences such as sociological and external
factors. Molino, in the Handbook of Noise Control [2] describes human response to sound
 in terms of both acoustic and non-acoustic factors. These factors are summarized in Table
A-I.
Sound rating scales are developed in reaction to the factors affecting human response to
sound. Nearly all of these factors are relevant in describing how sounds are perceived in
the community. Many non-acoustic parameters play a prominent role in affecting individual
response to noise. Background sound, an additional acoustic factor not specifically listed,
is also important in describing sound in rural settings. Researchers have indentified the
effects of personal and situational variables on noise annoyance, and have identified a
clear association of reported annoyance and various other individual perceptions or beliefs.
Thus, it is important to recognize that non-acoustic factors as well as acoustic factors
contribute to human response to noise.

4. Sound Rating Scales
The description, analysis, and reporting of community sound levels is made difficult by the
complexity of human response to sound and myriad sound-rating scales and metrics
developed to describe acoustic effects. Various rating scales approximate the human
subjective assessment to the "loudness" or "noisiness" of a sound. Noise metrics have
been developed to account for additional parameters such as duration and cumulative
effect of multiple events.
Noise metrics are categorized as single event metrics and cumulative metrics. Single event
metrics describe the noise from individual events, such as one aircraft flyover. Cumulative
metrics describe the noise in terms of the total noise exposure throughout the day. Noise
metrics used in this study are summarized below:
Single Event Metrics
         Frequency Weighted Metrics (dBA). In order to simplify the measurement and
computation of sound loudness levels, frequency weighted networks have obtained wide
acceptance. The A-weighting (dBA) scale has become the most prominent of these scales
and is widely used in community noise analysis. Its advantages are that it has shown good
correlation with community response and is easily measured. The metrics used in this
study are all based upon the dBA scale.
         Maximum Noise Level. The highest noise level reached during a noise event is,
not surprisingly, called the "Maximum Noise Level," or Lmax. For example, as an aircraft
approaches, the sound of the aircraft begins to rise above ambient noise levels. The closer
the aircraft gets the louder it is until the aircraft is at its closest point directly overhead.
Then as the aircraft passes, the noise level decreases until the sound level again settles to
ambient levels. Such a history of a flyover is plotted at the top of Exhibit A-3. It is this
metric to which people generally instantaneously respond when an aircraft flyover of loude
vehicle like a truck or motorcycle passes by.
a
         Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL) or Sound Exposure Level (SEL).
Another metric that is reported is the Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL). This
metric is essentially equivalent to the Sound Exposure (SEL) metric. It is computed from
dBA sound levels. Referring again to the top of Exhibit A-3, the shaded area, or the area
Laguna Beach Noise Element Appendix 2: Ndse    A -8
Lagma Beed, N o h Element Append& 2: Ndse A-
   within 10 dB of the maximum noise level, is the area from which the SENEL is computed.
  The SENEL value is the integration of all the acoustic energy contained within the event.
  Speech and sleep interference research can be assessed relative to Single Event Noise
  Exposure Level data.
           The SENEL metric takes into account the maximum noise level of the event and the
  duration of the event. Single event metrics are a convenient method for describing noise
  from individual aircraft events. This metric is useful in that airport noise models contain
  aircraft noise curve data based upon the SENEL metric. In addition, cumulative noise
  metrics such as LEQ, CNEL and DNL can be computed from SENEL data.
  Curnulafive Metrics
  Cumulative noise metrics assess community response to noise by including the loudness of
  the noise, the duration of the noise, the total number of noise events and the time of day
  these events occur into one single number rating scale.
  .        Equivalent Noise Level (Leq). Leq is the sound level corresponding to a steady-
  state A-weighted sound level containing the same total energy as several SEL events
  during a given sample period. Leq is the "energy" average noise level during the time
: period of the sample. It is based on the observation that the potential for noise annoyance
  is dependent on the total acoustical energy content of the noise. This is graphically
  illustrated in the middle graph of Exhibit A-3. Leq can be measured for any time period, but
  is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1 hour or 24-hours. Leq for a one hour period is used
  by the Federal Highway Administration for assessing highway noise impacts. Leq for one
  hour is called Hourly Noise Level (HNL) in the California Airport Noise Regulations and is
  used to develop Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) values for aircraft operations.
           Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). CNEL is a 24-hour, time-weighted
  energy average noise level based on the A-weighted decibel. It is a measure of the overall
  noise experienced during an entire day. The term "time-weighted" refers to the penalties
  attached to noise events occurring during certain sensitive time periods. In the CNEL
  scale, noise occurring between the hours of 7 pm and 10 pm is penalized by approximately
  5 dB. This penalty accounts for the greater potential for noise to cause communication
  interference during these hours, as well as typically lower ambient noise levels during these
  hours. Noise that takes place during the night (10 pm to 7 am) is penalized by 10 dB. This
  penalty was selected to attempt to account for the higher sensitivity to noise in the nighttime
  and the expected further decrease in background noise levels that typically occur in the
  nighttime.
  CNEL is graphically illustrated in the bottom of Exhibit A-3. Examples of various noise
  environments in terms of CNEL are pres&ted in Exhibit A-4. CNEL is specified for use in
  the California by local planning agencies in their General Plan Noise Element for land use
  compatibility planning.
  w        Day Night Noise Level (DNL). The DNL index is very similar to CNEL but does not
  include the evening (7 pm to 10 pm) penalty that is included in CNEL. It does include the
  nighttime (10 pm to 7 am ) penalty. Typically DNL is about 1 dB lower than CNEL, although

5. Effects of Noise On Humans
Noise, often described as unwanted sound, is known to have several adverse effects on
humans. From these known adverse effects of noise, criteria have been established to help
protect the public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human activities.
These criteria are based on effects of noise on people such as hearing loss (not a factor
with typical community noise), communication interference, sleep interference,
physiological responses and annoyance. Each of these potential noise impacts on people
are briefly discussed in the following narrative:
•        Hearing Loss is generally not a concern in community noise problems, even very
near a major airport or a major freeway. The potential for noise induced hearing loss is
more commonly associated with occupational noise exposures in heavy industry, very noisy
work environments with long term exposure, or certain very loud recreational activities such
as target shooting, motorcycle or car racing, etc. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) identifies a noise exposure limit of 90 dBA for 8 hours per day to
protect from hearing loss (higher limits are allowed for shorter duration exposures). Noise
levels in neighborhoods, even in very noisy neighborhoods, are not sufficiently loud to
cause hearing loss.
         Communication Interference is one of the primary concerns in environmental noise
problems. Communication interference includes speech interference and interference with
activities such as watching television. Normal conversational speech is in the range of 60
to 65 dBA and any noise in this range or louder may interfere with speech. There are
specific methods of describing speech interference as a function of distance between
speaker and listener and voice level. Exhibit A-5 shows the relation of quality of speech
communication with respect to various noise levels.
.        Sleep Interference is a major noise concern in noise assessment and, of course, is
most critical during nighttime hours. Sleep disturbance is one of the major causes of
annoyance due to community noise. Noise can make it difficult to fall asleep, create
momentary disturbances of natural sleep patterns by causing shifts from deep to lighter
stages and cause awakening. Noise may even cause awakening which a person may or
may not be able to recall.
Extensive research has been conducted on the effect of noise on sleep disturbance.
Recommended values for desired sound levels in residential bedroom space range from 25
to 45 dBA with 35 to 40 dBA being the norm. Some years ago (1981) The National
Association of Noise Control Officials published data on the probability of sleep disturbance
with various single event noise levels. Based on laboratory experiments conducted in the
 1970's, this data indicated noise exposure, at 75 dBA interior noise level event will cause
noise induced awakening in 30 percent of the cases.
However, recent research from England has shown that the probability for sleep
disturbance is less than what had been reported in earlier research. These recent field

 studies conducted during the 1990's and using new sophisticated techniques indicate that
awakenings can be expected at a much lower rate than had been expected based on
earlier laboratory studies. This research showed that once a person was asleep, it is much
more unlikely that they will be awakened by a noise. The significant difference in the recent
English study is the use of actual in-home sleep disturbance patterns as opposed to
laboratory data that had been the historic basis for predicting sleep disturbance. Some of
this research has been criticized because it was conducted in areas where subjects had
become habituated to aircraft noise. On the other hand, some of the earlier laboratory sleep
studies had been criticized because of the extremely small sample sizes of most laboratory
studies and because the laboratory was not necessarily a representative sleep
environment. The 1994 British sleep study compared the various causes of sleep
disturbance using in home sleep studies. This field study assessed the effects of nighttime
aircraft noise on sleep in 400 people (211 women and 189 men; 20-70 years of age; one
per household) habitually living at eight sites adjacent to four U.K. airports, with different
levels of night flying. The main finding was that only a minority of aircraft noise events
affected sleep, and, for most subjects, that domestic and other non-aircraft factors had
much greater effects. As shown in the Exhibit A-6, aircraft noise was a minor contributor
among a host of other factors which lead to awakening response.

              (Total awakenings = 6,457. Each subject could have reported more than one awakening each night.)
The Federal lnteragency Committee on Noise (FICON) in 1992 in a document entitled
Federal lnteragency Review of Selected Airport Noise Analysis Issues recommended an
interim dose-response curve for sleep disturbance based on laboratory studies of sleep
disturbance. In June of 1997, the Federal lnteragency Committee on Aviation Noise
(FICAN) updated the FICON recommendation with an updated curve based on the more
recent in-home sleep disturbance studies which show lower rates of awakening compared
to the laboratory studies. FICAN recommended a curve based on the upper limit of the data
presented and therefore considers the curve to represent the "maximum percent of the
exposed population expected to be behaviorally awakened," or the "maximum awakened."
The FICAN recommendation is shown on Exhibit A-7. This is a very conservative
approach. A more common statistical curve for the data points reflected in Exhibit A-7, for
example, would indicate a 10% awakening rate at a level of approximately 100 dB SENEL,

 while the "maximum awakenedn curve reflected in Exhibit A-7 shows the 10% awakening
rate being reached at 80 dB SENEL. (The full FlCAN report can be found on the internet at
www.fican.orq.)
         Physiological Responses are those measurable effects of noise on people which are
realized as changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. While such effects can be induced
and observed, the extent is not known to which these physiological responses cause harm
or are a sign of harm. Generally, physiological responses are a reaction to a loud short
term noise such as a rifle shot or a very loud jet over flight.
Health effects from noise have been studied around the world for nearly thirty years.
Scientists have attempted to determine whether high noise levels can adversely affect
human health-apart from auditory damage-which is amply understood. These research
efforts have covered a broad range of potential impacts from cardiovascular response to
fetal weight and mortality. Yet while a relationship between noise and health effects seems
plausible, it has yet to be convincingly demonstrated--that is, shown in a manner that can
be repeated by other researchers while yielding similar results.
While annoyance and sleeplspeech interference have been acknowledged, health effects, if
they exist, are associated with a wide variety of other environmental stressors. Isolating the
effects of aircraft noise alone as a source of long term physiological change has proved to
be almost impossible. In a review of 30 studies conducted worldwide between 1993 and
1998, a team of international researchers concluded that, while some findings suggest that
noise can affect health, improved research concepts and methods are needed to verify or
discredit such a relationship. They called for more study of the numerous environmental
and behavioral factors than can confound, mediate or moderate survey findings. Until
science refines the research process, a direct link between aircraft noise exposure and non-
auditory health effects remains to be demonstrated.
         Annoyance is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe. Annoyance is a
very individual characteristic and can vary widely from person to person. What one person
considers tolerable can be quite unbearable to another of equal hearing capability. The
level of annoyance, of course, depends on the characteristics of the noise (i.e.; loudness,
frequency, time, and duration), and how much activity interference (e.g. speech interference
and sleep interference) results from the noise. However, the level of annoyance is also a
function of the attitude of the receiver. Personal sensitivity to noise varies widely. It has
been estimated that 2 to 10 percent of the population is highly susceptible to annoyance
from any noise not of their own making, while approximately 20 percent are unaffected by
noise. Attitudes are affected by the relationship between the person and the noise source
(Is it our dog barking or the neighbor's dog?). Whether we believe that someone is trying to
abate the noise will also affect our level of annoyance.
Annoyance levels have been correlated to CNEL levels. Exhibit A-8 relates DNL noise
levels to community response from two of these surveys. One of the survey curves
presented in Exhibit A-8 is the well known Schultz curve, developed by Theodore Schultz.
It displays the percent of a populace that can be expected to be annoyed by various DNL
(CNEL in California) values for residential land use with outdoor activity areas. At 65 dB
DNL the Schultz curve predicts approximately 14% of the exposed population reporting

 themselves to be "highly annoyed." At 60 dB DNL this decreases to approximately 8% of
the population.
However, the Schultz curve and recent updates include data having a very wide range of
scatter with communities reporting much higher percentages of population highly annoyed
at these noise exposure levels. For example, under contract to the FAA, Bolt Beranek &
Newman conducted community attitude surveys in the residential areas south of John
Wayne Airport in Orange County in 1981 as part of a study of possible "power cutback"
departure procedures. That study concluded that the surveyed population (principally in
Santa Ana Heights and various Newport Beach neighborhoods) had more highly annoyed
individuals at various CNEL levels than would be predicted by the Schultz curve. When
plotted similar to the Schultz curve, this survey, indicated the populations in Santa Ana
Heights and Newport Beach were approximately 5 dB CNEL more sensitive to noise than
the average population predicted by the Schultz curve. While the precise reasons for this
increased noise sensitivity were not identified, it is possible that non-acoustic factors,
including political or the socio-economic status of the surveyed population may have played
an important role in increasing the sensitivity of this community during the period of the
survey. Annoyance levels have never been correlated statistically to single event noise
exposure levels in airport related studies.
•       School Room Effects. Interference with classroom activities and learning from
aircraft noise is an important consideration and the subject of much recent research.
Studies from around the world indicate that vehicle traffic, railroad and aircraft noise can
have adverse effects on reading ability, concentration, motivation. and long term learning
retention. A complicating factor in this research is the extent of background noise from
within the class room itself. The studies indicating the most adverse effects examine
cumulative noise levels equivalent to 65 CNEL or higher and single event maximum noise
levels ranging from 85 to 95 dBA. In other studies the level of noise is unstated or
ambiguous. According to these studies. a variety of adverse school room effects can be
expected from interior noise levels equal to or exceeding 65 CNEL and or 85 dBA SEL.
Some interference with classroom activities can be expected with noise events which
interfere with speech. As discussed in other sections of this report, speech interference
begins at 65 dBA which is the level of normal conversation. Typical construction attenuates
outdoor noise by 20 dBA with windows closed and 12 dBA with windows open. Thus some
interference of class room activities can be expected at outdoor levels of 77 to 85 dBA.
6. NoiselLand Use Compatibility Guidelines
Noise metrics quantify community response to various noise exposure levels. The public
reaction to different noise levels has been estimated from extensive research on human
responses to exposure of different levels of aircraft noise. Noise standards generally are
expressed in terms of the DNL 24-hour averaging scale based on the A-weighted decibel.
Utilizing these metrics and surveys, agencies have developed standards for assessing the
compatibility of various land uses with the noise environment. There are no single event
noise based noiselland use compatibility criteria that have been adopted by the Federal
Government or the State of California.
Laguna Beach Noise Element Appendix 2: Noise A - 19

This section presents information regarding noise and land use criteria useful in the
evaluation of noise impacts. Agencies including the EPA, the State of California, the County
of Orange and most cities have developed noiselland use compatibility criteria. A summary
of some of the more pertinent regulations and guidelines are presented in the following
paragraphs.
EnvironmentalProtection Agency Noise Assessment Guidelines
        Environmental Protection Agency, "Information on Levels of Environmental
Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of
Safety".
        In March 1974, in response to a federal statutory mandate, the EPA published this
document (EPA 55019-74-004) describing 55 dB DNL as the requisite level with an
adequate margin of safety for areas with outdoor uses, including residences and
recreational areas. This document does not constitute EPA regulations or standards.
Rather, it is intended to "provide State and Local governments as well as the Federal
Government and the private sector with an informational point of departure for the purpose
of decision-making". Note that these levels were developed for suburban type uses. In
some urban settings, the noise levels will be significantly above this level, while in some
wilderness settings, the noise levels will be well below this level. The EPA "levels
document" does not constitute a standard, specification or regulation, but identifies safe
levels of environmental noise exposure without consideration for achieving these levels or
other potentially relevant considerations.
State of California
   The State of California requires that all municipal General Plans contain a Noise Element.
The requirements for the Noise element of the General Plan include describing the noise
environment quantitatively using a cumulative noise metric such as CNEL or DNL,
establishing noiselland use compatibility criteria, and establishing programs for achieving
andlor maintaining compatibility. Noise elements shall address all major noise sources in
the community including mobile and stationary sources.
  Californian Noise Insulation Standards apply to all multi-family dwellings built in the State.
Single family residences are exempt from these regulations. With respect to community
noise sources, the regulations require that all multi-family dwellings with exterior noise
exposures greater that 60 dB CNEL must be sound insulated such that the interior noise
level will not exceed 45 dB CNEL. These requirements apply to all roadway, rail, and
airport noise sources.
  The Aeronautics Division of the California State Department of Transportation (Caltrans),
enforces the California Airport Noise Regulations. These regulations establish 65 dB CNEL
as a noise impact boundary within which there shall be no incompatible land uses. This
requirement is based, in part, upon the determination in the Caltrans regulations that 65 dB
Laguna Beach Noise Element Appendix 2: Noise A - 20
CNEL is the level of noise which should be acceptable to ".;.a reasonable man residing in
the vicinity of an airport."
County of Orange
  The General Plan Noise Element of the County of Orange establishes noiselland use
planning criteria for the unincorporated areas of the County. These noise guidelines and
standards cover roadway noise, rail noise, and airport noise including military and civilian
airports. The County has adopted noise standards for various land uses in terms of CNEL
and Leq. For residential land uses the County has established a maximum exterior noise
level standard of 65 dB CNEL for private outdoor living areas and an interior standard of 45
dB CNEL. The County of Orange uses the 60 dB CNEL contour as a threshold for review of
projects in order to screen projects and ensure that the 65 dB CNEL exterior and 45 dB
CNEL interior criteria are met. In other words, projects located within the 60 dB CNEL
contour are required to submit detailed acoustical studies ensuring compliance with the
County noise standards.
        Additionally, the County of Orange provides insurance that the 45 dB CNEL interior
noise limit for habitable rooms of residential units is met with windows open or windows
closed (not necessarily both). Specifically, homes with windows closed will provide at least
a 20 dB outdoor to indoor noise reduction (based on typical pre-1981 construction practice
and Uniform Building Code requirements, newer homes provide additional noise reduction).
Homes with windows open will provide a 12 dB outdoor to indoor noise reduction (largely
independent of date of construction). The County, therefore, requires that new homes with
exterior noise exposure greater than 57 dB CNEL (45 dB plus 12 dB) provide some means
of mechanical ventilation in order to ensure that residents are able to close windows and
obtain fresh air at a rate specified in the Uniform Building Code. New homes subject to this
requirement are typically air-conditioned or supplied with a fresh air switch as part of the
forced air heating unit. Prior to the incorporation of South Laguna into the City of Laguna
Beach the County of Orange General Plan was the operative guideline for planning in
South Laguna.

THE INTRODUCTORY SECTION ESTABLISHES THE
FRAMEWORK FOR OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
PLANNING IN LAGUNA BEACH BY EXPLAINING THE
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE OPEN SPACE
AND CONSERVATION ELEMENTS AND DESCRIBING
THE ORGANIZATION, CONTENT AND APPLICATION
OF THIS DOCUMENT.
SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION
Legislative History and Authoritv                                                                 ,,
In 1970, the State Legislature required that all cities and counties adopt Open Space and
Conservation elements as part of their general plans. The legislation cited its purpose in enacting
this requirement as including preserving open space lands: discouraging premature conversion of
such lands to urban uses: providing for orderly growth and development: and conserving natural
resources. The Open Space and Conservation Elements may be treated as separate documents or
combined into a single plan. The City has chosen to combine the elements because of the
interrelation of open space and conservation resources in the community. In order to explain the
principal concerns of each element, however, this introduction begins by discussing them
individually.
A.      Open Space Element
         Government Code Section 65560(b) defines "open space land" as any parcel or area of
         land or water, which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use. This
         includes:
        (1)      "Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited
                  to, area required for the preservation of plant and animal life, including habitat
                  for fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecological and other scientific
                  study purposes; rivers, streams, bay and estuaries; and coastal beaches,
                  lakeshores, bank of rivers and streams, and watershed lands."
        (2)      "Open space used for the managed production of resources, including but not
                  limited to, forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic
                  importance for the production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of
                  ground water basins: bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and streams which are
                  important for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing
                  major mineral deposits, including those in short supply."
        (3)     "Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of
                outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park
                and recreation purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches and rivers and
                streams; and areas which serve as links between major recreation and open space
                reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and
                scenic highway corridors."
        (4)      "Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas
                 which require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special
                 conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains,
                 watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required for the protection of
                 water quality and water reservoirs and areas required for the protection and
                 enhancement of air quality."
         As evidenced by these provisions, an Open Space Element must address a wide range of
         interacting issues. Resolution of the issues may involve difficult choices between
         competing objectives. One common objective, however, in the evaluation of these
         issues, is to safeguard and protect significant open space lands.
B.      Conservation Element
         The Government Code defines a Conservation Element as intended for the conservation,
         development, and utilization of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force,
         forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other
         natural resources. The Conservation Element may also cover any of the following: 1) the
         reclamation of land and waters; 2) flood control; 3) prevention and control of the
        pollution of streams and other waters; 4) regulation of the use of land in stream channels
         and other areas required for the accomplishment of the conservation plan; 5) prevention,
         control and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches and shores; 6) protection of
         watersheds; and 7) location, quantity and quality of the rock, sand and gravel resources.
         The scope of issues for this element is somewhat narrower than that of the Open Space
         Element. The majority of Conservation Element issues can be categorized under two of
        the four Open Space Element areas of concern: "Managed Production of Resources" and
         "Public Health and Safety." These Conservation Element issues are not specifically
        related to land, but rather are oriented toward assuring that the consumption and
        utilization of natural resources is undertaken wisely. By combining the Open Space and
         Conservation Elements, the City can approach these issues in a comprehensive manner.
Scope of Issues
The legislative parameters for open space and conservation concerns are relatively broad and
include a number of issues that do not apply in all jurisdictions of the State. The Government
Code specifies that the General Plan need address the nine mandated elements only "to the extent
that the subject of the element exists in the planning area." Accordingly, the principal emphasis
is placed on issues relating to the City's coastal and hillside settings, its large areas of hillside
open space and attendant natural features, and the natural hazards that are associated with the
City's environment. Resources such as large-scale farming and forest areas are not present in the
City and will not be addressed.
History of Laguna Beach Open Space and Conservation Element
Open space and conservation planning was first formally addressed in 1973, when a Citizens
Advisory Committee was formed to provide public input to the City Council in the development
of Open Space and Conservation Elements of the General Plan. These Elements were adopted
on November 2 1,1973, and amended once on June 12,1974.
In the late 1970's, the City became increasingly involved in developing a Local Coastal Plan. As
this effort continued, it became apparent that a number of General Plan elements needed to be
revised to meet the requirements of the Coastal Act. In addition, development pressure in the
City's hillside lands increased the need to define the community's open space values. In
response, the City commissioned a comprehensive biological inventory, which was completed in
 1983. This report, along with the resource valuation conducted for the Local Coastal Plan and
the input from the Open SpaceIConservation Citizens Committee, forms the basis for the new
Open Space/Conservation Element.
Geographic Application
The General Plan covers not only all territory within the City boundaries of Laguna Beach,
including Sycamore Hills, but also may include a "planning area -- any area outside the
jurisdiction's boundaries which, in the planning agency's judgment, "bears direct relation to its
planning." (Government Code Section 65400.)
The planning area for the City encompasses the Laguna Greenbelt,10,000 acres of largely
undeveloped lands surrounding the City (see the Land Use Element for greater detail regarding
the Greenbelt). The Open Space/Conservation Element places special emphasis on this planning
area for the following reasons:
 1.     The boundaries of the planning area generally correlate with the boundaries of the
        Laguna Canyon watershed. Any alterations of the land within the watershed area that
        significantly change runoff characteristics will, in turn, affect the runoff levels and
        flooding potential within the main drainage course of the Canyon. This is a particularly
        significant concern, since the Laguna Canyon drainage channel flows directly through the
        downtown area of the City.
2.      The potential for wildland fires is very high in the hillsides of both the City and the
        planning area. In addition, the planning area is generally situated upwind from the City.
        Under Santa Ana wind conditions this could be a contributing factor to the spread of
        wildland fires.
3.      The visual resources of the City and the planning area are highly similar and the
        viewsheds of the two areas are interrelated. Panoramic vistas from the City's hillsides in
        many instances extend into the planning area. Furthermore, large portions of the
        planning area are visible from Laguna Canyon and El Toro Roads, which are the only
        two routes into Laguna Beach from inland areas.
4.      The open space areas within the City and the planning area are similar with respect to
        landforms, natural vegetation and wildlife habitat characteristics.
5.      The combined hillside areas of the City and the planning area provide an excellent setting
        for numerous outdoor recreational opportunities, such as hiking and equestrian trails, and
        nature preserves.
Relationship to the Local Coastal Plan
The Coastal Zone in Laguna Beach represents some 4.78 square miles of land, encompassing the
entire City limits except for Sycamore Hills, which consists of 522 acres at the intersection of
Laguna Canyon and El Toro Roads, inland of the City. This circumstance requires the City to
prepare a Local Coastal Plan, which incorporates the provisions of the California Coastal Act of
 1976. The City's Local Coastal Plan addresses five principle subjects:
 1.     Recreation and Visitor-Serving Facilities and Uses
2.      Parking and Circulation
3.      Environmentally Sensitive Areas
4.       Shoreline Access
5.      Undeveloped Lands
Given the interrelationship between these subjects and the City's General Plan, the Coastal Plan
has been physically integrated into the Open SpaceIConservation and Land Use Elements. These
General Plan elements contain policies related to the above referenced subjects and are intended
to implement the provisions of the Coastal Act. A complete description and analysis of these
subjects is contained in a separate document which serves as a technical appendix to the General
Plan. By consolidating the substantive issues of the Coastal Plan into the General Plan, the City
is able to achieve an internally consistent long-range planning program, while responding to the
mandate of the Coastal Act and interests of the local citizenry.
Citizen Participation
Public participation has traditionally performed a valuable function in the planning process,
particularly in reflecting community values and goals. In Laguna Beach, public participation in
the Open Space and Conservation Element began in 1980, with an Open SpaceIConservation
Committee, which was one of five citizen advisory committees appointed to study the various
elements of the General Plan. The committee's ideas and recommendations were particularly
important in the development of this Element and in establishing community goals and policies.
Organization of the Open SpaceIConservationElement
The Element is divided into six sections. The first section introduces the document, and provides
the history and background of open space planning in Laguna Beach. The second section
identifies open space and conservation resources and discusses their importance to the City.
Section 3 consists of a series of issue statements followed by policies that set forth the manner in
which the City will deal with the issue. Section 4 describes the relationship of the Land Use
Element Map to Open SpaceIConservation regulations. Section 5 outlines the actions that will
be necessary to implement the policies in the Element, and Section 6 describes the environmental
impacts of the Element.
Section 65300.5 of the Government Code requires the various elements of a General Plan to be
internally consistent and compatible in terms of community goals and policies. For this reason,
the Open SpaceIConservation Element must be read and implemented in context to the City's
other General Plan elements. The Land Use Element is an especially important counterpart to
this Element, providing the basic structure for the location and distribution of future
development.

LAND IN THE COMMUNITY.
SECTION 2 - PHYSICAL SETTING
Historical Background
The historic development pattern of the City, resulting from Mexican land grants and the
topography of the area, has played a significant role in its existing distribution of open space.
During the 1840fs,Laguna Beach was excluded from the two surrounding land grants (the Irvine
and Moulton ranches). The exclusion of this area resulted in Laguna Beach being subject to
homestead claims once California became a state. Had this not occurred, it is highly unlikely
that Laguna Beach would have developed in its present location or pattern. It is more likely the
City would have been retained under one ownership and may have remained undeveloped, as did
the surrounding land grants.
Between 1875 and 1879, the Laguna Beach area was first surveyed by individual surveyors
under contract to the Department of the Interior. Once these survey maps were filed, it allowed
homestead claims within this area. By the 18801s,homestead claims had been filed on most of
the coastal plain. These first homesteads were large and dispersed, providing an abundance of
open space.
During the late 1880's and early 19001s,Laguna Beach became increasingly popular as a vacation
and resort town. As a result, landowners began to capitalize on this popularity by subdividing
their property. The first subdivision in Laguna Beach occurred in 1887, followed by a number of
subdivisions establishing a pattern of smaller lots intended for vacation homes. These
subdivisions occurred on the flatter portions of the City.
In 1911, subdivision in the City shifted from the coastal plain to the hilltops of Arch Beach
Heights. This subdivision of Arch Beach Heights created nearly 1900 (25' x 100') lots which
were plotted on a map without any apparent consideration for the steep topography of the area.
In fact, street access to these lots was nonexistent at the time of the subdivisions. Access was not
developed until the 19301s, when some street improvements were constructed. The
Diamondcrestview area, situated adjacent to Arch Beach Heights on less steep terrain, was
subdivided in 1925, creating approximately 200 lots. Similar to Arch Beach Heights, the
Diamondcrestview subdivision (Tract 764) was plotted without regard for the topography and
without access except for paper streets. Many of the problems (including substandard lots,
access constraints and environmental hazards) still exist today, resulting in a number of these lots
remaining unbuildable due to conflicts with current development standards.
These two areas were the only major hillside subdivisions for quite some time. By the mid-
1920's most of the coastal plain was subdivided. During the 30 years following these initial
subdivisions, most development activity in Laguna Beach involved primarily infilling on the
coastal plain and lower hills, leaving those areas less suitable for development vacant as open
space.
Development and subdivision activity during the late 1950's and mid-1960's was primarily
concentrated on the City's ridgelines, hilltops and hillsides, leaving less accessible hillsides,
ridgelines and canyon bottoms vacant. Today these lands account for a large majority of the
City's open space.
Existing; Geographic Conditions
The City of Laguna Beach is situated in a truly unusual setting uncommon elsewhere in the
County of Orange. This is due largely to both the location of the City as a seaside community
and its physical elements, which are characterized by numerous open space resources. There are
three primary physiographic characteristics that make up the existing pattern of open space
within Laguna Beach.
A.      Pacific Coastline. The City's shoreline extends for approximately 4.2 linear miles.
        Coastline improvements include 29 public beach accessways and 14.7 acres of oceanfront
        parks and viewing platforms, provided and maintained by the City of Laguna Beach
B.      Coastal Plain. The coastal plain lies between the ocean bluff tops and the base of the San
        Joaquin Hills. Existing open space on the coastal plain consists of City parks and a few
        isolated areas of undeveloped land, such as the Bluebird Canyon natural drainage course.
        Although major open space resources are limited, an abundance of trees, shrubs and
        vegetation within the coastal plain provides a natural, park-like setting in many areas.
         This limited amount of open space is due primarily to the absence of legislation (during
         the City's early development stage) that would have enabled the City to require parkland
         dedication. Prior to the enactment of State legislation (Quimby Act) in 1973, the
         dedication of parkland was left to the discretion of the subdivider or developer.
         Additionally, due to the relatively flat topography of the coastal plain, this area was the
         most suitable for building, with very little land spared for open space.
         Limitations in the amount of open space are offset somewhat by the close proximity and
         accessibility of beaches, the curvilinear streets interspersed with natural drainage courses
         and densely vegetated yards, and the surrounding background of vacant hillsides.
C.      Hillsides and Canyons. The majority of the City's natural open space is contained within
        the undeveloped hillsides of Laguna Beach, refer to map entitled "Inventory of Open
        Space and Vacant Land." Most of this open space (1,065 acres) is divided into large
        privately owned parcels, many of which may have future subdivision potential and may
        not always be left as open space. However, a significant portion of the City's vacant
        hillsides may not be developable, due to steep slopes and geological constraints. Sixty-
        five to 75 percent of the City's vacant hillsides consists of slopes of 45 percent or greater.
        The City's open space resources possess important aesthetic and recreational value, and
        provide vital wildlife and vegetative habitats. In addition, the undeveloped hillsides
        contribute greatly to the community identity that distinguishes Laguna Beach fiom
        surrounding communities.
D.      Regional Open Space Lands. In addition to open space lands within the City, the
        surrounding hillsides -- situated outside the City limits, but within the City's planning
        area -- are a major part of the community's natural open space, (see Map 3-1). This area,
        whose boundary generally corresponds with the Laguna Greenbelt, exhibits a wide
        variety of topographic, geologic, biotic and aesthetic features of regional and even state
        significance.
        Formal efforts to preserve the surrounding hillsides and canyons as open space began in
        May 1968 with the formation of the Laguna Greenbelt Committee. The purpose of this
        committee was to "advocate the preservation of greenbelt open space in advance of
        sprawling urbanization." As an outgrowth of this committee, a variety of individuals and
        groups were established to bring their environmental concerns to the attention of local
        and regional policymakers. As a result of these efforts, the Laguna Greenbelt has been
        identified in the Orange County Open Space Element as a priority area and has been
        recognized in the City's 1974 Open Space Element as an area which should be retained
        for its natural beauty.
        The majority of the Laguna Greenbelt is under the jurisdiction of Orange County. Most
        of this natural open space is undeveloped; however, increasing growth pressures within
        the County may result in development of portions of this area. A number of projects with
        varying degrees of intensity have already been approved or are currently proposed for
        portions of this open space. Areas to the west and east of the City limits, however, have
        been set aside as permanent open space (Crystal Cove State Park and Aliso Creek
        Greenbelt). The City's role in further preservation of the surrounding hillsides as open
        space is limited, due to the absence of direct jurisdictional control. Nevertheless, this
        area is a significant element of the community's open space system, for which the City
        monitors planning activities and discourages residential and commercial development.
Functions of Oven Space
The preservation of open space is necessary for a variety of reasons. Some of these encompass
physical characteristics such as natural ecosystems and passive agricultural uses, while others
involve less tangible factors such as aesthetic and educational benefits. Presented below is a
discussion of some of the principal open space values of importance in Laguna Beach, and their
role in open space planning.
A.      Aesthetic Function
        The range of aesthetic values is very broad. However, it is possible to identifl some
        basic characteristics of open space that serve important aesthetic functions.
                     Scenic beauty, such as landscapes that exhibit lush or colorful vegetation or
               other features that are visually attractive on the basis of their appearance alone.
                    Uniqueness, such as landscapes that are found in limited abundance within the
               surrounding region or which exhibit unusual physical features.

               Stature, such as relief features that are particularly bold, imposing, prominent
         or distinctive.
          +   Vastness of scale, such as homogenous landscapes that extend across a distant
         or sweeping horizon.
               Contrast or symmetry, such as landscapes with component features whose
         highly diversified or consistently similar patterns create an interesting and
         compelling visual effect.
   Since most people have an active appreciation of these values, aesthetics is a widely cited
   and commonly accepted reason for preserving open space. The actual task of planning
   for open space on the basis of aesthetics can often be difficult, however, since aesthetic
   appreciation is largely subjective. As a result, it is usually necessary to develop
   parameters of significant aesthetic value.
B. Ecological Function
   All natural open space areas support a specific range of vegetative and wildlife species
   that continuously adapt to prevailing climatic and environmental conditions. In turn, the
   various life forms within a habitat area develop interdependencies, primarily related to
   their food supply. A well-balanced relationship between plants and animals in a fixed
   environment creates an ecosystem or sensitive biological community.
   When an ecosystem is left undisturbed, it usually exists in a state of equilibrium, with all
   of the component vegetative and wildlife species able to sustain them in adequate
   numbers. When an open space area is converted to urban uses, the entire ecosystem,
   which occupied that area can be lost. If only a portion of a particular habitat area is
   developed, or if the area is only partially altered, it is still possible for substantial and
   irreparable damage to be caused to some or all segments of the ecosystem.
   Comprehensive management, therefore, is critical to the stability and propagation of
   biotic resources.
   Since field biologists are capable of evaluating the quality and sensitivity of ecosystems
   with a relatively high degree of accuracy, it is possible to develop specific programs for
   preserving open space on the basis of its ecological value. Such a program normally
   entails providing protection to those open space areas which, if developed or altered,
   would result in significant losses of rare or sensitive ecological habitats and ecosystems,
   or important species of vegetation and wildlife.
C. Educational Function
   The earth and its resources are the subjects of numerous fields of academic study and
   research, including biology, geology, geomorphology, archaeology and paleontology.
   Certain open space areas may possess particular resources or features that are important
   to each of these fields. Examples of such areas would include a rare or complex
   ecosystem habitat, an area where unusual geologic formations have been exposed, or an
   area where important deposits of fossils and artifacts are known to exist. By preserving
   such significant areas as open space, they can continue to be available for important
   educational study and research.
   With respect to open space planning, the educational values of open space are not often
   considered as a primary reason for preservation except in very significant cases. In many
   instances, however, open space areas of educational value may also possess other values;
   (i.e., ecological, aesthetic).
D. Protective Function
   Nature can pose threats to both life and property in the form of such hazards as floods,
   earthquakes, landslides, wildfires and severe ocean tides. In attempting to protect against
   losses from such events, the strategic preservation of open space can be of significant
   value. A few basic variations of open space management can be used according to the
   nature of the hazard in question.
   In the case of hazards such as floods and landslides, use and development of such hazard
   areas can be restricted. The level of restriction may vary, based upon a hazardous event's
   likelihood of occurrence andfor its potential severity. Where very high hazards exist,
   such as in an area of highly unstable geologic conditions, all types of development may
   be prohibited.
   In the case of hazards such as wildfires where very large areas are exposed to high but
   not necessarily imminent risks, open space can be used for protection by utilizing buffer
   strips around the periphery of developed areas. This function alone may be the basis for
   preservation of open space.
E. Recreational Function
   Almost every type of outdoor recreational activity requires some form of open space for
   its conduct. Consequently, the recreational value of open space is widely recognized.
   Over recent decades, the amount of available leisure time has generally increased while
   the spectrum of popular outdoor recreational activities has also expanded. This has
   further affected the need for more and different types of recreational open space.
   Natural open space primarily accommodates activities that fall under the broad category
   of "outdoor activities," including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, water sports and
   nature appreciation. In most instances, planning for natural open space recreation is a
   matter of preserving areas that provide settings suited to these activities.
In the case of improved open space such as urban parks, recreation is usually one, if not
the most important, of its intended functions. Parks normally provide settings and
facilities for both active uses such as athletics and passive activities such as picnicking
and view appreciation. Planning for parks can be based on characteristics related to a
site, such as a particularly scenic setting. More often, however, park sites are determined
on the basis of where the greatest range of uses and facilities can be accommodated and
where the greatest need and best accessibility exists.

SECTION 3 - ISSUE STATEMENTS & POLICIES
TOPIC 1:        COASTAL LAND FEATURES
Background
The distinctive and diversified physical composition of Laguna's coastline is the product of
natural phenomena working over centuries of time. These forces generally include:
 1.     Uplifting movements (folding and faulting) that have created an emergent coastline with
        elevated relief along most portions of the coast.
2.      Natural weathering and erosion forces, most prominent being the ocean surf, which have
        reduced and sculpted the built-up landforms.
3.      The presence of a wide variety of bedrock compositions, ranging from soft siltstone to
        resistant volcanic rocks, which have allowed the erosion forces to considerably reduce
        some portions of the coastline, while other portions continue to stand boldly.
These factors have created numerous physical features that vary in prominence, height, scale and
ruggedness, and cause the outline of Laguna's coastline to range from smooth and elliptical to
jagged and irregular.
Issue Identification and Analysis
Laguna's coastline is composed of various types of land formations that warrant special
consideration and protection because of their unique physical appearance. These include
landforms such as cliffs, headlands, bluffs and caves; and rock formations, such as wave-cut
benches, coves, arches, blowholes and islands and other offshore outcroppings. Several portions
of Laguna's coastline are composed of relatively weak bedrock materials that are susceptible to
accelerated erosion processes. Because of their weak properties, these areas have already been
eroded and now take the form of low, cascading bluffs and cliffs. Not only are these areas
particularly susceptible to deterioration from nature, but man-made improvements can also
jeopardize their stability.
The many sandy beaches of Laguna's coast are a unique sensitive natural resource. The creation
of beaches is a complicated process involving the actions of surf and ocean currents. The
process is also a cyclical one, with high tides in the winter washing sands out to sea and then
replenishing them during the milder conditions of summer. Under normal circumstances, these
seasonal losses and gains balance out over the course of the seasons. Extraordinary tidal
occurrences, however, can cause some natural imbalance in the replenishment process.
The replenishment process is also susceptible to the interference of man. Such activities as
dredging and the construction of levees and breakwaters can deplete supplies of sand or disturb
the north-south drifting pattern of the sand along the prevailing direction of the ocean currents
(littoral drift). Due to the sensitivity of the coastal environment and dynamics of ocean waves,
tides and currents, the design and construction of seawalls or other coastal features must consider
state-of-the-art technology, designed by qualified professionals.
In attempting to provide for the continued healthy replenishment of the City's beach sand,
activities which pose a potential threat must be regulated along the City's own coastline and the
activities up-shore fkom the City must also be monitored.
The qualities of the coastline that make it valuable as open space also serve to significantly
increase the demand for its acquisition and development. The fact that the coastline is a
physically limited resource further impacts this demand, creating competitive interests between
open space and development.
Planning for coastal open space should attempt to achieve a balance between the need for
restricted and undisturbed open space areas, the need to make open space areas available for
public use, and the interests of private property owners. This requires identification of those
particular areas or features that are needed for an open space use and the type and degree of
regulation that is practical and feasible. Whether an open space area is under private or public
ownership particularly influences the direction that can be pursued, since the level of
discretionary control over private property is limited. This factor is particularly pertinent in
Laguna Beach, since the large majority of the land adjacent to the City's coastline is under
private ownership.
                                              POLICIES
1A       Monitor other jurisdictions' activities, which may affect the natural sand replenishment
         process in Laguna Beach.
1B       Require the use of drought-resistant plantings and natural vegetation to reduce irrigation
         practices.
1C       Require the installation of rain gutters and other water transport devices as a condition of
         approval on blufftop development, in order to convey water to the street (away from the
         bluff side). When this is impractical, all water shall be piped to the base of the bluff.
1D       Develop measures to control and limit irrigation of coastal bluff properties in a consistent
         manner and institute procedures to adopt these measures by ordinance.
1E       Prohibit the construction of buildings and other man-made structures on the sandy portion
         of the beach unless necessary for public health and safety.
1F Shoreline protective devices which may adversely affect the sand supply or cause an
   adverse impact to shoreline processes shall not be approved unless the situation is one in
   which there is clear evidence that the existing structure(s) are in danger from erosion and
   when designed to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply
   and unless all feasible alternatives have been explored.
1G Establish an ordinance prohibiting climbing on coastal bluffs in non-designated areas
   and/or initiate an ecological signing program depicting the significance of bluff
   environments and potential damage to them inflicted by human activity.
1H Require Design Review for all blufftop development.
1I The City shall impose a 25-foot minimum setback or a distance ascertained by stringline
   measurements for all blufftop development, notwithstanding the fact that ecological and
   environmental constraints may require an additional setback.
1J In order to maintain stable channel sections and the present level of beach sand
   replenishment, sediment movement in natural drainage channels shall not be significantly
   changed.
TOPIC 1.5: SEAWALL AND OTHER SHORE PROTECTION DEVICES
Backmound
The construction of seawall and other coastal protection devices has caused substantial
community interest especially since the severe storms and high tides of 1983. In recognition of
the complex nature of shoreline protection needs, the Laguna Beach City Council commissioned
a special study that examined the characteristics of the local beach sand resource and formulated
policies for the evaluation of the shoreline protective devices. This study, entitled Guidelinesfor
Shoreline Protection, was adopted by a Resolution of the City Council and serves as the
technical background and identifies issues for the following policies that specifically address
shoreline projects. Any development applications, including grading projects that are subject to
discretionary review shall be reviewed for consistency with these policies.
                                             POLICIES
1.5A The shoreline environment should remain in a natural state unless existing, substantial
        improvements are in imminent danger from erosion, flooding or collapse. "Imminent
        Danger" is defined as a short-range threat from the immediate to a maximum range of
        three (3) to five (5) years. A threat presented in the context of geologic time shall not
        constitute imminent danger.
1.5B Structural protective solutions should not be approved for ancillary or appurtenant
        improvements to the main structure, or for unimproved land, unless they are found to be
        in the public interest.
1.5C An investigation of reasonable and feasible alternatives that accomplish the same, or
        similar, level of protection must be provided with every application for the construction
        of a shore-protection device. In the required consideration of alternatives, the lead
        project shall be the one with the least significant impact to the shoreline environment
        unless a statement of overriding considerations is adopted pursuant to CEQA Guidelines.
1.5D Enhancement and/or restoration of the natural shoreline setting without the use of
        structural devices shall be considered as an alternative and implemented whenever
        feasible.
1.5E    Reconstruction or substantial alterations to existing shore protective devices that have not
        performed adequately should not be approved unless those causative factors will be
        corrected in substantial compliance with the Guidelines for Shoreline Protection.
1.5F    Lateral public beach access easements shall be offered for dedication consistent with
        Policy 3G of this Element and with prevailing law as a condition of permit approval for
        shore protection devices.
Unless found to be in the interest of public safety and/or welfare and in the interest of
protecting existing habitable structures, devices that create a net loss in beach width shall
not be approved. A determination as to "net loss" is to be based on the pre-event beach
measurement in the case of abrupt erosion or seacliff failure.
Construction and grading activities on the beach shall be staged and phased to minimize
interference with public use.
Beach sand shall not be used as a construction material, nor shall it be regraded for the
purpose of enhancing, protecting or buttressing individual private properties unless
material is imported from a City-approved site.
Beach area created by avulsion and/or wave induced erosion should not be reclaimed for
private use unless the only feasible alternative for the protection of pre-existing, habitable
structures requires encroachment thereon.
The visual impact of a protective device should be minimized if the structure is .sited next
to or at the seacliff. As the structure encroaches onto the beach, the visual impact will
increase accordingly, thereby suggesting nontechnical as well as technical reasons for
reducing the encroachment.
A protective device will best blend into the seacliff when its surface texture, including
shape, size and roughness elements, most nearly duplicate that of the seacliff. A similar
surface roughness will also be in accordance with the wave reflection criterion discussed
in the Guidelines for Shoreline Protection.
In order to blend with the natural appearance of the shoreline, seacliff colors should be
duplicated in seacliff protective devices as well as in other shoreline structures.
Walkways, stairs and railings are often painted in contrasting colors that stand out
obtrusively from a distance, whereas a similar color would render them almost invisible
from a distance of several hundred feet. In most places the surface of a protective device
will be impacted by waves only infrequently. Consideration should be given to covering
devices with a non-structural, sacrificial surface that will have to be replaced whenever
damaged by waves or vandals. The surface cover could consist of imported earth, sand
or a cover of vegetation.
Any proposed protection scheme must be accompanied by an assessment as to whether it
can serve its intended purpose without detriment to adjoining properties or the sandy
beach.
Any coastal engineering report prepared pursuant to the Guidelines shall include a
recommendation as to the design event (i.e., 25-year, 50-year or 100-year) being
considered for a specific protective device and the property owner shall record a deed
restriction estimating its useful and anticipated service life, as well as any maintenance
requirements identified in Policy 1.5Q below.
1.5P The owner, successors and assigns of shore protective devices shall adequately maintain
     such device and assure its structural integrity, maintain its approved appearance, and shall
     absolve the City of any liability arising out of its location, placement and construction.
1.5Q Any development application for shoreline construction shall be reviewed with respect to
     the criteria contained in the Guidelines for Shoreline Protection, including the effects of
     beach encroachment, wave reflection, reduction in seacliff sand contribution, end effects
     and aesthetic criteria.
 .5R Due to the oftentimes unexpected and sudden onslaught of damaging waves, whether
     associated with a regional storm system or not, observance of the above policies may be
     temporarily suspended under an emergency declaration by the proper local authorities.
     The design principles, however, shall be observed to the maximum extent feasible in
     order to preclude the need for costly alterations or removal of structures once an
     emergency has abated. Any structure placed under emergency conditions shall be
     classified as temporary and the project sponsor shall be responsible for its removal if a
     regular permit, processed in accordance with applicable regulations, is not obtained.
1.5s In order to validate and update the data contained in the Guidelines for Shoreline
     Protection, the City should maintain a beach profile and seacliff retreat monitoring
     program, investigate funding methods for beach-fill projects and identify a candidate site
     for a test beach-fill project. An on-going monitoring program is essential for the
     development of a comprehensive technical data base for future actions that may be
     needed to protect beach width and quality and to test the accuracy of assumptions and
     predictions contained in the Guidelines.
1.5T Since the long-term stability of shoreline properties can be influenced to a great extent by
     the occurrence of groundwater, whether fiom natural sources or induced by irrigation,
     development applications for shore protective devices should be accompanied by
     landscape plans that emphasize the use of natural and drought-tolerant vegetation. The
     use of irrigation systems shall be limited to low-flow techniques specifically designed to
     minimize and limit the application of water and meet irrigation needs only as necessary to
     establish and maintain such vegetation. Shore protective devices shall include drainage
     and de-watering systems as necessary to maintain slope stability and to prevent soil
     erosion.
TOPIC 2:        TIDE POOLS AND MARINE HABITATS
Background
The shoreline of Laguna Beach is characterized by sandy shores, protected coves and exposed
headlands that collectively form the Coastal Intertidal Zone (the area between the high and low
water marks). Tide pools that trap water when the tide goes out characterize the Intertidal Zone,
creating self-contained pools. Rich in oxygen and providing an abundant food supply, these
tidepools support many species of seaweed, barnacles, anemones, worms, snails, sea slugs,
periwinkles, starfish and mussels. While some species, such as the blind goby, spend their entire
lives in tidepools, other creatures depend on the tidepools during some part of their life cycle,
either for spawning during their juvenile years, or in the later stages of their lives.
A small estuary occurs at the mouth of Aliso Creek. As recently as 1976 this estuary supported
the Tidewater Goby, a species considered uncommon and declining in numbers due to habitat
loss.
A resource inventory included in the Orange County Conservation Element identifies the
presence of the South Laguna Marine Life Refuge in the South Laguna area (Figure 3 in the
Addendum). The refuge, near the mouth of Aliso Creek, was given refuge status by the
California Fish and Game Commission because the animal populations in the rocky intertidal
habitat had not been subjected to the collecting pressures that had occurred in other areas along
the South Coast. The California Department of Fish and Game has indicated a concern regarding
a potential impact in sediment-laden storm water runoff from Aliso Creek watershed or
organisms found in the South Laguna Marine Life Refuge. Rocky shore areas, which are
important intertidal areas, are present in South Laguna.
Issue Identification and Analysis
A.      Environmental Sensitivitv: The Intertidal Zone of the City's shoreline is a complex and
        diversified habitat, relying on the natural ecological balance for its life and propagation.
        The sensitivity of these habitats and their importance to the overall coastal ecology must
        not be underestimated. At the same time, however, the Intertidal Zone and tide pool
        environments are particularly vulnerable to abuse and degradation by human activity.
        Tourism: Over the years, increasing numbers of tourists, laden with buckets, jars and
        plastic bags, has curiously collected plant and animal life from the shoreline, gradually
        depleting supplies (outpacing natural replenishment) and disrupting their sensitive
        ecological balance. The fact that much of the shoreline in Laguna Beach is accessible to
        the public has resulted in the diminishment of many intertidal marine species such as
        starfish, snails, limpets and abalone.
        Educational Training: Public and private schools for many years have instructed their
        students through various forms of conservation education, sometimes including field trips
        along the City's coastline. Because marine resources and tide pools are relatively few in
   number, inadvertent damage or destruction of these fragile habitats frequently occurs
   where rocks are overturned or marine specimens temporarily removed for observation.
   The intentional exploitation or destruction of marine life is of course irresponsible. But
   even the legitimate use of collecting for scientific and educational purposes can seriously
   deplete marine species in tide pools, if collecting is not carefully regulated and performed
   in a conscientious manner.
B. Government Remlations: The Intertidal Zone along the shoreline of Laguna Beach has
   experienced a visible depreciation of plant and animal life as interest and use in public
   beaches continues to grow. In an effort to preserve this valuable natural resource, the
   City initiated action to create an environment whereby the Intertidal Zone would be
   protected and allowed to regain a natural ecological balance. In cooperation with the
   State Department of Fish and Game, a Marine Preserve was created by the State in 1968
   for a portion of the City's shoreline particularly rich in tidepool life. The Marine Preserve
   or Marine Life Refuge, is protected by State law and is intended to preserve tidepool life.
   The boundaries and major access points to the refuge areas are posted with signs for
   identification and protection of the pools. Although protected by the California Fish and
   Game Code, certain game fish, including crustaceans and mollusks, may be removed
   from a refuge area with a Sport Fishing license pursuant to California Sport Fishing
   Regulations.
    In addition to the Marine Preserve, the State, in conjunction with the City, established an
    Ecological Reserve in 1974, creating, in essence, a marine sanctuary, or a protected
    "aquarium." The Ecological Reserve, which is demarcated by buoys and shore markers,
    differs from the Marine Life Refuge in that public access to Reserves is restricted and
    marine life, plants, large fish, shells or rocks cannot be removed or disturbed except as
    authorized by Fish and Game Regulations (i.e., for scientific study or research purposes).
    The diminishing natural habitat of intertidal life, which once flourished along the coast of
    Laguna Beach and Southern California should, over time, replenish due to the protection
    afforded by designated preserve areas. The keynote, however, to a successful program
    must include proper monitoring and enforcement, coupled with an effective education
    program emphasizing the value, sensitivity and complexity of intertidal environments.
                                        POLICIES
2A Encourage the expansion of the Marine Life Refuges and the designation of particularly
   unique or ecologically sensitive coastal areas as Ecological Reserves (such as seal and
   bird rocks), pursuant to the provisions of the State Department of Fish and Game.
2B Initiate procedures to post signs at the boundaries of tide pools, marine life refuges and
   ecological reserves that clearly denote their ecological significance and the penalty for
   disturbing these natural environments.
2C Promote educational programs aimed at heightening the awareness and appreciation of
   marine resources, utilizing the Marine Safety Department and enlisting support from
   volunteer groups.
2D As part of the City's resource management program, include provisions for monitoring of
   tidepools to ensure a proper balance between public beach access and the preservation of
   marine resources.
2E Solicit interest from university faculty and students with expertise in marine ecology to
   study and evaluate tidepools, including changes in their ecological characteristics.
2F Develop a local enforcement program, pending funding availability, consisting of
   shoreline protection regulations and Citation authority for Marine Safety personnel.
2G Support non-profit organizations which provide care and rehabilitation of marine life.
2H Support restoration of offshore kelp beds.
TOPIC 3:        PUBLIC BEACHES AND SHORELINE ACCESS
Background
Laguna Beach is a major visitor destination, attract-nearly three million tourists annually. The
popularity of the City imposes significant demand on the community's shoreline recreational
facilities with summer beach attendance. Sometimes exceeding 30,000 people daily. The City
has attempted to maximize shoreline access and accommodate the demands of recreation users
by providing abundant beach access opportunities. This accommodation, however, can produce
adverse environmental effects in the community if not properly balanced and monitored. These
effects may include damage or destruction of fragile coastal resources such as coastal bluffs, tide
pools and marine life, increase in traffic congestion, inefficient circulation, increase in street
parking demands, competition for street parking among various user groups, and overtaxing of
public services such as lifeguard and beach patrols. Maintenance of beach areas, restrooms and
related support facilities may also tax the City's resources.
Laguna Beach currently provides numerous opportunities for direct physical access to the
shoreline. It presently maintains 29 improved public beach accessways, providing recreational
opportunities to nearly 47 acres of sandy beach spanning 4.3 lineal miles of coastline (Map 3-2
and Table 3-1 depicts the inventory of existing access points). In addition, the City supports
several oceanfront parks and viewing platforms, totaling 14.7 acres. These facilities include
Main Beach Park (2.64 acres); Heisler Park (1 1.02 acres); Crescent Bay Park (0.80 acres); Oak
Street Viewpoint (0.02 acres); and Ruby Street and Thalia Street Viewpoints (0.1 1 acres). Main
Beach Park, which is situated in the heart of the downtown area, is especially popular with
residents and visitors alike. The park features an oceanfront boardwalk, landscaped lawns,
benches and tables, basketball and volleyball courts, children's play equipment and restroom
facilities.
With the exception of Irvine Cove and Rockledge, which are private residential communities
located in the north and south reaches of the City respectively, public beach access is available
along virtually the City's entire shoreline. The longest distance between access points is
approximately 1,000 feet along the central bluffs. In the south end of Laguna Beach, vertical
access is provided at every road-end adjoining the beach, or approximately every 200-300 feet.
Pedestrian access is also provided at each of the coves in north Laguna (except for Irvine Cove).
Issue Identification and Analysis
Pressures for the utilization of the City's beaches will continue to grow as the population of
Laguna Beach and South Orange County increases. Unrestricted use and access to these beaches
may, over time, impose demands beyond their threshold capacities, resulting in significant
environmental effects. The realization of new access opportunities, however, may relieve some
of these impending pressures by dispersing the demand to other areas. For example, future
regional park facilities such as Crystal Cove State Park and Aliso Creek County Park, located
immediately north and south of the City respectively, could offset some of the beach recreational
demand in Laguna Beach.

As part of the Local Coastal Program, four areas currently without access in the City were
examined for the possibility of establishing beach access.
Rockledge: Rockledge is a small residential area situated immediately adjacent to South Coast
Highway at the south end of the City between Moss Point and Victoria Beach. The
neighborhood is composed of approximately 24 oceanfront homes; two properties remain vacant.
A small natural cove is situated at the base of the bluffs. Public access to this cove is currently
unavailable due to existing development patterns and physical barriers such as steep bluffs and
rocky headlands to the north and south. The restricted access and undisturbed nature of the Cove
has produced a marine environment particularly rich in plant and animal life, including tide pools
abundant with ocean specimens.
Although public access may be physically possible because the bluffs are reported.1~in stable
condition (F. Beach Leighton Geologic Constraint and Land Use Capability Study, 1975), the
area is without essential support facilities such as restrooms and lifeguard services and suitable
public parking opportunities. Public access to Rockledge may also compromise the ecological
integrity of the area unless properly policed and managed.
Central Bluffs: Located on the south side of South Coast Highway between Laguna Avenue and
Sleepy Hollow Lane, the Central Bluffs occupies some 2.5 acres of oceanfront property situated
within walking distance of the City's central business district. The Central Bluffs, which rise
nearly vertically some 50 feet above sea level, is comprised of 20 lots under seven separate
ownerships. This area supports a mixture of development, including older single family
residences and small commerciall professional uses. Four properties, comprising approximately
29,000 square feet in area, remain vacant. A new time share project was approved by the City in
1982 which featured 25 time share units, 3,698 square feet of commercial space, 475 Square feet
of administrative space and 5,900 square feet of exterior pedestrian walkways. This project is
situated on the southeastern edge of the Central Bluffs, adjacent to the intersection of South
Coast Highway and Legion Street. In 1984 the City Council adopted an ordinance which now
prohibits time-share uses in the City. The City's General Plan and Zoning designate the Central
Bluffs for tourist/commercial development. The City, however, is pursuing a comprehensive
specific plan for the Central Bluffs, pursuant to the policies in the Land Use Element. This plan
will eventually establish new land use and development standards.
Public beach access is available in the vicinity of the Central Bluffs with accessways found at the
terminus of Laguna Avenue and Sleepy Hollow Lane. There is a distance of approximately
1,000 feet between these access points, which enables lateral access to the Central Bluffs from
points north and south. Main Beach Park, which provides restroom facilities and lifeguard
services, is situated a short distance north of the Bluffs, within easy walking distance.
Several well-traveled paths lead down the face of the Central Bluffs to the shoreline, suggesting
that this location is a popular route to the beach. Unauthorized use of these trails, however, has
presented a serious health and safety hazard and noticeable erosion of the bluff face. Because
the bluffs may contain unstable geologic formations and slide potential, continued climbing on
the bluff face may aggravate this situation. Improved public access at this location, however,
may retard the rate of bluff erosion by restricting access to a stairway constructed over the bluff
face.
Crescent Bay: Crescent Bay is a picturesque cove located in north Laguna Beach between
Shaw's Cove and Emerald Bay. The beach is accessible to the public by an existing stairway and
ramp located toward the south end of the bay. The beach supports public restroom facilities and
City lifeguard services.
Existing topographic constraints and geologic conditions have effectively prohibited beach
access at the north end of Crescent Bay. According to a geologic report prepared in 1976 for the
Crescent Bay Park Improvement Project, "No structures of any type should be planned on the
steep wave cut cliffs or the bedrock beach at the base of the cliffs." In addition to the precipitous
nature of the bluffs, the shoreline in north Crescent Bay is composed of rocks with minimal
beach area. Due to this circumstance and in recognition of the prominent location of the bluffs,
the City constructed Crescent Bay Park in 1980 on the bluffs overlooking Crescent Bay. The
park features landscaping, improved walking trails with hand rails, and a viewing platform which
affords a commanding view of the bay, the Pacific coastline and Seal Rock, a small offshore
island haven for sea lions and birds.
Irvine Cove: Irvine Cove is a small private residential community located between Emerald Bay
and El Morro Cove at the north end of Laguna Beach. The neighborhood is subdivided into 60
lots, the majority of which support single-family residences.
The Cove contains approximately four acres of sandy beach which during high tides is
sometimes divided into two areas, separated by a large rock outcropping. Direct beach access is
provided by an existing stairway used by residents of the neighborhood. There are two restroom
facilities at the shoreline and five parking spaces located at the point of access to the beach.
Access to the private community is controlled by locked electric gates operated with either a card
key or from a guardhouse. These gates effectively limit beach access to residents of the
neighborhood and their guests. Lateral access opportunities to the shoreline of Irvine Cove are
similarly limited, due to the presence of rocky headlands and steep slopes, heavy vegetation and
private residences.
Although public beach access would expose a larger audience to the coves, such an action would
likely result in significant adverse consequences to the natural environment, including sensitive
tidepools and marine life, bluff and hillside terrain and vegetation.

       implementation Actions of the Local Coastal Program. The purpose of the access
       management program shall be to provide maximum public access consistent with the
       Coastal Act of 1976, taking into account private property rights and site-specific con-
       straints. The access management program shall include the following:
        1. Establishment of hours of public access which shall include, at minimum, the
           hours between sunrise and sunset.
       2. The provision of bicycle racks for a minimum of 25 bicycles at the beach terminus
           of the vertical access-way
       3. The provision of signing at the entrance to the Irvine Cove in order to make the
           public aware of the existence of the accessway and its hours of operation.
       4. Provisions for management of the public areas and facilities by the accepting
           agency or association. Maintenance standards shall be consistent, at a minimum,
           with those in effect at the Cove at the time of acceptance.
       The access management program for Irvine Cove may also include the following
       elements: 1) The accepting agency may charge a reasonable entrance or use fee,
       comparable to those charged by State-and County-operated day use facilities, in order
       to defray costs for maintenance; and 2) The Community Association may be allowed,
       subject to permit approval, to erect small posts, bollards or similar structures at
       reasonable intervals in order to delineate the public recreation areas. Small signs
       describing the uplands as private property may also be allowed, subject to permit
       approval. No fences may be erected on the beach.

   relinquished, and. no more shall be required.
3G Lateral public access along the shoreline shall be assured by requiring as a condition of
   any new development, including approval for new building construction, additions
   greater than 10% to building, variances or subdivisions on property between the first
   public road and the sea, the recordation of an irrevocable offer to dedicate an easement
   for public access and recreational use on and along the beach. The easement shall extend
   fiom the mean high tide line to a specific landward reference point. Depending upon site
   characteristics, that reference point shall be either: a) the seaward extend of the building;
   b) the top of the vertical seawall; c) the intersection of sand and revetment; or d) the toe
   of the bluff.
3H In providing for legal public access, the City shall seek to protect the health and safety of
   residents and property owners consistent with Sections 30211 and 30213 of the Coastal
   Act.
31 Promote acquisition of lateral and vertical beach and bluff top public access where
   appropriate. Development shall not interfere with historic public accessways, unless
   suitable alternate access is provided. The lack of public parking shall not preclude the
   development of an accessway.
35 Base assessment of potential accessways on a priority system. The criteria for the
   priority system shall include consideration of the number of people who can be
   accommodated by the facility, the possibility of safety hazards, the impact of visitation
   on the site, the potential for support facilities and the potential for public transport to the
   site by private automobile, public transit, bicycle or foot. In addition, priority should be
   given to accessways, which facilitate law enforcement and beach maintenance efforts.
3K Determine the maximum acceptable levels of public use and methods by which resource
   values are best protected in areas of existing or potential access where habitat and
   resource protection have been identified as sensitive.
3L Procure public access in South Laguna as shown on Figure 5 (see Addendum A),
   consistent with Coastal Act policies and other legal requirements.
3M The provision, maintenance and enhancement of public non-vehicular access to the
   accessway shall be of primary importance when evaluating hture improvements, both
   public and private.
TOPIC 4:        WATER QUALITY AND CONSERVATION
Background
The preservation and conservation of water resources in Laguna Beach are significant local and
regional concerns. Water is vital to human survival, and plays a significant role in the
recreational, residential, commercial and industrial activities of the community. Water resources
in Laguna Beach consist of both inland water bodies and offshore ocean resources.
Issue Identification and Analysis
Lamna Lakes: Laguna Lakes are located in the vicinity of Laguna Canyon Road north of
Sycamore Hills and are the only known natural fresh water lakes in Orange County. The non-
tidal lake system is filled by seasonal rains and natural and urban runoff. The Lakes are
numbered 1 through 3 from upstream to downstream. Lakes 1 and 2 are on the west side of the
road and Lake 3 is on the east side. Lake 3 is the largest lake and is approximately 12 acres in
size. About 30% (four acres) of Lake 3 is situated within the Laguna Beach City limits and is
owned by the City. The three lakes comprise three biotic communities: fresh water aquatic, fresh
water marsh and riparian habitat. The Lakes support a variety of biotic species including:
microscopic plants; aquatic and semi-aquatic plants such as reeds and willow thickets; migrating
waterfowl and birds, frogs, salamanders; and a variety of mammals such as coyote, gray fox and
mule deer.
The lakes are of local and regional significance. They are the only naturally occurring lakes
within Orange County and are an important habitat for many waterfowl and birds that are not
widely found within the County. The lakes support significant wildlife habitats in the freshwater
marsh and riparian communities, and they possess much regionally uncommon aquatic and
marsh-related vegetation.
Plans have been approved to improve about a 5-mile stretch of Laguna Canyon Road north of El
Toro Road. These improvement plans will generally move this portion of Laguna Canyon Road
to the west, away fiom the lakes and flood plain. It will also widen the highway to two lanes in
each direction and elevate areas prone to flooding. This improvement project will allow Lakes 2
and 3 to be recombined.
Ocean Resources: The Pacific Ocean is one of the most significant physical features of Laguna
Beach, creating about 8 linear miles of coastline and over 100 acres of sandy beach. In addition
to its aesthetic and recreational value, the ocean and tidal zone of Laguna Beach also supports a
wide variety of plant and animal life. This coastal ecology is particularly vulnerable to pollutants
that originate fiom both land and sea. The quality of the ocean water is also susceptible to
degradation from runoff, sedimentation and debris from major urbanized drainage basins such as
Aliso Creek and Laguna Canyon, and from sewer outfalls. Degradation of the coastal water
resources has the potential of significantly disrupting the ecological balance of the area and
adversely affecting tourism.
Oil spills are a particularly serious threat because of their potential for widespread damage. The
Federal, State and County governments all have oil spill contingency plans which are activated
during an oil or toxic chemical spill. These contingency plans are designed to initiate and
expedite the process of clean-up and containment of oil and toxic chemical spills occurring
offshore. These plans establish lead agencies responsible for the clean-up and administrative
support and in some cases technical advice as needed during a major oil spill.
The Orange County Plan, however, differs from the State and National plans in that both these
plans recognize the Environmental Protection Agency or Coast Guard as the lead agency for the
spill response, while the County recognizes the local fire department of the affected jurisdiction
as the lead agency.
The City's role in an oil or chemical spill emergency involves discovery of the spill, taking
immediate action to limit damage and protect the public, notifying the appropriate State and
Federal agencies, and providing support for clean-up operations by private industry.
Water Conservation: Communities can no longer depend entirely upon importing water to meet
increased demand, but instead need to conserve water, thus reducing demand. Several
jurisdictions have addressed this issue by establishing policies and ordinances to require water
conservation. Other methods include reducing water demand in new residential development by
reorienting outdoor space and its landscaping, decreasing lot or lawn size and encouraging
drought-tolerant landscaping through subdivision and landscape ordinances. In addition,
residential water consumption can be reduced through economic and other incentives, building
codes that mandate water saving devices, and public education on water conservation
opportunities.
In Laguna Beach, the Laguna Beach County Water District (LBCWD) conducts a voluntary
water conservation program by encouraging people not to waste water and by promoting the
planting of native plants which use less water. This program is administered as an information
program by printing water conservation messages on water bills and by providing literature on
this subject at the LBCWD office.
Water Quality: Water is necessary for the survival and well being of humans, plants and
wildlife. The beneficial uses of water include, but are not limited to, domestic, agricultural and
industrial consumption supply; power generation; recreation; aesthetic enjoyment; and the
preservation of human, wildlife and plant habitats. The pollution of water is a direct
endangerment to and adversely affects the beneficial uses of water. Conversely, the protection of
the quality of water ensures and promotes the beneficial uses of water.
Urban runoff impairs the beneficial uses of water. The discharge of pollutants from urban storm
water systems into runoff receiving waters impairs or threatens to impair water's beneficial uses.
To help protect the beneficial uses of water, the best "first line of defense" is pollution
prevention at its source. Pollution prevention should be used in conjunction with source control
and treatment Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce or eliminate urban runoff pollution.
The most common categories of pollutants in urban runoff include total suspended solids or
sediment; pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses and protozoa); heavy metals (e.g., copper, lead, zinc,
and cadmium); petroleum products and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons; synthetic organics
(e.g., pesticides, herbicides and PCBs); nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers);
oxygen-demanding substances (e.g., decaying vegetation and animal waste); and trash.
During urban development two important changes occur. First, natural vegetated pervious
ground cover is converted to impervious surfaces, such as paved driveways, highways, streets,
rooftops and parking lots. Secondly, urban development creates new concentrated pollution
sources.
The most natural approach to water quality management is to minimize impervious surfaces and
filter and infiltrate runoff by allowing runoff to flow slowly over permeable vegetated surfaces.
By preserving and restoring the natural hydrological cycle, filtration and infiltration can reduce
the volume/peak rate, velocity and pollutant loads of urban runoff.
Since the urbanization process is a direct and leading cause of water quality degradation to
receiving waters, hndamental changes to existing policies, regulation and practices about urban
development are required. The main goal in the implementation of watershed protection
principles and policies is to direct land use decisions that protect storm water quality. These
changes concentrate on the three phases of urban development: land use planning, construction
and the "use" phase.
The legal authority for municipal management of water quality is based on the federal Clean
Water Act, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, all applicable provisions of state and
regional Water Quality Control Plans, the California Toxics Rule and the California Toxics Rule
Implementation Plan. Laguna Beach is under the jurisdiction of the San Diego Regional Water
Quality Control Board and must comply with the Board's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) Permit.
                                            POLICIES
  A      Development Planning and Design Best Management Practices (BMPs)
         Ensure that development plans and designs incorporate appropriate Site Design, Source
         Control and Structural Treatment Control Best Management Practices (BMPs), where
         feasible, to reduce to the maximum extent practicable, pollutants and runoff from the
         proposed development. Structural Treatment Control BMPs shall be implemented when
         a combination of Site Design and Source Control BNIPs are not sufficient to protect water
         quality.
4B       Minimize Impervious Surfaces
         Ensure that development minimizes the creation of impervious surfaces, especially
         contiguously connected impervious areas, or minimizes the area of existing impervious
         surfaces where feasible.
Minimize Volume and Velocity of Runoff
Ensure that development is designed and managed to minimize the volume and velocity
of runoff (including both stomwater and dry weather runoff) to the maximum extent
practicable, to avoid excessive erosion and sedimentation.
Minimize Introduction of Pollutants
Ensure that development and existing land uses and associated operational practices
minimize the introduction of pollutants into coastal waters (including the ocean,
estuaries, wetlands, rivers and lakes) to the maximum extent practicable.
Preserve Functions of Natural Drainage Svstems
Ensure that development is sited and designed to limit disturbances and to preserve the
infiltration, purification, retention and conveyance functions of natural drainage systems
that exist on the site to the maximum extent practicable.
Water Conservation and Native Plants
Ensure that development encourage water conservation, efficient irrigation practices and
the use of native or drought tolerant non-invasive plants appropriate to the local habitat to
minimize the need for fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and excessive irrigation. Prohibit
the use of invasive plants, and require native plants appropriate to the local habitat where
the property is in or adjacent to Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs).
Minimize Construction Impacts
Ensure that all development minimizes erosion, sedimentation and other pollutants in
runoff from construction-related activities to the maximum extent practicable. Ensure
that development minimizes land disturbance activities during construction (e.g.,
clearing, grading and cut-and-fill), especially in erosive areas (including steep slopes,
unstable areas and erosive soils), to minimize the impacts on water quality.
Continue Application and Maintenance of Best Management Practices (BMPs)
Require the property owner, homeowner's association or local government, as applicable,
to continue the application and maintenance of Source Control andlor Structural
Treatment Control BMPs as necessary to reduce runoff pollution, including appropriate
construction related erosion and sediment control measures.
Watershed Protection and Restoration
Promote the protection and restoration of offshore, coastal, lake, stream or wetland
waters and habitats and preserve them to the maximum extent practicable in their natural
state. Oppose activities that may degrade the quality of offshore, coastal, lake, stream or
wetland waters and habitat and promote the rehabilitation of impaired waters and habitat.
Infiltrate Runoff
Promote infiltration of both storm water and dry weather runoff, as feasible, to protect
natural hydrologic conditions.
4K Water Quality Public Education and Outreach
   Engage in water quality public education and outreach to promote pollution prevention
   and watershed protection. Require development proposals to include, where applicable,
   water quality Best Management Practices (BMPs) educational components or programs.
4L Lawna Lakes Protection and Enhancement
   Protect and preserve the existing natural hydrological process and enhance the ecological
   quality of the Laguna Lakes, where feasible. Coordinate with the City of Laguna Woods
   and the County of Orange in efforts to protect and preserve the ecological quality of
   Laguna Lakes. Oppose any physical alteration to the Laguna Lakes or adjacent habitat
   that may result in an adverse impact to water quality, habitat or the visual quality of the
   lakes.
4M Ocean Oil Spill Continaencv Plans
   Reevaluate periodically the Ocean Oil Spill Contingency Plans affecting the City.
TOPIC 5:        PARKS
Backmound
Perhaps the most commonly used method of conserving an or preserving open space in an urban
setting is the use of land for park purposes. Numerous parkland studies have been undertaken to
determine the cost and benefits of urban parks, with the consensus being that parks are desirable
and beneficial to the well-being of urban inhabitants. There is less agreement, however, on the
appropriate size, type and total acreage of City parkland.
The City of Laguna Beach currently provides approximately 99 acres of park and recreation
land. Park sizes range from .02 acres to 11.02 acres (excluding sandy beaches) and park types
vary from parks with no improvements to intensively improved parks. Together, City parks are
divided into three general categories of use: regional (66.9 acres); neighborhood (7.3 acres); and
mixed use (25 acres).
Regional parks have a service radius that extends beyond the City itself. Often, especially during
the summer, the majority of visitors to these areas are not Laguna Beach residents.
Neighborhood park and recreation areas, on the other hand, serve mainly local visitors, and
generally attract users from within a one-quarter to one-half mile radius of the park. The school
district also provides mixed use recreation areas that are shared with the City. The public use of
these areas is limited to times when they are not being used by the district. Table 3-2 lists the
Laguna Beach park and recreation areas according to the category into which they fall. The
accompanying map (3-3) identifies their respective locations.
The City's Master Plan for Parks and Recreation Facilities was originally adopted by the City
Council in 1980. This plan was subsequently reexamined by the City Council in January 1985,
at which time, the park improvement priorities were rearranged to reflect new community goals
and recreational benefits. More recently in 1986, the Master Plan of Parks and Recreation
Facilities was officially integrated as a component of the City's General Plan. This action
ensures that the Master Plan is compatible with other planning objectives in the General Plan;
ensures consistency between the Master Plan and new development proposals; and, enhances the
City's position to qualify for various grant monies for park and recreational improvements.
A Summary of the Park and Recreational Facilities is presented below; the Master Plan is
composed of eight priorities for new park facilities.
         Priority 1: Moulton Meadows Park This is a neighborhood park facility in Arch Beach
         Heights consisting of ten acres.
         Priority 2: Communitv Park at Top of the World This park is proposed in the vicinity of
         Alta Laguna Boulevard on property currently owned by the Laguna Beach Unified
         School District. The proposed size of the park is between four to six acres.
        Priority 3: Community Swimming Pool This pool is intended to serve the dual needs of
        the School District and residents of the City. For this reason, the Laguna Beach Unified
        School District and City Council are mutually involved in this project.
        Priority 4: MiniparklView Site Proposed locations for these small park facilities include
        Fernando Street, Pacific Avenue and Lots A, B, and C of Tract 11054, near Alta Laguna
        Boulevard.
        Priority 5: Community Park at Irvine Bowl The proposed park is situated on land above
        the Festival of Arts, under the ownership of the City and the Irvine Company. Existing
        concept plans propose extensive recreational facilities including a tennis complex,
        softball field, picnic area, tot lot, etc.
        Priority 6: Beachside Muniparks These small neighborhood parks would be similar to
        existing facilities at Oak Street and Thalia Street. Proposed locations may include
        Brooks, Cleo, Anita, Cress and Mountain.
        Priority 7: Hiking Trails This plan involves the development of a network utilizing open
        space easements and existing right-of-way and may include connection with trails
        planned in adjacent County lands.
        Priority 8: Miniparks in the Downtown Area This proposal envisions minipark sites at
        the Central Bluffs and Downtown area.
The City's park lands are augmented by large regional parks in close proximity to the City.
Within the immediate vicinity of the City of Laguna Beach, 9,717 acres are proposed by the
State and County as park, recreation and open space lands. These areas are depicted on Map 3-1.
Their facilities will provide various recreational opportunities, including picnicking, hiking,
camping, and bicycle and horseback riding. Crystal CoveIMorro Canyon State Park, northwest
of the City, will include 2,791 oceanfront and canyon acres. The remaining 2,650 acres between
the state park and the Laguna Beach City boundary is proposed as dedication land to be managed
by the County of Orange and kept as permanent open space. The 600 acre area to the north of
the City has been designated by the County as the LagunaJLaurel Canyon Regional Park. This
park will provide a 600-t-acre link between the open spaces to the west and east. East and
northeast of the City 3,616 acres are proposed as recreationlopen space in the County's Aliso
Creek Planning Unit. All of these areas combined generally follow the boundary of what is
commonly referred to as the Laguna Greenbelt.
Issue Identification and Analysis
A major obstacle to the provision of more park and recreation facilities in Laguna Beach is the
scarcity of land appropriate for park development. Much of the terrain in Laguna Beach consists
of steep hillsides and narrow canyon watercourses, and of the remaining relatively flat land most
has been developed. Due to this scarcity, developable land is very expensive and the City often
cannot afford the acquisition cost of new parklands.

An important consideration in providing parkhecreation land is on-going maintenance
responsibility. The City of Laguna Beach budgeted $896,304 in fiscal year 1983-84 for the
maintenance of park and beach land. With the rising cost of labor and machinery, maintenance
cost can be reasonably predicted to rise above this figure in the future. These factors clearly
illustrate that the cost of providing parklrecreation areas does not stop with the acquisition and
development of the land.
Given the problems stated above, funding programs must use imagination in seeking all possible
sources of revenues. Federal and state urban grants, state and local park bonds, park in lieu
funds, athletic program expansion funds; and capital improvement, development and open space
funds are all possible funding mechanisms. Park-in-lieu funds currently provide the majority of
money for park and recreation needs in Laguna Beach. Under this program, land developers are
required to dedicate a predetermined amount of parkhecreation land or provide money payment
in-lieu of the land. The payment is then deposited into a fund for the acquisition of new parkland
and/or for the improvement of existing park facilities. Park-in-lieu fees are collected according
to five separate districts in the City, and all monies collected within a given district must be
expended in only that district. This procedure enables the City to balance the supply of
recreation facilities in accordance with neighborhood growth and demand. Increased flexibility
and specificity is needed, however, in order to address priorities in the plan.
                                             POLICIES
5A      Evaluate the disposition of existing park-in-lieu fees and develop a more flexible and
         specific program for the expenditure of these funds.
5B       Support the recreational use and development of surrounding open space lands, where
         environmentally feasible, to relieve demand for parklands within the City. Encourage
        preservation of Laguna Greenbelt in a natural state, with recreational access limited to
        passive activities such as nature trails and wildlife observation areas.
5C      Pursue federal, state and county funding for parks.
5D      Investigate use of Water District land for neighborhood recreation use.
5E      Evaluate City-owned land for public parks and permanent open space, consistent with the
        purposes and uses set forth in Ordinance No. 1342.
5F      Encourage the placement of art forms in public places, other than the installation of
        permanent art forms at Main Beach Park.

                            Safety Element - City of Laguna Beach
                                      INTRODUCTION
Legislative History and Authority
In 1971, the California State Legislature required that all cities and counties adopt Seismic and
Safety Elements as part of their General Plans. The basic objective of the Safety Element is to
reduce loss of life, injury, damage to property and economic and social dislocation resulting
from future natural and manmade hazards. To achieve this objective, the Safety Element is
utilized as the major tool for identifying hazards that should be considered before making land
use decisions. Mapping is required of known seismic and other geologic hazards (such as
landslide areas), and issues such as emergency evacuation routes and water supply for fue
fighting must be addressed.
History of Laguna Beach Seismic and Public Safety Element
The Seismic and Public Safety Element was first adopted on February 28, 1979. There have
not been any revisions to this Element since the original adoption. On October 27, 1993,
portions of the City of Laguna Beach were devastated by a wildfire. Immediately after this fire
storm, the City reevaluated its work program and directed the Community Development
Department to update the Seismic and Public Safety Element. This work effort began in January
of 1994. During this work effort, the Planning Commission decided to rename this element the
Safety Element and expanded its scope to cover storm drainage, shoreline protection and the use,
transport and disposal of hazardous materials.
Citizen Participation
Public participation has traditionally performed a valuable function in the planning process,
particularly in reflecting community values, needs and goals. In the City of Laguna Beach,
~itizenparticipation has been a particularly important feature of the local planning process,
providing residents an opportunity to express their thoughts and viewpoints and interact in the
decision-making process. This participation in the community has added quality and credibility
to planning studies and engenders public understanding and support for such plans.
Citizen involvement played an instrumental role in the development of this update to the Safety
Element. The City Council directed the Planning Commission to invite the representatives from
all of the City's Homeowner's Associations and any interested citizens of Laguna Beach to attend
the numerous Safety Element update workshops. The ideas developed in these workshops were
particularly valuable in the actual development of the Safety Element, and in determining the
importance and priority of community goals and policies.

Organization of the Safety Element
The Safety Element is organized into six topics and an implementation chapter. Following the
introduction, Topics 1 through 6 discuss separate safety issues as they relate to the City of
Laguna Beach. Following the discussion in each topic is a series of policies to deal with the
identified issues. The final section of the element indicates which City Department has primary
responsibility for implementing each particular policy, how it will be funded and the scheduled
timing for implementation.

                              Safety Element   - City of Laguna Beach
               TOPIC 1: EMERGENCY PLANNINGIRESPONSE
The potential for a major calamity increases with the continuing urbanization of previously
unpopulated areas and with the advent of industrial processes which utilize hazardous materials.
The impact of earthquake, fire and flood is magnified as more and more high-risk land is
urbanized. Because of their unknown or unexpected nature, many emergencies require quick
and decisive action. Because disasters are dynamic and we continually learn through experience,
emergency response and planning should also be dynamic and continually maintained and
updated. Several disasters in Laguna Beach and in other communities in California have taught
us a great deal about disaster response.
The City of Laguna Beach adopted an Emergencv Services Plan in August of 1987. This Plan
details the City's specific responsibilities before, during and after any emergency. This Plan is
consistent with the State Emergency Services Plan, which describes the response of all levels
of government and certain private sector organizations to natural, man-made or war-caused
emergencies which threaten life, property and the resources of California. Section 8568 of the
California Emergency Services Act provides a basis for the City's emergency management
programs by requiring cities to carry out the provisions of the California Emergency Plan. The
City's Plan is an extension of the State Plan.
The City's Plan describes how the City will respond in the event of, but not limited to, a state
of war emergency, natural emergency situations (earthquakes, fires, floods, storms and tsunamis)
and man-made emergency situations (pollution spills, civil disturbances, aircraft accidents,
industrial accidents, explosions and radiological incidents). Emergencies that are preceded by
a recognized buildup period allow for advance warning to those impacted areas and population
groups. Timely warning and information broadcasts are important to the citizens' ability to help
themselves and for their evacuation. Emergencies which occur without advance warning require
prompt mobilization and commitment of the emergency organization after the onset of the
emergency,
During or following local emergencies, the City is the first agency involved. If the emergency
is so large that the City's resources are inadequate or are exhausted, assistance will be requested
of, and provided by, nearby jurisdictions through mutual aid. Neighborhood groups can be of
assistance to the City by conducting first aid and search and rescue operations in times of large
disasters. When mutual aid systems are no longer sufficient for the disaster task, the County
requests assistance from the State. The Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES)
coordinates regional emergency response and disaster assistance. The State may also request
aid from the Federal government in the form of a Presidential Disaster Declaration. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) then provides disaster assistance, temporary housing
assistance and recovery funds after a Presidential Disaster Declaration.
                              Topic 1 - Emergency Planning/Response
                             Safety Element  - City of Laguna Beach
The City's Emergency Services Plan lists three temporary seats of government in the event City
Hall is not available. Due to the close proximity of all of these alternate locations, it is likely
that in a major catastrophe such as a wildfire or earthquake, none of these facilities will be
available. The locations of alternate seats of government and emergency facilities have not been
evaluated as to their effectiveness in terms of location and response capabilities.
Mobility of the community to accomplish evacuation and the deployment of emergency personnel
during any disaster is essential. A variety of emergency response challenges exist within the
City of Laguna Beach. The City is located in hilly terrain, and many neighborhoods have
narrow dead-end streets with only one means of access.
It is the City's responsibility to develop evacuation plans which will readily and effectively
remove residents from hazardous areas to locations of greater safety. The mandate of the City
to protect public health, safety and welfare requires the City to ensure that disaster planning
within each neighborhood meets both the City's and neighborhood's interpretation of acceptable
risk. In issues of overriding safety concerns, the City's mandate requires affirmative action to
maximize public safety.
A discussion of emergency response and evacuation must focus on three levels of preparedness:
the household, the neighborhood, and the community at large. Specific policy decisions and
public actions must be taken at each of these levels to assure an acceptable level of risk for the
City's residents.
Household Emergency Planning
Household emergency planning refers to actions which are taken by private citizens to increase
their own level of disaster preparedness. Emergency response at this level generally requires
the dispatch of specific vehicles to serve specialized functions.
The highest probability of an evacuation occurs from individual households. Isolated
occurrences arise due to structural fires or slope failure, as experienced in the February, 1978
storms and again in the Mystic Hills landslides in January, 1993. Evacuation at the household
level generally does not require a public agency except to deal with the cause of the evacuation
and medical care. Problems associated with response to individual households are generally
related to street blockage from insufficient width of paved roadways or grade problems.
Families need to increase their general preparedness for the most likely natural disasters which
could occur in their particular location. There are many specific steps which can be taken on
the part of a homeowner to gain some autonomy and safety in the case of a natural disaster.
Adequate supplies, training and education about the effects of likely disasters and available
support systems help in this regard. The City can support these individual household efforts
with various services, such as the periodic distribution of emergency planning packets which
provide up-to-date emergency planning information and response guidelines.

                              Safety Element - City of Luguna Beach
Neighborhood Emergency Planning;
Neighborhood emergency planning requires the neighborhood and community to determine an
acceptable level of risk and the resulting public actions to elevate disaster preparedness to that
level. Evacuation planning refers to the removal of people from areas of extreme hazards to
areas of public safety.
As a result of historic development patterns and constraints imposed by local topography the City
is divided into geographic neighborhoods, These neighborhoods are an integral component of
emergency response planning. Emergency planning should both incorporate the resources of the
individuals within these neighborhoods and recognize the constraints each neighborhood
embodies.
A citizen response model could be incorporated into the City's Emergency Services Plan which
utilizes a neighborhood coordinate system of planning and response. This Plan could also
incorporate a communication component for both information coordination and emergency
resources allocation. It might be possible to designate individual neighborhood communication
sites and establish emergency local radio broadcasts. Neighborhood Planning could build upon
the "neighborhood watch" program. This program has been a victim of funding priorities, but
as a response to the requirement of the Emergency Plan to promote neighborhood autonomy, it
could be re-invigorated and supported by City staff. For instance, a periodic newsletter could
be established to help keep the neighborhoods abreast of the most recent advances in emergency
response and coordination.
Community Emergency Planning
Community level emergency planning includes the development of an Emergency Plan to be
initiated in the event of a City-wide evacuation. That Plan should include provisions for
emergency housing, transportation, clothing, food and medical aid. As neighborhood evacuation
planning addresses evacuation routes from various neighborhoods, comprehensive City-wide
emergency planning includes the development of a supportive infrastructure responsive to the
emergency needs of the community.
As part of a community-wide response to evacuation planning the City's Emergency Plan
identifies the roles and relationships of all governmental, quasi-governmental and private service
agencies existing within the City and could be updated to inventory facilities within the
community available for emergency response needs. This Plan becomes operational in the event
of a local emergency and should be periodically updated.
In the event of a community-wide disaster, it is possible that more than one evacuation center
would need to be established within the City. The scale of such a disaster would preclude
individual evacuation attempts from the community in favor of the efficiency of mass evacuation.
                                                 - 5-

                             Safety Element - City of Luguna Beach
It is doubtful that any roadway could accommodate vehicular evacuation on a community-wide
scale.
Citizens relocated to evacuation centers within the community would need to remain in those
locations rather than add to the expected confusion on congested roadways. It is not anticipated
that any new roadways serving the community would be needed for evacuation needs. In the
case of a community-wide disaster, the City would need to have coordinated plans with local
military organizations for the airlift of supplies and for evacuation of residents requiring medical
care beyond the capability of the community's resources. The City's Emergency Plan could be
updated to reflect this needed coordination.
An Emergency Operations Center (EOC) could be established to manage community-wide or
neighborhood emergencies. City staff could be utilized for staffing of the EOC and have, at
a minimum, annual training events to adequately support its operation. A public information
officer could be designated in the Emergency Plan, with procedures for both obtaining and
disseminating accurate information.
As with all emergency planning there must be ongoing maintenance and training. This involves
the allocation on the part of City government of the necessary funding support for an ongoing
emergency management coordinator.
Access Issues
In Laguna Beach there are many isolated neighborhoods which are accessed by only one entry
point, which create potentially undesirable, inadequate or hazardous access deficiencies in the
event of a disaster. Some of the neighborhoods which have impaired access due to road
geometrylconfiguration problems are: Allview Terrace, Bluebird Canyon, Canyon Acres,
DiamondICrestview, Upper Three Arch Bay and Upper Victoria. (Refer to the Impaired Road
Access Map.)
In addition to isolated neighborhoods, many of the City's major roadways are susceptible to
circulation restrictions and to geologic or hydrologic hazards which could result in their closure
during critical periods. The number of access routes to any neighborhood is less significant than
their circulation capacities (parking, travel-way width, etc.) and their susceptibility to closure
by hazards.

S a f c t ~Element of the General Pla
                              Safety Element  - City of Luguna Beach
Some of the neighborhoods, such as Irvine Cove and Upper Victoria, are not subject to major
environmental constraints like an identified fault or floodway. These roadways cannot always
be expected to remain open, because under even minor adverse conditions, such as a downed
tree or electrical line, these areas may become inaccessible.
The City could undertake a comprehensive emergency access evaluation and upgrade program
in which each public and private roadltrail is evaluated in terms of providing emergency vehicle
access and identifying access problems. The goal of this evaluation and upgrade program would
be to upgrade the access-deficient areas by retrofitting the substandard roadslroutes with non-
parking fire lanes (established in conjunction with the affected homeowners), establishing turn-
arounds andlor providing secondary access. In addition, an emergency circulation system could
be designated for evacuation and response.
The emergency circulation road/route system could be maintained at high priority levels of
policy and financial consideration. For instance, the public utility companies could be consulted
and encouraged to prioritize the undergrounding of their utility lines along these routes. Tree
maintenance could be emphasized on both public right-of-way and private property along these
routes. City maintenance of these roads or emergency routes could receive funding priority.
Three of the most severely access-restricted neighborhoods are Bluebird Canyon, Canyon Acres
and DiarnondfCrestview. These neighborhoods are all single-access neighborhoods and are
subject to environmental constraints which could restrict access. All three neighborhoods are
particularly susceptible to fire hazards, a situation aggravated by the narrow roadways in each
neighborhood.
Bluebird Canyon
Bluebird Canyon is recognized as an area subject to multiple hazards. The major hazards which
could minimize access are brush fires and landslides. The neighborhood's isolation, proximity
to open space areas, topographic conditions and wind patterns make it susceptible to a wildfire.
Similarly, the October, 1978 slide is evidence of the disastrous results of the effects of geologic
instability. As a result of these identified hazards, Bluebird Canyon Road could become
impassable. In that event, emergency vehicles would be unable to obtain ingress and vehicular
egress of the residents would not be possible.
Two separate fire hazards exist in Bluebird Canyon: the threat of wide-front brush fire and the
danger of structural fires. The issue of structural fires is most acute in the Dyer-Wykoff area
as a result of small lots, close proximity of structures and narrow roadways. Both types of fires
can trigger an evacuation response. Structural fires present less of a need for neighborhood
evacuation than do brush fires, unless the fires spread to adjacent structures.
                             Topic 1 - Emergency PLanning/Response
                             Safety Element   - City of Luguna Beach
It is imperative to residents' safety that alternative routes of evacuation be established in the
Bluebird Canyon area. Any route located too close to the existing roadway could quickly
succumb to the same hazard which forced its closure.
The major threat of fire occurrence is east of Bluebird Canyon. The hazards are greatest in this
area because of fuel loading conditions and Santa Ana wind patterns. The inclusion of an
evacuation route in this direction would have little benefit in leading residents to safety.
Similarly, topographic conditions of Rimrock Canyon make the construction of an evacuation
route in this area appear to be both aesthetically and economically unsound.
The City needs to continue to investigate and implement an.emergency access route that will
meet the safety needs of the neighborhood and will be consistent with community economic and
environmental goals. An emergency access connection could be established between Flamingo
Road and Wykoff Way by obtaining the necessary easements, constructing pavement and
installing access-control gates at either end. Secondarily, consideration could be given to the
construction of a road from Bluebird Canyon to Arch Beach Heights.
Canyon Acres
The Canyon Acres area is exposed to a combination of hazards including: wildfire, geological
instability, mudflows and flooding. In the event of a closure on Canyon Acres Drive, the only
potential access is a four wheel drive trail connecting with Alta Laguna Boulevard.
Based upon the experience from the October 27, 1993 fire, it is evident that a full-size
turnaround is needed at the end of Canyon Acres Drive in order to expedite and facilitate traffic
and emergency vehicle access during times of emergency.
For the long term, consideration could be given to installing pavement, fireflow and drainage
improvements on the existing graded earth road connecting Canyon Acres Drive with Alta
Laguna Boulevard for emergency access/egress. An all-weather surface would minimize annual
maintenance, permit fire equipment access and facilitate the maintenance of a fuel modification
program to help protect Canyon Acres and Mystic Hills from wildfire potential in the future
after regrowth occurs from the 1993 fire storm.
The DiamondICrestview area is similar to Bluebird Canyon in that it is adjacent to steep, heavily
vegetated hillsides. The Fire Department has expressed concern that a fire started either below
or above Crestview Drive could possibly bum everything between Catalina Street and the lower
part of Arch Beach Heights. The narrow access aspect of this neighborhood makes it
particularly difficult to protect. However, the City is widening the streets and requiring on-
street parking as a condition to further development to help alleviate this situation. New houses

and major remodeling projects, as defined in Title 25 of the Municipal Code, constructed in this
neighborhood are also required to install residential sprinklers.
Served only by Crestview Drive, the southerly portion of this tract presently has no alternate
access. As development occurs, the need for an additional ingresslegress point will increase.
A pedestrian walkway between the end of Ruby Place and Crestview Place could 'be established
relatively easily to facilitate evacuations by foot. Vehicular access, however, would involve
significant grading and/or retaining-wall construction due to existing terrain conditions. A
connection between Inez StreetJFern Street towards Tract 26 (Hermosa WayILomita Way) may
be available depending upon more detailed site-specific studies for emergency access purposes.
However, this option would involve either the placement of fill or the construction of a bridge
across a designated natural drainage course.
Undergrounding of Utilities
Overhead utility lines are known hazards which can be mitigated by placing them underground.
During the 1993 Laguna Firestorm, downed powerlines in Canyon Acres and other areas
restricted and delayed emergency response vehicles and evacuation. Heavy winds cause tree
branches to knock down powerlines creating a safety hazard, and power poles and utility boxes
are hazards in road rights-of-way.

          certified as functional by the Fire Department during an emergency. * The City
          shall not approve a variance from this standard unless findings are made that: 1)
          the Fire Department has reviewed the variance application and certified that
          long-term public health and safety has been established for emergency access
          through the provision of additional safeguards, including but not limited to,
          adequate fire flow and hydrants, requiring sprinklers, additional street width,
          additional turnarounds and maintained fuel modification zones; and 2) the road
          leading up to any road or driveway extension complies with City access standards
          regarding width and grade.
   lm     Limit a single means of ingress and egress or cul-de-sac to a maximum length of
          750 feet. Private driveways shall not exceed 150 feet in length without providing
          a turnaround, loop circulation or secondary emergency access. Any existing
          parcel which is considered to be a legal building site shall be exempt from this
          policy standard for the purposes of development on the parcel as one building
          site, but the policy shall be observed for the creation of new building sites. The
          City shall not approve a variance from this standard unless findings are made
          that 1) the Fire Department has reviewed the variance application and certified
          that long-term public health and safety has been established for emergency
          access through the provision of additional safeguard, including but not limited to,
          adequate fire flow and hydrants, requiring sprinklers, additional street width,
          additional turn-arounds and maintained fuel modification zones; and 2) the road
          leading up to any road or driveway extension complies with City access standards
          regarding width and grade.
   IN.    Evaluate the location of all public facilities necessary for emergency response in
          relation to the current City's Hazard Maps and the level of risk associated with

                       TOPIC 2: HAZARDOUS MATElXULS
There are many definitions and descriptive names being used for the term hazardous materials,
each of which depends on the nature of the material. For the purposes of this topic, the
definition in 5 25501(k) of the Health and Safety Code will be utilized:
         "anymaterial t h , because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical
        characteristics, poses a signiJcam present or potential hazard to human health
        and safety or to the environment if released into the work place or the
        environment. Hazardous materials include, but are not limited to hazardous
        substances, hazardous waste, and any material which a handler or the
        administering agency has a reasomble basis for believing that it would be
        injurious to the health and safety of persons or harmfil to the environment if
        released into the work.placeor the environment. "
Hazardous materials are manufactured, transported, stored, used and disposed of on a regular
basis. Although hazardous materials incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas are
at higher risk. Areas near roadways, railways, pipelines, airways and waterways that are
frequently used for transporting hazardous materials and areas near industrial facilities that use,
store, or dispose of such materials have an increased risk. The primary transportation routes
of hazardous materials in Orange County, near the City of Laguna Beach, are the 1-5 and 1-405
freeways. Some transportation of hazardous materials occurs on Coast Highway and Laguna
Canyon Road within the City. Within the County, the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads
operate 155 miles of railroad lines which transport large quantities of hazardous materials. The
City does not have direct authority to regulate the transport of hazardous materials on State
Highways or rail lines. United States Department of Transportation regulations establish criteria
for safe handling and transportation of hazardous materials.
~Numerous~petroleum    product producers with large storage facilities maintain hundreds of miles
of pipelines throughout the county. However, none of the major pipelines pass through the City
of Laguna Beach. The airspace around the City of Laguna Beach is among the busiest in the
nation. Hazardous materials may be transported by air over Laguna Beach or to destinations at
John Wayne Airport or El Toro and Marine Corps Helicopter Station, Tustin. Finally, because
Laguna Beach is a coastal city, it is exposed to oil tanker traffic as well as other ships carrying
hazardous materials.
Because of the distance of the major hazardous materials transportation routes from the City of
Laguna Beach, the threat of a significant hazardous materials emergency is minimal. The
potential magnitude of hazardous materials incidents will be largely affected by prevailing
weather conditions and topography at the incident scene. Wind direction and velocity, ambient
air and ground temperature and precipitation and humidity will affect the spread of gases,

vapors, mists, and the dusts of hazardous materials. Topography can greatly affect the behavior
of gases and liquids.
The most likely hazardous materials exposure is use of hazardous materials within the City
limits. Household cleaning products, pool chlorine, dry cleaning chemicals, film processing,
jewelry making, hospitals and automobile servicing involve hazardous materials and wastes. The
Laguna Beach Fire Department needs to continue to identify and monitor commercial and
industrial users of hazardous materials. It is not reasonable to closely monitor the use of
household hazardous materials, but the City has committed, through its state-mandated
Household Hazardous Waste Plan, to several actions, including educational campaigns regarding
reduced usage and proper disposal; promoting the County's Household Hazardous Waste
Collection Centers (the nearest are located in Irvine and San Juan Capistrano); and negotiating
 for annual County-sponsored collection events in Laguna Beach. (Each of these collection events
 costs between thirty and fifty thousand dollars, for an estimated 300 to 400 users or
participants.)
 In March, 1994, the City Council adopted the County of Orange Hazardous Materials Area Plan.
 This is a state-mandated plan with established criteria. The primary goal of this plan is to
 achieve the preservation of life, property and environment with the most effective and
 economical allocation of resources in time of a hazardous materials emergency. The City of
 Laguna Beach is also a participant in the Oran~eCountv Hazardous Waste Mana~ementPlan
 which provides options for siting of hazardous waste collection, treatment, recycling and disposal
 facilities throughout the County. Together, these Plans establish the City's responsibilities and
 goals and policies in dealing with a hazardous materials incident and with the identification,
 storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.
 The City presently requires the participation of businesses in the Hazardous Materials Disclosure
 Program. This involves the disclosure, at the time of obtaining a City business license, of
 whether the business will generate or use any of the hazardous materials contained on the list
 of such materials, as well as their quantities. This information is forwarded to the Orange
 County Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Program Office, which forwards a schedule of
 onsite inspections to the City Fire Department. These inspections currently occur at one- to two-
 year intervals. During the inspections, there is a review of the businesses' hazardous material
 safe-handling, storage, dispensing and disposal criteria. Any noted disposal violations are
 reported to the County for appropriate follow-up.
 The City presently operates a Small Hazardous Material Spills response vehicle that is primarily
 used in cleaning up spills associated with vehicular accidents. Large spills of hazardous
 materials would involve a response from the Orange County Fire Department, which has four
 Level A Hazardous Materials Mobile Units. The City has a joint powers agreement with the
 County for mutual aid and joint cost support of these units. In very large spills of hazardous
 materials, a responsible party is identified and private firms are contracted with for an
 appropriate safe clean-up of the site at the responsible party's expense.

Gasoline in underground storage tanks in service stations is considered to be a hazardous
material. State, County and City Health and Fire Codes require special tanks for underground
storage. Laguna Beach has completed the program of removing the known non-complying
tanks. Monitoring of some sites is still taking place to identify any contaminants requiring clean-
UP.
Marine oil spills are considered to be a hazardous material emergency and are typically multi-
jurisdictional events. The City of Laguna Beach is a participant in the Qrange County
 Operational Area Marine Oil Spill Continyencv Plan (OSCP). The OSCP is a component of the
Orange County Hazardous Materials Area Plan. The Office of Oil Spill Prevention and
Response (OSPR) and the U.S. Coast Guard have primary responsibilities for the cleanup and
response effort in coordination with the responsible party. The shoreline is a very significant
environmental and recreational resource to the City that could be adversely affected in the event
of an oil spill. The City of Laguna Beach will continue to oppose offshore oil drilling when
environmental, aesthetic and economic resources are threatened and will continue to monitor the
federal government's offshore leasing program to ensure that the impacts of the program on the
coastal environment are known and considered.
 Another possible source of a hazardous material is a sewage spill or a mixing of sewage,
industrial waste or pollutant discharges with storm drainage waters. This is naturally not
acceptable, but operational maintenance and system capacities must support the strict
performance standard of proper separation and treatment.
Aliso Creek and Laguna Canyon Stream are two areas that have been particularly problematic
in regards to water quality. The State Water Quality Control Board is charged with the
 responsibility for improving water quality in creeks and the ocean. The San Diego Regional
 Water Quality Control Board has jurisdiction over Aliso Creek. Six agencies which form the
 Aliso Water Management Agency (AWMA) have pipes that crisscross and parallel Aliso Creek.
 Iron pipes run beneath the banks of the creek, some transporting sewage, others moving thick
 sludgebetween the four treatment plants that receive the sewage. There have been numerous
 sewage spills that travel downstream to the ocean which have caused Orange County health
 officials to close Aliso Beach more than any other beach in the County. Spills can have serious
 health consequences for swimmers. Human wastes carry bacteria and viruses that can cause
 hepatitis and typhoid fever, although the most common ailment is diarrhea according to Orange
 County health officials. The Laguna Beach City Council has petitioned the Regional Water
 Quality Control Board and all of the agencies providing sewer collection and treatment in the
 Aliso Creek Basin to solve the sewage spill problems.

     Local Conditions
     In December of 1969, the City commissioned an analysis of the geology of Laguna Beach on
     a city-wide basis by Leighton and Associates. The prologue states that geologic information will
     not go out of date because the geology of the area originated through geologic ages and will
     change little in man's lifetime. The geologic history of Laguna Beach, as described in the
     Leighton and Associates 1969 study, is paraphrased as follows:
             The geologic record of Laguna Beach extends back approximately 30 million
             years through the analysis of earth materials, the structure of these materials,
             landscape features and fossils. This record begins with old beach sands that have
             transformed into the Topanga sandstone of Miocene age. Sedimentary layers
             were formed through marine deposits in Miocene seas which were gradually
             compacted and cemented. The layers were uplifted from a near horizontal
             position into broad arch-like folds called anticlines. The most recent uplift
             occurred during the last 250,000 years. On the basis of radioactive dating beach
             deposits of approximately 130,000 years ago are found at the lower terrace of the
             downtown are. of the City and over 250,000 years at the highest points of
             Temple Hills and Top of the World.
     Earth materials can be divided into surficial sediment and bedrock. Surficial sediment is of
     more recent geologic origin and consists of alluvium (stream deposits), colluvium (thick soil and
     slopewash), beach deposits, terrace deposits of marine origin and of non-marine origin. Bedrock
     is older and consists of Topanga Sandstone, Topanga Siltstone, San Onofre Breccia and intrusive
     igneous bodies.
- - .-,TheCity:of Laguna Beach can be divided into four areas with unique topographic and geologic
     characteristics called geomorphic subareas. Each of these involve separate constraints in terms
     of geology and requires different types of engineering when development occurs. These
     subareas of the City are important in order to understand their different stability qualities.
     The first subarea is the Major Canyons, including the side slopes of Laguna Canyon, Hidden
     Valley Canyon, Rimrock Canyon, Bluebird Canyon and Aliso Canyon. Steep slopes are
     common because of the resistant exposed rocks and the large amount of uplift and erosion in a
     relatively short geologic time frame. The slopes descending from bluffs and ridges differ greatly
     in stability and cohesiveness.
     The Canyon bottomlands subarea is not widespread and is mainly limited to the floor of Laguna
      Canyon and its tributaries. The downtown basin is located at the mouth of this system and
     exemplifies the characteristic construction hazards. Poorly consolidated, fine-grained and water-

 soaked soil materials of considerable depth have required careful foundation design and
 construction, usually with pilings driven deep to support large structures. Further up the
 watershed, conditions are different. Soil materials are usually more sandy and the water table
 deeper, usually more stable. Even here, differential settlement can crack poorly constructed
  foundations, especially where improper drainage of rainwater (due to the lack of rain gutters,
 for example) is a contributing cause. Sedimentation in lowland areas can slowly raise the land
 level around a structure. The rate of this normal increase is slow enough that there is generally
 little awareness of this phenomenon.
 The next subarea is the High Terrace, the flat-lying summit platforms of Temple Hills and Top
 of the World, Arch Beach Heights and the interconnecting ridge, which are mostly the remnants
 of elevated marine terraces. The highland areas of Laguna Beach began their formation as a
  series of layered sediments, most deposited beneath the sea. Volcanic activity injected a hard
 rock into several fissures. While these processes were occurring, seismic forces folded, faulted,
 and lifted the mass above sea level, allowing erosion to attack the layers of rock creating
  sandstone cliffs with cavernous weathering. Erosion and landsliding can affect these areas, but
 problems associated with groundwater seepage are less likely.
  The final subarea is the Coastal Fringe, which includes the broad coastal shelf traversed by
  Pacific Coast Highway. Included within this area are the headlands, cliffs and associated sea
  arches, caves and blow-holes, the beaches and the offshore islands and rock prominences. The
  coastal shelf is generally smooth and its broad, nearly level expanses invited early development.
  The shelf is composed of young and sometimes poorly consolidated sands and clays, which can
  pose construction problems due to lack of stable support. This condition is found most often at
  the edges of the bluffs where the emergence of springs can aggravate the problems. The central
  areas of the bluffs are mostly free from this condition. The bedrock formations in the northern
  portion of the City are primarily Topanga sandstones and siltstones, and are primarily San
  Onofre Breccia in the southern portion of the City. The Coastal Fringe terminates abruptly at
  the sea cliff, which are steep and sometimes nearly vertical. Some of the problems associated
. with this terrain are as follows: terrace materials subject to soil engineering problems; erosion
  materials from concentrated runoff descending over the cliff face; ground water seeps; rock falls;
  potential slide blocks; sea cliff erosion from wave impact; and collapse of sea caves and sea
  arches.
  The local landforms were primarily caused by normal erosion and wave action working on the
  layers of rock which have been altered from their original position. The harder and more
  resistant layers tended to remain as outcroppings, sometimes forming steep cliffs; the softer rock
  was more readily removed, allowing stream action to form canyons and other relatively
  depressed areas. Within the last 10,000 years or so, thick deposits of talus have accumulated
  at the base of some slopes. Analysis of aerial photography has shown regions where landsliding
  has occurred, thereby suggesting a degree of innate instability for some types of rock.

Landslides
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines a landslide as:
        "Downward and outward movement of slope-fonning materials composed of
        natural rock, soils, am~cialfills, or combinations of these materials. The
        moving mass may be proceeded by any of three principal types of movement:
       falling, sliding, or flowing or by their combinations. "
Although the term landslide is generally assumed to mean any slide of rock or soil down a hill,
the term actually encompasses a number of different types of earth movements. Lateral shifts
of level ground or rotational movement of land triggered by heavy saturation, liquefaction or
earthquakes are also classified as landslides. An ancient landslide can lie dormant for years with
imperceptible creep and gradual consolidation and settlement. Gradually the shear strength of
the old slide mass is overcome and reactivation occurs as a slow or rapid movement.
The occurrence of landslides is a part of the continuous, natural process of the downhill
movement of soil, rock, and rock debris. The speed at which this earth material moves
downslope can range from imperceptible creep of soil to sudden mass movements of an entire
hillside. The size of a landslide can range from several square feet in area to several square
miles. Slide thickness may range from less than a foot to several hundred feet. It is important
to remember that the complex arrangement of earth and rock units sometimes results in one
piece of land having a sound and stable geological foundation while another piece immediately
adjacent, perhaps on the same lot, may be entirely different and potentially unstable. It is
therefore necessary to study each development proposal individually.
Landslides can cause substantial damage and disruption in the City of Laguna Beach. Landslides
can cause death, destroy entire neighborhoods, cause substantial damage to and loss of public
improvements, block drainage channels, and disrupt utilities and pipelines.
Many known bedrock and surficial landslides exist in the hilly portions of Laguna Beach. Many
of these slides are ancient bedrock slides which are at present stabilized or in equilibrium. In
most cases in which an ancient landslide begins to slip, water-saturated hillsides are the cause.
Where bedding and jointing of rock materials and hill slope directions tend to be the same, slide
possibilities are greatly increased. Although these areas may remain stable for hundreds of
years, triggering forces may cause failure at any time.
In addition to the known landslide areas, there are several areas subject to potential slope
instability due to slide-prone formations occurring in the bedrock. The massive slide in the
Meadowlark Drive area of Bluebird Canyon occurred within the area of an ancient landslide.
The relationship of rock type (clayey siltstone) and geologic structure (dipslope) to the slope
height and slope angle provided the fundamental geological and geometrical basis for failure.

    However, this landslide was triggered by a combination of the heavy infiltrating rains of 1978
    and the removal of -earth material at the toe of the 1andsIide by erosion and sloughing.
    A secondary impact associated with landslides is the creation of a temporary dam when a slide
    blocks a major drainage course. This situation was also experienced in the Bluebird Canyon
    slide. Without adequate drainage, these dams may impound runoff water from the upstream
    watershed. These dams are certain to fail within a relatively short time, presenting an
    inundation hazard to developed areas below.
    Landslide Hazard Reduction
    Damage due to landslides can be reduced through avoidance, removal or permanent stabilization.
    The first step is to recognize the existence of an ancient landslide or the probability of a future
    landslide. This is accomplished through detailed geologic mapping, trenching, drilling and photo
    interpretation of surface geologic conditions. Ancient landslides located in undisturbed and
    undeveloped areas are the easiest to detect through the use of photo interpretation. Detection
    in developed areas may be much more difficult because the characteristic features of landslides'
    lobe-like forms and track-like hollows are often obscured. Probable future slides can often be
    anticipated in areas where other landsliding has already taken place. Hillsides covered with deep
    soils or that are heavily saturated with groundwater may be potential landslide areas.
    Additionally, landslide possibilities are greatly increased where the bedrock and hill slope
    directions tend to be the same.
    In order to determine the precise origin of the topographic form, it is necessary to conduct
    supplementary subsurface explorations. Once the configuration of a potentially active landslide
    is known by subsurface investigation, the threshold values of failure can be calculated. A value
    of 1.0 represents equilibrium, where the forces resisting failure or movement equal those forces
    which cause failure. A value below 1.0 would indicate where a geological failure (i.e.,
    landslide) is expected to occur. The present minimum accepted level of safety value is 1.5,
. . which. means.;that the .geological feature is 50% stronger than equilibrium or the forces
    promoting failure.
    When an area is recognized as a potentially hazardous landslide area, future development can
    be designed to take this into consideration and existing development can take mitigating actions
    to reduce potential hazards to an acceptable level. Several methods of minimizing landslide risks
    include:
            1) Leaving hazardous areas undeveloped.
            2) Removing unstable slope material.
            3) Engineering grading prior to construction.

                             Sdety Element     - City of Laguna Beach
        4) Providing for roof, surface and subsurface drainage.
        5) Constructing retaining walls or other barriers to buttress ancient slides.
        6) Reducing the driving forces acting on the slope by reducing the slope angle or the
        weight of objects placed on the slope.
        7) Planting drought-resistant vegetation with deep, strong root systems.
Although these techniques represent effective mitigation to protect development from geologic
instability, they cannot ultimately guarantee control over .the forces of, nature. Diligent
investigation, analysis and reporting is essential in making informed land use decisions, but
should not be viewed as being absolutely definitive because extreme events, such as unusually
heavy precipitation or severe seismic events, are not predictable.
Seismicitv & Liquefaction
~aults,which represent fractures in the earth's crust, are not always easy to identify, especially
in areas that are obscured by development. Through analysis of existing land formations and
subsurface investigation, geologists can identify the location of many faults. A fault may be a
single continuous line, but more likely may be a system of splinter faults and breaks, which
together constitute a fault zone.
There are three types of fault classifications:
 1)      Active faults have experienced movement within the last 11,000 years (Holocene time)
         and may move again in the relatively near future.
2)       Potentially active faults have moved in the last two million years (Quaternary Period)
       . but show no direct evidence of movement within the last 11,000 years.
3)       Inactive faults show no evidence of movement since Pleistocene times and present no
         evidence of potential to move in the near future.
It should be noted that the words "inactivewand "potentially active" are used by seismologist as
concise technical terms, to describe the past activity of any fault. Analysis shows that an
 "inactive" fault is least likely to generate an earthquake, but its continued inactivity is not

Seismic Measurement
Earthquakes are measured two different ways - the Richter scale (magnitude of energy released)
and the Modified Mercalli scale (intensity of movement or affects of shaking).
The Richter scale is a well known, but often misunderstood, system used primarily by
seismologists to evaluate and compare the energy of individual quakes according to an absolute
and objective scale. The magnitude of energy released is calculated from the instrumental record
made by the event on a calibrated seismograph. Seismographs record a zigzag trace that shows
the varying amplitude of ground oscillations beneath the instrument. Magnitude is expressed in
whole numbers and decimal fractions. Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole
number increase in magnitude corresponds to the release of about 30 times more energy than the
amount associated with the preceding whole number value. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake
with a magnitude 8.3 generated 1,000,000 times as much energy as the 4.3 magnitude
earthquake that occurred in Laguna Beach in 1969. Furthermore, the Richter magnitude does
not give any indication of the actual damage caused by the quake. Other factors must be
considered: distance to the epicenter, and its focal depth as well as geological conditions at the
location of damage. Even with these data the Richter magnitude is more meaningful and useful
to the scientist than the layman.
The Modified Mercalli scale is subjective and related not to the energy released, but to people's
perception of the quake and the damage done, as determined by field surveys. This scale is
much more significant to the public since its steps are delineated by cracked plaster, fallen
buildings, ground failure, and citizens' panic, rather than energy relationships measured by
instruments. The Modified Mercalli Scale as shown on Table I provides a description of the
effect of the different levels of earthquake intensity with the corresponding Richter Scale.
Regional Seismic Conditions
Southern California is located in a seismically active area. (Refer to the Regional Seismic and
Geologic Hazard Maps.) There have been many earthquakes throughout recorded history; some
have been large. The 1933 Long Beach quake was the most powerful and closest shock to hit
Laguna Beach in living memory, and the 1994 Northridge quake was the most recent powerful
shock. Both of these were felt widely across the Los Angela basin and caused considerable
damage. In October, 1969, a quake occurred which was felt predominantly in Laguna Beach
and South Laguna. By way of comparison, the three quakes listed above had the following
Richter magnitudes: 1933 Long Beach, 6.3; 1994 Northridge, 6.8; 1969 Laguna Beach, 4.3.
The respective Mercalli magnitudes as perceived in Laguna Beach were VI, V and V.

The first scale to reflect earthquake intensities was developed by de R m i of Italy, and Forel of Switzerland, in the 1880's. This scale, with
values from 1 to X, was used for about two decades. A need for a more refined scale increased with the advancement of h e science of
seismology, and in 1902the Italian seismologist, Mercalli, devised a new scale of a I to XI1 mnge. The Memlli Scale was modified in 1931
by American seismologiata Harry 0. Wood and Fmnk Neuman to take into account modem slnrcturnl features:

The active faults of Southern California will continue to be subjected to stresses which produce
movements that in turn cause earthquakes of varying magnitude and intensity. Earthquakes
along active faults will, more than likely, be of the same magnitude as those experienced in the
past, and large earthquakes will most likely occur where they have previously occurred.
Local Seismic Conditions
The City of Laguna Beach lies on the western flank of the San Joaquin Hills. The three
dominant active fault systems of this geomorphic area in which these hills occur are the
Newport-Inglewood (3 miles west), Whittier-Elsinore (20.5 miles northeast), and the San Jacinto
(42.5 miles northeast). These faults all trend in a.northwesterly direction and divide the
province into subparallel blocks each of which contains a complex system of older faults. There
are also distant faults that could affect Laguna Beach by generating a powerful shock, such as
the San Andreas and the San Jacinto, two great faults which have shown activity in historic
times. The most destructive earthquake experienced in the Laguna Beach area occurred in 1812
and was probably centered near San Juan Capistrano or on an undetermined offshore fault,
perhaps on or related to the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone. The activity of the Christianitos
fault, which passes roughly from San Onofre to El Toro, is a matter of question among the
experts.
Although there are no active or potentially active faults in Laguna Beach, the City is traversed
by two major inactive fault systems, the Laguna Canyon Fault and the Temple Hills Fault. It
is unlikely that these faults will experience activity in the near-future since there is no record of
faulting in historical times or in the geologic record of the last 11,000 years. The Laguna
Canyon fault zone consists of two parallel northwest-trending faults across Laguna Canyon;
north of this canyon, the zone forms a single fault. The Laguna Canyon fault system is best
revealed by the eroded saddles on ridges and a steep scarp at the head of Bluebird and Rimrock
Canyons. This fault can be followed from Thousand-Steps Beach in South Laguna to the vicinity
of the University of California, Irvine.
The ~ e m ~.kills
               l e fault trends in an easterly direction. The Temple Hills fault is not as visibly
apparent, and also trends in an east-west direction subparallel to the Laguna Canyon fault. It's
trace runs from one mile east of Aliso Canyon to the downtown basin.
Many other smaller faults have been discovered by geological surveys, which are roughly
parallel to one or the other of these two major systems. Most of these faults have been
determined to be technically inactive.
Because no active faults cross the City, the overall constraint or hazard from fault rupture is
considered low. However, it is not advisable to build a structure across a major inactive fault
such as the Temple Hills fault and Laguna Canyon fault.

Ground Ru~tureand Shaking
The most significant hazard from an earthquake is ground-shaking. Far more damage is caused
by shaking than by actual surface rupture. The factors determining the degree of ground shaking
at a given location are:
1.      Distance from the earthquake epicenter (and focal depth).
2.      Size (force) of magnitude.
3.      Local soil, geologic and groundwater conditions.
An earthquake generated nearby can be felt as a single, severe jolt, such as the 1969 Laguna
Beach quake. Coming from a slightly greater distance, a double shock with lesser acceleration
but a longer period of shaking is experienced. The 1933 Long Beach earthquake was felt in
Laguna Beach in this manner. The Northridge earthquake caused prolonged shaking due to long
frequency waves.
The greatest hazard from ground-shaking is the effect on the structures and the occupants of the
structures. The manner in which structures respond to earth movements is dependent upon the
type of construction, the underlying geology and the magnitude and distance of the earthquake.
Statewide seismic design standards for new construction were not included in building codes
until 1933, after the Long Beach earthquake. Although seismic design standards have improved
over the years, they are minimum standards and will not make buildings completely resistant to
damage from earthquakes. Seismic design standards are only meant to increase structural
stability, reduce damage and minimize loss of life.
Generally, certain types of construction withstand ground movement better than others. Wood-
frame, single-story residential structures are the most stable'during an earthquake. Structures
with unreinforced masonry walls are the structures most susceptible to damage. Unreinforced
masonry construction was prevalent during the late 1800's to early 1900's for commercial
structures. Approximately 30 such structures exist today in Laguna Beach. However, Senate
Bill 547 required inventories and mitigation plans to be submitted to the State by January 1,
1990 to correct these structural hazards. Two-thirds of these commercial unreinforced masonry
structures in Laguna Beach have completed the retrofitting process. The remainder must be
completed by 1997.
The local geology affects the intensity of earthquake shockwaves as they pass through the area.
A large portion of Laguna Beach is located on highland areas underlain by bedrock and the
cementation and elasticity of this natural foundation allow the groundwaves to travel faster than
                                   Topic 3 - Geologic Hazards
                             Safety Element    - City of Laguna Beach
they would through areas of thick alluvial sediments. Severe damage to structures results where
tall structures are built over thick, soft, water-saturated soils. The area which can expect the
most damage to structures is the lowland alluvial regions of Laguna Canyon, its tributaries and
the downtown basin. Here the sediments lack the density and cementation of upland regions and
the shaking is likely to be more intense. The presence of a high water table can make damage
worse. Areas of thick surficial soils on hillsides may also be susceptible to increased shaking.
Geologic conditions vary so markedly that one of two adjoining lots may be on sound bedrock
and the other on less stable soils. For this reason, each individual site must be evaluated to
determine the seismic standards necessary for construction.
Some facilities warrant special seismic standards because of their -occupancy andlor their
function. Schools, hospitals and facilities necessary for emergency operations fall into this
category. Other facilities, such as utility lines, warrant special attention to siting and seismic
design standards. The Uniform Building Code addresses these facilities under the classification
of "essential facilities." Public schools in California fall under the approval authority of the
State Architect, which enforces the high standards of earthquake bracing for all new schools.
Hospitals, clinics and nursing homes fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of Statewide Health
Planning and Development. Seismic standards are enforced on all other structures by the City.
A major earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater (Richter) on the Newport-Inglewood fault could
have serious effects on the lifelines (facilities such as highways, bridges, electrical power lines,
gas lines, water and sewage lines and communication lines) in Laguna Beach according to
Special Report 99, prepared by the Division of Mines and Geology and the Department of
Conservation. The quake would cause Pacific Coast Highway to be blocked by severe pavement
breakage and liquefaction failures. The bridge at Aliso Creek could suffer extensive damage.
Intense shaking and ground failures would damage electrical power transmission towers and lines
and would result in power outages. Underground waste water pipelines could be expected to
perform reasonably well except in liquefaction areas, where significant damage should be
anticipated. Potential failure locations are at connections between service lines and transmission
lines., .In.addition to loss of sanitary sewer service to thousands of people, the most serious
impact of the projected damage to the waste water system would be the contamination problems
of the discharge of untreated sewage into the ground, streets and ocean. The primary impact
on natural gas facilities would be fires, which could be expected due to broken gas mains and
service connections in the areas of high liquefaction potential. Fires can be very difficult to deal
with when there are damaged roadways and broken water lines, combined with disrupted
communication lines. Preparedness for seismic disturbance is of very great importance relative
to gas service.

  Liquefaction
  Liquefaction refers to a phenomenon in which water-saturated granular soils behave like a liquid
  when intergranular water pressure moves the grains apart. To have potential for liquefaction,
  three simultaneous conditions are necessary: cohesion-less soils, high groundwater, and degree
  of ground-shaking. Sediments of the Holocene age (less than 11,000 years) are more susceptible
  to liquefaction than older sediments. Stream and estuarine deposits in which the water table is
  high generally have a high potential for liquefaction.
  Buildings, utilities, transportation facilities and reservoirs in these areas are subject to damage
  because the soils lose their ability to support structures. Liquefaction potential in Laguna Beach
  is based primarily upon the association of alluvial areas with shallow or potentially shallow
  groundwater depths (less than 20+ feet). A liquefaction evaluation of specific sites is necessary
  to mitigate potential hazards for new construction.
  Seismicallv Induced Settlement and Slom Failure
  In the absence of a shallow water table, but with soil conditions otherwise ideal for liquefaction,
  settlement can occur to some degree, depending upon the intensity of shaking and the looseness
  character of the soil. Such a compacting process would damage structures primarily where there
  is significant differential settlement within a short distance in alluvial valley areas, or where a
  site was partially on bedrock and partially on a fill or surficial earth materials. This
  phenomenon is of primary concern in those areas of Laguna where the underlying fill or surficial
  material is loose and can become saturated or where foundation conditions vary greatly within
  one lot or between adjoining sites. For example, one portion of a lot may be on sound bedrock
  and another portion on unsafe slide debris, thick residual soils, or loose fill.
  Tsunamis and Seiches
- Tsunamis.~are  .seismic sea waves generated by large submarine earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
  or large submarine landslides. Seiches are stationary oscillations of enclosed or partly enclosed
  bodies of water caused by landslides, sudden changes in atmospheric and wind pressure or
  earthquakes. Only seismically induced seiches are considered a potential hazard. The tsunami
  hazard is considered to be low for the elevations above the principal sea cliffs in Laguna Beach.
  Areas on the beach or below this sea cliff are considered to have a moderate tsunamic hazard,
  depending on tidal conditions and their elevation with respect to sea level.
  The Army Corps of Engineers has estimated a 7-8 foot potential run-up for the coastal area.
   Assuming a coincidental highest tide, areas below the 1617 foot contour level could be
  inundated by a tsunami. The chance of this occurring appears to be low based on existing data;
  but if an earthquake happened along the Newport-Inglewood fault, a tsunami of a much higher
   inundation level could be expected.

                                   TOPIC 4: FIRE HAZARDS
   California experiences large, destructive wildland fires almost every year. In October and early
   November of 1993,26 major fires burned more than 200,000 acres in Southern California. The
   potential for a severe wildfire to occur is increased when dense vegetation growth and large
   accumulations of .dead.plant material .are present. Weather. conditions and steep terrain also
   increase the hazardous wildfire potential; however, these conditions do not cause wildfires.
   Human error, arson, high-voltage lines, vehicles and lightning are the primary causes of
   wildfires. Moreover, an expanding population seeking living space and recreation in the fire
   hazardous wildland contributes to the problem. The City of Laguna Beach, typifying the
   conditions throughout the State, faces a serious threat of wildland fires annually.
   Structural fires, which typically involve only a single structure, are the most common fires that
   are battled routinely by local fire departments. Some of the common causes of structural fires
   are arson, electrical problems, combustibles too close to heat sources, unattended cooking and
...rnisuse.:of.smokingmaterials. The combination of building materials, density, frre flow, hydrant
   location, response time of emergency equipment and natural conditions can exacerbate potential
   structural fire disasters.
  9-                       Classification Svstem
   There are three levels of fire hazard zones within the wildlands surrounding the City. These
   zones are adapted from a fire hazard severity classification system for California wildlands
   developed by the State of California Department of Forestry. These classes are moderate, high
   and extreme fire hazard. This classification utilizes field investigation and present topographical
   information to define the fire hazard classes based upon three criteria: (1) Fuel Loading; (2) Fire
   Weather; and (3) Slope.
   Buel Loading includes three classes. Light fuels represent flammable grass and annual herbs.
   There are only a few areas in Laguna Beach which fit this category. Most of these have been
   altered by man's actions: cattle grazing, fuel breaks, etc. Medium fuels include brush and other
   perennial shrubs less than six feet in height with a crown density of 20 percent or more. This
   comprises the largest group in Laguna Beach, with the coastal sage scrub and chaparral plant
   associations dominating this group. Plants include: Rhus integrifolia (Lemonade Berry), Rhus
   laurina (Laurel Sumac), Artemesia California (California Sagebrush) and Eriogonum
   Fasciculatum (California Buckwheat). Heavy fuels are the heavier brush species, woodland
   types and timber types over six feet in height with a crown density of 20 percent or more. In
   Laguna Beach these areas are predominately located on north facing slopes in the canyons where
   the moisture content is greater. Plants in these areas include: Quercus agrifolia (Coast Live
   Oak), Rhus trilobata (Poison Oak), Heteromeles arbutifolia (Toyon). In Bluebird Canyon there
   is a stand of Eucalyptus globulus (Blue Gum) that also fits this heavy category.

Fire Weather includes three classes. Each class is related to the frequency of critical fire
weather days occumng in each of the State's Fire Danger Rating Areas over an eight to ten year
period. (Fire Danger Rating Areas are wildland geographical areas having similar climate.) The
Low Class (Class I), includes all those Fire Danger Rating Areas which have experienced fire
weather in the very high or extreme ranges on an annual average of less than one day; the High
Class (Class 2), has an annual average of 1 to 9.5 days; and the Extreme Class (Class 3), has
an annual average of more than 9.5 days. Each United States Geological Survey topographic
map in the State is keyed to one of the Fire Danger Rating Areas and assigned that area's critical
fire weather frequency classification. Based on the above methodology, Laguna Beach has been
classified as a Class 2 Fire Danger Area.
Slope is divided into four classes as part of the Fire Hazard Severity Classification Scale. The
following classes are based on the slope: 0-9.9 percent, 10 to 19.9 percent, 20 to 39.9 percent
and over 40 percent. Slope is recognized as having an effect on fire behavior similar to the
effect of wind (i.e., an increase in slope produces an increase in the rate of fire spread). The
system therefore assigns values to slope which modify the various fire danger indices
accordingly.
Each class of fuel loading, fire weather, and slope is assigned a severity factor value. The
values are multiplied in a matrix to produce a Fire Hazard Severity Scale. This scale is relative,
that is, a fire occurring in an area determined to represent a moderate fire hazard will be less
severe than a fire occurring in an area representing an extreme fire hazard. It is important to
note that this information represents a synthesis and necessary generalization of more detailed
information, and thus is not an exhaustive description of the vegetation, slope patterns, etc., that
exist. Rather, it represents the interpretationfgeneralizationof available information as it relates
to suitability of development based on fire safety.
Wildland Fire Hazard Potential
Several.factorsaffect the hazard potential one can expect from a wildland fire in any given area.
These factors include topography, vegetation, climate, development patterns, access and fire
fighting capabilities to the area. All of the factors combined to contribute to the devastating
wildfire in Laguna Beach on October 27, 1993, which engulfed 16,682 acres, destroyed 366
homes (286 homes within the City Limits) and damaged 642 homes.
The topography of Laguna Beach can best be described as being dominated by hillsides and
canyons. This topographical condition has considerable effect on wildland fire behavior and on
the ability of fire fighters and their equipment to take action to suppress those fires. This
topography also channels air flow, creating extremely erratic winds on the slopes and in the
canyons.

  Vegetation
  Along with the local topography, marine influences play a significant role in shaping the fire
  hazard potential for the area. The topography and soils encountered in the San Joaquin Hills
  along with climatic conditions, predominately influenced by the Pacific Ocean, have contributed
  to the plant environment found in Laguna Beach: coastal sage scrub and, to a lesser extent,
  chaparral and grassland. If the vegetation in the wildland areas is not periodically burned, the
  fuel load can create hazardous conditions. Other forms of fuel density control are grazing
  programs and fuel reduction by machinery and by the use of hand crews.
  Climate
  Climate is the single most important contributing factor to the fire problem. The Santa Ana
  winds are a phenomenon caused by very dry and warm air originating from high-pressure
  systems over California, Utah and Nevada. Winds can reach up to 70+ miles per hour and
  have a humidity of near zero. Precipitation (its annual total, seasonal distribution, and storm
  intensity) has further effects on the moisture content of dead and living vegetation and hence has
  important effects on fire ignition and behavior potential. Precipitation in Orange County
  averages between 9 and 15 inches per year and generally falls during the period from November
  to April. Most of the large fires occur during the fall, following abnormally wet winters.
  The wind is a separate factor once a large brushfire has begun. It drives the fire before it,
  increasing the rate of spread downwind in proportion to its velocity. Passing through and
  beyond the fire, it then becomes a super-heated current of air which can move downhill rapidly
  and uphill many times faster, especially when funneled by the shape of gullies and canyons.
  Where the wind and topography combine to direct such an effect, the heat can be so intense that
  temperatures may reach 2400 to 2600 degrees. A strong wind can also carry burning debris,
  igniting many spot fires, often times from one-half mile to a mile downwind.
. .If enough-areais ablaze simultaneously, the updraft from rising heat can generate a vortex or
  tornado which can lift up and propel firebrands over a wide area outside the original fire, which
  can then rapidly expand. The updraft can generate an unbalanced condition on uneven terrain
  which presses the flames against any nearby steep slopes, igniting them. Therefore, even in the
  absence of any prevailing wind, the fire can generate fire whirls which may move uphill with
   great rapidity. Auto-generation effects can arise because of the fire itself, if it is sufficiently
   large. These are usually referred to collectively as a firestorm.
  Development Patterns
   Development patterns can have considerable effect on fire ignition and rate of spread. This is
   especially true in the open space interface areas where the presence of man near the highly
   flammable brush creates a critical situation.
                                         Topic 4 - fire Hazards
                              Ssfety Element  - City of Laguna Beach
Building design and material, small lots, and the resulting proximity of adjacent structures
compound the potential impacts of structural fire. When these combine with the threats of brush
fires, fire hazards reach critical concerns. Some of the following neighborhoods have been
identified as having critical development patterns with respect to fire are: Arch Beach Heights,
DiamondICrestview, Canyon Acres, WoodlandIMilligan, the Olympic Village section of Upper
Bluebird Canyon and the interface areas of South Laguna. Development patterns also affect the
potential for fire hazard; highdensity development, small setbacks, narrow roads, long
culde-sacs and circuitous circulation patterns all work to reduce the effectiveness of fire fighting
efforts. In addition, small setbacks and flammable building materials, especially within
proximity to wildlands, tend to increase the propensity for fire and accelerate its spread.
The most significant factor determining overall fire risk is human proximity. The human
element is often responsible for the ignition of major brush fires, as evidenced by the abundance
and frequency of burns in the vicinity of residential neighborhoods. Unsupervised children,
wood burning fireplaces, increased recreational use of the wildlands (off-road vehicles) and arson
all contribute to the largest single source of wildland fires - man.
Access
Any discussion of access must simultaneously be concerned with egress, as well as ingress.
Title 21 of the Laguna Beach Municipal Code "Plats and Subdivisions" sets forth standards for
roadway development. As a result of early lifestyles and concomitant developmental patterns
numerous neighborhoods are presently served by roads which do not meet Title 21 requirements.
The upgrading of these roads to conformity is not, in certain areas, feasible or desirable. For
the purposes of hazard identification, the Fire Department has established a minimum
unobstructed roadway width of twenty feet.
For a variety of reasons streets which fail to meet fire department minimum requirements for
access restrict emergency mobility in the neighborhoods they serve. Among other reasons for
road width inadequacy are illegal parking patterns, a non-dedicated usable vehicular
right-of-way, and an insufficient fire department turn-around. Long cul-de-sacs (over 750') with
inadequate vehicle turn-around also create special problems. Situations where personnel and
equipment may be trapped, unable to reach the fire or flee from its path, are untenable. The
City Council directed the Fire Department to identify and mitigate those areas with only a single
access to and from the community. By providing a second access roadway, movement of fire
apparatus can be deployed as evacuation is taking place. Deployment of fire fighting equipment
is critical to successful fire defense of any community.

Fire Fighting Capabilities
The City of Laguna Beach is presently served by four fire stations. An automatic aid agreement
provides for Orange County response into the fringe areas of the City for fire protection. Truck
company service is also provided by the County on all structural fires. At least two Orange
County Fire brush engines respond on all reported brush fires. The Laguna Beach Fire Stations
are strategically located to provide optimum response times to most of the City. When the
response models were developed it was realized that four fire stations would serve the City in
a very effective manner. Response time (the time it takes to drive to the site after leaving the
station) averages were calculated and found to be between 3 and 5 minutes in all areas studied
within the City (except in the Club Laguna and El Toro area which is 5 minutes, 43 seconds.)
A boundary drop agreement lessens the response time to just over 3 minutes. Total reflex time
(time from receiving the call to site arrival) is around 7 minutes, where the driving response
time is 5 minutes or less as outlined above and if the unit is a first response unit.
The following equipment is currently housed at the following locations:
        F i e Station #1 -    One Type I engine and one utility vehicle.
        Fire Station #2 -     Two Type I engines, one paramedic squad, one utility vehicle and
                              one brush engine.
        Fire Station #3 -     One Type I engine.
        Fire Station #4  -    Two Type I engines and one brush engine.
The Fire Department is currently staffed by 3 fire fighters at each station for a total of 12 on
duty per shift. The Department is augmented by an authorized cadre of 15 to 20 reserve
firefighters.
Currently the Fire Department responds to about 120 structural fires each year. Events which
involve one average structure are easily handled by four engine companies. Much of the
response area of the City is adjacent to the wildland. The Laguna Beach Fire Department, as
part of its resources, has two brush engines which will be equipped with Class A foam for
wildland fire fighting. Additionally, the Type I engines will be outfitted with Class A foam
within a year to conform to state-of-the-art standards.
Local Programs and Legislation
As experienced by the City of Laguna Beach in October, 1993, the Mutual Aid system works
very well. However, mitigation measures must be implemented to ensure that the vulnerability
to wildfires is reduced. The success.of increasing public safety regarding fire hazards relies on
systematically fighting the threat of fire before the fire occurs through a host of programs.

         These programs include amending building codes, initiating controlled bums, developing
         guidelines for the placement and location of fire hydrants, developing landscape guidelines,
         defensible space management on a city-wide basis, enhancing the fuel modification program and
         analyzing the water system for fire fighting use. In February of 1994, the City Council adopted
         several staff recommendations to lower the risk of wildfire in the City of Laguna Beach. These
         areas of risk and necessary modifications are discussed in the following sections.
         The City of Laguna Beach Fire Department participated in preparing a Report of the
         WildlandIUrban Interface Task Force. This report was compiled in response to the disastrous
         wildfires that struck Orange County in October of 1993. Recognizing that steps must be taken
         to preclude a reoccurrence, a multi-agency task force was convened and charged with addressing
         the issues relevant to the wildlandlurban interface. The report, which has been endorsed by the
         Orange County Fire Chiefs' Association and has the support of the Building Industry
         Association, contains recommendations that have been tied to very high fue hazard severity
         zones, as applicable. The report contains a wildland hazard reduction inspection program,
         proposed amendments to the Uniform Building and Fire Codes, fuel modification guidelines for
         high fire hazard areas, a wildland fire management planning model and model ordinance and
         resolutions.
         Building Codes and Landscaping Guidelines
         The Fire-Zone Mapping Bill, (Assembly Bill 337 - the Bates Bill), requires the identification of
         fire zones within the 15 most vulnerable counties within California based on fuel load, weather,
         slopes and housing density. As a result of this Bill, the City of Laguna Beach will amend the
         fire severity zones to reflect the Bill's intent. The entire City is designated as being in the Very
         High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
         Wildland fires have demonstrated the need for fire-resistive building construction requirements
         in the wildland/urban interface zone that are more restrictive than the provisions in the Uniform
........:Building.Codes (UBC). The City of Laguna Beach has adopted special building requirements
         in its hazardous fire area (wildlandlurban interface zone) that exceed the UBC requirements.
         After the fire in Laguna Beach on October 27, 1993, a task force was established to determine
         if changes should be made to the Municipal Code to require homes to be even more fire-resistant
         in the hazardous fire area. Based on the task force's recommendations, the City Council
         recommended the use, where possible, of fire-resistive construction to resist fire spread. The
         Community Development Department has a list of fire-resistive components which can be used
         in new construction or in retrofit situations. Noncombustible roofs, double- and triple-pane glass
         and stucco-wrapped horizontal and vertical projections are examples of recommended fire
         resistive components.

                            Safety Element   - City of Luguna Beach
The Fire Department must also develop, implement and maintain a community and neighborhood
hazard identification and abatement program to support defensible space management.
Defensible space is the private property, usually landscaped, which is managed in such an
manner that the ornamentals or native plants do not increase the fuel loading in relation to
structures.
Fuel Modification Program
Through sound management of the vegetation and planting at the urban wildlands interface it is
possible to increase moisture content and reduce fuel loading, thus moderating potential fire
hazard. The process of changing the moisture content by adding irrigation or planting moisture-
retentive plants and reducing the volume of shrubs and woody debris by thinning and removal
is termed fuel modification. Thinning and removal can be accomplished by the use of hand
crews or by a combination of manual removal and grazing. The City has used both methods to
maintain fuel modification zones. In the past cattle grazed the Irvine and Moulton Ranches to
the north and east; and in recent years the City has contracted with herders to have goats graze
vegetation in planned bands between homes and naturally vegetated areas.
Fuel modification can be effective, with North Laguna as an example. Although located directly
in the path of the fire, the North Laguna area did not suffer heavy loss of homes in the 1993
firestorm. This may be partly because of the fuel modification zone which had been thinned by
supervised goat grazing one to two years before the firestorm occurred. These hills are also rich
in moisture-retaining beavertail cactus, which is much slower to burn than dry sage scrub.
A typical recommended design for fuel modification zones is illustrated in Figure IV-1. The
design shown in the figure consists of four zones varying in degree of modification between the
structure and the unmodified natural vegetation. Management within these zones includes
planting water-retentive, low-fuel shrubs and ground covers, adding irrigation, and doing
graduated selective thinning of the vegetation to control the heat and intensity of wildland fires.
Combustible structures such as decks, sheds, gazebos and wood fences should not be placed in
any of the zones.
Balancing fire safety with protection of the native vegetation means that the width of the fuel
modification zone must be weighed against the amount of vegetation to be removed. In general,
if the fuel modification zone is kept very narrow, most of the vegetation will have to be
removed. Conversely, a wider fuel modification zone will allow more of the vegetation to
remain. A fuel modified area should be no less than about 200 feet wide due to flame tongues
that alone can reach 200 feet during severe fire weather. The intent is that the width of the fuel
modification area not be a set distance, but that it should be undulating in response to slope
steepness and fire hazard potential.

   The canyon and hillside areas classified as high hazard areas often contain sensitive native
   vegetation, including endangered, rare and locally important plants and animal habitat.
   Consequently, fuel modification programs must include measures to balance fire safety and
   protection of sensitive plant species and habitat for rare, threatened or endangered wildlife
   species.
   To accomplish the objectives of maintaining fire safety while protecting sensitive native
   vegetation, slope stability and the integrity of natural areas, a fire protection program should
   incorporate a combination of the following:
              fire-resistant building materials;
              minimizing combustible materials (including platings, decks, fencing and firewood)
              around the home;
               setback of combustible construction from the wildlands area;
              imgated buffer zones; and
               fuel modification zones.
   By employing a combination of all of these prevention techniques (rather than relying on
   vegetation removal alone), a higher level of safety can be achieved, the quality of natural areas
    can be preserved and risk of erosion and slope stability can be minimized.
    Annual maintenance of pruning and removal of dry and dead materials is needed to assure that
    the fuel modification areas continue to provide an area of reduced fire hazard.
    Fuel modification can occur on private or public land, but modification performed by private
    property owners cannot go beyond property lines without agreement by the adjacent property
    owners. In cases where fuel modification is needed on public land, a fuel modification easement
    can be granted to the adjacent private party assigning the private party maintenance and liability
. . responsibility.
    While in most areas of the City with existing homes the concepts of fuel modification must be
    applied to remedy, as much as possible, a less than ideal situation, owners of undeveloped
    properties and lots should conduct site planning from the beginning of project design to create
    proper zones and setbacks, and to site structures at the safest locations in terms of fire danger.
    Responsibility for the continued maintenance of fuel modification areas also needs to be defined
    and structured,
    In 1963 Orange County initiated a fuel break program, and as a participant, the City of Laguna
    Beach took remedial action to address this persistent problem area -- the natural resource (open
    space)/urban interface. The City Council has since directed the Fire Department to implement
    a program, supported by the proper funding mechanisms, to widen existing fuel modifications
    and extend the program into the southern-most border of South Laguna and to instalYconstruct

fuel breaks in the interior canyon areas of Park AvenueIHidden Valley, Rimrock Canyon,
Bluebird Canyon, DiamondICrestview and Oro Canyon. The City will be working with the
Coastal Greenbelt Authority, the City of Laguna Niguel and respective neighborhood associations
including Emerald Bay, Laguna Sur and Monarch Point and the Orange County Harbors,
Beaches and Parks Department to support more aggressive wildland management techniques
which will provide younger fuel beds, support less flame intensity, and provide a mosaic pattern
of different ages of fuels, all of which will help reduce wildfire exposure.
Planning and Maintenance of Outdoor Areas Adjacent to Homes
While fuel modification deals with the treatment of the urbanlwildlands interface, the concept
of defensible space applies to all areas of the City. Creation of defensible space means the
arrangement of access on the property for ease of fire fighting and maintenance of properties to
minimize buildup of fuel that could ignite and cause fire to spread to the home.
Better access for fire fighting should include the following:
            providing safe walkways around all sides of the house; and
            keeping side yards unobstructed and free of flammable stored items.
Maintenance for fire safety should include the following:
            thinning of planting to remove dead wood and to reduce build-up of branches and
            foliage;
            removal of dried leaves and grasses, dead limbs and twigs, and chipping, composting
            and mulching planting areas where feasible;
            spacing and pruning of trees and shrubs to avoid continuous canopies and "fuel
            ladders" from ground to canopy;
            removal of plants growing up under eaves;
            pruning of tree branches and shrubs within ten feet of a chimney;
            removal of leaves, pine needles and debris from roofs and rain gutters;
            removal of combustible stored material and debris from around and under the house
            and decks; and
            stacking of firewood as far away from the home as possible.
When planning the landscape of a home, access for fire fighting should be considered in the
design. Maintenance considerations outlined above should be considered in the choice and
placement of plantings. Adjacent to the natural vegetation areas, construction of combustible
 structures--fences, decks, and gazebos should be minimized. Wood decks with open areas

Planting and Fire-wise Plant Choices
While much has been written and suggested regarding fire-resistant or fire-retardant plantings,
the 1993 fire demonstrated that any plant will bum. However, reasonable planting selections
combined with sound arrangement and spacing and good maintenance can improve the chance
that a structure will survive a wildlands fire. Lists of suggested and not-recommended plants
for the wildlands interface zone have been prepared by many public agencies, including the
Orange County Task Force, County of Los Angeles Fire Department and the City of Oakland,
as well as by the garden publications. The County of Orange Report of the WildlandfUrban
Interface Task Force, July 1994, also includes a recommended plant list for fuel modification
zones. A comparison of these often conflicting lists reveals certain criteria for fire-wise planting
as follows:
            Low fuel volume;
            High moisture content;
            High salt content;
            Low aromatic oil content;
            Low heat value;
            Minimal production of dry litter; and
            Suited to the site and climatic conditions so that plants will be healthy.
Consistently "not-recommended" plants include conifers--pines, cypress, cedar and junipers.
Also "not-recommended" are acacia, bougainvillea and ornamental grasses. Eucalyptus is also
"not-recommendednon many lists because of the high aromatic oil content and the tendency of
some species to produce high amounts of dry litter. The use of "not-recommended plants"
should be avoided adjacent to natural vegetation areas.
Because of Eucalyptus's dominance in the landscape of Laguna Beach, it is important to look
at this genus in more detail. There are over 700 species of Eucalyptus, and they vary greatly
in their .size, .fuel volume and litter production. An unmaintained Blue Gum, for example, has
a great deal more flammable material in its shedding bark, leaf litter and branches than a Lemon
Gum. Many of the Lemon Gums survived the 1993 fire with some charred trunks and loss of
foliage. The County of Orange Report of the Wildlandfurban Interface Task Force did not
single out or condemn Eucalyptus. It emphasized irrigation, thinning and spacing as keys to any
fire-safe landscape.
Irrigation, thinning .and clean-up to keep the amount of litter and dried materials low,
arrangement and spacing to avoid continuous canopies, and keeping foliage away from structures
are as important as the type of plants chosen.

Weed Abatement
The City of Laguna Beach has had a weed abatement program for over thirty years. Property
owners are notified when property they own is determined to be a weed nuisance. They then
have the option of either abating this problem themselves or having the City do it and bill them
for services rendered. In recent years the City has had this work performed through contract
services. This program addresses only weed abatement and generally does not address native
plant material that may be growing adjacent to an urbanized area.
Water System
The water districts which serve the City of Laguna Beach import all of their water from the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Met). The sources of Met's water include
northern California and the Colorado River.
Three water transmission lines currently bring water into water districts which serve the Laguna
Beach area. One line, under Pacific Coast Highway, starts in Corona del Mar and terminates
at the Laguna Beach County Water District's (LBCWD) San Joaquin Reservoir on Ledroit
Street. The second line begins in Irvine, runs through Laguna Canyon and terminates at
LBCWD's Moorhead Reservoir above the Art Festival grounds. The third line enters the
Laguna Beach area from the south along Pacific Coast Highway through South Coast Water
District (SCWD). A fourth line located between the proposed Top of the World Reservoir and
the Ridge Reservoir is anticipated to be completed in 1995-96.
Once the water has entered the Laguna Beach area, it is either stored in reservoirs at lower
elevations or pumped up into other reservoirs at higher elevations. The maximum elevation that
water can be stored in the Laguna Beach area without being pumped is 400' above sea level.
The amount of water required for extinguishing a single structure fire can be calculated by using
a complex, formula that takes into account the building type, building construction materials,
building area, material types stored inside the building and the surrounding terrain. After the
October 1993 firestorm, it became clear that a fire of that magnitude taxed the water supply and
delivery system beyond its design capability. In order to maximize the defensibility of interface
areas within the City, the City should continue to work with the Water Districts, in conjunction
with the Fire Department, to analyze these aspects of the water system for fire fighting use.

                                TOPIC 5: F'LOOD HAZARDS
   Historically, flooding has been beneficial to agricultural soil, wildlife and the general ecological
   balance. In the unaltered state, water systems have considerable built-in capacity for detaining
   storm waters that would otherwise surge too rapidly downstream and into estuarine basins.
   Hydrologists emphasize that, along natural watercourses, flooding is.a routine process. Flooding
   in an urban setting can also be viewed as a natural hazard.
   Virtually all stages of the natural hydrologic cycle, including flooding, have been significantly
   altered by human intervention. Changes in land use have profound effects on runoff and erosion
   on the land surface. As vegetation is removed and soil is exposed during construction, erosion
   rates may increase significantly. The creation of impermeable surfaces that accompany
   urbanization increases and concentrates runoff, leading to a greater incidence of flooding.
   A flood may be defined as a temporary rise in stream flow that results in water overtopping its
...banks and .inundating areas adjacent to the channel not normally covered with water. The
   lowland area adjacent to the stream that is subject to periodic inundation by floodwater is known
   as the floodplain.
   The magnitude of a flood is measured in terms of its peak discharge, which is the maximum
   volume of water (in cubic feet per second) passing a point along the channel. Floods, however,
   are usually referred to in terms of their frequency of occurrence. For example, the 100 year
   flood is a flood magnitude which has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
   year. There is a certain element of risk involved using this type of designation because the
   prediction of a flood of a particular magnitude is based on probability and an element of chance
   is involved. According to statistical averages, a 25-year flood should occur on the average once
   every 25 years. However, two 25-year floods could conceivably occur in any one year. For
   planning purposes the flood magnitude most often used in delineating floodplain boundaries is
  lthe.SOO-year.flood. This flood is also referred to as the intermediate regional or base flood.
   The climate of Laguna Beach is typically Mediterranean, characterized by warm, dry summers
   and cool, rainy and foggy winters. The average annual rainfall is 13 inches. Over 90% of this
   rainfall occurs between late October and early April.
   Flooding is a direct response to the amount, distribution and intensity of precipitation. Most
   surficial hillside damage is brought by sudden deluges of already soaked ground. Storms that
   combine high total rainfall, long duration and high daily maxima, as in the 1969 storm, are the
   most destructive. Heavy runoff and accelerated erosion are associated with this type of short-
   period torrential rain, as well as with storms of longer duration and greater totals.
   Historically, floods causing significant structural damage have occurred in Laguna Canyon in
    1937, 1938, 1941, ,1966, 1969, 1978, 1983 and 1995. Flood potential does exist in the form

   of temporary flash floods related to winter rains and wave runup. Most of the flash flood
   activity is isolated along the canyons, the floors of which act as runoff channels for the
   watershed above. With the exceptions of Laguna, Bluebird and Aliso Canyons, most flash flood
   conditions in Laguna Beach are short lived in nature due to the limited size of the available
   watershed and the presence of drainage improvements. Drainage resulting from flash floods is
   more erosive than inundative in nature.
   In general, three separate and distinct types of inundation are known to exist in Laguna Beach.
   Flood inundation hazards are those associated with major atmospheric events that result in
   inundation of developed areas, due to ovefflow of nearby stream courses, or inadequacies in
   local storm drain facilities. Facility inundation hazards are those associated with downstream
   inundation that would occur given a major structural failure in a nearby impoundment. Such
   failures would most likely be caused by geologic phenomena including seismic events and slope
   instability. The third inundation hazard is mud and debris flow that may occur during the rainy
   season.
   Sections of Laguna Beach are subject to flooding due to wave nmup. This type of flooding is
   typically caused by large swells produced by storms at sea occurring at high tide.
   Approximately every 10-15 years, waves wash up on Pacific Coast Highway between Broadway
   and Ocean Avenue. Wave runup is especially damaging to the residences located on Victoria
   and El Moro beaches. The water and debris left by the waves typically cause no damage to the
   commercial area, however, traffic is blocked along Pacific Coast Highway. Wave runup damage
   did occur in the downtown commercial area in 1929. In 1978, Main Beach Park suffered from
   wave runup and heavy sand deposition, and later that same year, several trailers at El Moro
   Beach were damaged due to wave runup.
   Sedimentaion is found where runoff, heavily laden with the products of erosion, undergoes a
   sudden decrease of velocity and can no longer transport its whole load. This is found usually
   at an abrupt decrease of slope, where any obstruction impounds the flow, or on bottomland
, .during.a heavy backwater flood. It is always proportionate to the amount of erosion taking
   place. Sedimentation presents a serious hazard to property located on a floodplain next to a
   natural streambed. It fills the bottom of the channel, reducing the carrying capacity until even
   a modest rainfall cannot flow by without overtopping the banks. Many residents have found that
   a heavy rainfall necessitates their patrolling the streambed during and just after the storm to
   remove any objects which could lodge and cause an obstruction and sedimentation.
   A mudflow is similar to a flash flood in that the effluent sweeps down canyons, causing damage
   by its rapid motion. It differs in the abnormally high percentage of sediment it contains,
   sometimes over half. This adds to the bulk, velocity, erosive power and destructive ability of
   the runoff. The usual observation about mudflows is that the damage is far out of proportion
   to the storm which produced it. The causative factors are unique. They are: 1) steep terrain,
   stripped of vegetation by fire or other causes and mantled with a thick residual soil high in clay
   and silt, and 2) a-series of .storms which first saturate the topsoil and then deliver an intense
                                                  - 53-

downpour to wash it away suddenly. Several areas of town experienced mudflows during 1969,
in late 1993 and early 1994, after the October 1993 firestorm, and in 1995.
The magnitude and frequency of flooding can be influenced by many factors. The growth of
brush and trees within the floodplain can act as an obstruction to floodwater flow. Flood heights
may also be naturally.increased by the occurrence of fire in a watershed followed by heavy
rainfall; The increase in storm runoff and sediment decreases the ability of the ground to absorb
additional moisture. Laguna Beach experienced this problem during moderate rains after the
October firestorm.
The encroachment of urban development is perhaps the most serious change in drainage basin
and floodplain characteristics that can influence the magnitude and frequency of flooding.
Urbanization often leads to a greater percentage of impervious surfaces which increases the total
volume of storm runoff by decreasing the amount of water that infiltrates into the ground.
Development can also result in the placing of artificial fill and other objects in the floodplain.
To protect development from the impacts of flooding, stream channels are often channelized
(straightened, lined, etc.) to move the water off of the land more efficiently. However, when
water emerges from the improved section of stream channel, it is often delivered to the
unchannelized downstream section at rates and velocities that the natural section of stream is not
capable of carrying. Piecemeal channelization efforts often exacerbate the flooding potential
downstream.       Therefore, it is important that flood hazard reduction operations be
comprehensive, well planned programs.
Local Setting
The City of Laguna Beach, Master Plan of Drainae was prepared in 1982, and the South
Laguna Master Plan of Drainage was prepared in November of 1993. These documents identify
the local network of flood control facilities and provide a basis for establishing funding
mechanisms and prioritizing system improvements. These Master Plans are primarily based on
existing conditions and facilities and anticipated land use to determine storm runoff. To continue
to be effective, they should be periodically updated to reflect new hydrologic modeling
techniques, revised rainfall runoff data, changed land use and development, and current costs.
The effects of storm water runoff in the City of Laguna Beach are not typical of problems in
inland areas, where run off from several tributary areas combines to inundate low-elevation
areas. Because the topography consists of a relatively long and narrow coastal plain backed by
rugged terrain covered by brush, each drainage area is separate. Although many of these
drainage areas are basically in an unaltered state, a majority of the lower reaches have been
channelized.

 Stream channelization involves straightening the natural meanders, clearing the banks and
 widening and deepening the channel. It is undertaken to assist in flood control and to increase
 developable land. Channelization lowers the level of the stream and the riparian water table,
 increases the rate of surface run off, increases the stream flow rate, enhances bank and bottom
 erosion, and transports a heavier sediment load than the unchannelized stream. Channelization
 also affects the beach replenishment process which is discussed in Topic 7, Shoreline Protection.
 Laguna Canyon channel is a major watercourse through the City. The headwaters commence
 from a shallow lagoon located at the upper corporate limits approximately 5 miles from the
 Pacific Ocean. The drainage area of Laguna Canyon and its tributaries is about 8 square miles,
 including the east fork along El Toro Road and Canyon -Acres wash.
 Development in the floodplain of Laguna Canyon ranges from dense at the mouth to sparse
 toward the City's upper limits. The lower end of the canyon opens into the central business
 district of Laguna Beach. The floodplain in this area has been completely developed.
 Residential and light industrial development is predominant in the area between Woodland Drive
 and El Toro Road.
 Boat Canyon and.the lower reach of Bluebird Canyon are two other major watersheds that
 traverse the City's coastal shelf. Both Boat and Bluebird Canyons exhibit extensive urban
 development in the floodplains. Much of Bluebird Canyon and Boat Canyon are in a natural
 state, excepting the lower reaches which are piped.
 With the exception of Laguna Canyon and South Laguna, watersheds in Laguna Beach vary in
 size from 2-3 acres up to 650 acres. Laguna Canyon watershed measures 5,000 acres and South
 Laguna encompasses approximately 1400 acres, extending into Laguna Niguel. Watersheds in
 the central portion of the City are typically located within the City Limits. Watersheds in the
 northern portion, including Laguna Canyon extend beyond corporate limits into other
jurisdictions. Land use planning in these adjacent areas (Laguna Sur in South Laguna, .Aliso
..Creek.and Aliso Viejo on Laguna Canyon Creek) have a direct effect on storm run-off on the
 watersheds. (Refer to Flood Hazard Map.)

    Flood Protection Measures
    As part of the National Flood Insurance Program, a report was prepared which delineated
    floodways in Laguna Beach. The generation of this report and accompanying maps help
    illustrate where development has encroached into the floodway creating a hazardous condition.
    A majority of the City's storm drain infrastructure, unless otherwise noted, is designed for the
    25-year flood. It would, therefore, be inadequate for the more generally accepted standard of
    a 100-year flood. Several drainage improvements have been made within the City which
    include, but are not limited to:
    Laguna Canyon Channel
    The existing channel improvements extend from the ocean to the GTE Corporation maintenance
    yard in Laguna Canyon. The reach from the ocean outlet at main beach to Beach Street is
    owned and maintained by the City of Laguna Beach. Caltrans constructed the reach of channel
    from Beach Street to the boardwalk in 1928 as part of a Pacific Coast Highway construction
    project. North of the GTE facility, the natural channel meanders through private property and
    has historically been maintained by the property owners. Both the existing improved channel
    and the unimproved natural channel are incapable of conveying the 100-year discharge as
  '
    depicted in Table 11. The City is currently conducting an analysis of alternatives to improve
    public safety and reduce flooding hazards in Laguna Canyon and the Downtown area. The
    primary goal of this study is to control floodwaters by storing them in retention, detention and
    filtering basins, which drain out when the downstream storm drains are no longer overtaxed.
    Boat Canyon
    The Boat Canyon storm drain extends from Hillcrest Drive to the Pacific Ocean. The drain has
    been designed to carry the 100-year frequency storm, however, a high debris factor causes local
,   flooding at the inlet at the rear of Riddle Field.
    Bluebird Canyon
    Bluebird Canyon has a graded greenbelt channel through its lower reach and a natural canyon
    in its upper reach. The storm drain from Glenneyre Street to the Pacific Ocean was designed
    to carry the 100-year frequency flood.
    Hidden Valley Canyon
    Hidden Valley Canyon has surface run off that runs down Park Avenue to Wendt Terrace. The
    Master Plan of Drainage proposes the extension of a pipe to Hidden Valley to resolve this
    problem.

Of the numerous other drainage facilities throughout the City of Laguna Beach, most drain areas
are of insignificant size or have the capacity to pass the 100-year storm. The concept of 100-
year protection remains desirable, but may not be achievable in the foreseeable future due to
financial factors. Therefore, the concept of providing reasonable level of drainage control to
meet the 10, 25, or 50-year design frequency should be considered while waiting for the
ultimate, 100-year design to be designed and funded. Drainage structures that do not meet the

                            Safety Element - City of Laguna Beach
standards of the 25-year storm and/or drain areas of sufficient size have been noted in drainage
studies.
In 1988 the City of Laguna Beach adopted a Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance to promote
sound land use and floodplain development standards pursuant to the rules and regulation of the
Federal Insurance Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Areas of
special flood hazard and areas of mudslide hazards have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) which has been
adopted by the City and is included as part of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.
In 1990 the City, along with the County of Orange, the Orange County Flood Control District
and the other Cities of Orange County (as Co-Permittees), were issued a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Permit, as part of the implementation of
the Federal Clean Water Act, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through the State
of California and the State Water Resources Control Board. The NPDES Permit established two
major requirements: 1) an effective prohibition of non-stormwater pollutant discharges into the
storm drainage system; and 2) implementation of water quality Best Management Practices
(BMPs) through the development and adoption of a Drainage Area Management Plan (DAMP).
The BMPs help to effectively control erosion sediment from discharging into the stormwater
drainage system.
Central to an effective prohibition of non-stormwater discharges is the enactment by local
jurisdictions of ordinances preventing such discharges. In 1995, the Co-Permittees will be
adopting such ordinances based on a model ordinance developed in 1994. In Laguna Beach the
Water Quality Control Ordinance will replace Title 16 of the Municipal Code regarding
Industrial Waste Disposal that was adopted in 1990. The new Water Quality Control Ordinance
is intended to prevent industrial waste pollution, .as- well as other non-stormwater pollutant

                         TOPIC 6: SHORELINE PROTECTION
 The California coastline has been eroding for thousands of years. Erosion did not present
 economic or safety issues as long as the coastal areas were left undeveloped or were used for
 agriculture or low-intensity recreation. The desire for magnificent ocean views and convenient
 beach access has induced many people to build at the ocean's edge, even in high-risk locations.
 For such dwellings, each severe winter storm is a potential disaster. Coastal erosion is likely
 to continue or even to accelerate in the future.
 Damage from storms and erosion are episodic in nature. The winter storm of 1982-1983
 resulted in substantial losses to Orange County beaches. With continued coastal community
 growth and development, property values continue to increase. Costs from damage due to major
 storms could be greater each year as coastal land is increasingly upgraded and developed.
 Owners of oceanfront properties become more concerned with protecting their investment from
 storm erosion and structural damage. During and after severe storms, many oceanfront property
 owners attempt to construct protective devices that do not consider the complex interrelationships
 of the land and sea.
 Over the years, the bluffs of the coast of California have been modified by the development of
 structures and through the use of irrigated landscaping. Seacliffs with weak geologic structures
 are typically prone to landsliding, rockfalls and surficial failures. Extensive grading,
 landscaping and irrigation can exacerbate this problem. Preventive measures are the most
 logical goal for the City. Prior to approving structures designed to retain the slope, drains,
 dewatering sublayers and modifying landscape and irrigation should be considered.
 Seacliff retreat is a natural process. When considered over a long period of time, the seacliffs
 and beaches are retreating. This retreat is episodic, infrequent, site-specific, directly related to
 wave climate and rainfall, and is highly impacted by urbanization. The protection, preservation
.:and.restorationof sandy beaches and the desire of private property owners to protect their
 investments are closely interrelated. The value and enjoyment of oceanfront property depends,
 to a great degree, upon the existence of a sandy beach. As sandy beach widths are reduced, an
 increase in the amount of wave attack on beach front property and the base of the existing
 seacliff occurs.
 Sand management is the act of controlling the littoral sediment resource, to the extent possible,
 to benefit the recreational and protective functions of a beach. It requires that changes in beach
 width be anticipated before they occur. Only then can enlightened decisions be made and cost-
 effective methods be implemented to deal with undesirable shoreline behavior.

                                   Topic 6 - Shoreline Protection
                             Safety Element - City of Luguna Beach
       Conditions
The Laguna Beach coastline is characterized by short, generally narrow sandy beaches separated
by protruding headlands. The coastline retreated at an unequal rate as sea level rose about 400
feet in the last 18,000 years. Headland seacliffs of resistant rock did not retreat as fast as the
more erosive seacliffs in the embayments. Beaches formed and are maintained in the
embayments because there they are partially protected and contained by the headlands. The sand
is held in the bay or compartment and the compartment functions as a closed sand system (sand
moving parallel to shore) that can be managed separately from other coastal compartments.
Sediment discharge from streams, particularly Laguna Canyon and Aliso Creek, could change
and decrease the yield of sediment. Sediment yield is usually reduced as a result of maturing
urban or suburban development. Channelizing streams, even small ones, can affect sediment
discharged to the ocean. Therefore, streams should be left in their natural condition whenever
possible. Future channelization projects should analyze this potential effect to the City's
beaches.
In April of 1988, the City of Laguna Beach adopted Guidelines for Shoreline Protection, with
technical data, prepared by Craig Everts of Moffatt & Nichol, Engineers. The primary objective
of the Guidelines was to develop a better understanding of the localized shoreline environment,
including its history, changes, and general performance. This document provides a mechanism
for evaluating proposed alternatives for shoreline design factors and provides guidance as to their
suitability for any particular application.
With only a limited number of exceptions, few residential and commercial structures in the City
are exposed directly to ocean wave attack. Periodically, foundation materials are washed by
waves which cause landward erosion and retreat and threaten long-term stability. In an ongoing
effort to arrest this process and to develop the beach-front for recreational use, approximately
 106 seawalls, bulkheads and foundation walls have been constructed in the City (excluding South
Laguna). (A seawall or "shore protective device" is any bulkhead, retaining wall, revetment,
fence,,berm .or other structure primarily designed to prevent erosion or other damage due to
wave action.) Most of these improvements were constructed many years ago, before the City
had specific standards and requirements for them. Excluding the bulkhead beneath the Main
Beach Boardwalk, these structures extend to an aggregate footage of 4,981 lineal feet when
added end-to-end. This amounts to one-third of the City's beach frontage, excluding South
Laguna beaches, backed by some type of structural device. Many of the older reinforced
concrete structures are in various stages of distress due to cracking, settlement and exposure of
reinforcing steel. Many are inadequately founded and are being undermined by scouring during
storms. Accelerated scour on either side of structures that extend seaward of the bluff can be
detrimental to the adjoining owners. Other structures show a lack of maintenance,
demonstrating the need for long-term upkeep to ensure continued functionality. Finally,
location, construction materials and appearance oftentimes raise fundamental aesthetic questions
(Everts 1988).

 Shore protective devices have three potential undesirable effects. These are as follows:
         "1)     A protective device constructed seaward of the base of the seacliff will be
                 responsible for a reduction in beach width because the landward edge of the beach
                 is artificially moved seaward.
         2) A protective device may be responsible for a permanent loss of sand in the coastal
             compartment, and hence a reduction in beach width.
         3) A protective device may be responsible for a temporary loss of beach sand which
             reduces the width of the beach. This may occur even though the volume of sand in
             the coastal compartment over a long period of time is not affected by the device.   "'
 Beach replenishment is an active management response to an imbalance in the sediment budget
 of a coastal compartment. Beach or sand replenishment could be an aesthetically attractive and
 economic alternative to the construction of hard shoreline protection devices. Beaches are very
 effective .in dissipating wave energy. It is important to understand that sand replenishment
 cannot be expected to solve all shoreline problems, especially areas that are experiencing failures
 independent of wave attack. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of using a natural material such
 as sand for shore protection should be investigated. The development of a database could help
 to prepare for a long-range planning effort.
 Knowledge of the natural and actual rates of shoreline erosion is important for planning
 purposes. Comprehensive studies of rates of erosion by oceanographers and marine geologists
 have not been done during past decades. The City of Laguna Beach is participating in a five-
 year study of the Orange County Coast. The cost is shared by the Federal Government and
 Orange County and five coastal cities, including Laguna Beach. The report began in 1991 and
 covers the portion of the Orange County coastline from the mouth of the San Gabriel River to
 the Dana Point headlands, approximately 32 miles. The product of this report will provide a
.database .of sediment type, movement and location, wind, currents and wave height and
 frequency that will establish a "normal" condition. A primary goal is to provide comprehensive
 coastal data and information in a format that helps coordinate and enhance the efforts of federal,
 state and local agencies involved in managing and maintaining valuable coastal resources. Such
 information can be invaluable in designing beach nourishment projects and in preparing oil spill
 contingency plans, both of which are regional issues. The study will provide an opportunity for
 commencing a regional benchmark investigation and will enable the City to comply with
 recommendations relative to "resource monitoring" as outlined in the City's Shoreline Protection
 Guidelines.

                               Policies
 Prohibit the construction of buildings and other man-made structures on the
 sandy portion of the beach, unless necessary for public health and safety.
 Review any development application for shoreline construction with respect
 to the criteria contained in the Guidelines for Shoreline Protection, including
 the effects of beach encroachment, wave reflection, reduction in seacliff sand
 contribution and aesthetic criteria.
 Prohibit shoreline protective devices which will materially and adversely
 affect the sand supply or cause an adverse impact to shoreline processes,
 unless the situation is one in which there is evidence that the existing
 structure(s) may be in eminent danger from erosion and is designed to
 mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply, and unless all
 reasonable alternatives have been explored.
 Enforce building setback standards on local beaches to prevent exposure of
 structures to large sea waves of seismic or storm origin. .
 Prevent shoreline development which would place structures in danger of
 wave attack or degrade natural means of shoreline protection.
 Ensure that storm water and drainage are contained, controlled and
 discharged in an appropriate manner.
 Explore possibilities for beach or sand replenishment as an alternative to the
 construction of hard shoreline protection devices.
-Consider the impacts of flood control improvements on sand replenishment
 of the beach.
 Require damaged shoreline protection devices to be consistent with prevailing
 zoning regulations and general plan policies.

    The policies of Safety Element of the General Plan establish the actions and requirements
    necessary to direct safety-related decisions in the City. It is recognized that the implementation
    of the policies in this document may already be underway or may evolve dependent upon City
    staffing levels, economic conditions and manmade or natural physical events. The time-frame
    objectives delineated in this section are goals for actions to be accomplished over the next three
    years. This section also identifies actions that need to be undertaken on an ongoing basis. The
    time-frames are based on a snapshot of the community values, politics and conditions at a
    particular moment in time. Since these factors are continually in flux, the City must continually
    monitor the relevance of the Safety Element policies and their implementation progress, so that
    the main goal of protecting the public's health and safety over time is maintained and improved.
    The City Council recognizes this charge and will annually review the safety objectives achieved
    during the preceding year and will set new safety objectives for the next year, based upon
    changing conditions, new information and revised City policies and priorities.
: . Many,of the,implementation actions will require additional staffrng and/or additional funding for
    their successful and timely completion. Funding constraints beyond the City's control may make
    it difficult or impossible to allocate funds for the necessary staff, equipment or consulting
    services necessary to complete some of the items. It is recognized that the necessary staff,
    equipment and consultants are dependent upon an annual appropriation by the City Council as
    part of the annual budget process and annual review and prioritization of safety objectives. It
    is also recognized that the implementation measures identified in this Safety Element will realize
    substantial cost benefits in the preparation for disasters and their avoidance or impacts.
    Some of the implementation measures require capital improvement projects to be constructed.
    These projects may require a review according to the provisions of the California Environmental
    Quality Act, and environmental degradation and grading shall be minimized to the greatest extent
    possible. However, it is also likely that some of these projects, such as emergency access
   improvements, may prevent the literal consistency with all of the pertinent General Plan and
    environmental protection policies, thereby necessitating a careful balancing of competing
    objectives. Public health and safety should be of primary concern when prioritizing these
    competing objectives.
    The City's Safety Element includes actions which range from measures necessary to insure
    consistency between the City's general plan and federal, state and local regulations to those
    actions required to fulfill the policies in the plan. These actions have been divided into four time
    frames with the designation the primary department(s) responsible for their implementation.

             ADDENDUM TO THE SCENIC HIGHWAYS ELEMENT
The following policies were derived from the South Laguna Specific
Plan (SLSP) and are herein by reference added to the Laguna Beach
Scenic Highways Element. In an effort to consolidate the SLSP
with the Laguna Beach General Plan, some policies from the SLSP
have been added to either the Land Use Element, the Open Space/
Conservation Element, the Transportation/Circulation Element or
the Housing Element. Other policies have been eliminated due to
the existence of comparable policies in the City's General Plan.
The following additionslchanges are to be included in the text of
the Scenic Highways Element upon the update and reprinting of the
document.
SCENIC HIGHWAYS
The Scenic Highways Element designates Pacific Coast Highway as a
scenic highway. The visual corridor was established for Pacific
Coast Highway in each direction and combined into a composite
viewshed analysis (Figure 4 ) . The visual corridor was established
by placing station points (view origin points) along the center
line of Pacific Coast Highway at regular intervals. A viewing
template of the drivers1 cone of vision under normal conditions
was made to establish the visual boundaries. Visual boundaries
are determined by combining topographic relief and the plants or
man-made structures added to it. It is assumed the structures are
opaque and vegetation is also opaque. The view is determined by
an angle of vision taken at a point five feet above station point
and extending from the station points until blocked by various
visual boundaries. This establishes the edge of the visual
corridor.
The views from Pacific Coast Highway are important for they
probably represent the most frequently seen features of the commu-
nity. Other views, however, are also important and would include:
views from the beaches and from the ocean, views from residential
areas within the community, and views from the hillside open space
and trail system.
Policies
    1. Plans for scenic highways shall be integrated with open
       space plans as they are developed.
    2. Scenic highway corridors shall be designed to maximize the
       compatible multi-purpose objectives of open space planning
       such as recreation, conservation, public health and safety,
       and preservation of scenic-aesthetic amenities.
    3. The scenic highway should traverse areas of relatively high
       aesthetic, recreational or cultural value which may include
       such features as: lakes, streams, creeks, rivers, wetlands
       and other bodies of water; unusual geologic formations;
       outstanding scenic vistas; exceptional pastoral views or
   mountain scenes; notable urban scenes; and cultural and
   historical features offering enjoyment and edification for
   the motorist.
4. The scenic corridor plan should not provide impetus for
   other forms of development detrimental to the values of the
   scenic highway corridor.
5. Construction of any scenic highway should be subordinate to
   the scenery; in rural areas, scenic vistas and views should
   be protected; in urban areas, man-made landscapes should be
   created as well as protecting sites with distinct urban
   vistas.
6. Any scenic highway should be linked, when possible, to
   regional parks, trails, wildlife areas and historical
   sites, greenbelts and other recreation-open space areas
   without being detrimental to them.
7. Where possible, a scenic highway should be connected to
   State Scenic Highways and other scenic highways to form a
   linked system.
8. In urban, or urbanizing areas, consideration should be
   given to the design of any scenic highway and its corridor
   as a buffer between communities and as an open space link
   between other open space and recreation areas.
