•  Town revisions to its Municipal Code. The Town has made changes in its Municipal Code such as the definition
  of family which reads “An individual, or group of two or more persons occupying a dwelling and living together as a
  single housekeeping unit in which each adult resident has access to all parts of the dwelling.” (WMC § 153.005). This
  definition is more supportive of people with disabilities as it does not limit the number of disabled people living with
  each other to create a supportive living environment.
  In 2005, the Town amended the Municipal Code to include exceptions for minor improvements for disabled access
  (Woodside Municipal Code §153.063).

 A. Affordable Housing Opportunities
      1. Accessory Living Quarters
            Program Description and    Promote accessory living quarters (ALQs) as an opportunity for affordable housing through
            Objective                  community outreach and information, streamlined review; incentive programs; and
                                       consideration of new ordinances that would permit affordable rental units, provide amnesty
                                       for existing accessory units, reduce construction fees, and allow additional square footage for
                                       main residence where accessory units are deed restricted for affordability and limited size.
            Timeframe and Achievements Ongoing
            Program Evaluation and     The Town promotes accessory living quarters (ALQs) by allowing them in all residential
            Recommendation             districts. The Woodside Municipal Code permits up to two ALQs as accessory uses to a
                                       primary use (i.e. main residence) without approval of any discretionary permits (discretionary
                                       permits may be required for the construction of additions or structures to accommodate an
                                       ALQ, but not for the use itself ). The Town also has a voluntary survey for applicants of new
                                       units to track their use and affordability. The Town is also working to streamline their review,
                                       and will be considering a process that includes only one review meeting before the ASRB.
                                       Additional meetings may be required before the Planning Commission if other entitlements
                                       are required. In the 2011 fee schedule update, the Town Council removed the fee for rental
                                       certificates as a first step toward easing the requirements for rental units.
      2. Alternative Construction
            Program Description and    Promote affordable alternatives to conventional construction by continuing to allow mobile
            Objective                  homes and exploring procedures for the consideration of alternative methods such as green
                                       building, straw bale construction, etc.
            Timeframe and Achievements On January 10, 2012, the Town adopted the Sustainability Element as part of the 2012 General
                                       Plan. On July 10, 2012, the Town adopted the Residential Design Guidelines. These documents
                                       formalize the Town’s commitment to increasing the prevalence of environmentally conscious
                                       design features in construction projects.
            Program Evaluation and     The Town continues to allow mobile homes, factory built and modular housing units,
            Recommendation             consistent with State law. The California Building Code provides an option for alternative
                                       construction, whereby an applicant submits an alternate design to the Building Official,
                                       the alternate design standards and testing of the proposed product, and the rationale for
                                       the request. The Town has approved alternate retention and reuse materials in the past,
                                       including rammed earth landscape walls, green roofs, rainwater retention and reuse systems,
                                       fuel cells, ground source heat recovery systems and Styrofoam core truss wall systems. The
                                       Town encourages green building measures in all of its projects, in compliance with applicable
                                       building codes which include sustainable features such as solar panels, green roofs, rainwater
                                       retention, fuel cells, radiant heating and other progressive design techniques.
      3. Accessibility
            Program Description and    Increase access to affordable housing by continuing to request the extension of public transit
            Objective                  routes along major traffic corridors.
            Timeframe and Achievements Ongoing. The Town continues to coordinate with SamTrans to expand bus service to provide
                                       better connections with surrounding jurisdictions.
            Program Evaluation and     SamTrans’ Line 274 provides weekday and Saturday service between Cañada College and the
            Recommendation             Redwood City CalTrain station. Line 85 provides weekday service between Woodside, Portola
                                       Valley and Menlo Park. As part of the 2012 General Plan, the Town included a transit connectivity
                                       goal in the Circulation Element. Policy CL6.1 reads: “Support the expansion, development,
                                       and improvement of the public transit systems serving Woodside and the Midpeninsula
                                       which are effective, convenient, quiet, and economically feasible.” Staff continues to engage
                                       with SamTrans regarding potential expansion of public transit in Woodside.

A. Affordable Housing Opportunities (continued)
    4. Multi-family Opportunities
         Program Description and          Work with Cañada College to draft and adopt guidelines that would allow multi-family
         Objective                        housing (either through overlay zoning or with a use permit) on existing land owned and
                                          operated by San Mateo County Community College District (Cañada College) in Woodside
                                          during the planning period. Allow waiver of certain standards that would limit development
                                          such as reduced parking, increased height allowances, and increased density, and consider a
                                          density bonus ordinance.
         Timeframe and Achievements The Town is currently working with Cañada College to develop an overlay district that would
                                          allow for the development of multi-family housing.
         Program Evaluation and
                                                                                                                                               INTRODUCTION
         Recommendation
                                          The overlay district is currently being developed.
    5. Easing restrictions on the construction of rental units and incentives to construct affordable deed restricted
    	 Accessory Living Quarters
         Program Description and          Work with the Town Council and other Council designated commission and/or committee to
         Objective                        develop municipal code amendments to ease restrictions on the construction of rental units
                                          and provide incentives to construct deed restricted affordable units.
         Timeframe and Achievements Ongoing Consideration
         Program Evaluation and           Town residents have been active in developing accessory dwelling quarters. If the pace of
         Recommendation                   development slows, the Town will consider the need for additional incentives to increase
                                          development of deed restricted and other affordable units.
B. Conservation, Rehabilitation, and New Construction
                                                                                                                                               HOUSING
    6. Conservation
         Program Description and          Conserve the existing housing stock by continuing to apply the California Building Code
         Objective                        (California Code of Regulations (Title 24)) and allowing alternative standards for historic
                                          structures; improving the character of substandard structures; continuing to address code
                                          violations; and supporting the provision of sewage systems to areas with waste disposal
                                          problems.
         Timeframe and Achievements The Town adopted an Historic Preservation Element on March 10, 2009. This element was
                                          updated and amended as part of the 2012 General Plan, adopted on January 10, 2012. The
                                          Town adopted Residential Design Guidelines on July 10, 2012 that encourage preservation
                                          or adaptive reuse of existing or historic structures over demolition.The Town’s Community
                                          Preservation Officer completed Code Enforcement Officer Training in April 2009, meeting the
                                                                                                                                               APPENDICES
                                          goal for that adopted program. The Town works to conserve the existing housing stock on
                                          an ongoing basis.
         Program Evaluation and           The Town applies the most recent version of the California Building Code (Title 24) to
         Recommendation                   all development in Town. The Town recommends preservation of existing structures
                                          when feasible and when structures meet historic thresholds. The Woodside Municipal
                                          Code includes allowances for adaptive reuse and flexible siting of historic structures on
                                          properties within the Town. The Town has also drafted an Historic Preservation Ordinance
                                          that is currently being reviewed by the Town Council. As part of this Ordinance, the Town is
                                          exploring incentives for historic preservation. The Town encourages green building practices
                                          which include preservation of existing structures, rather than demolition, to maintain the
                                          Town’s housing stock.
                                                                                                                                               AREA PLANS

      7. Rehabilitation
            Program Description and    Rehabilitate the existing housing stock by continuing to provide setback exceptions to
            Objective                  support remodeling or small additions rather than demolition. Inform low and moderate
                                       income residents about the County’s Rehabilitation Loan Program.
            Timeframe and Achievements Ongoing
            Program Evaluation and     The Town processes building permits for additions and remodels on an ongoing basis. The
            Recommendation             Town maintains information on the County’s Rehabilitation Loan Program at Town Hall and
                                       on the Town website.
      8. New Construction
            Program Description and    Develop new housing stock that conforms with building codes and encourage the retention
            Objective                  of smaller homes where possible.
            Timeframe and Achievements Ongoing
            Program Evaluation and     All new construction requires a building permit demonstrating compliance with the
            Recommendation             California Building Code (California Code of Regulations (Title 24)). The Municipal Code limits
                                       the size of residential structures in all zoning districts, and encourages renovation rather than
                                       demolition of structures. This encourages retention of smaller structures. Because much of
                                       the Town has the potential to be affected by wildfire, the Town adopted a new fire safety
                                       ordinance that augments building requirements for new construction.
      9. Energy Efficiency
            Program Description and    Promote energy efficient housing by continuing to require compliance with Title 24; educating
            Objective                  homeowners and disseminating energy conservation from PG&E and other agencies;
                                       encouraging energy saving siting, features and materials in retrofits and new construction;
                                       implementing the Sustainability Element, that is now part of the Town’s General Plan;
                                       encouraging staff to attend energy efficiency trainings; pooling resources with neighboring
                                       jurisdictions; and exploring the adoption of green building regulations and incentives.
            Timeframe and Achievements The Town adopts the most recent version of the California Building Code (California Code of
                                       Regulations (Title 24)). The Town adopted a Sustainability Element as part of its 2012 General

Housing Element has also been refined to reflect changes
in State law. The Town will continue to monitor the General
Plan and Housing Element to ensure their consistency on
an ongoing and annual basis.
No specific construction project within Woodside’s current
jurisdiction is proposed as part of the Housing Element
Update. The allowable total square footage and the number
of allowable residential units would not change under
any of the proposed programs for the updated element.
Privately owned land in Woodside is predominantly built-

annexation. The core goals and policies have not changed
from the 2007-2014 Housing Element that was certified
by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD).

                        Introduction
                        The Land Use and Community Design Element is a guide to the uses of land in Woodside, the
                        character of the built environment, and the relationship of both to the natural environment.
                        This Element is intended to define the goals, policies, and strategies that will allow Woodside to
                        maintain its rural character, yet allow for reasonable development of private property.
                        The pattern of land uses described in this Element is driven by:
                        •  the natural setting of Woodside;
                        •  the established pattern of development;
                        •  the relationship of Woodside to adjacent communities and employment centers;
                        •  population growth and change; and,
                        •  the present and future means of travel within the Town and between the Town and the outside
                            area.
                        Land use policies are designed to prevent overuse of land and control intensity of use. The
                        overuse or overcrowding of individual sites with primary residential uses or accessory uses creates
                        environmental impacts such as excessive drainage, soil erosion, loss of vegetation and other
                        resources, and destroys the open, natural characteristics of the Town.
                        Historically, land use intensity in Woodside has been defined by: population density, building
                        coverage, extent of impervious surfaces, public service requirements, traffic volumes, topography,
                        natural hazards, fire safety, and natural resources. Although this Element describes and maps ten
                        Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) it should be noted that as an urban/wildland interface
                        community, virtually all areas of Town are subject to issues of environmental sensitivity.
                        The Town of Woodside has the reputation of being one of the most visually pleasing communities
                        in the State. The principal reasons are: the wooded hillsides; narrow country roads; natural stream
                        corridors; fields of wild grasses and wildflowers; scenic vistas; great groves of oak, redwood, and
                        buckeye trees; large lots containing paddocks, riding rings, and stables; open fields; and buildings
                        which are subordinate in appearance to the land.
                        The Flood Zones Map for the Town (Map NH3), as well as other hazard maps are located in the
                        Natural Hazards and Safety Element.
                        Policies in this Element have been formulated to enhance the rural and natural qualities of this
                        unique community.

Changes Since 1988
The following land use and community design changes have occurred since 1988:
Commercial
Commercial land is very limited in Woodside. Commercial properties are located in two small
centers: the Town Center on Highway 84 (Woodside Road); and the Skylonda Center on Highway 35
(Skyline Boulevard). No expansion of the commercial areas has occurred since 1988, although some
significant changes occurred in the Town Center during this period, including: the development of
the Town government center and the Woodside Road/Whiskey Hill parking areas. Currently, peak
                                                                                                                                     INTRODUCTION
activity in these areas occurs weekdays at mid-day and on weekends. The popularity of the Town’s
restaurants, bars, and market contributes to traffic, circulation, and parking challenges at these
times. During this General Plan update, residents expressed a strong, continued desire to address
circulation issues and to encourage commercial services and facilities that meet their day-to-day
needs. Current market conditions, however, have proved challenging as rent of commercial space
for office use can be more lucrative and stable than rent for retail, personal service, and restaurant
uses. Residents see an update to the Town Center Plan as a top planning priority.
Institutional
                                                                                                                                    LAND USE AND
A number of changes have occurred to institutional properties in the last two decades.
Town Hall and public parking was constructed near the southeast corner of Woodside and Whiskey
                                                                                                                                  COMMUNITY DESIGN
Hill Roads, and the Town acquired and constructed Barkley Fields and Park on Farm Hill Boulevard.
A portion of Cañada College was deannexed to the City of Redwood City to allow for the
construction of 60 units of affordable faculty and staff housing, of which the Town received a credit
of 24 units toward its State affordable housing requirement.
A new parking program was initiated on Woodside Road in the Town Center and Woodside
Elementary School vicinity. Woodside Elementary School contributes traffic, circulation, and
parking challenges during its peak periods: student drop off and pick up times.
                                                                                                                                     APPENDICES
Open Space
Since 1988, two open space areas were combined with adjacent open spaces, and one open
space areas was lost.
Open Space Area 10, Dennis Martin Creek, was purchased by Midpeninsula Regional Open Space
District and incorporated into Open Space Area 13, Thornewood. Open Space Area 21, Sandstone
Caves, was also purchased by Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District and incorporated into
Open Space Area 15, El Corte de Madera Creek Open Space Preserve. Reference the Open Space

                                        Residential
                                        Residential properties in Woodside are single-family residential properties. No lands
                                        are designated for multi-family use. Accessory dwelling units are allowed on single-
                                        family residential properties and the Housing Element proposes a possible overlay
                                        zone for multi-family staff and faculty housing at Cañada College. Improvements to
                                        residential properties continued to be strong, including: remodeling, the construction
                                        of additional accessory structures, demolition and replacement of existing residences,
                                        and construction of new residences on the limited inventory of vacant lots.
                                        Timber Production
                                        State law requires that a land use category be designated that provides for timber
                                        production parcels or real property that have been zoned for timberland production.
                                        No lands within the Town are designated for timber production.
                                        Military
                                        State law requires that the General Plan Land Use Element consider the impact of
                                        new growth on military readiness activities carried out on military bases, installations,
                                        and operating and training areas. No military installation or activities are located or
                                        occur within the Town.
                                        Public Utilities
                                        Reference the Public Utilities Element for information regarding solid and liquid
                                        waste disposal facilities, and other public and private utility infrastructure.
                                        Town-wide Regulatory Changes
                                        Challenges with the Municipal Code which are currently being debated and addressed
                                        include: paved coverage limitations and the Municipal Code’s consideration of
                                        features (e.g., tennis courts, swimming pools, patios, walkways) rather than type of
                                        paving material; the R-1 development standards, nonconforming regulations, and
                                        nonconforming parcels and structures; the need for a voluntary lot merger process;
                                        the scope of basement proposals; and the location and required setbacks for the
                                        newly required water line backflow preventers.
                                        One of the most significant regulatory changes in Woodside since 1988 has been
                                        the adoption of new fire regulations. In 2008, the Woodside Town Council adopted
                                        an ordinance designating the western foothills and Emerald Hills as “Very High Fire
                                        Hazard Severity Zones” (VHFHSZ). In 2009, the Woodside Town Council adopted an
                                        ordinance designating new regulations incorporating fire resistive materials and
                                        construction methods. In summary, these fire prevention regulations required a
                                        higher level of fire resistance materials and construction methods throughout Town,
                                        and imposed additional site improvement and defensible space requirements for
                                        properties located in the VHFHSZ. While these new regulations respond to the health

and safety issues associated with living in an urban/wildland interface community,
they also created the need to revisit the building material and landscape references
in the Town’s Residential Design Guidelines.
Residential Design Guidelines
The Town developed and adopted Residential Design Guidelines in 2000. In 2011,
in response to new green building requirements, new fire regulations, and an on-
going community desire to preserve the rural character of Woodside, the Town
Council appointed a subcommittee comprised of Town Council members, Planning
Commissioners, Architectural and Site Review Board (ASRB) members, and staff to
                                                                                                                                   INTRODUCTION
revise and update these Guidelines. The General Plan Task Force also expressed an
interest in adopting the concepts set forth in the draft Fence Guidelines. These draft
Guidelines were developed in 2007 by a subcommittee comprised of members
from ASRB; and the Open Space, Conservation, and Environmental Health and Trails
Committees.
The Residential Design Guidelines should be consistent with the goals, policies,
and strategies of the General Plan; and the regulations contained in the Woodside
Municipal Code. Should any conflict arise between the Design Guidelines and those
                                                                                                                                  LAND USE AND

                          General Plan Land Use Designations
                          In Woodside, there are seven General Plan land use designations. Each parcel of land in Town
                          receives a General Plan land use designation (See Map LU1, General Plan Land Use Designations).
                          Each parcel of land also receives a zoning designation. The purpose of each, and their relationship
                          to each other, is described in the Relationship Between the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
                          section. The primary land use intended for each General Plan designation is described below.
                          Additional allowable uses are set forth in the Woodside Municipal Code according to a property’s
                          zoning designation.

                          The Commercial (“C”) land use designation allows for businesses that primarily serve the day-to-
                          day needs of the local community. Secondarily, low-intensity, small scale office use is acceptable.
                          IN: Institutional, Public and Quasi-Public
                          The Institutional (“IN”) land use designation provides for educational, governmental, and
                          institutional uses, such as schools, libraries, places of worship, meeting halls, and public parks.
                          OS: Open Space
                          The Open Space (“OS”) land use designation preserves open space for natural resources, allows
                          opportunities for outdoor recreation, and safeguards the public health and safety.
                          OS-ESA: Open Space / Environmentally Sensitive Area
                          The Open Space land use designation with an environmentally sensitive overlay (“OS/ESA”)
                          preserves natural resources and habitat, with a higher degree of sensitivity than the “OS” areas.
                          Low-impact and low-intensity recreational uses, such as hiking, are allowed in OS-ESA.
                          R: Residential
                          The Residential (“R”) land use designation allows for a variety of residential densities. Residential
                          development can range from large rural estates with multiple accessory buildings, such as
                          Mountain Home Road; to smaller, single-family homes within compact neighborhoods, such as
                          The Woodside Glens.
                          R-ESA: Residential / Environmentally Sensitive Area
                          The Residential land use designation with an environmentally sensitive overlay (“R-ESA”)
                          designation is assigned to parcels requiring a greater degree of environmental protection due
                          to characteristics such as steep hillsides, geological hazards, difficult road access, or soil or water
                          problems.
                          U: Utility
                          The “U” designation is for general utility uses such as public works, corporation yards, and
                          maintenance buildings.

                                              “C” Commercial Land Uses
                                              There are two Commercial (“C”) areas in Town: the Town Center on Woodside Road,
                                              and the Skylonda Center at the intersection of State Highways 35 and 84.
                                              Town Center Area
                                              The Town Center Area is located on both sides of Woodside Road between Whiskey
                                              Hill Road and just west of Cañada Road (Map TC1). Uses in this Area include stores,
                                              offices, specialty shops, and consumer service establishments needed to meet the
                                              day-to-day needs of local residents. Historically, stores and services have included
                                              convenience shopping needs such as groceries, drugs, and hardware; and services,
                                              such as banking and dry cleaning. The purchase of larger items, such as furniture,
                                              appliances and automobiles occurs in the larger, more urban adjacent communities.
                                              The provision of convenience shopping services should be emphasized in future
                                              planning, so that these uses stay in balance with office and administrative uses and
Town Center commercial area.                  reduce vehicular trips to outside the community. In addition to retail and service

                                              combination of private initiative and public action.

                                             Town Government Offices and Public Parking
                                             In 1988, the Town government offices were located in rented space at the Woodside
                                             Elementary School. In 1988-89, the Town initiated the development of a Town Hall
                                             complex and public parking for the commercial area. It acquired land behind the
                                             Pioneer Hotel building and the strip of commercial properties along Woodside Road,
                                             including the Mathisen farmhouse property. The Town also established the Woodside
                                             Road/Whiskey Hill Road Parking Assessment District at this time and, through two
                                             construction phases, built over 140 public parking spaces to support the Town Hall

                                             parking construction were funded by a combination of Special Assessment District
                                             bonds, paid for through assessments on the involved commercial property owners,
                                             and Town funds, totaling just over $3.2 million.
                                             The architect for the new Town Hall complex was Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis, of
                                             San Francisco. Town Hall was formally dedicated on December 8, 1990. Construction
                                             cost was about $2.3 million, financed by the issuance of 25-year Certificates of
                                             Participation, a kind of lease-financing mechanism. These were retired in 2006, nine
                                             years early.
                                             Independence Hall, built in 1884 and acquired by the Town in 1978, was relocated
                                             from its original location two miles west of where it stands today. It was completely
                                             renovated in 1991 as the last element of the Woodside Town Hall complex project.

“R” Residential Land Uses
The Residential (“R”) land use designation is intended to allow for a variety of residential
parcel sizes that are compatible with the historic development pattern of Woodside,
and at the same time safeguard Woodside’s natural environment. Residential density
in Woodside ranges from large, rural lots to denser, smaller lots.
The number of structures and intensity of uses allowed in the Residential land
use designation depends on a property’s size, environmental constraints, and                      Home in a single-family, residential
compatibility with the surrounding area. On lots with adequate space and limited                  neighborhood.

pools, pool houses, accessory dwelling units, other accessory structures, commercial
vineyards, and stables. In contrast, development in areas that have numerous
environmental constraints and/or smaller lots should have fewer structures and less
intensive use.
“R-ESA” Residential Land Uses, Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Lands designated as Residential with the “ESA” overlay (“R-ESA”) are considered more
environmentally sensitive than the area designated only Residential (“R”). These lands
are environmentally constrained by steep slopes, geological hazards, difficult road

minimum lot sizes and applies more restrictive site development standards.

                                                  The purpose of the “environmentally sensitive area” (ESA) designation is to identify
                                                  those areas of the Town which contain significant environmental constraints. This
                                                  information will be used when considering the appropriateness of development
                                                  proposals. ESA areas are shown on Map LU1, General Plan Land Use Designations.
Steep slopes are an example of                    Environmental constraints dictate the number of building sites or intensity of

                                                  The presence of one or more of these constraints, therefore, will reduce the allowable
                                                  density in any zoning district.
                                                  Environmentally sensitive areas may contain the following constraints: steep slopes,
                                                  geological hazards (Maps NH1 and NH2), lack of water supply, fire hazards (Map NH4),
                                                  poor road access, excessive noise exposure (Map N1), flooding (Map NH3), proximity
                                                  to stream corridors (Map CV1), significant biological resources (Map CV2), or major
                                                  scenic corridors and viewsheds (Map CL2).
                                                  The majority of these areas occur in the steeper Western Hills of the Santa Cruz
                                                  Mountains (all lands west of Kings Mountain Road, Woodside Road, and Portola Road),
                                                  along the main trace of the San Andreas Fault, and adjacent to the Interstate 280 (I-

                                                  and accessory uses. There are two other significant environmentally sensitive areas
                                                  which are largely undeveloped: Summit Springs (Teague Hill), located in the Western

                                                  are described below. While these areas have specific characteristics of environmental
                                                  sensitivity, they are not the only areas in Town which are environmentally sensitive

                                                  flows through the area. These lands are heavily wooded. Problems with access exist
                                                  due to the narrow widths of pavement and right-of-way for Greer Road, and other
                                                  physical constraints making road widening extremely difficult. Any general widening
                                                  of the roadway would have adverse environmental impacts. In addition, Greer Road
                                                  is a “dead end” road with no adequate turnaround. Emergency vehicle access and
                                                  operating problems are particularly severe.

                                                In addition to access problems, terrain and geologic hazards impose severe limitations
                                                on development. Although some improvements were made in 1975, water supply is
                                                deficient for fire protection. Potentially active traces of the San Andreas fault zone are
                                                mapped through the area, but fault investigations indicated that these traces do not
                                                exist in at least the southeast portion of this area.

                                                This area includes lands dependent upon Josselyn Lane for access. Access is poor.
                                                Narrow road width, poor alignment, and short curves impairing sight distance create
                                                hazards for all traffic, particularly for emergency vehicles. Water supply is substandard
                                                for both fire and domestic purposes through most of this area. Parts of this area
                                                have steep slopes with a high potential for landsliding, and an active trace of the
                                                San Andreas fault zone extends through this area. Most of the existing parcels are
                                                developed with residences.

                                                This area divides into two parts: a lower part consisting of the Woodside Oaks and
                                                Oak Hill Acres subdivisions, with residences on most of the lots; and an upper part,
                                                Summit Springs, which is the 620 acre Teague Hill Open Space Preserve.
                                                The existing subdivisions are characterized by lots that are too small for the terrain
                                                conditions, slope instability problems, and road and drainage problems due to the

                                                grades.
                                                The 620 acre Teague Hill Open Space Preserve presents particularly difficult
                                                development problems because of steep terrain, slope stability problems, and

5. San Andreas Fault Zone (South of Kings Mountain Road)
This area is bounded on the southwest by Tripp and Woodside Roads and on the
northeast by the active trace of the San Andreas fault zone. It includes the active
(1906) trace and mapped potentially active traces of the San Andreas fault. Portions
of this area are subject to flooding and some parts have a high water table and a
potential for liquefaction. Several creeks flow through this area. (Also see the Natural
Hazards and Safety Element.)                                                                   5. South of Kings Mountain Road

potential slope instability, and identified landslides. The area is divided into two
distinct parts by an inactive (bedrock) fault that separates serpentine and sandstone
bedrock. It is an excellent example of differences in landscape character caused by
underlying rock formations.
The less steep portion is a serpentine landscape area which supports an abundance
of wildflowers and other plants which have adapted to the serpentine land. Prior to
the construction of Interstate 280 (I-280), it was part of a large serpentine landscape
area which included Open Space Lands Area No. 6 marked for Preservation of Natural
                                                                                                                                          LAND USE AND

                                                                                                                                           APPENDICES
This area comprises lands dependent on Moore Road for access. It is constrained
primarily because of noise exposure from I-280; and the narrowness of Moore Road,
a private road which limits access for emergency equipment. A substantial part of
the area is in the scenic corridor of I-280, which is designated as a Scenic Highway by
the State. The traffic access and safety problems may not be severe for the existing
developed properties, but it imposes restraints on subdivision and development of
acreage properties which otherwise could be subdivided.

                                                 This area includes the lands north of State Highway 84, south of Wunderlich Park and
                                                 east of Skyline Boulevard. The primary constraints to development in this area are
                                                 steep slopes, potential landsliding, and poor surface and groundwater conditions.
                                                 The general topography is steep and the hillsides are wooded. Existing landslides
                                                 may reactivate under heavy precipitation or seismic shaking.

                                                 This six parcel area is approximately 130-acres and consists mostly of vacant land with
                                                 one single-family home. The area is adjacent (southwest) to I-280, and approximately
                                                 midway between Sand Hill Road and Woodside Road.
                                                 This area is characterized by steep slopes, deeply incised creek corridors and swampy
                                                 areas, potential external and internal access problems (such as difficulty in crossing
                                                 creeks and surmounting steep areas), potential slope instability, a high degree of

Adjacent Lands
Adjacent lands, those lands beyond Town limits but within Woodside’s Planning
Area (Map TF2), comprise private and public lands which are both developed and
undeveloped. They provide a buffer or transition zone between Woodside and the
surrounding areas; they contain important natural and aesthetic resources that
contribute to Woodside’s quality of life; or they have environmental constraints such
as steep or unstable slopes which, if developed improperly, could adversely affect the
area. Adjacent lands comprise half of the land area of the Woodside Planning Area,            Searsville Lake, located adjacent to
which is roughly 23 square miles.                                                             Woodside.

For developed lands, any changes or intensification of land uses should be sensitive to
the environmental conditions of the site and the surrounding area. For undeveloped
lands, open space, agricultural, and equivalent land uses are most appropriate.
Parklands should be maintained as open space as much as possible, and should
provide for low-intensity recreational use. Intensity of recreational development,
suitability of access, and sensitivity of the terrain should be considered in park
planning. Jurisdictions in the subregion should participate in cooperative planning
efforts to assure that all affected parties have early input on proposed development
                                                                                                                                            LAND USE AND

Woodside as “Agricultural/Academic Preserve.”
Stanford lands have important aesthetic and natural resource value to Woodside
and the surrounding area. Lands west of I-280 along Sand Hill Road serve as a visual
gateway to the rural setting of Woodside and the hills beyond. Preservation of these
resources is encouraged. Town comments on changes proposed by Stanford should
take preservation of these resources into account. Recreational, agricultural, or
equivalent uses are encouraged for these areas.

Relationship Between the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance
The General Plan designates land uses in general, long-term categories. In addition, the zoning code (Chapter 153 of the
Woodside Municipal Code) designates specific allowable uses of land. The zoning code is the primary means of implementing
a General Plan, and prescribes the specific allowed uses and development standards for each zoning designation. State law
requires that the General Plan and zoning ordinance be consistent. Table LU1 below lists existing General Plan and zoning
designation pairings in Town.

While the Town officially recognizes the above listed resources, other resources in Town may qualify for either national, State,
or local listing. The fact that a resource is not listed in, or determined to be eligible for listing in, the California Register of
Historical Resources, not included in a local register of historical resources, or not deemed significant pursuant to definitions
contained within the Public Resource Code does not preclude the Town from determining whether the resource may be a
historical resource. Assessment of historic significance, and potential impacts, are made on a case-by-case basis in the Town.

Additionally, recreational bicycle traffic impacts virtually every road and neighborhood throughout the year. This adds to the
competition for roadway use that already exists, exacerbating the problem.
SPECIAL EVENTS
Running, equestrian, and bicycle events are held on Town roads. Plans and regulations for these events need to consider the
impacts of road closure and access on residences and businesses in the Town. The Town has regulations within the Municipal
Code governing Special Events which involve fifty or more participants on the Town’s roads. Applications for Special Events are
reviewed with a view to ensuring the safety of the participants and other roadway users. Conditions of Approval can be added
to enhance the safety aspects of an event and to encourage the use of major roads that can better handle the added roadway
traffic that such events engender.
TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS
Vehicle Traffic Counts
Vehicle traffic counts were completed for ten road segments for one week in August 2010 and one week in September 2010
(see Table CL1). The counts showed that weekday traffic generally is higher than weekend traffic, even though Woodside roads
get a lot of recreational use. The September counts were generally a little lower than the summer counts.

Bicycle Traffic Counts
Bicycle traffic counts were taken at eight intersections on a Saturday in August
2010 and five intersections on a Wednesday in September 2010 (see Table CL3).
The August counts were for a longer time period (7:00 AM to 6:00 PM) compared
to the September counts (7:30 AM to 4:30 PM). The summer weekend counts were
dramatically higher than the September weekday counts. Bicycle volume was
particularly high on Cañada Road and Portola Road on Saturday. These are the first
bicycle counts taken in Woodside, so no comparisons can be made to earlier data.
The bicycle turning movements are shown on Figure CL1.

Traffic Volume and Road Capacity in Woodside
An analysis of the present traffic volume on roads in the Woodside Planning Area indicates that most roads are being used far
below their traffic capacity. The busiest road segments are found on Woodside Road immediately east and west of I-280. While
busy, these segments operate well within their capacities. Traffic also is busy around the commercial area of Woodside adjacent
to the Woodside/Cañada/Mountain Home intersection. This area has a concentration of street traffic, parking, and pedestrian
activity. Nevertheless, traffic operations are within acceptable standards. Since land uses in Woodside are generally built-out,
large future increases in traffic volume are not expected. The existing road system is adequate to accommodate future traffic.
No substantial road widening and no significant new road construction will be needed.

Strategies:
a. Encourage trip reduction
Encourage                                       residents     to     voluntarily reduce  their
transportation carbon footprint by:
1.	 Employing trip reduction strategies, such as combining
                                   trips and compressing the work week;
2.	 Utilizing local delivery services, such as those from drug
                                   stores, dry cleaners, and fresh produce providers;
3.	 Utilizing alternative transportation strategies, such as

Strategies:
a. Neighborhood tranquility
Promote measures to limit or mitigate the impacts
of recreational traffic (motorists, motorcyclists, and
bicycles) on neighborhoods.
b. Coordination with event sponsors
The Town should encourage event sponsors to use
major roads, such as Cañada, Sand Hill, and Whiskey Hill

                                     ized and non-motorized) and noise.
2.	 Examine impacts (travel speed, adherence to traffic
                                     law, and parking) from pelotons, bike clubs, motor-
                                     cycles, and other recreational traffic, and consider

Expansive soils and bedrock, if not properly identified,
characterized, and appropriately mitigated, can cause
significant damage to foundations, other structural
elements, and to site pavement. The California Building
Code (CBC) requires preparation of a geotechnical
investigation report, including laboratory soil test data,
in order to determine whether expansive soils and
expansive bedrock are present at a particular site. In the
event that expansive soils and/or expansive bedrock are
present, then the geotechnical consultant is required to

The   CBC     establishes   minimum      standards     for

Summary of Potential Hazards
The Woodside Planning Area is exposed to significant geologic and fire hazards.
Geologic Hazards
The Geologic Hazard Zones Map, Map NH1, divides the Town into four general zones that have associated potential geologic
hazards. Table NH1, Geologic Hazard Zones, lists and defines the potential hazards in each of the zones. Within each Geologic
Hazard Zone, varying degrees of hazard exist. Specific fault (Map NH2), flood (Map NH3), and fire (Map NH4) zone maps are
also included in this Element.

Erosion and Sedimentation
Erosion and sedimentation are on-going natural processes and the rate of erosion at any particular location is related to the
type of soil material, slope, and character of ground cover. Where natural conditions are disturbed, erosion can be greatly
accelerated and cause damage both to the site on which it occurs and in downslope areas where water-borne sediments are
deposited. The steep western hills present the highest erosion potential. Town regulations require the retention of vegetation
and limits on grading to minimize erosion and sedimentation.
Expansive Soils and Bedrock
Some soils and bedrock expand when they get wet and shrink when they dry, which can be damaging to structures. The
severity of this condition varies with location. Soil and bedrock within the Whiskey Hill Formation and the Santa Clara Formation,
as well as Serpentine areas, are known to be potentially expansive. For this reason, site specific soils investigations are required
for most parcels in Woodside.

Seiches
A seiche is an earthquake-induced wave (sloshing) in an
enclosed body of water like a lake or reservoir. A seiche
can overflow or even erode an embankment, potentially
releasing significant volumes of water that could flood
and damage developed areas downstream. Schilling Lake
is the only significant body of water in Woodside and a
potentially damaging seiche could impact developed
areas downstream along Dennis Martin Creek. Bear
Gulch Reservoir and Searsville Lake are located outside of
Woodside, and potentially damaging seiches from these
sources would impact downstream undeveloped and
developed areas of Stanford University, Menlo Park, and
Atherton.

planning efforts. For example, a residence built at the
minimum required setback from a riparian area could
result in the removal of riparian vegetation to create a
defensible space zone around the residence. The optimal
approach to achieving a greater balance between such
conflicting goals is to specifically identify all areas to be
preserved (including the appropriate buffer zone), and
restrict development of these areas. This approach would,
however, require the collection of a wide range of data
to identify and select the preserve areas. An alternative
to completion of such an in-depth study is preparation
of Urban/Wildland Interface Design Guidelines. Such
guidelines could inform the design process as individual
development projects are reviewed.
Urban/Wildland Interface Design Guidelines
In developing guidelines for urban/wildland interfaces,
the specific habitats’ covered wildlife species of interest
should be identified to ensure that these species have
sufficient habitat to live and forage, free from the need to
disperse from preserve areas into surrounding developed
areas where they can fall prey to domestic animals;
human-habituated wildlife species such as raccoons and
opossums that thrive in urban and residential areas; and
motor vehicles.
Beyond minimizing such direct and immediate impacts,
the design of the urban/wildland interface should consider
indirect and long-term effects, such as runoff from
developed areas that can transport harmful substances
(such as pesticides, automotive fluids, sediment) into

emergency water supplies should be established and
maintained in areas served by water lines which cross
active fault traces.

                                             streams and streamsides comprise an interconnecting riparian habitat and provide
                                             corridors for the movement of wildlife. They also provide visual links because of the
                                             riparian growth along most of the streams. Some streamsides provide space for
                                             trails and paths. The streams in the Planning Area are quite varied in character. Some

and required separation between structures also create open spaces.
Most of the land with few constraints to development are now in residential use.
Much of the remaining undeveloped land has significant constraints to development.

Commercial Areas Open Spaces
Open spaces in commercial areas buffer residential areas from commercial uses, and
reflect Woodside’s rural character.
Public/Quasi-Public Open Spaces
In addition to the open space associated with residential and commercial uses,

Easements (Open Space, Conservation, and Scenic)
Cities and counties may accept or purchase easements from private landowners for open space and resource conservation
purposes. Open space and conservation easements are, in effect, transfers of development rights. The deed transferring an
easement to a local government must restrict the transferred property’s use to open space or resource conservation activities.
Cities and counties may acquire open space easements pursuant to the Open Space Easement Act of 1974 (California
Government Code section 51070 et seq.). Land must remain within an easement in perpetuity or, alternatively, for at least ten
years. An easement’s term is automatically extended each year by an additional twelve months. Under certain circumstances,
open space easements may be abandoned. The Williamson Act has traditionally been used for agricultural properties. The
Town has held informational seminars regarding the property tax benefits of open space easements.
A city or county must have an adopted Open Space Plan Element as a prerequisite to acquiring an open space easement.
Furthermore, the preserving of easement land in open space must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s General Plan.
The Conservation Easement Act of 1979 (California Civil Code sections 815-816) enables a city, county, district, or nonprofit
organization to acquire perpetual easements for the conservation of agricultural land and open space, or for historic
preservation. Unlike open space easements, there is no procedure for non-renewal of conservation easements and there is no
expiration date.
In establishing an easement, a landowner and local agency agree upon the permitted land uses within the conservation area.
The easement is binding upon successive owners of the land.
Recent State legislation has expanded opportunities for cities and counties to protect viable agricultural lands. The Department
of Conservation’s Agricultural Land Stewardship Program (ALSP) was enacted in 1995 as SB 275. The Program provides cities,
counties, and non-profit land trusts with funding for the purchase of conservation easements from agricultural landowners.
The Program complements the Williamson Act by providing permanent protection of agricultural land, targeting protection of
most threatened agricultural land, placing ownership of development rights with a third party, usually a local land trust, and
providing one-time payments allowing farmers to re-invest in their agricultural operations to improve profitability. Sources
of revenue for funding include gifts, donations, legislative appropriations, general obligation bonds, federal grants or loans,
and other sources. (See Land Use and Community Design, Natural Hazards and Safety, and Conservation Elements for related
policies and standards).
Incentives
Property tax relief may be available for preserving open space. Property owners may apply to the San Mateo County Tax
Assessor for reclassification of land to lesser intensive land use type, thereby reducing the property taxes.
Other programs include the Williamson Act, a program which contractually restricts land to agricultural or open space use in
exchange for reduced property taxation. In 2010, there were two parcels in the Town of Woodside held under the Williamson
Act (for the purpose of open space). There are over 500 parcels held under the Williamson Act in the unincorporated area of
San Mateo County.
Lands subject to open space or conservation easements are “enforceably restricted.” In other words, their value for property
tax purposes is established on the basis of the easement restrictions rather than potential development uses. For properties
which would otherwise have been subject to rising property taxes, this is a form of tax relief. It provides landowners with an
incentive to grant easements.

Open Space Inventory
Table OS2 and Figure OS2 describe the open space areas located within, and immediately adjacent to, the Town’s Planning
Area. The numbering of these areas remains consistent with the 1988 General Plan, with the following changes (as further
described below): Areas 10 and 21 were modified, Area 31 was lost to private development, and Area 34 was added to
the inventory. These open spaces are under the jurisdiction of the Town of Woodside, the Town of Atherton, San Mateo
County, and the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District.

                                    Table OS3: Open Space Area Categories, is intended to illustrate the uses of land
                                    designated as Open Space in the General Plan. These categories act as a guide to
                                    the placement of open space areas into their proper zoning districts, but are not
                                    equivalent to zoning districts.
                                    In Table OS3, the distinction between medium and low intensity recreational use is
                                    that medium intensity recreational uses have a sustained medium level of activity,
                                    including traffic generation, that is important to the normal functioning of the given
                                    land use whereas low intensity recreational uses generally have low weekly level
                                    of activity associated with the normal functioning of the land use. Low intensity
                                    recreational uses may have medium levels of activity for special events that may
                                    occur no more than six times per year, providing those events are associated with
                                    the normal function of the land use.

                                            categories of open space use defined in Open Space Purposes. Many of these areas

                                            Area 1: The Bear Gulch Watershed Area
                                            The primary use of this area is watershed protection for health and safety. It is the
                                            main local source of water for the California Water Service Company, which supplies
Area 1: Bear Gulch Watershed.
                                            water to most of the Woodside and Portola Valley planning areas and communities to
                                            the east and south. Other characteristics support preservation of this area for health
                                            and safety: presence of geologic hazards, including identified landslides, debris flow
                                            areas, slopes in excess of 35% in parts of the area and high fire hazard. In addition,
                                            these lands are important for their natural beauty which provides substantial visual
                                            enhancement to Woodside and the Midpeninsula. This area also serves as an
                                            important wildlife habitat for all major local biotic communities. Bear Gulch Creek is
                                            the only creek within Woodside to support a trout population.
                                            Area 2: San Francisco Watershed Lands
                                            The City and County of San Francisco hold approximately 23,000 acres of watershed
                                            lands lying to the north of town limits, of which approximately 560 acres are within
                                            the Planning Area. The Crystal Springs Lakes reservoirs of the San Francisco water
                                            system are located within this area. Uses other than watershed protection and water
                                            storage include wildlife sanctuary (State Fish and Game Preserve), riding and hiking
                                            on established trails (subject to permit from the San Francisco Water Department),

Area 5: Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and Searsville Lake
Marshlands
The Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,189 acre scientific study area that consists
of a diverse upland area, Searsville Lake, and the marshland east of Portola Road. It
is part of Stanford University’s lands and is maintained by the University as a highly
restricted nature preserve for biological field research. This area is designated as
Academic in Stanford’s Land Use Plan. Parts of the area in any event are unsuitable for
development because of terrain and geologic conditions. The steep north and west

facing slopes are striking visual features.
The man-made marsh in this Stanford area is unusual because it is part of one of the
largest fresh water marshes in the Bay Area. The area also includes some dry land
presently used for a commercial stable and riding ring. The marshlands support a
diverse population of birds, insects and amphibians. Many organisms found in the
marshlands cannot survive elsewhere. Therefore, the inclusion of marshlands in an
ecosystem significantly increases the diversity of species in the area. A large variety
of animals rely upon the marsh for sustenance. It provides food for many varieties
of organisms, from the frog-loving raccoon to the seed-eating blackbird. A variety

marshlands should be retained as open space lands for natural resource preservation.
The area is also important for outdoor recreation as it is part of the scenic corridor
along Portola Road and provides equestrian facilities. Because of the prevailing
high water and soft ground conditions, a major part of the area is unsuitable for
development and should be preserved as open space for health and safety as well as
for its natural resource and recreation values.

Area 18: Edgewood County Park
San Mateo County’s Edgewood County park consists of 467 acres bisected by a
north-south ridge. Dense oak woodland and steep terrain characterize the eastern
half of the park. The western exposure of the ridge is characterized by grasslands,
oak woodland and gentler slopes. Approximately half of the Park area consists of
serpentine rock, which hosts the Bay Checkerspot butterfly, listed as a “threatened
species” by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The park is highly visible from
the I-280 scenic corridor, particularly during the wildflower season. Park uses include         Area 18: Edgewood County Park.

Area 19: Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve
The Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve is owned by the Midpeninsula
Regional Open Space District. This 3,360-acre preserve is located on the western
slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains overlooking Half Moon Bay. Its eastern boundary
abuts State Highway 35, across from the Huddart park boundary. The preserve was
established with a gift of $2 million from the Save-the-Redwoods League. It includes
the area previously known in the 1988 Woodside General Plan as Open Space Area 19
(“Redwood Park”), which is a 623-acre portion of this current preserve. The preserve
boasts towering redwoods, rushing creeks, and understories of ferns, berries, and
                                                                                                                                         OPEN SPACE

                                          This area comprises the 942-acre San Mateo County Park. Wunderlich Park is suitable
                                          for low intensity uses, such as horseback riding, hiking, family or other small group
                                          picnicking, nature study, and scenic enjoyment. Vehicular access to the park, parking,
                                          and other development require careful control to avoid degradation of the natural
                                          resources and adverse impact on the community. Except for the canyon of Alambique
                                          Creek, almost the entire park is in view from a major portion of the Midpeninsula and

The Alambique Creek Canyon, the Fairy Ring, and the middle and upper meadows
require special protection to preserve these valuable natural resource areas.
Several large landslides have been mapped within the park boundaries; some other
smaller areas have been identified as highly susceptible to landsliding. The terrain for
the most part is very steep. Most of Wunderlich Park is classified as a high fire risk area.
These hazardous conditions would be severe constraints on development and open
space preservation for health and safety is warranted.

Gulch watershed lands of the California Water Service Company. These lands are
dependent upon Bear Gulch Road, a private road, for access. Because of ownership
patterns, steepness of terrain, and slope stability problems, private development is
difficult.
These lands are suitable for low intensity recreational use and watershed protection;
all surface drainage from this area flows into Bear Gulch Creek above the intake for
the public water supply. In addition, because of geologic hazards, the lands should
be preserved as open space for health and safety.                                                  Area 25: Skyline Corridor /

Area 32: Village Hill
Village Hill is a Town-owned parcel on Woodside Road which overlooks the center
of Town. Consisting of 1.65 acres, it is an area viewed by many people as they travel
through the Town Center. It contributes to the rural character of the Town by providing
a hillside of natural grasses which contrast with the commercial development across
Woodside Road. In 1988, the Town Council adopted an Ordinance No. 1988-371 to
prohibit the sale, lease or development of Village Hill unless a majority of the voters
take other action. A trail transverses the site and an equestrian sculpture (“Spring and        Area 32: Village Hill.

Area 33: Teague Hill
Teague Hill is a 624-acre expanse of hillside above the Summit Springs-Woodside
Oaks area and is an important part of the Western Hills that are visible from many
places in Woodside. It constitutes a significant visual resource as a natural, tree-
covered backdrop to the Town and is an essential part of the community’s identity.
The area, considered to be extremely valuable watershed, has three deep ravines
that run toward West Union Creek: Squealer Gulch, Tripp Gulch and Appletree Gulch.
Densely wooded forests and deep lush ravines characterize the majority of the site
and serve as valuable wildlife habitat. Much of the area has slopes over 35% and

of open space on the Peninsula. Some trails exist and more are planned on the land.             Area 33: Teague Hill.
Area 34: Barkley Fields and Park
Barkley Fields and Park is owned by the Town of Woodside. The 6-acre park, which
is located off Farm Hill Boulevard across from Cañada College, opened in October
of 2007. It is the Town’s only formal park and is dedicated to youth organized sports,
                                                                                                                                          APPENDICES
primarily soccer and baseball. The land was donated to the Town by a local family
and about half of the funds needed for the park’s construction were raised from
private donations. The area was undeveloped at the time it was donated, but had
been considered for development on several occasions during the decade prior to its
donation. The agreement that governed the gift of the land stipulates that the land
must remain in open space and used to provide youth sports fields.

                                              Introduction
                                              Purpose of Element
                                              The Conservation Element defines conservation goals, policies, and strategies for
                                              the conservation and utilization of natural resources, and protection of the aesthetic
                                              qualities of the community. Residents should be aware of both local and regional
                                              opportunities and environmental issues in order to maintain and enhance the natural
                                              quality of the natural environment.
                                              Following the Introduction, the Conservation Element includes a “Definitions” section
                                              and “Updates Since 1988”. The Element then includes a “Natural Resource Inventory”,
                                              which describes the specific attributes of Woodside’s air quality, watershed, water
                                              resources, and flora and fauna. The Natural Resource Inventory is followed by a
                                              discussion of “Conservation Regulation”, which describes a number of governmental
                                              regulations and agencies which safeguard natural resources, including federal, State,
                                              and regional governance. The last section contains the Conservation Element “Goal,
                                              Policies, and Strategies”, which seek to preserve, protect, and enhance the natural
                                              features, resources, and wildlife of the Town and Planning Area.
                                              The unique natural setting of Woodside is the primary characteristic of quality of life
                                              in Town. The steep, tree covered slopes and deeply incised canyons of the Santa Cruz
                                              Mountains provide the watershed, land form and backdrop for the westerly portion
                                              of the Town. When viewed from scenic corridors in the suburban valleys below, these
                                              western foothills provide the first impression of the community. The wooded slopes
 The Western Hills.                           and stream corridors within the Town provide a spacious, natural and rural quality.
                                              The central area of the Town contains the gentle oak and grassland foothills, flatter
                                              valley areas, valley stream corridors containing riparian habitat, flood plains, ground
                                              water aquifers and seismic rift zones. The portion of Town east of Interstate 280 is
                                              predominantly mixed oak woodland.
                                              The Town is endowed with a variety of landforms and environmental resources,
                                              creating a mosaic of natural features and aesthetic qualities that are unusual within
                                              this urban region. The preservation of these natural features represents the single
                                              most important community conservation value.
                                              The open lands surrounding Woodside also play important roles in conserving natural
                                              resources. The system of water, wildlife, geological and visual resources crosses
                                              political boundaries, and it should be maintained on a regional scale. Stanford lands,
                                              including the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, San Francisco Watershed lands, and
                                              lands west of Skyline contain many prominent natural features, such as streams, lakes,
                                              and wildlife habitat (also see the Open Space Element).
 Open lands in Woodside provide space
 for many important habitats.

Since its incorporation, the Town of Woodside has affected a careful stewardship of its
resources through the utilization of land use policies and implementation programs
which reflect strong conservation goals.
Woodside residents historically have been committed to maintaining the Town’s
rural atmosphere and residential character. The conservation of natural resources is a
foundation of the Town planning efforts and land use regulations. For the purposes
of truly effective conservation, development and utilization of natural resources,
however, there is a need for a more widespread understanding of how the ecosystem
functions. This Conservation Element is intended to contribute to this understanding.
                                                                                                                                            INTRODUCTION

                                          Changes Since 1988
                                          Since adoption of the last General Plan (1988), the following changes related to
                                          conservation have occurred:
                                          •  Listing of flora and fauna species has increased;
                                          •  The regulation of wetlands has narrowed;

                                          •  Climate change has become of increasing concern.
                                          Increase in Listing of Species
                                          Due to habitat loss or degradation, competition with non-native species, and other

                                          Regulation of Wetlands
                                          Wetlands and other waters of the United States (such as lakes and streams) have
                                          been regulated under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) since 1972.

Sudden Oak Death Syndrome (SODS)
Sudden Oak Death is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, and can
quickly kill susceptible tree species, including:
•  tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus)
•  coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia)
•  black oak (Quercus kelloggii)
                                                                                                                                        CONSERVATION
Of these, tanoak is the species most susceptible to mortality.
Sudden Oak Death Syndrome (SODS) first appeared in California in 1995, and
has since spread throughout coastal counties in central and northern California,
including San Mateo County.                                                                   Sudden Oak Death.

The pathogen can also result in adverse (though usually non-lethal) effects (such             naturescience/diseases_sod.htm
as leaf or twig dieback) to other species common in Woodside, including:
•  redwood (Sequoia sempervirens)

•  Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
•  California bay (Umbellularia californica)
•  evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum)
Even if not killed or substantially affected, these species can act as hosts for the
pathogen, contributing to the spread of Sudden Oak Death in a forest. California
bay, in particular, is a significant host contributing to the spread of SODS in
central and northern California. There is currently no cure for infected trees, but
there are treatments which can help to prevent infection in uninfected trees or in

Climate Change
Since 1988, there has been considerable study and increased scientific knowledge
regarding the potential for climate change resulting from human activities. Changes
in climate and weather patterns could have significant consequences for native
ecosystems in Woodside and throughout California. For instance, the distribution of
redwood forests, including those in Woodside, is linked to rainfall patterns as well
as the timing and location of coastal fog and stratus. Any changes in these patterns
could result in adverse effects on redwood forests and other vegetation types, with
consequences such as changes in forest composition and structure, impacts to
wildlife habitat, and changes to fire frequency. Refer to the Sustainability Element for

Town Natural Resources
California Government Code Section 65302(d) defines a purpose of a conservation
element as the conservation of natural resources, including: water, forests, soils,
water bodies, fisheries, wildlife, and other natural resources. The Town’s conservation
strategies are related to the components of the Woodside environment, their fragile
characteristics, their interrelationships, and required actions for environmental

Air Quality
The problem of air pollution continues to be a major environmental concern. Air
pollution is associated with major respiratory diseases and extensive economic losses
associated with it have been widely documented. The Town’s direct involvement with

                                             biodiversity hotspot, as defined by Conservation International, due to an unusually
                                             high concentration of endemic plants. The CFP is one of the five biodiversity hotspots
                                             globally, with a Mediterranean climate, and is characterized by hot, dry summers
                                             and cool, wet winters. The CFP is situated along the Pacific Coast of North America,
                                             and includes about 70% of the State of California west of the Sierras, northern
                                             Baja California, and southwestern Oregon. While in other geographic areas habitat
                                             remains unchanged over large expanses, Woodside is indicative of the diversity of
                                             the CFP in that the existence of microclimates and wide variations in topography
                                             and soils make it possible to experience habitats from deep redwood forests to open
                                             grassland within very short distances.

                                             Wetlands and Riparian Corridors
                                             Embedded within each of Woodside’s four general habitat areas are wetlands and
                                             riparian corridors which, though often small in size, offer important habitat for
                                             both common and special-status plants and wildlife. These corridors provide other
                                             important ecosystem functions including water purification, groundwater recharge,
                                             and flood flow reduction. The following Table CV2 lists flora and fauna which occurs

                                             Mixed Oak Woodland
                                             Mixed Oak Woodland occurs primarily on lower slopes and on rolling hills in central
                                             and eastern areas of Woodside. Oaks dominate the canopy, along with other trees,
                                             such as bay and buckeye. Shrubs, native grasses, and forbs are also common. Native
                                             and non native herbaceous species characteristic of Grassland habitat are present
                                             in canopy openings. Due to the abundance of food (e.g., acorns) and other habitat
                                             components (e.g., snags and cavity-bearing trees), oak woodlands are some of the
Mixed Oak Woodland.
                                             most productive and diverse wildlife habitats in California. Characteristic wildlife
                                             species that use oak woodlands include mammals, such as deer, mountain lion,
                                             foxes, mice, rats, and numerous bat species; a large number of birds, such as hawks,
                                             woodpeckers, and owls; and reptiles and amphibians. The following Table CV3 lists
                                             flora and fauna which occurs in the Mixed Oak Woodland habitat:

Redwood-Mixed Evergreen Forest
Redwood-Mixed Evergreen Forest occurs primarily in the western portion of
Woodside in the foothills and eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Redwood
is dominant in lower slopes, drainages, and other areas with deeper soils and higher
soil moisture. A variety of trees, shrubs, and herbs grow in the deep shade of the
redwood canopy, including a diverse mix of broadleafed evergreen trees. Native
shrubs are common, along with herbaceous species. Common wildlife in Redwood-
Mixed Evergreen Forest includes birds, squirrels, raccoon, skunks, and reptiles and              Redwood-Mixed Evergreen Forest.

                                              Grassland
                                              Grasslands occur primarily in northern and eastern portions of Woodside adjacent to
                                              Interstate 280. Grasslands are generally in areas subject to past disturbance, such as
                                              grazing. Native grasslands in California have been greatly altered from their original
                                              condition, and grasslands in Woodside are composed primarily of non-native grasses
                                              and forbs, with occasional native species. Grasslands support a rich and varied wildlife
                                              population, including deer, squirrels, and gophers, which, along with abundant
Grassland.                                    invertebrates, offer food sources to bird and mammal predators, such as hawks and
                                              coyotes. Grasslands in the Woodside area underlain by certain soil types, such as
                                              serpentine, are unique habitats and often contain rare plant and insect species. The

Chaparral
Chaparral is a dense shrub community usually occurring in dry areas, particularly in the
western portions of Woodside on steep slopes and ridges, and/or areas with thin or
rocky soils. Chaparral is dominated by native shrubs. Chaparral is adapted to frequent
fires and many plant species survive and/or reproduce after fires via resprouting and/
or germination of dormant seeds in the soil seed bank. Wildlife species common in
chaparral include birds, rabbits, bobcats, and reptiles. Chaparral can be observed at
the Thornewood Open Space Preserve. The following Table CV6 lists flora and fauna                  Chaparral.

Fauna Conservation
As described in the Natural Resource Inventory section above, the Town has diverse
populations of fauna. Much of Woodside area is relatively undisturbed and serves as
the habitat of a diverse wildlife population. Conservation of this habitat is not only
important for protection of wildlife, but also for conservation of the rural atmosphere
of Woodside. Some development has occurred in the Planning Area without
considering the conservation of wildlife habitats, with the result being that natural
species are sometimes driven out. Other species have been introduced into the                   Maintained clear passage of wildlife

Wildlife Habitat and Corridors
In order to maintain and enhance wildlife habitat, special attention should be given
to maintaining clear passage through wildlife corridors, preserving riparian areas, and
leaving portions of property undeveloped. Non-wildlife friendly fencing fragments
habitats, alters migration patterns, forces wildlife on roadways, and makes previously
populated habitat areas inaccessible. Clearing riparian and natural state areas reduces
or eliminates wildlife food and shelter. The loss of protective cover also leaves species
open to increased predation.

as “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to
attempt to engage in any such conduct.”
A habitat conservation plan (HCP) must accompany an application for an incidental
take permit. The habitat conservation plan associated with the permit ensures that
the effects of the authorized incidental take are adequately minimized and mitigated.

In Woodside a project that would require a Section 404 permit through USACE would
be restoration of a pond or wetland that involves bank reconstruction. Additionally,
if a project is occurring near a wetland, the applicant would first have a biologist
prepare a biotic assessment to determine the wetland delineation, which would be
reviewed by USACE to determine if it has permitting jurisdiction.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Community-wide (2005 Baseline)
In October 2010, the County of San Mateo County RecycleWorks program prepared an estimation of community-wide
greenhouse gas emissions for Woodside. RecycleWorks estimated the 2005 greenhouse gas as 120,063 metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for the baseline calendar year of 2005. The emission sectors included in this report are: residential
energy use, community energy use, transportation on local roads, transportation on State highways, water disposal, average
daily cover of waste, and transportation off-roads (See Table S.2). Sixty five percent of community-wide emissions result from
transportation on State highways, 19% from residential energy use, and 11% from transportation on local roads.

 An explanation of the methodology for preparing this greenhouse gas emissions inventory is located in Section Two: Emission Inventory
 Methodology of the above referenced RecycleWorks report. In summary, the inventory follows standard methodology developed for the Local
 Government Operations Protocol (LGOP), with modifiers (e.g., substituting a standardized formula for government operations fleet emissions
 with a standardized formula for transportation on local roads and state highways) to quantify community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.
As evidenced by Table S2, 2005 Woodside Community-Wide Emissions by Sector, it is estimated that the greatest contributor
(65%) to green house gas emissions in Town is transportation on State highways. Given the small size of the Town, its government,
and available resources, reducing vehicular trips on State highways that run through Town are largely beyond local control.
Participation in regional solutions to transportation issues is one way to be involved. The second greatest contributor (19%) to
green house gas emissions in Town is residential energy use which may be more directly influenced locally by regulation, such
as required green building standards.
Per capita emissions can be a useful metric for measuring progress in reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) and for comparing
one community’s emissions with neighboring cities and against regional and national averages. Comparisons should be
viewed more as rough comparisons, however, since it can be difficult to produce and obtain directly comparable per capita
emissions numbers. Each community has its own particular proximity to work and commercial areas, housing densities, as well
as availability of public transportation which can result in wide variation in per capita emissions.
As detailed in Table S.2, dividing the total community-wide GHG emissions by population yields a result of approximately 21.9
metric tons of CO2e per capita. It should be noted that this number is not the same as the carbon footprint of the average
individual living in the Town, as the per capita number also includes emissions from activities by people who work or drive
through Town, not only those living in the Town.

In October 2011, The Planning Center, PG&E, in conformance with BAAQMD requirements, prepared GHG calculations for
existing land uses in the Town in the CEQA baseline year (2011), land uses in the Town at 2020, and land uses in the Town
at buildout of General Plan 2012 (2035). The results are shown in Table S4. Under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the
maximum development allowed under buildout of General Plan 2012 would result in annual emission that would exceed
BAAQMD’s 6.6 MTons per service population threshold. Because the GHG emissions associated with General Plan 2012
would exceed BAAQMD’s efficiency matrix, this plan includes a GHG reduction strategy for the Town.
Statewide GHG emissions reduction measures that are being implemented over the next 10 years (such as, changes in fuel
mix, and energy source portfolios, and green building requirements), will reduce the Town’s GHG emissions. Table S5 is the
                                                                                                                                              SUSTAINABILITY
2020 and 2035 GHG emissions in the Town with federal, State, and local GHG reduction strategies in place. As shown in the
table, the Town is projected to have no growth in non-residential land uses and only a small amount of residential growth,
resulting in a nominal increase in GHG emissions growth in the Town from 2010 to 2020. BAAQMD requires municipalities
to identify a GHG reduction target that is in line with the GHG reduction goals of AB 32, which are:
•  1990 levels by 2020,
•  15 percent lower than existing (2005 – 2008) levels by 2020, or,

The Town, through its Climate Action Plan (see S2.5) would be required to establish a GHG reduction target that is
                                                                                                                                              APPENDICES
consistent with one of the three BAAQMD targets outlined above. For the purposes of this GHG assessment, Table S5
compares communitywide GHG emissions in 2020 based on a target consistent with BAAQMD’s recommendations of
15 percent below existing levels. The target identified in Table S5 is based on existing levels of GHG emissions shown in
Table S4. As a result, federal and State-wide GHG emissions reduction measures currently being implemented have the
potential to reduce GHG emission within the Town almost to the GHG reduction target of 15 percent lower than current
(2011) levels (within 94 percent of the target). A Town GHG reduction strategy identifying local communitywide GHG
reduction measures that ensure that emissions reductions in the Town continue on a downward trend to achieve the
Town’s GHG reduction target and meet at least 590 MTons of additional reductions is, however, included in this Plan to
ensure consistency with the GHG reduction goals of AB 32 (preparation and implementation of the Climate Action Plan).

Residential Energy Use
Given that Woodside is predominantly a residential community, it is helpful to compare residential energy use to
those of surrounding communities. Sustainable San Mateo County has published an annual, county-wide report card
on sustainability entitled “Indicators for a Sustainable San Mateo County”, since 1997. The following figures and tables
illustrate the Town’s use of electricity and natural gas for 2005 and 2006, and compare these usages with other San Mateo
County municipalities:

For 2005 and 2006, Woodside ranked the second highest in the County of San Mateo for average electricity and natural gas
use per household. Factors which contribute to Woodside’s high electric and natural gas usage include large residence sizes
and the accompanying indoor and outdoor lighting, and heating and cooling needs; and the development of additional site
amenities, such as guest houses, pool houses, pools, water features, and other accessory structures and uses.

Other Provisions of the General Plan
that Support Sustainability
Sustainability is an integral theme that runs through other Elements of the General
Plan and its two Area Plans, as well as the Town’s two Specific Plans. It has been a
fundamental value of the Town since incorporation in 1956. Sustainability is addressed
in the following ways in the other Elements:
                                                                                                  Town Center provides convienient

community and commercial activities in two central locations and along major routes
of travel. This results in reducing trip generation, air pollution, and consumption of
energy.
Historic Preservation Element
The Historic Preservation Element is intended to help preserve the rich history of
the Town. The retention of historic structures preserves the “embodied energy” of a
structure (materials and labor) and site (mature landscaping).
                                                                                                  Historic building reuse preserves

Circulation Element
The street system is designed to provide efficient access to the most frequently visited
locations in Town, accommodating multiple forms of transportation(motor vehicles,
bicycles, horses, and pedestrians). It also seeks to reduce energy consumption and
air pollution.
Open Space Element
The Open Space Element calls for the preservation of major parts of the Town in a
natural state. This contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through
carbon absorption by plants.                                                                       Multiple forms of transportation

Conservation Element
The Conservation Element provides for the protection of the natural resources of the
Town including: water in streams, water bodies and wetlands; native vegetation; soils
and geology; and wildlife. This Element also addresses preservation of the natural
environment when new development is considered.
Public Utilities Element
The Public Utilities Element calls for access to utility services of a quality and quantity
which will protect health and safety, installed in a manner that preserves the Town’s
                                                                                                                                            AREA PLANS
