develops, evolves, and transitions over time. This chapter of the General
Plan focuses on the City’s neighborhoods, commercial and industrial
areas, mixed-use corridors, public spaces, parks and recreation, urban design, historic
preservation, and mining operations. The City strives for an orderly and attractive physical
form and appearance. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a clear course of direction for
the City to make future land use decisions. The Community Form Chapter is made up of a
“Strategic Framework for 2030” and the District Plans.
2.2         Strategic Framework for 2030
Lake Elsinore has a well-defined strategy for investing finite City
resources for the greatest public benefit. This General Plan provides
the framework to help accomplish that objective and ensure the
future prosperity of the City and its residents.
The Strategic Framework provides an overall structure to identify
policies that guide the City in addressing its challenges to achieve
the primary City goal: to improve the quality of life for current and
future generations of residents. It provides a mechanism to explain
how the individual elements of the General Plan fit together, how
the Plan is to be implemented through a regulatory framework that
achieves its policies, and provides a vision for the foreseeable
future.
The Strategic Framework will include the following elements and           Maintain Quality of Life
topics of the General Plan, which collectively set Community Form:
                          Land Use
                          Circulation
                          Growth Management
                          Housing Element (prepared and bound separately)
                          Community Facilities and Protection Services (See Chapter 3.0)
                          Parks and Recreation
                          Historic Preservation (See Chapter 4.0)

2.3         Land Use
2.3.1       Introduction
In order to maintain a community with a broad variety of economic land uses that provide
services and jobs for residents, and accommodations and destination venues for visitors, a
diversity of land use designations should be available, including schools, parks (both active
recreation areas and passive open space), community centers, residential uses for different
socio-economic levels, retail, commercial, employment centers, and industrial/mining
operations. The Land Use element and its maps indicate the general distribution, location,
types, and relationships of these land uses.
The Lake Elsinore General Plan Area includes all land designated for, or to be considered for,
future development, including all land within the existing city limits and areas within the City’s
Sphere of Influence that the City may wish to consider for annexation into its incorporated
boundary in the future. Specifically, the General Plan Area covers 46,564 total acres including
27,747 acres within existing city limits, 18,818 within the City’s Sphere of Influence. Currently,
much of the City’s existing vacant land and open space areas are governed by adopted specific
plans and slated for future development. Significant amounts of open space areas and Multiple
Species Habitat Conservation Plan conservation areas have been incorporated in these specific
plans, Regional Conservation Authority independent land acquisitions, and throughout other
areas of the City.
Figure 2.1a, Land Use Plan, designates land uses for the
Lake Elsinore area. The Land Use Plan assigns a series
of residential and non-residential land use designations.
The Land Use Plan identifies locations of the land use
designations to indicate where certain types of land uses
may occur. In the case of the specific plan areas, the
Land Use Plan depicts a Specific Plan Land Use
designation for all areas for which there exists an
approved specific plan. Each approved specific plan
document governs land uses within its designated
boundaries.      Additional information detailing each
specific plan is located in Appendix A of this document.
The following is a list of specific plans approved at the
time this General Plan document was prepared:
                                                                        Example Map of Land Uses

State law mandates that general plans include standards of population density and building
intensity for all of the territory covered by the plan. To satisfy this requirement, Table 2-1, City
of Lake Elsinore Land Use Designation Standards, includes standards for each of the land use
designations shown in Figure 2.1a. These standards are stated differently for residential vs.
non-residential development. The following sections explain how these standards operate.

 Chapter 2.0
2.3.2       Land Use Baselines
The land area of the City of Lake Elsinore is approximately 43 square miles, and with the
addition of the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI), it covers more than 72 square miles. The SOI,
adopted by the Riverside County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO), represents the probable future boundaries
and service area of the City.
As nearby areas such as San Diego County, Orange County, and
Los Angeles County become less affordable, people are beginning
to move to cities in the Inland Empire such as Lake Elsinore for the
relatively affordable housing.
Neighborhoods
There are a number of distinct neighborhoods within the City of
Lake Elsinore often defined by the name of a specific plan. For
example, residents describe themselves as being from Tuscany
                                                                           California gnatcatcher
Hills or Alberhill Ranch, which are both specific plan areas. Other
neighborhoods are defined by the development name, such as Country Club Heights.
Neighborhoods are also defined by common characteristics, such as the Historic District, by
location, or geography.
Commercial/Industrial
Existing commercial and industrial uses are scattered throughout the City. The major
commercial centers include the Lake Elsinore Outlets located on Collier Avenue; the
Costco/Lowes, Home Depot, and the Target shopping centers at the Interstate 15/Central
Avenue intersection; and a development called “City Centre” that has a Wal-Mart and Vons, at
the Interstate 15/Rainbow Canyon intersection. Due to the City’s attraction as a tourist and
recreation destination, there is interest in developing a strong retail base at historic downtown
Main Street.
Lake Elsinore contains diverse industrial uses that include manufacturing, wholesale, and
distribution, predominately located within the Business District.
Lake Elsinore has a developing Auto Mall located adjacent to I-15, including Lake Chevrolet,
Lake Elsinore Ford, and Lake Buick Pontiac GMC. Additional auto dealerships are slated for
future development.
Open Space and the MSHCP
Open space is also critical to the quality of life and economic development in the City. Open
space on land that contains endangered species and sensitive habitat may be designated for
permanent preservation under the MSHCP or granted “take” authorization under the MSHCP,
                                                2-10

                                                                                   Chapter 2.0
balanced with urban development in these areas. Land on steep slopes may be difficult to
develop and could likely remain as permanent open space. In some cases appropriate
reclamation planning and creative hillside engineering can correct the impacts of the mining
activity and create viable urban land uses. Land within the floodway of local drainages, including
Lake Elsinore and Temescal Creek, are currently vacant to avoid flooding. Additional open space
exists, although much of this land is committed and designated for future development (24.9%).
The above open space areas will be subject to future planning design, balancing MSHCP
permanent conservation needs with economic land use programs that will contain permanent
open space areas separate from the MSHCP.
The MSHCP was adopted by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors on June 17, 2003 and
the City of Lake Elsinore in 2004. Countywide, the MSHCP has 16 area plans, including the
Lake Elsinore Area Plan, which includes the City of Lake Elsinore and the City of Canyon Lake.
The MSHCP is intended to conserve natural habitat and preserve biological and ecological
diversity in western Riverside County. Chapter 4.0 (Biological Resources) explains the MSHCP
in greater detail. It is important to note that the target conservation acreage range, as required
in the MSHCP within the City of Lake Elsinore is 4,800–7,800 acres.
Existing endangered and threatened species in the Lake Elsinore Area Plan include the coastal
California gnatcatcher, least Bell’s vireo, Stephens’ kangaroo rat, the Quino checkerspot
butterfly, and other federally endangered species. The MSHCP has identified particular areas
within Lake Elsinore where land should be preserved to maintain core and linkage habitat for
the MSHCP-identified species. It is the intention of the MSHCP to set aside land as permanent
open space as directed by the City Council to balance conservation with urban economic
development. The City of Lake Elsinore has the largest percentage and acreage of MSHCP
designated conservation in the region. The City must balance its conservation planning as to not
hinder economic development opportunities, particularly along major transportation corridors
and intersections. The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) is
responsible for maintaining and managing the reserve.
Floodplains
There are several floodplain areas within the City of Lake Elsinore. These include the
floodplain around the lake; the area to the east of the lake in the East Lake Specific Plan; the
area along Temescal Wash; the area along the San Jacinto River from Canyon Lake, also known
as the Railroad Canyon Reservoir; and along Alberhill or “Temescal” Creek.
Density and Intensity
Standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as the allowable range of dwelling
units per net acre. Net acreage includes all the land, excluding streets and rights-of-way,
designated for a particular residential use.
                                                2-11

 Chapter 2.0
Standards of population density for residential uses can be derived by multiplying the
maximum allowable number of dwelling units per net acre by the average number of persons
per dwelling unit assumed for the typical residential designation. The assumed household
average number of persons per dwelling unit in Lake Elsinore is 3.37, according to the State
Department of Finance in their 2010 report.
Standards of building intensity for non-residential
designations in the General Plan are stated as
maximum floor area ratios (FAR). A floor area ratio is
the numerical value obtained by dividing the gross
building square footage on a lot by the net square
footage of the lot.
To illustrate, on a lot with 10,000 net square feet of land
area, an FAR of 1.0 will allow 10,000 square feet of gross
building floor area to be built, regardless of the number
of stories in the building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor
on two floors or 10,000 square feet on one floor). On the
same lot, an FAR of 0.5 would allow 5,000 square feet of                Depiction of FAR
floor area, and an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square
feet, etc.
Standards of employee population density for non-residential uses can be derived by
multiplying one acre (43,560 square feet) by the applicable FAR and then dividing by the
assumed average square footage of building area per employee. The assumed average square
footage of non-residential building floor area per employee varies by commercial and industrial
land use intensities, as follows:
            Neighborhood Commercial                          350 square feet per employee
            General Commercial, Mixed Uses                   400 square feet per employee
            Gateway Commercial, Industrial Business Park 425 square feet per employee
            Tourist Commercial, Public Institutional         450 square feet per employee
            Freeway Business                                 500 square feet per employee
            Limited Industrial                               600 square feet per employee

2.3.3       Land Use Designations
The General Plan includes seventeen (17) residential, commercial, mixed use, industrial and
other land use designations to depict the types of land uses that will be allowed in each General
Plan Area. Each land use designation is defined in terms of the allowable uses and density and
intensity standards. Table 2-1, above, summarizes the standards for each land use designation.
The General Plan is implemented largely through zoning and its accompanying regulations.
Residential
Residential land use designations offer a mix of housing types to Lake Elsinore residents. These
designations enable the City to provide housing available to all economic segments of the
community, including very low, low and moderate income households, as well as estate lots
and custom homes. The following residential designations are available: Hillside, Lakeside,
Low Density, Low-Medium Density, Medium Density and High Density. Each designation is
more fully described below.
Hillside Residential
This designation is intended for low-density single-family residential development and small-
scale agricultural uses in areas of steep slopes. Parcel sizes of one-half, one, two, four or ten
(net) acres are required for newly created lots depending on the total average slope, and
whether the parcel has adequate sewage treatment service from either a treatment plant or from
individual septic systems. Development is conditional based upon the ability of the lot to
connect to the treatment plant or the soil to percolate. Development of newly created lots
would be prohibited in areas with an average slope of 40% or greater. The following are
standards for minimum parcel size:
                   Under 15% slope: 1 dwelling unit per acre *
                       15-25% slope: 1 dwelling unit per 2 acres
                       25-35% slope: 1 dwelling unit per 5 acres
                         35+% slope: 1 dwelling unit per 10 acres
                   * Where parcels are served or are eligible to be served by a
                      sewage treatment plan, parcel size may be reduced to ½
                      acre.
Clustering of development is permitted on areas of level topography and only if adequate
sewer is available, to encourage preservation of steep slopes. ”Clustering” can be defined as a
development pattern whereby structures or building sites are arranged in close proximity to
one another in non-linear groups, adjacent to permanently preserved common open space or
steep slope areas, so as to make efficient and visually aesthetic use of the natural features of the
landscape. In both cluster and non-cluster projects, the actual parcel size may be increased and
the number of dwelling units decreased for reasons of environmental protection or for
                                               2-13

 Chapter 2.0
neighborhood compatibility or for other reasons necessary to protect the public health, safety or
welfare.
Lakeside Residential
This designation provides for custom single family homes that have an orientation and
accessibility to the lake for private use only. Residential densities for new subdivisions should
not exceed one (1) dwelling unit per 10,000 net square feet. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and lot
coverage shall be calculated on the area of the property remaining above the “Ordinary High
Water Mark”. Development should, as much as possible, provide scenic vistas between homes
which could be enjoyed by pedestrians as well as local residences. Development proposed
within this designation may require additional design and engineering due to traffic safety
circulation.
Low Density
This designation provides for single-family detached homes, secondary residential units, hobby
farming and keeping of animals, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses.
Clustered single-family development may also be encouraged within this designation to
minimize grading requirements and impacts to environmentally sensitive areas. Residential
densities shall be between 1 and 3 dwelling units per net acre.
Low-Medium Density
This designation provides for single-family detached homes, secondary residential units, public
and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residential densities shall be between 1
and 6 dwelling units per net acre.
Medium Density
This designation provides for typical single family detached and attached homes, duplexes,
triplexes, fourplexes, multi-family residential units, group quarters, public and quasi-public
uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residential densities shall be between 7 and 18 dwelling
units per net acre.
High Density
This designation provides for single-family attached homes, multi-family residential units,
group quarters, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residential
densities shall be between 19 and 24 units per net acre.
Density Bonus
Consistent with the State Density Bonus and Incentive Law (California Government Code
Section 65915 et seq.), a developer, upon request, shall be granted a density bonus, incentive,
concession, or modification/waiver of development standards as long as the developer
proposes to build a qualified project satisfying criteria set forth in the City’s Density Bonus
Ordinance.

Mixed Use
Commercial Mixed Use
This designation provides for a mix of residential and non-residential uses within a single
proposed development area, with an emphasis on retail, service, civic and professional office
uses. Residential uses are allowed in a subordinate capacity. The FAR for non-residential uses
is 0.80:1 and a minimum of 50% of the total floor area shall be commercial uses. Residential
densities shall be between 7 and 18 dwelling units per net acre.
Residential Mixed Use
This designation provides for a mix of residential and non-residential uses within a single
proposed development area with an emphasis on high density residential uses. Uses such as
retail, service, civic, and professional office are allowed in a subordinate capacity. Residential
densities shall be between 19 and 24 dwelling units per net acre. With a future adoption of a
Residential Mixed Use Ordinance, a density bonus incentive of up to 35 dwelling units per net
acre shall be granted where site amenities are provided. Amenities for which a bonus may be
granted are defined below. The FAR for non-residential uses is 1.0:1. If non-residential uses are
proposed they shall be between twenty percent (20%) and thirty-five percent (35%) of the total
building square footage.

 Chapter 2.0
Overlays/Special Treatment Areas
Overlays/Special Treatment Areas are used in areas within the City with special needs, and
either expand or modify the base regulations in an effort to encourage flexibility and high
quality developments. The General Plan consists of the following three (3) Overlays/Special
Treatment Areas.
Main Street
This special overlay designation, located in the Historic District, indicates that there is a set of
policies that provide additional tools needed to revitalize Historic Downtown’s vision for its
Main Street corridor. The overlay designation was established with the adoption of this
General Plan to address the specific needs of the downtown area and the need to establish
development regulations that will facilitate redevelopment and promote a healthy urban
environment. The main focus is to revitalize Historic Downtown as the premier civic,
commercial, and cultural destination of the City and the surrounding areas and to provide a
strong connection to the lake. Specific goals and policies related to the Main Street overlay and
focus are identified in the Historic District Plan and the Downtown Master Plan, both part of
the General Plan.
Auto Mall
This special overlay designation, located in the Riverview District, provides for additional
detailed design standards necessary to facilitate and accommodate auto mall development and
prevent conflicts related to land use incompatibility with surrounding residential
neighborhoods. The easternmost areas of the Riverview District have been designated as
general commercial with an overlay designation in order to support auto mall uses. It is
important to mitigate any land use incompatibility issues such as lighting and hours of
operation between auto mall activities in the general commercial designated areas of the eastern
portions of the Riverview District with the surrounding residential and recreational uses.
Extractive
This special overlay designation, located in the Alberhill District, the Business District, and the
North Central Sphere District provides for continued operations of extractive uses, such as
aggregates, coal, clay mining, and certain ancillary uses. These areas marked by the extractive
overlay are, in some cases, located within close proximity to both residential and non-
residential designations, conserved lands, and open space areas. As such, it will be important to
mitigate land use incompatibility issues with surrounding areas. Reclamation Plans are
required in conjunction with mining permits as particular projects come forward.
Specific Plan Areas
The specific plan land use designation identifies territory whose zoning is governed by existing,
approved specific plans. For those areas, the designated uses contained in each specific plan are
the governing land uses. Specific plans do not sunset; they remain valid until revoked pursuant
to State Law. It is intended that these potential development areas be constructed based on an
                                                2-18

overall plan consistent with the District Plans and the Community Form Chapter of the General
Plan. The plan should include detailed design guidelines, conceptual architecture, site
circulation and street improvements, as well as the phasing of the project. The overall plan will
be evaluated upon its adequacy in a number of areas that are outlined in the General Plan and
Zoning Code. These tools will allow the City the opportunity to consider a well-integrated
design that is responsive to the unique location and physical features of a site, as well as
providing opportunities for public input.

2.4         Circulation
2.4.1       Introduction
The City of Lake Elsinore recognizes that the manner in which people and goods move within
and through the City is a major part of maintaining a quality living environment. The City
intends to develop and maintain an effective transportation and circulation system that will
protect and enhance the environmental quality of the community and the region.
Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that all cities and counties include a Circulation or
Transportation Element as part of the required General Plan. This requirement is intended to
assure that cities and counties recognize the need to provide a circulation system that is
sensitive to land uses and the environment. The circulation system refers to the routes by which
traffic moves from one place to another and the modes by which people and goods are
transported from one place to another. The Circulation Element of the City of Lake Elsinore’s
General Plan is designed to provide mobility for residents and to facilitate business.
2.4.2       Circulation Baseline
The roadway system forms the core of the City’s circulation infrastructure and includes a
hierarchy consisting of seven (7) classifications: augmented urban arterial, urban arterial, major,
secondary, collector, divided collector, and special new roadway. Figure 2.2, Roadway Cross
Sections, depicts the cross sections of the seven (7) roadway classifications. Figure 2.3 is the
Roadway Classifications map.
While the automobile is the primary form of transportation, the City encourages use of
alternative modes of transportation within the City. For that reason, the transportation network
for the City of Lake Elsinore includes airports, bike paths, bus routes, sidewalks, trails, and
parking facilities.

             Represents free flow. Individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of others in
 LOS "A"     the traffic stream.
             In the range of stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to be
             noticeable. Freedom to select desired speeds is relatively unaffected, but there is a slight
 LOS "B"     decline in the freedom to maneuver.
             In the range of stable flow, but this level marks the beginning of the range of flow in which
             the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others
 LOS "C"     in the traffic stream.
             Represents high-density but stable flow. Speed and freedom to maneuver are severely
 LOS "D"     restricted, and the driver experiences a generally poor level of comfort and convenience.
             Represents operating conditions at or near the capacity level. All speeds are reduced to a
             low but relatively uniform value. Small increases in flow will cause breakdowns in traffic
 LOS "E"     movement.
             Used to define forced or breakdown flow. This condition exists wherever the amount of
             traffic approaching a point exceeds the amount that can traverse the point. Queues form
 LOS "F"     behind such locations.

Riverside County has established, as a countywide target, an LOS “C” on all County-
maintained roads and conventional state highways. As an exception, LOS “D” may be allowed
in Community Development areas at intersections with any combination of secondary
highways, major highways, arterials, urban arterials, expressways, conventional state highways
or at freeway ramp intersections. LOS “E” may be allowed in designated community centers to
the extent that it would support transit-oriented development and walkable communities. LOS
“D” with a delay of less than 45 seconds per vehicle (midpoint of LOS “D”) is acceptable to
Caltrans at signalized intersections.

 Chapter 2.0
This section describes most recent traffic conditions in the City of Lake Elsinore, including the
existing roadway features, existing transit services, and the other modes of transportation.
Existing Roadway Characteristics
Figure 2.4 depicts the existing number of through lanes on the roadway system. Most of the
arterial roadways in the City of Lake Elsinore have not been constructed to ultimate cross-
section widths. A brief description of each roadway is provided below.
         Interstate 15 (I-15) traverses in a generally north/south direction along the east side of
          the lake and the central portion of the City. To the north, I-15 connects with the
          Riverside Freeway (State Route 91), the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60), and the San
          Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) and is the link to greater Los Angeles and the
          Inland Empire. To the south, I-15 connects with the Escondido Freeway (Interstate
          215) and is the link to San Diego County. Currently, I-15 has three lanes in each
          direction within the SOI.
         State Route 74 (SR-74) traverses in a generally east/west direction along the north side
          of the lake and the central portion of the City. To the west, SR-74 (known as Ortega
          Highway through the mountainous Cleveland National Forest) connects with the San
          Diego Freeway (Interstate 5) and is the link to the coast and Orange County. To the
          east, SR-74 connects with I-215 and is the link to Perris and Hemet. SR-74 is mostly a
          two-lane roadway except the segment north of I-15 toward Riverside Street which has
          been widened to a four-lane divided roadway to accommodate the recent
          development in the area.
         Lake Street southerly from I-15 to Lakeshore Drive is a two-lane undivided roadway.
          South of Lakeshore Drive, it has been widened to a four-lane divided roadway. Lake
          Street is a major access road to northern areas of the City from I-15.
         Lakeshore Drive, a two-lane undivided roadway, is a major north/south route along
          the east side of the lake. Portions of Lakeshore Drive north of Riverside Drive and
          south of Lake Street have been widened adjacent to new development.
         Riverside Drive is a two-lane undivided roadway, which makes up a segment of SR-74
          along the north end of the lake. The portion of Riverside Drive south of Lincoln Street
          (adjacent to the new high school) has been widened to a four-lane roadway with a
          center left turn lane.
         Railroad Canyon Road northerly from I-15 is a major link between I-15 and I-215 east
          of the City of Lake Elsinore. Railroad Canyon Road is currently a four-lane divided
          roadway. Significant residential development is in progress along both sides of this
          roadway.

         Newport Road, which is an extension of Railroad Canyon Road east of the City of
          Canyon Lake, currently is a two-lane undivided roadway. Significant residential
          development is also in progress along both sides of this roadway.
         Mission Trail from Railroad Canyon Road to Palomar Street, mostly a four-lane
          undivided roadway, is an important route southerly from the commercial area at the
          Railroad Canyon Road interchange with I-15. Portions of the roadway in the vicinity
          of Bundy Canyon Road have been widened to a four-lane divided section roadway.
         Grand Avenue between Riverside Drive and Corydon Street is a two-lane undivided
          roadway. This north/south route is the only through roadway around the west side of
          the lake and provides an important connection to SR-74 from the area south of the
          lake.
Bikeways
The Bikeway Plan (Figure 2.5) contains four (4)
classifications and is aimed at integrating bicycle access
into a balanced multimodal transportation system for the
City. The four classifications on the Bikeway Plan include
the following:
Class I Bikeway
Bike paths or trails with a completely separated right-of-
way for the exclusive use of bicycles.
Class II Bikeway
Bike lanes that provide a restricted right-of-way for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of
bicycles with the permitting of vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross flows.
Class III Bikeway
Bike routes that provide a right-of-way designed by signs or permanent markings and are
shared with pedestrians or vehicles.
Multi-Purpose
Paths or trails available for joint bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian uses that may or may not be
separated or paved.

2.4.3       Circulation Classifications
Public Transportation Network
The Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) provides public bus service to the City. Currently, five bus
routes along several Lake Elsinore roadways provide alternative intra-City and regional
transportation options. Moreover, the Lake Elsinore Dial-a-Ride (DAR), operated by RTA,
serves seniors and persons with disabilities with advance-reservation designed to provide curb-
to-curb transportation.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Trails
The pedestrian network (Figure 2.6, Elsinore Area Trails System) consists of all the paved
sidewalks and trails in Lake Elsinore. Several local roadways in Lake Elsinore do not have
paved pedestrian facilities. In addition, some of the RTA bus stops are not accessible by paved
sidewalks, and transit riders must wait along the side of the road in unpaved areas.
The bikeway system encourages bicycling as an alternative mode of transportation, although
some terrain makes traversing the City via bicycle difficult. Existing and proposed routes of the
City bikeway system are divided into four classifications: Class I, II, III, and Multi-Purpose.
The Bikeway Plan (Figure 2.5) delineates an extensive, continuous network of bicycle routes,
with Class II bikeways as the principal provision for bicycle travel through the City. More
specifically, a Class I off-street bikeway is designated for Grand Avenue through the SOI. The
Class III bikeway along Main Street, Camino Del Norte, Summerhill Drive, and Ramsgate Drive
is delineated specifically to emphasize and facilitate the linkage of bicycle routes through the
major specific plan areas east of I-15 and the downtown area. The multi-purpose designation
reflects the City’s existing dedicated and proposed trail system (west end) available to
equestrian, pedestrian, and bicycle users. The existing segments are unpaved; future sections
may or may not be paved or separated depending upon design and use requirements.
Air Transportation
Sixteen (16) private and public-use airports are situated within the boundaries of Riverside
County. Of these, four public use airports are located within the generalized vicinity of the City
of Lake Elsinore, including Perris Valley, located approximately 11 miles from Lake Elsinore;
French Valley, located approximately 18 miles away in Temecula; Riverside Municipal Airport,
located in Riverside, approximately 20 miles away; and the Hemet-Ryan Airport,
approximately 22 miles from the City.
Air transportation systems located within the City and the surrounding region include public
use airports and carrier operations. Airports serving the City are tied into the regional air
transportation system and operate as an efficient and convenient transportation network.

Skylark Airport is located within the City of Lake Elsinore, in the vicinity of the southern
terminus of the lake. This airport provides glider and skydiving opportunities for the
community and surrounding region. The runway surface at Skylark Airport consists of gravel
and sand; as such, this surface generally does not permit optimal conditions for frequent and
convenient airport operations. Skylark Airport is a private use airport with runways that are
2800 feet in length and fall under the category of Short General Aviation Runways.
There are five (5) major commercial airports in Southern California used for passenger service,
including Palm Springs International Airport, Ontario International Airport (San Bernardino
County), Orange County–John Wayne Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and
Lindbergh Field (San Diego County). Of these, only Palm Springs International Airport, located
approximately 70 miles from the City, is located in Riverside County. In addition to the
regional air passenger airport facilities, the March Inland Port/Air Reserve Base is located along
I-215 in Riverside County, approximately 23 miles from the City. This airport provides regional
air cargo service and also continues to function as an Air Reserve Base military installation.
Park and Ride
The Riverside County Transportation Commission provides free “park and ride” sites to
encourage residents to carpool or take alternative forms of transportation. Several park and
ride lots exist within the City, including the Ortega Market, located at 15887 Grand Avenue;
Lake Elsinore Outlet Mall, located at Collier Street and Nichols; and the SR-74 park and ride lot
located at Dexter Street and SR 74.
Railroads
There are currently no railroad services within the City of Lake Elsinore or its SOI. However, in
the past, the Lake Elsinore branch of the Santa Fe Railroad provided rail service for the
immediate community as well as the surrounding region. The Lake Elsinore branch railways
were located to the north of Lake Elsinore. The dissolution of the Santa Fe Railroad, coupled
with continued growth of the City, resulted in removal of those railways and their associated
infrastructure. The City continues to be actively involved in establishing future commuter
railroad and high speed rail possibilities along the I-15 corridor through regional involvement
with WRCOG and SCAG.
Scenic Routes
Caltrans has identified I-15 and SR-74 as eligible state scenic highways, but neither one is
officially designated. Caltrans outlines an application process for official designation, which the
City has not pursued. The advantages of official designation are the ability to promote local
tourism in a manner that is consistent with the community’s scenic values, protect the scenic
values of an area, enhance community identity and pride, and enhance land values, thereby
making the area more attractive to investors.

Safe Routes to Schools
The State of California encourages a program called Safe Routes to School to encourage more
school children to walk or bike to school. Thirty years ago, 66% of children walked or biked to
school; now, the number has dropped to 13%. This has been attributed to parents’ perception
that crime and traffic have made roads unsafe, so they opt to drive their children to school
instead. To change this, various entities, including the California Department of Health
Services, California Highway Patrol, the Center for Livable Communities, the Surface
Transportation Policy Project, the California Bicycle Coalition, and the Rails to Trails
Conservancy, have been working with local officials, parents, law enforcement officers, and
traffic engineers to create Safe Routes to School programs and make streets safer for pedestrians
and bicycle riders on heavily used school routes.

Goal 6           Optimize the efficiency and safety of the transportation system
                 within the City of Lake Elsinore.
Policies
6.1 The interconnection and coordination of traffic signals shall be achieved through two
    processes, namely the requirements in the conditions of approval on development projects
    and/or through the implementation of Capital Improvement Program projects.
6.2 Enforce and comply with proper intersection “sight distance” requirements as described by
    the Engineering Division.
6.3 Maximize the use of shared driveways and on-site circulation to minimize conflicts at access
    points to the roadway network.
6.4 Maintain the system of bike lanes and multi use trails throughout the City. Encourage the
    implementation of the network of Class I, II, and III bike lanes on all development projects
    through construction of the facility as described in the Bike Lane Master Plan and/or the
    Trails Master Plan.
6.5 The City will monitor traffic and congestion on Grand Avenue and Corydon Street through
    the review of project-specific traffic studies, and apply mitigation measures to ensure that
    projected traffic does not exceed daily capacities as new development occurs in the area.
6.6 As appropriate, coordinate City improvements with the efforts of the County and adjacent
    cities that provide a circulation network which moves people and goods efficiently to and
    from the City.
Implementation Program          Through the development review and CEQA processes the City
    shall ensure the efficiency and safety of roadways, implement the Bike Lane Master Plan

2.5         Growth Management
2.5.1       Introduction
“Growth Management” is the process of directing the pattern and rate of development for the
benefit of quality of life and safety of residents, cost efficiency for the City, and sustainability of
resources and services. The growth management goal is to insure that public services do not lag
behind population growth and the concomitant demands created by a larger population.
Growth management is an important regional issue in Southern California since rapid
population growth has the potential to cumulatively affect the cities in the region. Rapid
population growth can result in stress on public services and infrastructure when the needs of
new development cannot be adequately served. The demands for public services and
infrastructure need to be anticipated in order to establish adequate services and infrastructure
at a rate that meets the rate of new construction.
The Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) covers a region consisting of six neighboring
counties: Orange, Riverside, Ventura, Los Angeles, San
Bernardino, and Imperial and encompasses a total of over
38,000 square miles with a Year 2005 population of 18.1
million. The region is projected to increase to 23.3 million
by 2030; adding 5.11 million people, 1.76 million
households, and 2.14 million jobs over the 2005-2030
forecast period. Population growth at an annual rate of
1.13% is projected to add about 204,345 people to the
region per year.                                                         Residential Construction
The City of Lake Elsinore, like any other urbanizing community, has the potential for major
impacts to public services and infrastructure with the anticipated increase in growth and
development. The adoption of comprehensive goals and policies can mitigate those impacts to
an extent that balances the competing demands for development, natural resource protection,
and adequacy of services and infrastructure. Achieving this balance increases the quality of life
and sustainability for the City and its residents and visitors.
Aside from ensuring sufficient public services and infrastructure, it is also important to achieve
an acceptable jobs-to-housing balance in the City. According to SCAG’s adopted 2008 Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) Growth Forecasts; in 2005 Riverside County had a jobs-to-housing
ratio of 1.06, and Lake Elsinore’s ratio was 0.89.
                                                 2-41

 Chapter 2.0
The goals and policies in this section are designed to provide the framework for a growth
management strategy that promotes and maximizes mobility, livability, prosperity, and
sustainability in the City. Decisions regarding growth, transportation, land use, and economic
development should be guided by these goals and policies.
2.5.2 Growth Management Goal, Policy and Implementation Program
Goal 7          Maintain orderly, efficient patterns of growth that enhance the
                quality of life for the residents of Lake Elsinore.
Policy
7.1 Encourage mixed-use developments to reduce public service costs and environmental
    impacts through compatible land use relationships, and efficient circulation and open space
    systems.
Implementation Program           As part of the project review and the CEQA processes, the City
      shall evaluate growth impacts from individual and cumulative projects to determine their
      effect on quality of life within the City.
Agency/Department                Community Development Department
2.6         Housing
The State of California requires all California communities to prepare a Housing Element every
five years. Housing element law, enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments adequately
plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
community. The law acknowledges that, in order for the private market to adequately address
housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory
systems which provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development.
The City of Lake Elsinore adopted its last Housing Element of the General Plan in 2002,
including the City’s housing goals, objectives, policies, and programs. In compliance with the
SCAG region timeline for revision of the City of Lake Elsinore Housing Element, an update has
been prepared for adoption along with the update to the General Plan for the planning period
of July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2014.
2.6.1 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
State Housing Element law requires that a city accommodate its fair share of the region’s
projected housing needs for the planning period. The Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) is the regional planning agency responsible for allocating the RHNA to
individual jurisdictions within the six-county region. This share, called the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA), identifies the numerical quantity of new housing, and thus the
                                                 2-42

                                                                                  Chapter 2.0
amount of land sufficient to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic
segments of the community.
The City of Lake Elsinore’s RHNA for the 2008-2014 planning period has been determined by
SCAG to be 5,590 housing units as follows:
                1,311 units     for very low-income households
                  921 units     for low-income households
                1,041 units     for moderate-income households
                2,316 units     for above moderate-income households
Perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of the Housing Element is that the mandatory
requirement does not necessarily mean that a city must develop or build the needed housing.
Instead, the city must ensure that there is opportunity for needed housing to be built and that
there are no constraints that prohibit construction. The General Plan Land Use Map and its
goals, policies and implementation programs provide such assurance.
The City of Lake Elsinore Housing Element and its goals, policies and programs are bound
separately.
2.7         Parks and Recreation
2.7.1       Introduction
Recreational opportunities are vital to the overall
well-being of a community.            Activities and
hobbies such as sports leagues, biking, walking,
and classes at a community center foster healthy
social and physical growth in children and
enhance social networks and the health of adults.
Because of varied interests in diverse populations
and the rising popularity of recreational activities
in general, demand for recreational opportunities
needs to be recognized and addressed.                              McVicker Canyon Park
The relationship of recreation to aspects of social, cultural, and economic benefits to the
community should be understood in the planning process for parks and recreational facilities
and programs. Historically, Lake Elsinore has been regarded as a recreational destination for
the Inland Empire partly because of the City’s natural resources such as the lake, mountains,
and rugged hillsides. These resources, combined with a rich array of recreational programs and
a diverse selection of facilities, have the potential to be a major source of economic growth for
the City.

opportunities necessary to create a recreational destination and foster community building for
the City of Lake Elsinore.
2.7.2 Parks and Recreation Baselines
Parks
There are sixteen (16) parks in the City of Lake Elsinore with thirteen (13) additional parks
slated for future development (Figure 2.8, Parks). Each park has a unique set of features, with a
variety of passive and active recreation. These features include fields for baseball, softball,
football, and soccer; play equipment; picnic areas; barbeque facilities; drinking fountains; tennis
courts; dog parks; and grass for passive recreation. A section of McVicker Park is devoted to
skateboarding and inline skating.
There are 3,000 sports league participants who use the sports fields throughout the City,
including nine local youth and adult sports leagues. Special events are sponsored by the City
Parks Department, Lake Community Center, and Senior Activity Center and include the Lake
Elsinore Children’s Fair, Kid’s Fishing Derby, July 4th Celebration, Music with a View Concerts,
Safe Candy Night, Unity in the Community Parade, and Winterfest.
The City of Lake Elsinore also offers a program called Volunteers in the Park (VIP), which is a
partnership with the Community Services and Parks/Open Space divisions and volunteers
from the community. Together, the participants clean up parks and open space areas on a
quarterly basis.
Further, the City of Lake Elsinore partners with the applicable school districts to allow joint use
of facilities where possible, such as active recreational ball fields, playgrounds, or outdoor
multi-use areas that can be shared.
Recreational Facilities
In addition to parks, the City of Lake Elsinore features and four recreational facilities including
the Lake Community Center, the Cultural Center, a Senior Activity Center and the Boys & Girls
Clubhouse at Alberhill Park. Three (3) additional recreational facilities are slated for future
development. These centers are very active and provide a large number of programs. There are
more than 40 recreational classes at the Lake Community Center ranging from art, gymnastics,
acting, dancing, and music, to martial arts and dog obedience. More than 1,000 people per
week currently use the Lake Community Center.

Lake Recreation
Like a gleaming jewel, the sparkling 3,000 acre Lake Elsinore is Southern California’s largest
natural lake. Exciting lake sports include boating, wakeboarding, parasailing, fishing, water
skiing, jet skiing, windsurfing, sunbathing, picnicking or playing on the beach. Beautiful tree-
shaded campgrounds and RV resorts surround the lake for overnight outdoor enthusiasts.
The spectacular Ortega Mountains and Cleveland National Forest nearby, with world famous
thermal winds and updrafts, create ideal conditions for more extreme sports such as skydiving,
hang-gliding, sailplanes and hot-air ballooning, that allow participants the freedom to soar or
float over the valley and lake.

high-quality public services.
3.2         Air Quality
3.2.1       Introduction
The major factors affecting local air pollution conditions in the Lake Elsinore planning area are
the extent and types of both region-wide and local emissions, climate, topography, and
meteorology. The combination of regional temperature inversions (the warm air mass that
descends over the cool marine layer, thus preventing pollution from dispersing upward and
creating smog), the Lake Elsinore Convergence Zone (a boundary created by coastal winds that
allows for the accumulation of air pollutants within the Lake Elsinore area), and the
contribution of any air pollutants from sources within the Lake Elsinore planning area has the
potential to significantly contribute to cumulative air quality conditions.
Existing air quality conditions in Lake Elsinore can be characterized in terms of the ambient air
quality standards that California and the federal government have established for several
different pollutants. The pollutants of greatest concern in the Lake Elsinore area are carbon
monoxide (CO), ozone, particulate matter smaller than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter
(PM2.5), and particulate matter smaller than or equal to 10 microns in diameter (PM10). Air
quality in the area does not meet state and federal health standards for ozone, PM2.5, and
PM10. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is responsible for
monitoring air quality and preparing attainment plans aimed at achieving state and federal air
pollution standards.
While emission control measures and alternative fuel vehicle purchasing requirements for
public agencies and certain private entities have been implemented by the SCAQMD, increased
development and segregated land use patterns that require motor vehicle trips threaten to offset
these gains.
Air quality is a regional issue and Lake Elsinore has a role in improving the region’s air quality.
The goals and policies in this section are designed to improve regional air quality.

3.2.2       Air Quality Baselines
Climate and Meteorology
Regional - Western Riverside County
Temperature inversions are the prime factor in the accumulation of contaminants in the Basin.
The mild climatological pattern is interrupted infrequently by periods of extremely hot weather,
winter storms, and Santa Ana winds. The topography and climate of Southern California
combine to create an area of high air pollution potential in the Basin. During the summer
months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist marine layer produced by
the interaction between the ocean’s surface and the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The warm
upper layer forms a cup over the cool marine layer, which prevents pollution from dispersing
upward. This inversion allows pollutants to accumulate within the lower layer. Light winds
during the summer further limit ventilation from occurring.
Due to the low average wind speeds in the summer and a persistent daytime temperature
inversion, emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen have an opportunity to combine
with sunlight in a complex series of reactions. These reactions produce a photochemical oxidant
commonly known as smog. Since the Basin experiences more days of sunlight than any other
major urban area in the United States, except Phoenix, the smog potential in the region is higher
than in most other areas of the nation.
Local - Lake Elsinore Planning Area
The major factors affecting local air pollution conditions in the Lake Elsinore planning area are
the extent and types of both region-wide and local emissions, climate, and meteorology. The
general climate of Lake Elsinore is characterized by sparse winter rainfall and hot summers
tempered by cool ocean breezes. The climate in and around Lake Elsinore, as well as most of
Southern California, is controlled largely by the strength and position of the subtropical high-
pressure cell over the Pacific Ocean. This high-pressure cell produces a typical Mediterranean
climate with warm summers, mild winters, and moderate rainfall. This pattern is infrequently
interrupted by periods of extremely hot weather brought in by Santa Ana winds. Most of the
area’s precipitation occurs intermittently between November and April; the area is still
dominated by sunny or partly sunny conditions during these months. Cyclic land and sea
breezes are the primary factors affecting the region’s mild climate. The daytime winds are
normally sea breezes, predominantly from the west, that flow at relatively low velocities.
Just south of Lake Elsinore, the Lake Elsinore Convergence Zone acts as an invisible boundary
that obstructs much of the inland basin air pollutants from continuing south beyond the Lake
Elsinore area. Coastal winds within the Lake Elsinore Convergence Zone are a primary factor
for the obstruction. They allow air pollutants to be dispersed just south of the convergence zone
and accumulate within the Lake Elsinore area, including surrounding communities to the north
and east.

Air Quality
Regional - South Coast Air Basin, including Western
Riverside County
As California’s largest metropolitan region, the Southern
California Air Basin (SCAB) contains some of the highest
air pollutant concentrations statewide. The SCAB includes
the western portion of Riverside County, including Lake
Elsinore. On-road motor vehicles in the SCAB are the
largest contributors to CO, oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and
reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions; other on-road and
off-road mobile emission sources are also significant
contributors to CO and NOX emissions. Area-wide and
stationary sources contribute to the remainder of air
pollutant emissions within the SCAB. While high growth
rates are often associated with corresponding increases in
emissions and pollutant concentrations, aggressive
emission control programs in the SCAB have resulted in          Distant View of Smog Obscuring
emission decreases and a continuing improvement in air                      Scenery
quality.
SCAQMD operates a network of thirty monitoring stations throughout the SCAB to effectively
monitor twenty-seven source receptor areas (SRA) of the expansive region. The SCAB relies on
one or more monitoring stations to document local air pollutant concentration levels within
each SRA. Concentration levels vary widely at each SRA depending on location and time of
year. The highest levels of ozone and particulate matter recorded in SRAs in the interior valleys
generally occur during warm, stable periods in summer and autumn. Recorded CO
concentrations are highest near heavy traffic on freeways or near large business districts.

3.3         Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The City of Lake Elsinore has some businesses
and activities that involve the transport, storage,
or use of toxic or hazardous materials.
Hazardous materials are defined as those that
pose a potential threat to human health, having
the capacity to cause serious illness or death. The
term “hazardous materials” includes radioactive
waste and explosives as well as substances such
as gasoline, pesticides, and household cleaning
products.
While the use of hazardous materials is carefully
regulated, the City seeks to reduce the potential
                                                                   Hazardous Materials
for injury or damage in the event of accidents or
spills. There are currently no active enforcement actions or violations relating to hazardous
materials in the City. The goals and policies in this section are intended to ensure that the
appropriate agencies are adequately prepared to deal with a hazardous material emergency and
that citizens are protected as much as possible from potential hazards.

                                                                                  Chapter 3.0
3.3.1        Hazardous Sites
There are large numbers of businesses and other entities within the City and the SOI that
generate, transport, store, treat, or dispose of hazardous waste as defined by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Action (RCRA). Since almost all fuels, lubricants, solvents, and
paints are considered hazardous materials under RCRA, businesses and institutions that use
substantial quantities of such materials are required to adhere to very strict requirements in
handling, transporting, and storing hazardous materials.
There is a wide range and variety of entities that deal with hazardous materials in the course of
their activities. As indicated above, these include but are not limited to:
                                      Automobile repair facilities
                                      Gas stations
                                      Automobile service facilities
                                      Construction firms
                                      Manufacturing firms
                                      Painting contractors and paint suppliers
                                      Dry cleaning firms
                                      Schools
                                      Hospitals and medical facilities
                                      Trucking firms.
The City of Lake Elsinore Fire Department provides oversight of hazardous materials and
regulates permits for the handling, storage, and use of any explosive or other hazardous
material. These permits note the location of the user as well as the type of material used. This
enables the City to be aware of locations where such uses occur and thus note areas where high
concentrations of such uses occur, such as in industrial and manufacturing areas. Hazardous
materials also occur in individual locations such as gas stations and dry cleaners.
3.3.2        Santa Ana Regional Interceptor
The Santa Ana Regional Interceptor (SARI) line is a regional brine line constructed to protect the
Santa Ana watershed from various saline wastes. The SARI line collects up to 30 million gallons
per day (MGD) of non-reclaimable wastewater from the upper Santa Ana River basin; after
treatment, it is discarded in the ocean. The purpose is to maintain the quality of water in the
Santa Ana watershed by balancing the amount of salt in the basin. Increased salt in the
watershed is caused mainly by industrial and agricultural uses and can affect all water users.
Increased salinity in the water creates problems ranging from decreased effectiveness of
                                                 3-5

 Chapter 3.0
laundry detergents to worn out plumbing fixtures and household appliances. It also affects the
taste of the water.
A brine line is necessary because industrial and commercial users are able to dispose only a
limited amount of saline waste into wastewater plants due to the difficulty of removing salts
and minerals from water. Users that produce a lot of saline waste can go through an
application process to make a connection to the SARI line; the Santa Ana Watershed Protection
Authority (SAWPA) establishes connection fees and monthly rates for using the SARI line.
Businesses that do not generate a substantial flow and are not close enough to make a direct
connection can haul the waste by truck to a SARI truck collection station. SAWPA has permit
fees and fees based upon volume for indirect connection users.
3.3.3       Hazards and Hazardous Materials Goal, Policies and
            Implementation Programs
Goal 3          Reduce the level of risk associated with the use, transport,
treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials to protect the
community’s safety, health, and natural resources.
Policies
3.1   Continue to require hazardous waste generators to implement a waste reduction program
      per the Riverside County Hazardous Waste Management Plan with necessary inspections
      per the Riverside County Hazardous Materials Handlers Program.
3.2   Require any proposed development within close proximity to an active and/or inactive
      landfill to complete a technical analysis that focuses on public safety and hazard issues.
      The analysis shall be prepared by a professional consultant.
3.3   Encourage the safe disposal of hazardous materials with County agencies to protect the
      City against a hazardous materials incident.
3.4   Continue operating household hazardous waste education and collection programs in
      collaboration with the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health.
3.5   Evaluate new development on or adjacent to the Santa Ana Regional Interceptor (SARI)
      line requiring extensive subsurface components or containing sensitive land uses such as
      schools on a project-by-project basis to determine impacts if an accident occurs.
Implementation Program         Through project review and the CEQA process the City shall
      assess new development and reuse applications for potential hazards, and shall require
      compliance with the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan and collaboration with
      its Department of Environmental Health.

3.4         Wildland Hazards
Much of the area to the southwest, west, and northwest within the SOI supports coastal shrub
and chamise redshank chaparral. These are prime fuel sources for wildfire. As shown in Figure
3.1, Wildfire Susceptibility, the wildfire susceptibility in this area is defined as moderately high.
The steep terrain in these areas also contributes to rapid spread of wildfire when one occurs.
The danger of damage to natural resources and structures from wildfire is high in California
due to a generally dry climate and a preponderance of highly flammable vegetation over much
of the state. From 1999 to 2003, wildfires within the jurisdiction of the California Department of
Forestry and Fire (CDF) averaged 6,081 fires per year and burned an average of 217,908 acres
per year. The number of structures damaged during that 5-year span averaged about 1,560 per
year. Average annual monetary damages are estimated to be about $275 million. In 2003 alone,
the damage from wildfires, which burned 527,753 acres within the CDF jurisdiction, was
estimated at about $950 million. As such, the City has adopted the High Fire Severity Zone Map
(Figure 3.1)
Wildfire susceptibility in the City of Lake Elsinore is defined as moderately high. The
combination of Southern California’s Mediterranean climate, with its winter and spring rainfall
and hot, dry summers, and the frequency of high wind velocity creates optimum conditions for
wildfires. The annual rainfall pattern supports grasses, shrubs, and trees, and the hot arid
summers result in dry vegetation. This readily combustible material can be easily ignited and
will burn hot and fast, especially during high wind conditions. In fact, Southern California
fires, which consumed more than 90% of the wildfire-burned acreage, were accompanied by
high-velocity winds.
The City of Lake Elsinore and the SOI are known for periodic high-velocity wind conditions
through the Temescal Valley and the steep canyons to the northwest, west, and southwest
portions of the SOI. Such winds are due mostly to the area’s topography, which forms a natural
wind tunnel along the valley and through the canyons. The area is also subject to occasional
Santa Ana conditions.

Past fire management policy mandated immediate fire suppression action for all fires, including
those in wilderness areas, but also led to a long-term accumulation of vegetation (fuel) that can
be easily ignited. Fire can spread quickly in high
wind conditions, which poses a significant hazard
in many areas, especially in forested and chaparral
areas of rural Southern California. Much of the
areas in the Cleveland National Forest and along
the Ortega Highway (SR-74) contain large areas of
chaparral and oak/pinyon plant communities that
are highly flammable in the summer dry season
and can promote the spread of wildfires over large
distances, especially during high wind conditions.
Chaparral in particular poses unique problems for
fire prevention because its components (tough
shrubs such as chemise, manzanita, and sage) are
genetically predisposed to burn. Many of the                   Country Club Heights Fire
plants in this community need fire to sprout their
seeds; chaparral burns naturally every 30 to 100 years. Much of the area within the SOI
supports this type of vegetation.
The heavy use of the Ortega Highway and the residences in the mountains pose additional fire
risks. Traffic provides a potential ignition source because of tossed cigarettes and vehicle fires;
residences provide other potential ignition sources, such as power equipment, barbeques, and
residential fires.
3.4.1       Wildfire Hazards Goal, Policies and Implementation Program
Goal 4          Adhere to an integrated approach to minimizing the threat of
wildland fires to protect life and property using pre-fire management,
suppression, and post-fire management.
Policies
4.1   Require on-going brush clearance and establish low fuel landscaping policies to reduce
      combustible vegetation along the urban/wildland interface boundary.
4.2   Create fuel modification zones around development within high hazard areas by thinning
      or clearing combustible vegetation within 100 feet of buildings and structures. The fuel
      modification zone size may be altered with the addition of fuel resistant building
      techniques. The fuel modification zone may be replanted with fire-resistant material for
      aesthetics and erosion control.
4.3   Establish fire resistant building techniques for new development such as non-combustible
      wall surfacing materials, fire-retardant treated wood, heavy timber construction, glazing,
                                                3-11
 Chapter 3.0
      enclosed materials and features, insulation without paper-facing, and automatic fire
      sprinklers.
4.4   Encourage programs that educate citizens about the threat of human wildfire origination
      from residential practices such as outdoor barbeques and from highway use such as
      cigarette littering.
Implementation Program         The City shall condition project to comply with Fire Department
      requirements, and work with the California Department of Forestry and the County Fire
      Department supporting public fire education and prevention programs.

3.5         Flooding and Floodplains
Development in the 100-year floodplain can increase flooding hazards by raising water levels
upstream and adding flow, velocity, and debris downstream. Floodplains are the low, flat,
periodically flooded lands adjacent to rivers, lakes, and oceans inundated by the 100-year flood
and composed of the floodway and the floodway fringe. The floodway is the channel of a river
or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
100-year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
The floodway fringe is that portion of the floodplain between the floodway and the limits of the
existing 100-year floodplain.
Significant portions of the City and the SOI are located within the 100-year floodplain. The City
of Lake Elsinore has identified flooding sources within the City that include Arroyo del Toro,
Channel H, Elsinore Spillway Channel, Lake Elsinore, Leach Canyon Channel, Lime Street
Channel, McVicker Canyon, Ortega Wash, Ortega Channel, Rice Canyon, San Jacinto River,
Stovepipe Canyon Creek, Temescal Wash, Wash
G, Wash I, Murrieta Creek, Wasson Canyon
Creek, and potentially Railroad Canyon Dam if
the incidence of failure occurs.
The City places a high priority on preventing
flood damage and requires new projects to
consider flooding and storm drainage effects.
Limited encroachment into the 100-year
floodplain fringe is allowed in order to permit
development of properties within this area.
However, encroachment shall maintain a focus on
                                                              Flooding in Lake Elsinore 1988
public facilities such as roads, parks, sewer and
water improvements, and pedestrian routes. No development of the floodway is allowed. The

City will review development projects within the floodplain to ensure compliance with City,
state, and federal floodplain development projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) often have jurisdiction over
areas that are located within floodplains.
USACE, through the authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, is the primary agency
involved in wetland regulation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the authority
to veto any decision by the USACE on Section 404-permit issuance because the EPA has the
ultimate authority over enforcement of wetland regulations. Prior to the issuance of a Section
404 permit by the USACE, the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) must issue a
Section 401 water quality certification or waiver. In this way, the RWQCB regulates actions
permitted by the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). In addition, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) must be consulted and may also take jurisdiction if any
wetland impacts could affect federally endangered species.
The USACE has jurisdiction over “waters of the U.S.,” including wetlands as defined by Section
404 of the Clean Water Act. Not all waters of the U.S. are wetlands and not all wetlands are
under USACE jurisdiction. The term “waters of the U.S.” covers many types of waters,
including waters currently or historically used in interstate or foreign commerce (including all
waters subject to the ebb and flow of tides); all interstate waters (including interstate wetlands);
all other waters, such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams),
mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, etc., the use, degradation, or destruction of which could
affect interstate or foreign commerce; all impoundments of waters otherwise defined as waters
of the U.S.; tributaries of waters of the U.S.; territorial seas; and wetlands adjacent to waters of
the U.S. Regulated waters of the U.S. do not include isolated waters. However, isolated waters
may be regulated by the RWQCB and the CDFG under the Porter-Cologne Act and the
California Fish and Game Code, respectively.
The CDFG has jurisdiction covering lakes, rivers, and streams. Jurisdiction extends across the
bed, banks, and channel of these features and includes areas beneath a riparian canopy, even if
the canopy areas are well away from the stream channel (such as in oak riparian areas). More
typically, the jurisdiction over streambeds is applied from the top of one channel bank to the
top of the opposite bank.
Regional flood control planning and facilities construction are within the jurisdiction of the
Riverside County Flood Control District. The district is also responsible for the maintenance
and operation of flood control facilities, including debris dams, storm channels, and storm
drains. The City of Lake Elsinore owns and maintains certain flood control facilities in the City
that are constructed generally as part of the drainage plans for individual projects.

Goal 5          Minimize risk of injury to residents and visitors, and
property damage due to flooding.
Policies
5.1   Continue to ensure that new construction in
      floodways and floodplains conforms to all
      applicable provisions of the National Flood
      Insurance Program in order to protect buildings
      and property from flooding.
5.2   Utilize the Capital Improvement Program for
      storm drainage projects and maintenance and
      improvement of local storm drain systems
      including channels, pipes, and inlets to ensure
      capacity for maximum runoff flows.
Implementation Program         Through the project review and the CEQA processes the City shall
      assess new development and reuse applications for potential flood hazards, and shall
      require compliance with FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas where appropriate.

3.6         Seismic Activity
The City of Lake Elsinore and SOI are located in the Elsinore Valley, a pull-apart depression
formed at a right (releasing) step-over in the Elsinore fault system. The Elsinore fault consists of
multiple strands, a number of which are recognized as active and zoned by the State of
California under the Alquist-Priolo Act. Risk of surface rupture along these zoned active traces
is substantial. Although the County has zoned additional faults as active, none of the County-
zoned traces is in the immediate vicinity of the City or SOI.
The Uniform Building Code recognizes the northern portion of the Elsinore fault as a Type B
seismic source (International Council of Building Officials 1997). The Elsinore fault is believed
to be capable of generating earthquakes with moment magnitudes in the range of 6.5–7.5, with a
recurrence interval of approximately 250 years between major events. Smaller events may
occur more frequently. Thus, the City and the SOI are likely to experience repeated moderate to
strong ground shaking generated by the Elsinore fault in the foreseeable future. The City and
surroundings also have the potential to experience significant ground shaking as a result of
seismic activity on a number of the Peninsular Ranges’ other active faults, shown in Figure 3.2,
                                                3-14

                                                                                  Chapter 3.0

Near Lake Elsinore, and Figure 3.3, Seismic Hazards.
Although the State of California has not yet issued seismic hazards maps for the Lake Elsinore
area, when completed, these maps will be required to delineate areas at risk from secondary
seismic hazards. Both the County General Plan and the Elsinore Area Plan delineate areas
susceptible to secondary seismic hazards. The City has high potential for damage due to
liquefaction and slope failure in some areas.
The City recognizes the importance of addressing seismic hazards and taking preventative
measures to reduce their negative effects. The following goals and policies are intended to
minimize the effects of any seismic events on citizens and property.
3.6.1       Secondary Seismic Hazards—Liquefaction and Ground Failure
The State of California has not yet issued seismic hazards maps for the Lake Elsinore area under
the mapping program mandated by the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act. Mapping is in progress
in the Murrieta and Temecula 7.5-minute quadrangles to the south and is planned for the Lake
Elsinore and Wildomar quadrangles in coming years.
The City recognizes the importance of addressing secondary seismic hazards, and has
delineated areas of known and suspected liquefaction hazard. In general, liquefaction
susceptibility ranges from very low in the former lake footprint to moderate on much of the
remainder of the valley floor and very high in the valley floor corridor formerly occupied by the
axial riverine drainage. Liquefaction potential is also very high along the area’s principal
tributary drainages and on portions of the alluvial fans on the valley’s eastern margin. Figure
3.4, Liquefaction Susceptibility in Lake Elsinore Area, presents a generalized map of
liquefaction potential based on data on file with the City.
3.6.2       Landslide and Other Slope Stability Hazards
As discussed in the previous section, the State of California has not yet issued seismic hazards
maps for the Lake Elsinore Area; when completed, these maps will be required to delineate
areas at risk from seismically induced landslides. In the meantime, as shown in Figure 3.5,
Percent Slope, a substantial proportion of the City, SOI, and surrounding area are located on
slopes of 25%–35% or steeper, and much of the area is at substantial risk of seismically induced
slope failure. Non-seismically induced slope failure is also a hazard in these areas, as evidenced
by numerous existing landslides.

Goal 6         Minimize the rise of loss of life, injury, property damage, and
economic and social displacement due to seismic and geological hazards
resulting from earthquakes and geological constraints.
Policies
6.1   Encourage the pursuit of federal and state programs that assist in the seismic upgrading of
      buildings to meet building and safety codes.
6.2   Continue to require Alquist-Priolo and other seismic analyses be conducted for new
      development to identify the potential for ground shaking, liquefaction, slope failure,
      seismically induced landslides, expansion and settlement of soils, and other related
      geologic hazards for areas of new development in accordance with the Fault Rupture
      Hazard Overlay District adopted by the City of Lake Elsinore Zoning Code. The City may
      require site-specific remediation measures during permit review that may be
      implemented to minimize impacts in these areas.
Implementation Program        Through project review and the CEQA processes the City shall
      assess new development and reuse applications for potential hazards, and shall require
      compliance with Alquist-Priolo and other guidelines where appropriate.

3.7         Noise
3.7.1       Introduction
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. It is part
of everyday life in an urban community,
resulting from on- and off-road vehicle traffic,
railroads, aircraft, construction vehicles and
other heavy equipment, other commercial
activities, and loud music.        The existing
background or “ambient” noise level in the
community is the product of the cumulative
effects of a variety of noise sources that
accumulate over a period of time. Exposure to
excessive noise has often been cited as a health             Activities at Lake Elsinore
hazard.
                                              3-25

 Chapter 3.0
Roadway traffic is a major source of noise within the City. Some other reported noise sources in
Lake Elsinore include industrial and manufacturing facilities, Skylark Airport, schools,
construction activities, and recreational activities associated with the lake, the motocross park,
and Diamond Stadium.
The goals and policies in this section are designed to locate new development in areas with
compatible noise levels and minimize intrusive noise from existing and new development.
3.7.2        Noise Baselines
Land uses in the Lake Elsinore planning area include varying densities of both clustered and
non-contiguous residential development, different densities and types of businesses and
commercial developments, open space, and recreation. The locations and densities of these
land uses, in conjunction with major transportation routes and other significant activities within
the Lake Elsinore area, such as construction, contribute to the ambient noise conditions, or
setting, of the area.
Sensitive land uses are generally defined as locations where people reside or where the
presence of noise could adversely affect the use of the land. These land uses include uses such
as schools, hospitals, residences, libraries, and recreation areas. The City has designated noise-
sensitive zones for land uses that require exceptional quiet. Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 provide
regulations to ensure noise and land use compatibility and recommend noise standards.

Topography and Climate
Noise amplitude and attenuation characteristics are key factors in the establishment of noise
conditions and vary considerably according to natural climate and topographical features.
Meteorological factors affecting noise characteristics within the Lake Elsinore planning area
include temperature changes, Santa Ana winds, and the amount and duration of rainfall.
Topographical features in the planning area include the steep Santa Ana Mountains and
Elsinore Mountains to the south and west; the large centrally located, low-lying Lake Elsinore
and surrounding local valley; and the rolling hills throughout much of the area. Man-made
features within the planning area, such as buildings and structures, agricultural fields, and
roadways, also affect noise amplitude and attenuation.
Vehicular Traffic
Because two highly utilized transportation corridors, I-15 and SR 74, traverse the City, roadway
traffic is one of the more prevalent sources of noise within the area. Traffic noise varies in how it
affects land uses depending upon the type of roadway, distance of the land use from that
roadway, topographical setting, and other physical land features such as landscaping, walls,
buildings, and other structures. Some variables that affect the amount of noise emitted from a
                                                     3-28

                                                                                      Chapter 3.0
road are speed of traffic, flow of traffic, and type of traffic (e.g., tractor trailers versus cars).
Another variable affecting the overall measure of noise is a perceived increase in sensitivity to
vehicular noise at night.
Industry
Industrial and manufacturing facilities are stationary noise producers that may affect sensitive
land uses. Industrial land uses have the potential to exert a relatively high level of noise impact
within their immediate operating environments. The scope and degree of noise impacts
generated by industrial uses is dependent upon various critical factors, including the type of
industrial activity, hours of operation, and the site’s location relative to other land uses.
Noise-related complaints are often aimed at facilities such as Elsinore Ready-Mix, a concrete
manufacturer located in Country Club Heights. Other noise complaints usually come from
neighbors who live next to land that is under-developed.
Airports
Skylark Airport is a privately owned airport that occupies approximately 150 acres of land
located at the southern city limits on Corydon Road. In 2010, the airport housed 21 single-
engine aircraft, five multi-engine aircraft, and four gliders. This airport provides glider and
skydiving opportunities for the community and surrounding region. The runway surface at
Skylark Airport consists of gravel and sand; as such, this surface generally does not permit
optimal conditions for frequent and convenient airport operations. Skylark Airport is a private
use airport with runways that are 2800 feet in length and fall under the category of Short
General Aviation Runways.
Schools
Schools can be a source of nuisance noise for neighboring residential uses. Noise-generating
activities include children at play, bells, and public address systems. High schools may include
stadiums used for day and evening athletic events, and the use of public address/loudspeaker
systems can also generate substantial noise levels during the day and/or evening.

 Chapter 3.0
Other Noise Sources
Other sources of noise include recreational
boating and personal watercraft on Lake
Elsinore, the Motocross Park, Diamond
Stadium, and construction activities.
Vibration
As with noise, vibration can be described by
both its amplitude and frequency. Amplitude
may be characterized by displacement, velocity,
                                                              Lake Elsinore Motocross Track
and/or acceleration. Typically, particle velocity
(measured in inches or millimeters per second) and/or acceleration (measured in gravities) are
used to describe vibration. Vibration can be felt outdoors, but the perceived intensity of
vibration impacts are much greater indoors due to the shaking of the structure.
The most common sources of vibration in the Lake Elsinore planning area are transit vehicles,
construction equipment, and large vehicles. Several land uses are especially sensitive to
vibration and therefore have a lower vibration threshold. These uses include but are not limited
to concert halls, hospitals, libraries, vibration-sensitive research operations, residential areas,
schools, and offices.

Agency/Department              Community Develop and Engineering Departments
3.8         Community Facilities and Protection Services
City development and community welfare are dependent on a network of public facilities,
infrastructure and services. These availability services provide the necessary components for
quality life in the community. Quality services and facilities are critical to retaining existing
households and businesses and attracting future residents and new businesses. The City seeks
to ensure excellent services regardless of the provider.
The goals and policies in this section are designed to promote community welfare and to
enhance the overall well being of the City’s residents and visitors through responsive city
government, efficient and timely emergency response, academic excellence that includes access
to quality school and library facilities for all residents, and effective and efficient delivery of
services and utilities.
3.8.1       Fire and Police/Law Enforcement Baselines
Effective fire protection and law enforcement services are essential to the welfare of a
community. Without adequate provision of these invaluable services, the safety of the
community could be jeopardized with the rise in crime and risk of fire damage. Long-term
effects could result in a decrease in immigration of new residents and a low quality of life for
current residents. The following goals and policies are intended to ensure that the community
that the City remains safe and protected by fire and police services.
Fire Protection
The City of Lake Elsinore contracts for fire services from the
Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) and the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
(CDF). The RCFD operates 93 fire stations in 17 battalions,
providing fire suppression, emergency medical, rescue, and
fire prevention services. Equipment used by the department
has the ability to respond to both urban and wildland
emergency conditions. Battalion 2 in the Southwest Division
                                                3-33

 Chapter 3.0
of RCFD services the City of Lake Elsinore.
The following stations are located within city limits:
         Fire Station No. 10, servicing the central area of the city, located on the northeast side
          of the lake at 410 W. Graham Ave;
         Fire Station No. 85, McVicker Park Fire Station, located to the north at McVicker Park,
          slightly east of the lake at 29405 Grand Avenue;
         Canyon Hills Fire Station No. 94, located in the southeast section of the City, at 21775
          Railroad Canyon Road, east of the I-15.
         Rosetta Canyon Fire Station No. 97 (unmanned), located in the north section of the
          City on Rosetta Canyon Drive.
The following stations are located outside city limits:
         Lakeland Village Station No. 11,
         El Cariso Station No. 51,
         Wildomar Station No. 61,
         Wildomar Station No. 74, and
         Canyon Lake Station No. 60.
Although the fire stations are operated by RCFD, CDF staffs firefighters and stores firefighting
equipment at stations throughout the City, particularly during peak fire season. Both agencies
respond to all types of emergencies, depending on the need and equipment available.
Emergencies range from wildland fires, residential/commercial structure fires, automobile
accidents, medical aid of all types, search and rescue missions, hazardous material spills, floods,
earthquakes, and more. Standard response times are established by RCFD guidelines. One goal
in the guidelines calls for the response time to any location within the City to be seven (7)
minutes, with the intent to reduce that time to five (5) minutes.
Since October 2003, fire paramedics are required at each station. These specially trained
firefighters are equipped to respond to medical emergencies and ride on all calls. Their arrival
on the scene can ensure the timely start of emergency medical treatment until an ambulance
arrives for patient transport. Each fire engine carries nearly $35,000 worth of state-of-the-art
emergency medic equipment.

Police Protection
The City of Lake Elsinore contracts for police protection from
the County of Riverside Sheriff’s Department. The Lake
Elsinore Police Department/Sheriff’s Station is located on the
northeast edge of the lake at 333 Limited Avenue. The police
department has various programs in place to deter crime, such
as neighborhood watch, Crime-Free Multi-Housing program,
and community-oriented policing. The police and fire stations
are depicted in Figure 3.7, Police and Fire Stations.
For Fiscal Year (FY) 2011/2012, the total number of sworn officers serving the City is 43.6,
which equates to a ratio of 0.85 sworn officer per 1,000 residents. Average response times for
City police protection vary due to the differing priorities of each call received by 911 and
dispatched to officers. During FY 2010/2011, the average response times for priority one calls
was 6.98 minutes, for priority two calls, 16.33 minutes, for priority three calls, 36.91 minutes,
and for priority four calls, 56.72 minutes.
The Police Department manages the Lake Patrol with Marine Safety trained Police Officers who
patrol the lake, beaches and lake-adjacent parks and enforce boating rules and regulations on
the lake and assist stranded boaters. The Lake Patrol is also augmented by a special group of
volunteers known as Lake Elsinore Marine Search and Rescue (LEMSAR). The LEMSAR
volunteers patrol the lake and assist with boating collisions and stranded vessels on the lake
and augment the Lake Patrol. LEMSAR volunteers are trained in first aid and CPR and must
also complete a U.S. Coast Guard auxiliary boating and safety course. The Police Department
also utilizes Reserve Police Officers. These volunteers are fully trained as police officers and
offer an additional level of service and cost savings to the city of Lake Elsinore.
3.8.2       Fire and Police/Law Enforcement Goal, Policies and
            Implementation Program
Goal 8          Provide efficient and effective public safety services for the
                community.
8.1     Continue to follow Riverside County Fire Department most current guidelines to
        achieve standard response times and staffing levels.
8.2     Coordinate with the County of Riverside to provide adequate police service and staffing
        levels.
8.3     Continue to provide Lake Patrol personnel who enforce boating rules and regulations,
        and perform rescue tactics.

The Lake Elsinore Unified School District (LEUSD) serves most of the City of Lake Elsinore, all
of the City of Canyon Lake, all of the City of Wildomar and a portion of the unincorporated
County of Riverside. The district covers a 140-square-mile area with a population of
approximately 70,000. It is the largest employer in the Lake Elsinore Valley, with more than
1,955 full- and part-time employees. District boundaries are identified on Figure 3.8, Schools
and District Boundaries. Menifee Union School District serves a portion of Canyon Hills
Specific Plan area.
The LEUSD is composed of 25 schools, including 12 elementary, two K-8 schools, four middle,
three comprehensive high schools, a continuation school, and two alternative education schools.
The district also has a K-12 virtual school and an adult education program. The district also
provides Head Start programs at four school sites.
The District is in the process of updating its Facilities Master Plan. The District has experienced
a slight growth in enrollment since 2005. The enrollment for 2010/2011 is 20,658 K-12 students.
The District has recently closed two elementary schools and converted an elementary and
middle school into K-8 programs. The decline in the economy and the loss of new housing
construction has slowed down the need for new schools. However, there continues to be a need
to expand and modernize current facilities to accommodate changing technology and additional
enrollment. According to the 2011 enrollment projections and current housing market
conditions the District expects only a slight increase in enrollment district wide over the next
ten years. However, it is difficult to predict the future housing market, so the assumptions are
made that minimal housing development will occur over the next ten years. When the housing
market picks up again, the District will be ready for the surge of growth. The District currently
owns property in the Wasson Canyon area and has several school sites in various planning
stages in the Alberhill and Summerly Developments.
There are two portions of the City of Lake Elsinore that are not within the LEUSD. In the center
of the northern part of the City, a small section falls within the Perris Elementary and Union
High School District; on the eastern edge of the City, a small section falls within the Menifee
Union School District. There is one portion within the northwest corner of the City’s SOI that is
not in the LEUSD. This small portion of the SOI falls within the Corona-Norco Unified School
District. Figure 3.8 shows the location of the school districts within the City and SOI.

Water, Wastewater, and Reclaimed Water
The Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District (EVMWD) is a public nonprofit agency. It was
created on December 23, 1950, under the Municipal Water District Act of 1911. EVMWD
provides water, wastewater, and reclaimed water service to the City of Lake Elsinore, the City
of Canyon Lake, the City of Wildomar, portions of the City of Murrieta, and unincorporated
portions of the County of Riverside. EVMWD is a special district with powers that include
provision of public water service, water supply development and planning, wastewater
treatment and disposal, and recycling. Currently, the district has more than 35,000 water,
wastewater, and agricultural service connections. EVMWD is a subagency of the Western
Municipal Water District, a member agency of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California.
EVMWD obtains its potable water supplies from imported water from Metropolitan, local
surface water from Canyon Lake, and local groundwater from the Elsinore Basin. It has access
to groundwater from Elsinore Basin, Coldwater Basin, San Bernardino Bunker Hill Basin,
                                             3-44

Rialto- Colton and Riverside-North Basin. Almost all of the groundwater production that is
used for potable use occurs in the Elsinore Basin. Imported water supply is purchased from the
Metropolitan via Eastern Municipal Water District and Western Municipal Water District.
EVMWD’s service area is broken into two divisions, the Elsinore Division and the Temescal
Division (also known as Temescal Domestic Service Area). The division between the two valleys
is approximately two miles north of Lake Elsinore, near the intersection of Love Lane and
Temescal Canyon Road (where the Temescal Wash flows north). The water system currently
includes 33 pressure zones. Within these zones, there are approximately 3,063,000 feet (580
miles) of pipelines ranging in diameter from 3 inches to 42 inches, 67 storage reservoirs with an
approximate total storage capacity of 83 million gallons (MG) and 46 booster pump stations.
The District currently obtains its water from 13 groundwater wells, the Canyon Lake Water
Treatment Plant (WTP), and imported water from Metropolitan through the Auld Valley and
Temescal Valley Pipelines.
EVMWD’s existing recycled water demands are supplied by tertiary-treated wastewater from
the Regional WRF, Railroad Canyon WRF, and Horsethief WRF. In the effort to minimize the
need for imported water, EVMWD plans to expand its recycled water system to provide
recycled water for irrigation users and to maintain water levels in Lake Elsinore during normal
and dry years.
The EVMWD Water Distribution Master Plan from February 2008 has a projected need
assessment based on future growth projections. Water demands for future scenarios are
determined based on water duty factor (WDF) and future projected growth. If growth occurs at a
different pace than expected, it is acknowledged that improvements may need to be implemented
so that water will be continuously available.
To meet rising future demands additional water source capacities are also required. The district is
currently planning two groundwater wells in the Lake Elsinore Back Basin. Improvements to fix
existing system deficiencies and accommodate future growth are being funded by three different
categories, including ratepayers for existing services, future Capital Improvement Programs
(CIP), and developers for future development projects.
The EVMWD Sewer District provides service for the City of Lake Elsinore, the City of Canyon
Lake, the City of Wildomar, portions of the City of Murrieta, and unincorporated portions of the
County of Riverside. The “backbone” of the system consists of trunk sewers, generally 10
inches in diameter and larger, that convey the collected wastewater to EVMWD’s Water
Reclamation Facilities (WRFs). EVMWD’s existing wastewater collection systems consist of
approximately 358 miles of sewer mains up to 54 inches in diameter, 33 lift stations and three
WRFs.
EVMWD’s current service area is delineated into four separate collection systems. These are the
Regional, Canyon Lake, Horsethief, and Southern collection systems. The flows conveyed in the
Regional, Canyon Lake, and Horsethief collection systems are treated by EVMWD’s Regional,
                                               3-45

Railroad Canyon, and Horsethief WRFs, respectively. Whereas wastewater discharged into the
Southern collection system is conveyed through the Rancho California Water District’s
(RCWD’s) wastewater collection system to the RCWD operated Santa Rosa WRF for treatment.
It should be noted that future wastewater flows generated within the Horsethief collection
system will be routed to the planned Alberhill WRF for treatment.
EVMWD also produces recycled water. Recycled water is used to
irrigate parks, street medians, golf courses, and wildlife habitat and
facilitate lake stabilization. It is the goal of EVMWD to build
additional lines and expand recycled water services in order to free
up additional water for residents.
Prior to July 2011, the Elsinore Water District (EWD) provided
water services for a limited area in Country Club Heights and parts
of Lakeland Village. The EWD did not provide wastewater
services. Water resources for the EWD included several local wells
as well as purchases from EVMWD. EWD supplied water to more than 1,800 customers.
However, a consolidation of EWD into EVMWD was finalized by the Riverside Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO) and took effect July 1, 2011. Additional water lines will have
to be constructed if additional development is anticipated within the area formerly served by
EWD.
Electrical and Natural Gas
Southern California Edison (SCE), a subsidiary of Edison International, provides electricity to
the City of Lake Elsinore. SCE is a provider for 13 million customers, 5,000 large businesses,
and 280,000 small businesses in 430 cities. SCE provides a significant amount of energy from
alternate and renewable energy and from a variety of other sources. There are 16 utility
interconnections, 4,990 transmission and distribution circuits, and 425 transmission and
distribution crews.
The City of Lake Elsinore receives its natural gas through the Southern California Gas Company
(The Gas Company). The Gas Company is a regulated subsidiary of Sempra Energy and is the
nation’s largest natural gas distribution utility, serving 19.5 million consumers through 5.5
million meters. The company's service territory encompasses 23,000 square miles in most of
central and Southern California.
Both Southern California Edison and The Gas Company anticipate the ability to accommodate
future growth within the City of Lake Elsinore; development proposals will be required to
formally request “will serve” letters on an individual basis.

Lake Elsinore Advanced Pump Storage (LEAPS)
EVMWD, in conjunction with the Nevada Hydro Company, is proposing the Lake Elsinore
Advance Pump Storage Project (LEAPS) and the related Talega-Escondido/Valley-Serrano
(TE/VS) Transmission Line Project. LEAPS consist of a lower and upper reservoir and a
hydroelectric plan to generate electricity. The Lake serves as the “lower reservoir.” When
demand for electricity is low, water is pumped to the upper reservoir in the Cleveland National
Forest where it is stored for release to generate electricity during peak demand periods. The
project is expected to generate enough electricity to power 500,000 homes. EVMWD is currently
seeking the necessary regulatory entitlements.
The project is dependent on adequate water supplies in the Lake. Therefore, according to
EVMWD, the primary benefit of the LEAPS project to the Lake will be the stabilization of the
Lake level at elevation 1240 MSL. The daily water pumping will affect Lake water quality and
potentially impact habitat areas and recreational use on the Lake as the shoreline will be subject
to significant variation on a day-to-day basis.

3.8.11      Trash and Recycling Baseline
CR&R is responsible for trash disposal in the City of Lake Elsinore as well as Temecula, Canyon
Lake, and unincorporated parts of the County of Riverside. Residents are provided three
separate 60-gallon containers for garbage, green waste, and recycling. Trash is taken to either a
landfill within Riverside County or the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF). There are no
landfills within the City. Riverside County Waste Management (RCWM) manages the landfills
used by the City of Lake Elsinore. According to RCWM, capacity levels of landfills within the
jurisdiction of RCWM are calculated on a system wide capacity level. That is to say that landfills
within its jurisdiction adhere to state guidelines, which specify that a minimum of 15 years of
system wide landfill capacity shall be provided.
RCWM facilitates waste management services for Riverside County. These services are
provided on a countywide basis, and each private or public entity determines which landfill or
transfer station to use. Typically, this determination is made according to geographic
proximity. The landfills typically used by the City of Lake Elsinore are the El Sobrante,
Badlands, and Lamb Canyon Landfills.
The El Sobrante Landfill is located east of Interstate 15 and Temescal Canyon Road to the south
of the City of Corona. The El Sobrante Landfill is currently permitted to receive a maximum of
70,000 tons of refuse per 7-day week, with a daily tonnage that shall not exceed 16,054 tons of
refuse per day (tpd), of which up to 5,000 tpd is reserved for refuse generated within Riverside
County. The landfill has a total capacity of approximately 184 million tons, or 209.91 million
cubic yards. As of end of 2010, the landfill had a remaining in-county disposal capacity of
approximately 44.313 million tons. The landfill is expected to reach capacity by approximately
2045.
The Badlands Landfill is located northeast of the City of Moreno Valley at 31125 Ironwood
Avenue, which is accessed from State Highway 60 at Theodore Avenue. The landfill is
currently permitted to receive 4,000 tpd; it had an overall remaining disposal capacity of
approximately 8,987,467 tons at the end of 2010. The Badlands Landfill is projected to reach
capacity in approximately 2024. Further landfill expansion potential exists at the Badlands
Landfill site.
The Lamb Canyon Landfill is located between the City of Beaumont and the City of San Jacinto.
The landfill is currently permitted to receive 5,000 tpd; it had a remaining disposal capacity of
approximately 6,647,603 tons at the end of 2010. The current remaining disposal capacity is
estimated to last until approximately 2021. Landfill expansion potential exists at the Lamb
Canyon Landfill site.
As mandated by the State of California, 50% of Lake Elsinore’s trash had to be recycled by
December 31, 2005. Due to the extensive amount of new homebuilding in the area leading to
excessive construction waste, the City of Lake Elsinore has been granted an extension to comply
with the law.

Franklin Heald then purchased Rancho La Laguna and founded the town of Elsinore in 1883,
which was named after the famous lake side City of Helsingnor from Shakespeare’s Hamlet.
With the construction of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railroad and the discovery of
mineral ores in the late 19th century, immigration began to increase significantly to the lake
area. Many people also visited the newly created town of Elsinore looking for recreational
opportunities, which helped to stimulate its tourist industry. In 1972, by popular vote, the area
incorporated and officially became known as the City of Lake Elsinore.
As a result of its historical evolution, the City encompasses significant prehistoric and historical
archaeological sites in addition to a rich record of fossil life. The policies in this section are
intended to promote and preserve the City’s existing cultural and paleontological resources. In
addition, each of the 16 district plans contains goals and policies regarding historical sites and
buildings within its specific boundary.
4.6.2       Cultural and Paleontological Resource Baselines
Prehistoric and Historic Archaeology
The record search indicated that 157 prehistoric and historical archaeological sites have been
previously recorded in the City of Lake Elsinore. Of these 157 sites, two prehistoric
archaeological sites (CA-RIV-1022 and CA-RIV-2798) have been determined eligible for listing
in the NRHP. CA-RIV-1022 is described as a rock shelter and CA-RIV-2798 is recorded as a
prehistoric village site.
Archival research was conducted at the Lake Elsinore Historical Society; the University of
California, Irvine; and the research library at Jones & Stokes. This research was conducted in an
effort to determine the prehistoric, ethnographic, and historic contexts for the City of Lake
Elsinore. The City shall consider adopting the 1988 North American Vertical Datum of 1242.2.
Prehistoric Context
A distinct cultural sequence has yet to be specifically defined for Lake Elsinore. Traditionally,
this area has been incorporated within discussion of Luiseño ethnographic traits, and previous
descriptions depended upon the similarity of the limited assemblages with those from the more
extensively studied Pauma Valley sites (Hampson et al.1992). A discussion of Moratto’s (1984)
Southern Coast Region (San Diego) sequence is based on these comparisons and included here.
In addition, Moratto’s (1984) Desert Region (Colorado River) sequence is also discussed.
Southern Coast Region - San Diego Sequence
San Dieguito (Beginning ca. – 5500 Before Present (B.P.))
This period reflects a generalized hunting tradition distinct from the Desert Tradition.
California units of the San Dieguito Complex include the C.W. Harris site (San Diego County),

Playa I and II (San Bernardino County), Lake Mojave, Death Valley I, Panamint Basin, Mono
Lake, and Owens Lake assemblages characterized by leaf-shaped knives and points, Lake
Mojave and Silver Lake points, scrapers, engraving tools, and crescents.
La Jolla Complex (5500 – 1000 B.P.)
The origin of the La Jolla Complex began sometime before 7,500 years ago with the arrival on
the coast of a gathering people from the interior desert. The reason for the migration may have
been that the California deserts became increasingly unfavorable for human habitation. The La
Jolla Complex is recognized by millingstone assemblages in shell middens, often in the vicinity
of sloughs and lagoons. Characteristic of this assemblage are millingstones, unshaped manos, a
large amount of flaked cobble tools, and a few Pinto-like projectile points. Burials tend to be
flexed, heads to the north, under stone cairns. Some writers interpret this period as having
three distinct phases that reflect developmental changes: La Jolla I (5500–3500 B.P.) identified by
flexed burials, the first appearance of millingstones, and percussion-flaked scrapers; La Jolla II
(3500–2000 B.C.) with true cemeteries, ground-stone discoidals, and several types of projectile
points in addition to the Phase I inventory; and La Jolla III (2000–1000 B.C.) showing Yuman
cultural influence from the east.
Pauma Complex (5500 – 1000 B.P.)
In 1958, D.L. True identified a complex similar to both La Jolla and San Dieguito in an area west
of Escondido in the Peninsular Ranges of Northern San Diego County (30 to 35 miles south-
southeast of Lake Elsinore). An examination of nearly 25 sites revealed San Dieguito-like
flaked-stone crescents and leaf-shaped points or knives associated with the La Jollan
millingstones, core scrapers, and stone discoidals. The name Pauma Complex was assigned to
these materials after the Pauma Valley where some of the sites were located. As a result of
additional surveys and further analysis of artifacts, True recognized that the Pauma Complex as
originally defined may have been a conglomeration of the San-Dieguito-like materials,
Millingstone elements, and assemblages with Millingstone artifacts unlike those typical of the
La Jolla Complex.
San Luis Rey Complex I-II (A.D. 1400 – 1750)
Initially attributed to the ancestors of the Diegueño, studies have determined the complex as
almost certainly representing the forebears of the Luiseño. Diagnostic features for San Luis Rey
I include cremations, bedrock mortars, milling stones, triangular arrow points, bone awls, and
stone and shell ornaments. In addition to those items, San Luis Rey II components include
pottery vessels, cremation urns, red and black pictographs, and such non-aboriginal items such
as metal knives and glass beads.

 Chapter 4.0
Desert Region – Colorado River Sequence
Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 12,000 – 7000 B.P.)
The earliest humans to occupy North America are believed to have been highly mobile hunters
and gatherers. Rogers (1966) assigned the Paleo-Indian sites within the Colorado Desert to the
San Dieguito Culture. Moratto (1984:92) notes that San Dieguito artifact assemblages are similar
to those of Lake Mojave and other Paleo-Indian cultures in Southern California. Moratto goes
on to suggest that assemblages of this early era be divided into a Fluted Point tradition (12,000–
10,000 B.P.) and, following Bedwell (1970), a Western Pluvial Lakes Tradition (10,000–7000 B.P.).
Pinto Period (ca. 7000 – 4000 B.P.)
The Pinto Period is marked by the gradual transition from pluvial to arid conditions during the
terminal Pleistocene-Early Holocene. Pinto Period sites are associated with the margins of
pluvial lakes and with now-extinct springs. Pinto-series projectile points, crudely made
stemmed or basally notched dart points, are the most distinctive artifact type of the Pinto
Period. Other artifacts found at Pinto Period sites include large leaf-shaped knives, thick, split
cobble choppers and scrapers, scraper-planes, and small milling slabs and manos.
Throughout most of the California desert region, sites containing elements of the Pinto Basin
Complex are small and are usually limited to surface deposits, suggestive of temporary and
perhaps seasonal occupation by small groups of people. Environmental conditions during the
Pinto Period of the Early Holocene were characterized by increasing aridity. However, at least
one period of increased moisture, from approximately 6,500 to 5,500 years ago, resulted in the
return of pluvial lake conditions. Warren (1984:414) postulates that human occupation of the
Southern California deserts during the periods from approximately 7,000 to 6,500 years ago and
from 5,500 to 4,000 years ago may have been limited because of the arid conditions. It is also
suggested that the Pinto Period populations withdrew to the desert margins and oases during
these arid periods, leaving large portions of the California deserts unoccupied for many
centuries.
Gypsum Period (ca. 4000 – 1500 B.P.)
The Gypsum Period is one of cultural intensification in the deserts of Southern California. The
beginning of the Gypsum Period coincides with the Little Pluvial, a period of increased effective
moisture in the region, wherein the ameliorated climate allowed for more extensive occupation
of the desert regions. In addition, periods of drought within this era seem to have resulted in
human adaptations to more arid conditions rather than a retreat from the deserts. Diagnostic
projectile points of this period include Humbolt, Gypsum, and Elko-series dart points (Warren
1984). Late in the Gypsum Period, Rose Spring arrow points appear in the archaeological
record, reflecting the spread of the bow and arrow technology from the Great Basin and
Colorado River region. Other artifact types characteristic of this period include leaf-shaped
arrow points, rectangular-based knives, flake scrapers, T-shaped drills, milling slabs and
                                               4-44

                                                                                  Chapter 4.0
manos, as well as core/cobble tools assemblages such as scraper planes, large choppers, and
hammerstones (Warren 1984). In addition to the introduction of the bow and arrow, another
technological innovation introduced during this period was the mortar and pestle for
processing hard seeds, such as those derived from the mesquite pod. Trade relationships with
the Pacific Coast are indicated by the presence of shell ornaments at several Gypsum
Period sites.
In addition to diagnostic projectile points, Gypsum Period sites include leaf-shaped points,
rectangular-based knives, flake scrapers, T-shaped drills, and occasionally, large scraper planes,
choppers, and hammerstones (Moratto 1984:416). Manos and milling stones are common; the
mortar and pestle also were introduced during this period. Other artifacts include shaft
smoothers, incised slate and sandstone tablets and pendants, bone awls, Olivella shell beads,
and Haliotis beads and ornaments.
Saratoga Springs Period (ca. A.D. 500 – 1200)
This period is, in large part, a continuation of the developments begun during the Gypsum
Period, such as an increasing adaptation to the desert environment and an increase in trade
relations (Warren 1984).        Regional environmental conditions became much wetter, a
development known as the Little Pluvial. Variations in regional cultural adaptations during the
Saratoga Springs Period also become apparent.
The Saratoga Springs Period is characterized by cultural diversification, with strong regional
developments. Turquoise mining and long-distance trade networks appear to have attracted
both the Anasazi and Hakataya peoples into the California deserts from the east and southeast,
respectively. Trade with the California coastal populations also appears to have been important
in the Antelope Valley region and stimulated the development of large, complex villages. In the
northwestern Mojave Desert, however, the basic pattern established during the Gypsum Period
changed little during the Saratoga Springs Period. Toward the end of the Saratoga Springs
Period, the Hakataya apparently moved far enough north to gain control of the turquoise mines
in the central Mojave Desert, thus replacing the Anasazi occupation of the eastern
California desert.
Developments during the Saratoga Springs Period in the southern cultural sphere include the
gradual introduction of pottery, Cottonwood-series arrow points, and Desert Side-notched
arrow points late in the period. Trade with the Pacific and Gulf coastal populations appears to
have been extensive and was likely the driving force that led to the gradual expansion of
Hatakaya cultural traits further west into the deserts and later into the mountains of the
Peninsular Range as well as into the inland valleys and coastal regions of Southern California.
Lake Cahuilla is believed to have formed around A.D. 500 and was the focus of cultural
activities such as exploitation of fish, waterfowl, and wetland resources during this period.

 Chapter 4.0
Shoshonean Period (ca. A.D. 1200 – 1800s)
During the Shoshonean Period, sometimes referred to as the Proto-Historic Period, there
appears to have been a continuation of the technological developments from the earlier
Saratoga Springs Period. Regional developments, however, indicate the formation of distinct
ethnographic groups become clearer during the Shoshonean Period. Two major events affect
the archaeological record of this period. The final desiccation of Lake Cahuilla, which had
occurred by approximately A.D. 1640, resulted in a population shift away from the lakebed into
the Peninsular Ranges to the west, including the Lake Elsinore area and the Colorado River
regions to the east. Subsequently, Spanish exploration and establishment of the mission system
during the late 1700s mark the end of prehistoric lifeways.
In the Southern Desert region, brown and buff ware pottery, first appearing on the lower
Colorado River at about A.D. 800, started to diffuse across the California deserts by about A.D.
900 (Moratto 1984). Associated with the diffusion of this pottery were desert side-notched and
cottonwood triangular projectile points dating to about A.D. 1150–1200, suggesting a continued
spread of Hakataya influences. Large, complex housepit village sites were established along the
headwaters of the Mojave River and were somewhat similar to those reported in Antelope
Valley. Although both of these areas appear to have participated in extensive trade between the
desert and the coast, the lack of buff and brown ware pottery at the Antelope Valley sites
suggests that these people were minimally influenced by the Hakataya developments along the
Mojave River (Moratto 1984). The Hakataya influence throughout the Colorado and Mojave
deserts is evidenced by desert side-notched and cottonwood triangular projectile points and
buff and brown ware pottery. During this period Lake Cahuilla began to recede, and the
extensive Hakataya populations occupying its shores began moving westward into areas such
as Anza-Borrego, Coyote Canyon, the Upper Coachella Valley, the Little San Bernardino
Mountains, the San Jacinto Valley, and Perris Plain.
4.6.3       Ethnographic Setting
The ethnographic territory of the Luiseño Indians is within the geographic boundary of the City
of Lake Elsinore’s SOI. The term Luiseño is derived from the Mission San Luis Rey and has
been used in Southern California to refer to those Takic-speaking people associated with
the mission.
Luiseño territory comprised a total of 1,500 square miles of Southern California. Luiseño
territory included most of the drainage of the San Luis Rey River and that of the Santa
Margarita River (Bean and Shipek 1978). Along the coast it extended from Agua Hedionda
Creek on the south to Aliso Creek on the northwest. The boundary extended inland to Santiago
Peak, then across to the eastern side of the Elsinore Valley, then southward to the east of
Palomar Mountain, then around the southern slope above the San Jose Valley. From there the
boundary turned west and returned to the sea along the Agua Hedionda Creek.

                                                                                  Chapter 4.0
Villages were located in diverse ecological zones typically located along valley bottoms,
streams, or coastal strands near mountain ranges. Each village area contained many named
places associated with food products, raw materials, or sacred beings, and each place was
owned by an individual, family, the chief, or by the group collectively (Bean and Shipek 1978).
The village of Paiahche is ethnographically documented immediately north of the lake by
Kroeber (1925), however consultation with the Pechanga Tribe shows that the village was
located northwest of the Lake and that the correct spelling is Páayaxchi. This name also refers
to the Lake itself. The area around and including the Elsinore hot springs was known to the
Luiseño as iténgvu Wumówmu (meaning “hot springs”). The hot springs also figure
prominently into Luiseño oral tradition.. The location, iténgvu Wumówmu, is named in a
song about the death ofWuyóot, a religious leader who led the people in their migration from
the north (Du Bois 1908; Harrington 1978 in Grenda et al. 1997). Several additional Luiseño
place names are within the Lake Elsinore area and SOI including We’éeva, Píi’iv, Qawiimay,
Páayaxchi Nivé’wuna, Anóomay and others, reflecting this diverse and well utilized region.
Houses were primarily conical and partially subterranean, thatched structures of locally
accessible materials, including reeds, brush, or bark. Round, semi-subterranean, earth-covered
sweathouses were important for a variety of rituals.
The principal game included deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, woodrat, mice and ground squirrels,
antelope, and valley and mountain quail and other birds. Trout and other fish were caught in
mountain streams. Acorns were the most important single food source, and villages seem to
have been located near water resources necessary for the leaching of acorns. Grass seeds were
the next most abundant food source (Bean and Shipek 1978). Seeds were parched, ground, and
cooked as a mush in various combinations. Additional food sources included various greens,
cactus pods, yucca buds, and bulbs, roots, and tubers.
Tools for food acquisition, storage, and preparation included an inventory made from widely
available materials. Hunting tools included shoulder-height bows with fire-hardened wood or
stone-tipped arrows, curved throwing sticks, rabbit nets, slings, and traps. Seeds were ground
with handstones on shallow unshaped basin metates. The same granites were made into
shaped or unshaped mortars and pestles for pounding acorns or small game (Bean and Shipek
1978). Coiled and twined baskets were used in food gathering, preparation, storage, and
serving. Food was cooked in wide-mouthed clay jars over fireplaces or in earth ovens wrapped
with clay or leaves. Other utensils for food preparation included wooden food paddles,
brushes, tongs, tweezers, steatite bowls, and wooden digging sticks (Bean and Shipek 1978).
While the literature recognizes Lake Elsinore as a part of Luiseño linguistic territory, references
are also made to possible previous occupation by the Juaneno based on their place names and
creation myths and overlapping use or influence by adjacent groups, including the Gabrielino,
Serrano, and Cahuilla (Hampson 1992).

4.6.4       Historic Context
The information contained below is a summary statement from Tom Hudson’s: Lake Elsinore
Valley, Its Story 1776–1977, and General History of Southern California.
Spanish Period
Beginning in 1769, the Spanish set up missions throughout the area called Alta California. Most
of the missions failed to have an impact beyond their respective region. The San Luis Rey
Mission, however, extended its influence into the surrounding regions and used the lands for
grazing cattle and other animals. Then in 1818, Leandro Serrano settled in what the Spaniards
were calling Laguna Grande. He was the first non-Indian to settle what was to become
Riverside County, with his settlement just north of Glen Ivy Hot Springs. Throughout the
Spanish Period, this lone settlement was the only region in Riverside County that continued to
grow. Mexican independence, however, in 1822 changed the makeup of Laguna Grande,
Riverside, and all of Alta California.
Mexican Period
Mexican independence and the Secularization Act of 1833 led to population increases and
disastrous consequences for the Luiseño tribes. Many of the local Indians became accustomed
to the mission way of life and were not prepared for the aftermath. It became common practice
for large land grants to be issued to those friendly to the Mexican cause. As the land grants
were developed, local tribes were presurred to relocate or to become laborers and workers on
the ranches. The comisionados, who were placed in charge of the land transfer, took advantage
of the situation and became the powerful land holding class known as the rancheros.
Early American Period: La Laguna
The treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was signed in 1848, ending the Mexican-American War and
marking the end of the Mexican Period in California. The treaty ceded much of the southwest
to the United States, including all the lands around La Laguna and the rest of Southern
California. The City of Lake Elsinore’s historic name, La Laguna, is derived from Laguna
Grande, the name the Spanish gave the lake and used in the early 1800s. The historic roots of
the La Laguna/Laguna Grande influenced the name given to Rancho La Laguna, land granted
to Julian Manriquez in early 1844. For the non-Indian occupants, the beginning of the American
Period can be called a golden era for the region, with the announcement of the discovery of gold
shortly after the war.
Before the outbreak of war between Mexico and the United States, Julian Manriquez received a
sizable land grant in 1844 that included the lands of La Laguna. Battle was waged over the land
from 1846 to 1848. Then, in 1850, California became the 31st state in the Union. Soon thereafter,
in 1851, Julian Manriquez sold the land to Abel Sterns, who was Massachusetts-born and the
largest landholder in all of Southern California. In 1858, Augustin Machado acquired the land
                                               4-48

                                                                                     Chapter 4.0
and named it Rancho La Laguna. He was the
first landowner since the Indians to call the lake
home, and he immediately began construction
of a seven-room adobe, which immediately
became a local landmark. Machado’s adobe
was the first stop for the postal service in the
area surrounding La Laguna.              From its
inception, La Laguna became an important
crossroads for the stagecoach, the railroad,
prospectors, recreation seekers, and all travelers
alike.
Founding of the Town
The years between the Civil War and the
coming of the railroad saw only gradual
progress. Instead, it saw the death of Augustin          Example of an Historical Building That No
Machado and the rise of his son, Juan Bernardo           Longer Exists in Downtown Lake Elsinore
Machado, who became known as the legendary
Don Juan. Franklin Heald purchased Rancho La Laguna in 1883. He then founded the town of
Elsinore, which was named after the famed city of Elsinore from Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The
lake at Helsingnor is also a center of atraction as it is at Lake Elsinore. It was not until
December of 1972 that, by popular vote, Elsinore City formally acknowledged the importance of
the lake and became officially known as the City of Lake Elsinore.
In 1884, George Irish bought the remainder of Don Juan Machado’s estate, thus ending the
Machado family’s reign over the valley. Shortly after its inception, and because of its rapid
growth, the town of Lake Elsinore became a full-fledged city on April 9, 1888, located in what
was then San Diego County. In 1893, Lake Elsinore joined the new county of Riverside,
encompassing lands that were formerly part of San Diego and San Bernardino Counties.
Throughout this time period, the City continued to expand, and developers continued to
construct buildings, some of which still stand today. In 1884, Wilson Heald, Franklin’s father,
built a two-story home on the corner of what is now Grand and Riverside. Lake Elsinore also
built its first post office and schoolhouse in the same year.
In early 1887, one of Heald’s major accomplishments was the building of a bathhouse in the
ancient hot springs of the Páayaxchi, known as the Crescent. Also completed in the same year
was a two-story meeting hall dedicated to Elsinore’s chapter of the Grand Army of the
Republic. This building is located at the northeast corner of Main and Franklin, and it has seen
many uses throughout the years. Also built that year was the Consolidated Bank, later used as
a schoolhouse and then a hotel, the Ambassador Hotel, which was the tallest building in all of
Lake Elsinore. It is presently vacant.
                                                 4-49

 Chapter 4.0
In 1887, the Lakedale Hotel was completed, which later became the Lake View Inn. This
building no longer stands; however, it symbolizes the transformation of Lake Elsinore from a
tranquil lakeside village to a vibrant resort town.
Transportation
The development of La Laguna followed similar patterns as the rest of California. The advent
of rapid transportation brought many new peoples to the Pacific and the lake area. The
motivations behind the new wave of immigration was both recreation and gold, which brought
many well-to-do men and women to the shores of the lake and prospectors into the vicinity of
La Laguna.
The transcontinental railroad opened the floodgates to settlement all along the Pacific, including
the inland interiors. Its completion in 1869 opened the way for land speculators, miners,
developers, farmers, and vacationers to swarm into California. The rail opened up the region to
a larger population boom. The first colony in the area surrounding La Laguna sprang up in
what is modern-day Riverside.
The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad was completed by the early 1880s, bringing the
newly created City a lifeline to the outside world. In the history of California, those towns that
were blessed with rail lines thrived; those without a rail line often suffered. The Elsinore
station, later called Elsinore Junction, was located near the intersection of Railroad Canyon
Road and Mission Trail. The original building was moved sometime in the past to either the
City of Alessandro or Arlington but has since been destroyed, possibly by fire. The historic
train depot that is currently in the City of Lake Elsinore was moved from the City of Arlington
where it was originally constructed.
As it did in the rest of California served by railroads, the rail line brought new life to the area.
The completion of the railroad began the process of growth and urbanization for Lake Elsinore.
The City and its surrounding region experienced a large influx in population, due in part to the
excitement for gold. Once these people settled, they learned of the splendors along the shores
of the lake. Many began to settle and vacation in the valley, and development grew to
accommodate the demands of vacationers seeking relaxation and recreation.
Signaling the transition away from the railroad toward more modern means of transportation,
W. Leonard Bonney and Miss Margaret Stahl were the first to fly over Lake Elsinore in 1913.
Soon after, to celebrate the Fourth of July, Harry Holmes flew and landed Glenn L. Martin’s
hydroplane in the lake. Then, in 1914, five automobiles succeeded in driving the 17-mile course
around the lake.
Finally, in 1932, the Ortega Highway was opened to the public, continuing the influx of people
to the city. Around this time, an airport was built, bringing many enthusiasts to hang glide and
sky dive. As transportation progressed, it brought more people and new ideas to the heart of

Lake Elsinore. The development of a strong middle class and ownership of a family automobile
in the post World War II era expanded recreational potential in Lake Elsinore.
Mining
The gold rush and the advancing railroads brought more people to California. Lake Elsinore
and the surrounding area were no exception, with its mining of tin ore, coal, clay, and some
gold.
In the late 19th century, the town experienced a boom because of gold mining between the
towns of Elsinore and Perris. The most prosperous mine was Good Hope Mine, the discovery
of which has been credited to Juan B. Castillo and Madison Chaney or possibly a Frenchman by
the name of Mache. This mine produced more than $2 million worth of gold (over $20 million
in current dollars) during its working years. At its height, it used coal extracted from the Terra
Cotta mines to process the gold. The coal mines, which were discovered in 1883 by Madison
Chaney and his wife, Esther, were also used to fire kilns and heat homes. The region
surrounding Alberhill was also known for its coal mining. Coal was also mined in the Warm
Springs Valley. The coal mine provided employment but also gave Lake Elsinore a degree of
energy self-sufficiency.
Mining of asbestos also began during the 1880s. John D. Huff, owned and operated the
Asbestos Company and founded the coal and clay mines near the town of Terra Cotta. The clay
mine at Terra Cotta was in operation until the 1940s when the Alberhill mine became the sole
operating clay mine in the region. The clay extracted from these mines was of such high quality
that it won a gold medal at the prestigious Panama-California Exposition at San Diego in 1916.
The Pacific Clay Brick Products Company is the present owner of the Alberhill commercial area.
Within its grounds is the Alberhill School, which served the area from 1912 until it was
abandoned in 1964.
Rail transportation opened up the Lake Elsinore region to prospectors, miners, and investors
who took advantage of the untapped reserves to expand their personal wealth to influence the
City. Lake Elsinore became the main center for mining and transportation in the region. Many
additional spurs were built to improve the connection of Lake Elsinore to its surrounding
mines. The rails injected new life into the valley and kept a steady stream of prospectors,
settlers, and vacation seekers flowing to the shores of Lake Elsinore. When the mines played
out, the tourists and vacationers continued to provide a source of economic opportunity.
Recreation
Many people visited the newly created City of Lake Elsinore, looking for recreation along the
shores of the pristine lake. The move toward creating a resort town began shortly after the
town’s inception. The rail brought ranchers and prospectors to the City in 1883, and then in
1887 the City’s first hotel was completed. Most lakes in southern California, all of which were
man made, were somewhat remote. Lake Elsinore sat on a major rail line and highway. This
                                               4-51

 Chapter 4.0
move toward becoming a resort town continued into the 20th century when the Laguna Vista
Club House was completed, the first lakefront resort. In 1923, the Mount Elsinore Country Club
opened to great fanfare. Lake Elsinore attracted many Hollywood stars, such as Will Rogers, to
its famous bathhouse and pristine waters with proximity to major cities and rails.
The earliest attraction of Lake Elsinore was its legendary bathhouse, known as the Crescent. At
one point it was proclaimed the finest bathhouse in all of California, and more important, it still
stands as of 2007. It is now known as the Chimes, located at 201 W. Graham Avenue, and has
been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1884, Henry Lillie built a yacht, the Marguerita, to ferry passengers across the lake. The
steamship, the Lady Elsinore, carried passengers on lake cruises, which occasionally
featured bands.
In 1926, the Clevelin Reality Corporation attempted to revitalize the tourist industry by building
a double-deck pier. It included a dance club and several games. In 1927, the Aloha Yacht Club
sponsored the largest gathering of speedboats on the lake, which was a great success. The
following year the lake held the National Speed Boat Race, which garnered nine world records.
Another bathhouse, known as the Briner Bathhouse, was completed at the corner of Sumner
and Riley in 1928. Later that same year, Hunter’s Elsinore Sanitarium opened, bringing health
seekers to Elsinore for many years. In 1930, construction was under way for a new bathhouse at
Pachanga Hot Springs. Even during the lean years of the depression, Lake Elsinore still
attracted a large number of visitors to the surroundings of the lake. The most unique
construction of the 1930s was the Clevelin Realty Corporation’s “ship pier” on the south side of
the lake. It was capable of allowing small ships to dock within it. Also, it was mounted on
tracks to allow for easy repairs.
Mirroring the immense popularity of baseball in the 1900s, Local high school teams played
against teams from southern California, winning several district championships. The Los
Angeles Angels played in the ballpark east of Main Street during spring season of 1916. The
Sacramento Solons and the Hollywood Stars both trained in the valley on a newly constructed
field on Poe Street in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Today, the Lake Elsinore Storm have one of
the largest fan bases in minor league baseball. The Storm logo is the best selling minor league
logo and helps brand the City as a professional-level community.
The City of Lake Elsinore
Lake Elsinore began as a small town with the emergence of the railroad around 1883. It soon
began to grow with the completion of its first post office and schoolhouse in 1884. In 1893, the
town became officially recognized as a city in the same year as the establishment of the
Cleveland National Forest. The original City Hall was completed on July 7, 1934; the original
building no longer exists.
                                                4-52

                                                                                   Chapter 4.0
During the boom years of the 1920s the city of Lake Elsinore saw a great deal of development.
This time period saw the building of the Masonic Temple in 1923 at East Graham Avenue, and
the building of the Methodist church at Main and Heald, in the same year. This Church is still
in use. In 1925, the Elsinore Woman’s Club built a meeting place at the corner of Graham and
Lowell. The Elsinore Theatre on South Main, built in 1925 replaced the Star theatre, built c.1908,
and has been the Franklin Store since 1938. Another interesting structure built in 1929 and
located on the hills east of the lake is “Aimee’s Castle” that was the home of noted evangelist,
Aimee Semple McPherson. It is also important to note that in 1924 the valley’s first telephone
services were installed. The Great Depression limited expansion, except for the completion of a
new post office in 1932.
Agriculture
Early settlers in the valley subsisted on ranching and farming. Even at the height of its tourist
season, the region was still in peak production. The farmers in the area grew olives, grapes,
apricots, and other produce.
The farmers in the area produced at such high levels that to handle their needs, the Lakeland
Ranch, owned by C. H. Albers, built one of the largest canning facilities in the state. He was the
owner of “Albers’ Folly” canned olives. In 1916, Elsinore olive oil took gold at the Panama-
California Exposition in San Diego. Later, apricots became the boom crop. These crops
sustained the valley during the worst years of the Depression and helped it flourish during its
tourist peak. The eucalyptus trees, palm trees, and pepper trees that shade the walkway and
line the shores and streets have been there for generations and keep the land connected to its
past.
4.6.5        Prehistoric Archaeological Sites
As identified in the record search, Lake Elsinore has an extensive use history from the
prehistoric era to modern times. The record search resulted in the identification of 132
prehistoric and historical archaeological sites within the project area. Two of the previously
identified prehistoric sites, CA-RIV-1022 and CA-RIV-2798, have been determined eligible for
listing in the NRHP.
Additional previously identified prehistoric archaeological sites include: villages, rock shelters,
habitation sites, lithic scatters, and milling slicks. Isolated artifacts have also been identified
within the project area; however, given the limited amount of data typically derived from
artifacts without associated features or assemblages, they have not been included in the
discussion of previously identified sites in Table 4-3.
These previously identified archaeological sites can provide assistance in determining areas of
known sensitivity for prehistoric archaeological resources. The site definitions provided in
Table 4-3 are based on the information provided in the record search and are to be used as a
general guideline to understanding the nature of prehistoric archaeological sites in the region.
                                                 4-53

 Chapter 4.0
In addition, the identification of known areas of sensitivity does not preclude the possibility of
locating additional prehistoric sites in other portions of the City and SOI.
  Table 4-3.       Previously Identified Prehistoric Archaeological Sites within the SOI
  Site Types           Site Definitions and Locations
  Village sites        Sites that exhibit a level of sustained residency with resources suitable for
                       sustaining long-term or seasonal habitation. Typically located along watercourses
                       (such as the San Jacinto River and its tributaries or near Lake Elsinore). Associated
                       artifact assemblages may include (but are not limited to) bedrock outcrops, lithic
                       artifacts, groundstone, shell, animal bone, fire-affected rock, ceramics, pictographs
                       and petroglyphs, house rings, and evidence of funerary practices.
  Rock shelters        Typically located in higher elevations in areas that sustain habitable rock overhangs
                       that can support brief habitation episodes or be utilized for ceremonial purposes.
                       Associated artifacts can include (but are not limited to) pictographs and
                       petroglyphs, fire-affected rock, lithic artifacts, midden soil, animal bone, bedrock
                       milling features, ceramics.
  Habitation sites     Temporary camps or transition areas that exploit an immediate or seasonal
                       resource. Usually located near watercourses such as the San Jacinto River and its
                       tributaries. Associated artifact assemblages may include (but are not limited to)
                       ground stone, lithic debitage, and bedrock milling features.
  Lithic scatters      Flaking stations that may indicate possible opportunistic quarrying activities or tool
                       reduction stations. Clusters can be identified in isolation or in association with other
                       site types and are not restricted in geographic location.
  Bedrock Milling      Grinding stations typically located along watercourses (such as the San Jacinto
  Features             River and its tributaries) near exposed bedrock outcrops (typically granite or
                       granodiorite) with suitable resources in the area for processing.

4.6.6        Historical Archaeological Sites
The previously identified historical archaeological sites represent a range of activities including:
mining, transportation, recreation, and ranching/homesteading and are represented
throughout the City and SOI. The number of previously identified historical archaeological
sites is much smaller than prehistoric sites making it more difficult to determine areas of known
or established sensitivity. It is possible, however, to make informed deductions about the types
of resources likely to be encountered in future projects based on the previously identified sites
in combination with the documented history of the area.
For example, historical archaeological sites associated with recreation activities tend to be
concentrated around, or within the immediate vicinity of Lake Elsinore. In addition, the lake
itself has been previously recorded as a cultural resource (p33-11009). A majority of the
previously recorded mining sites have been identified in the northeastern portion of the study
area. These include sites that are representative of extractive operations focused on the
acquisition of gold, granite, and limestone. This includes the Good Hope Mine Site (33-3352),
the most prosperous gold mine in the region in the 19th century. Early transportation into the
area is currently represented through previously recorded segments of the Santa Fe Railroad
(CA-RIV-3832H) and associated features. It is also possible that early roads might be eventually
added to the existing list of transportation related cultural resources. Ranching and
homesteading sites consist of a variety of material culture remains including (but not limited to)
building foundations, fence lines, rock walls, orchards and agricultural fields, landscaping
elements, and outbuildings. These sites are distributed throughout the City and SOI.
4.6.7        Paleontological Resources
County of Riverside
To ensure that appropriate protection is afforded to the County’s rich and extensive record of
fossil life, a Countywide inventory for paleontological sensitivity has been conducted. The
resulting map evaluates all land within the County as having high, low, or undetermined
sensitivity for paleontological resources, consistent with guidelines published by the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology (Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Conformable Impact Mitigation
Guidelines Committee 1995), which represent the industry standard for protection of
paleontological resources. It serves as a general guide for environmental review of
development proposals and identification of appropriate strategies for avoidance and
mitigation of paleontological impacts.
The County’s paleontological resources sensitivity mapping shows areas of high paleontological
sensitivity in Quaternary deposits north of Lake Elsinore along the west side of the I-15
corridor. Quaternary units of the valley floor immediately surrounding Lake Elsinore are of
undetermined paleontological sensitivity, as are the fan deposits flanking the Santa Ana
Mountains rangefront south of the lake; Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks northwest of the
Lake; and Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary rocks, and Mesozoic metasediments east of the

Lake. Most of the valley floor south of Lake Elsinore, and the plutonic highlands to the west
and east of the valley, are considered to have low paleontological sensitivity, as seen in
Figure 4.6, Paleontological Resources.
City of Lake Elsinore
The City of Lake Elsinore has identified geologic units that are known to contain important
paleontological resources in the Alberhill Ranch area in the northeast portion of the SOI. In this
area, the Silverado Formation of Paleocene age (approximately 66–55 million years old) is
locally highly sensitive for invertebrate and plant material. The fossil plants from this unit have
been studied for more than half a century and are therefore considered to be particularly
significant.
4.6.8        Cultural and Paleontological Resources Goals, Policies and
             Implementation Programs
Goal 6          Preserve, protect, and promote the cultural heritage of the
                City and surrounding region for the education and enjoyment
                of all City residents and visitors, as well as for the
                advancement of historical and archeological knowledge.
Policies
6.1   Encourage the preservation of significant archeological, historical, and other cultural
      resources located within the City.
6.2   The City shall consult with the appropriate Native American tribes for projects identified
      under SB 18 (Traditional Tribal Cultural Places).
6.3   When significant cultural/archeological sites or artifacts are discovered on a site,
      coordination with professional archeologists, relevant state and, if applicable, federal
      agencies, and the appropriate Native American tribes regarding preservation of sites or
      professional retrieval and preservation of artifacts or by other means of protection, prior to
      development of the site shall be required. Because ceremonial items and items of cultural
      patrimony reflect traditional religious beliefs and practices, developers shall waive any
      and all claims to ownership and agree to return all Native American ceremonial items and
      items of cultural patrimony that may be found on a project site to the appropriate tribe for
      treatment. It is understood by all parties that unless otherwise required by law, the site of
      any reburial of Native American human remains or cultural artifacts shall not be disclosed
      and shall not be governed by public disclosure requirements of the California Public
      Records Act.

                                                                                 Chapter 4.0
6.4  If archeological excavations are recommended on a project site, the City shall require that
     all such investigations include Native American consultation, which shall occur prior to
     project approval.
Implementation Program        The City shall encourage owners of local sites to apply for
     recognition in the State Historic Resources Inventory as Riverside County Landmarks,
     State Points of Historic Interest, State Landmarks, and as sites on the National Register of
     Historic Places.
Agency/Department             Community Development Department
Goal 7         Support state-of-the-art research designs and analytical
               approaches to archeological and cultural resource
               investigations while also acknowledging the traditional
               knowledge and experience of the Native American tribes
               regarding Native American culture.
Policies
7.1  Consult with California Native American tribes prior to decision-making processes for the
     purpose of preserving cultural places located on land within the City’s jurisdiction that
     may be affected by the proposed plan, in accordance with State or Federal requirements.
7.2  Continue to identify, document, evaluate, designate, and preserve the cultural resources in
     the City.
7.3  Continue to update a citywide inventory of cultural resources in conformance with state
     standards and procedures while maintaining the confidentiality of information as
     required by law.
7.4  Support the permanent curation of archaeological artifact collections by universities or
     museums or appropriate tribal facilities.
7.5  Increase opportunities for cultural heritage tourism by promoting the history of Lake
     Elsinore to attract cultural heritage travelers while maintaining the confidentiality of
     Native American sites, places and other information as required by law.
Implementation Program        Through the CEQA process the City shall request state-of-the-art
     and best-available research designs and approaches be utilized in archaeological and
     cultural resource investigations.

Goal 8           Preserve paleontological resources occurring within the City.
Policy
8.1    For development in areas delineated as “High” or “Undetermined” potential sensitivity
       for paleontological resources, require the project applicant to hire a certified
       paleontologist, who must perform a literature search and/or survey and apply the
       relevant treatment for the site as recommended by the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology.
Implementation Program             The City shall use the development and environmental review
       processes to ensure that appropriate archaeological and paleontological surveying and
       documentation of findings is provided prior to project approval, and require monitoring
       of new developments and reporting to the City on completion of mitigation and resource
       protection measures.

4.7.1        Introduction
A city cannot attempt to understand its present or to
forecast its future if it fails to recognize its past. By tracing
its past, a city can gain a clear sense of the process by
which it achieved its present form and substance. Lake
Elsinore’s rich and varied historical and cultural resources
include buildings, districts, landforms, and archaeological
sites that possess historical, scientific, architectural,
aesthetic, cultural, or ethnic significance. These resources,
with their inherent ability to evoke the past, represent
important aspects of the history of Lake Elsinore, from the
time before and during European contact with Native
                                                                  Lake Elsinore Historic Building

industrial development, and to boom periods with
increased leisure time, which made the City a recreational
destination.
Preservation of important historical resources enhances the quality of life in Lake Elsinore. It
improves the character of the built environment, encourages appreciation for the City’s history
and culture, maintains the identity of communities, and contributes to the City’s economic
vitality. The identification, evaluation, registration, and protection of these resources are the
essential components of Lake Elsinore’s historic preservation responsibilities.

Cultural and Historical Resources
Record Search
A records search for the study area was conducted at the Eastern Information Center of the
California Historical Resources Information System at the University of California, Riverside on
July 12, 2005. The researcher consulted the state’s database of previous cultural resource studies
and recorded cultural resource sites as well as the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR), California Historical Landmarks,
California Points of Historical Interest, and local historical registers.
According to the records search, 194 cultural resource studies have been previously conducted
within the study area and 447 cultural resources (buildings, structures, objects, and
archaeological sites) have been previously recorded within the same boundary.
Historic Built Environment
Two buildings within the City boundaries, the Crescent Bath House and the Grand Army of the
Republic Armory Hall, are currently listed in the NRHP. The armory hall is also listed in the
California Points of Historical Interest (RIV-070) as is the
Elsinore Women’s Club (RIV-071).            California Historical
Landmarks lists no properties within the study area.
In the 1980s, the Riverside County Historical Commission
designated Historic Downtown Lake Elsinore as a local historic
district. Historic Downtown Elsinore encompasses areas of
early residential and commercial development within the City
of Lake Elsinore, as seen in Figure 4.7. A majority of the district
is focused in the areas around Main Street, Heald Avenue, and
Graham Avenue where some of the earliest development
occurred. The City is working with the County of Riverside to
                                                                                Cultural Center
protect its local cultural heritage and structures of merit. The

4.8         Aesthetics
4.8.1       Introduction
The City and the SOI surrounding Lake Elsinore are located in a valley with panoramic views of
the Santa Ana Mountains to the southwest, rolling hills to the east, and a valley that sweeps to
the north and south. The visual character of the area is dominated by Lake Elsinore, which is
accentuated by the area’s topography and visible from several areas within the City. Other
scenic resources include the Cleveland National Forest, rugged hills, mountains, ridgelines,
rocky outcroppings, streams, vacant lands with native vegetation, buildings of historical and
cultural significance, parks, and trails.
As the City continues to urbanize, it will be important to maintain a healthy balance between
the natural and built environment. The goals and policies in this section are intended to protect
and enhance the area’s rich array of aesthetic resources.
4.8.2       Aesthetics Baselines
Visual Character
The 38 square mile city of approximately 38,000
people and a 3,000-acre natural lake make up Lake
Elsinore. Trees and scrub bushes surround the
lake and nearby mountains and hillsides, hiding
patches of development.            Older buildings
including housing, commercial buildings, retail
shops, and light industrial uses are scattered
around the lake. Southeast of the lake, large areas
of undeveloped land are interspersed with older
housing and newer, sprawling subdivisions. The
mountains on the southwest shore rise up
                                                            Effect on Viewshed of New Home
dramatically providing a backdrop for the lake.
                                                                Construction in Hillsides.
The topography of the area accentuates the beauty of the lake. The City is located in a valley
with panoramic views of the Santa Ana Mountains that extend from the southwestern edge of
the lake, rolling hills along the northeastern borders, and a valley that sweeps to the north
and south.
Relative to other cities in Southern California, the City of Lake Elsinore is non-urban. A city
center was developed in the northeast portion of the lake known as historic Lake Elsinore, with
additional development dispersed around the lake. As the city grew, development patterns
spread up the valley towards the north. Development within the current City boundaries is
limited due to various topographical barriers including the Santa Ana Mountains to the west
and rolling hills to the east.

Scenic Resources
Scenic resources within and surrounding the City of Lake Elsinore include the lake, Cleveland
National Forest, rugged hills, mountains, ridgelines, rocky outcroppings, streams, vacant land
with native vegetation, buildings of historical and cultural significance such as the cultural
center, bathhouse and military academy, parks, and trails. Examples of these scenic resources
can be seen in photos listed as Figures 4.8a-d.
Sensitive Viewer Groups
Sensitive viewer groups for the City of Lake Elsinore include, but are not limited to, city
residents, unincorporated county residents, people who live in other cities but work in Lake
Elsinore, tourists, commuters, and motorists on I-15 or Highway 74. Public vantage points for
the various viewer groups include the highways, recreational facilities around the lake as well
as within the center of lake, and hang gliders, small planes, and others from the sky. Private
vantage points include views from individual residences.
Viewsheds
Viewsheds or landscaped viewshed units of scenic vistas include the lake, urban areas around
the lake, and the rugged vacant hills in the northern and eastern portion of the City. For
purposes of discussion, 15 landscape viewshed units have been identified in the Lake Elsinore
area as seen in Figure 4.9, Landscape Viewshed Units. Each of these areas have distinct
viewsheds defined by man-made structures and physiographical features such as landform,
water, or cultural features.
The following is a brief summary of each of the Landscaped Viewshed Units from Figure 4.9:
    1. Mainly vacant land with steep hillsides interspersed with development. Unit is both
        within the City and SOI.
    2. Partially graded land due to mineral extraction. Unit is half in the City and half in the
        SOI.
    3. Mainly developed with residential, commercial, and recreational land uses.
    4. Steep slopes mainly outside City boundaries, but within the SOI. Includes portions of
        the Cleveland National Forest. This unit is mainly undeveloped, but has patches of
        residential, commercial, and recreational development.
    5. Rolling hillsides characterize this unit. It is mainly residential with limited commercial
        use.
    6. Unit is adjacent to the lake with a mix of residential, commercial, and public facilities.
        This unit is also the location of historic downtown Lake Elsinore.

    7. Mainly within City boundaries, the unit is characterized by varying topography and
        rural development.
    8. Majority of this unit is outside City boundaries, but within the SOI. Area is developed
        with intermittent residential and commercial uses.
    9. Unit is outside of the City, but within SOI. Residential community located along I-15.
    10. Located outside the City and on the edge of the SOI. Characterized by rolling hills and
        limited residential development.
    11. Located in the center of the SOI. Mainly developed with residential and commercial
        uses. Contains a public high school.
    12. Location of the future Lake Elsinore Outlet stores. Large portion to the east is vacant for
        future expansion.
    13. Mainly manufacturing land use located along I-15. Relatively flat topography. Includes
        current location for the existing Lake Elsinore Outlet Mall.
    14. This unit includes Lake Elsinore and surrounding floodplain.
    15. Characterized by steep slopes and limited development due to small lots and inadequate
        utilities. Also known as Country Club Heights.
Figure 4.10, Viewshed and Vantage Points, demonstrates the areas within the City of Lake
Elsinore, SOI, and outlying areas where views of the lake are visible, and areas where the lake
cannot be seen. If an individual is standing in an area that is marked as green on the map, they
can see the lake. If they are standing in an area that is red, they cannot see the lake. For
example, as a motorist drives on I-15, the map demonstrates that views of the lake will be
sporadic, with visibility of the lake better along the southern portion of I-15 and worse in the
north.
Vantage Points
The visual character of the City is dominated by Lake Elsinore, which is the largest natural lake
in Southern California. Due to the importance of the lake, scenic resources were addressed by
identifying key public vantage points of the lake throughout the City. Sites chosen included the
view of the lake from I-15, Highway 74, the Lake Elsinore Recreation Area and Campground,
the baseball stadium, the boat launch on the eastern edge of the lake and the Aloha Pier look-
out. These points were chosen because they are key public vantage points that can be accessed
by every viewer group. Figure 4.10 shows where the vantage points are located, and Figure
4.11, Vantage Point Photos, displays photos of each of the locations. The following is a
description of each vantage point.

With the city’s proximity to I-15, the lake can be seen as commuters pass by the city. A full view
of the lake appears in the distance, sitting in a valley surrounded by mountains and hills. Most
travelers on the I-15 are passing through at high speeds making it difficult to enjoy views of the
lake. While the view of the lake is pleasant, travelers are focused on driving and not on the
visual quality of the lake and surrounding city. Without pulling off the freeway, the lake is only
visible to north and southbound motorists for a short period. From other public vantage points,
viewers have prolonged viewing times of the lake, either due to slower speed limits on
roadways, or because the viewer is not traveling and has time to stop and look.
From SR 74, there are several vantage points where sightseers and residents can stop and enjoy
the view of the lake. Ortega Highway traverses up and over the Santa Ana Mountains. As the
highway switchbacks through the mountains, the view of the lake becomes more impressive as
travelers enjoy an aerial view of the entire lake and surrounding rugged topography. From the
high viewpoint the lake fills the view. As seen from Figure 4.11, the surrounding hills and
distant mountains act as a backdrop for displaying the lake.
Looking down from Ortega Highway, a development of newer homes with red roofs stands out
on the southeast side of the lake creating a visual distraction. Towards the west, the
topography gets steep very quickly. There are very few shrubs and trees on the hillside that
obstruct views of the lake from the roadway. Rocky outcroppings at the vantage point provide
additional visual interest.
Another key public vantage point is from the Lake Elsinore Recreation Area that includes a
campground, boat launch and swimming area. It is located adjacent to the water on the
northwestern edge of the lake. The view of the lake fills up the southern sightline of the viewer
as seen in Figure 4.11. In the summer of 2005, several dozen palm trees were viewed
submerged in the water from distances of 15 to 50 feet from the shore, an indicator of the high
water level at that time. Mountains to the west can be seen from the recreation area as well as
new homes sited along the edge of the mountains. Development around the lake is nearly
hidden from view by trees surrounding the water’s edge. Trees also nearly hide the hills to the
east, but houses on tops of the hills are partially visible between the foliage. The aesthetic
quality of the water in the lake is not inviting from close range due to floating vegetation that
contributes to the water’s murky appearance.
The baseball stadium is located close to the water in the southeastern part of the city. From this
vantage point, an inlet of the lake created by the levee is visible. A distant view of the lake is
available from just outside the stadium, but does not dominate the landscape due to the
distance from the lake. Most of the views across from the ballpark are of dry, brown grasses
and scattered trees, a portion of which has been set-aside as a wildlife habitat area. From this
vantage point, a newer housing development can be seen on the hills located to the west of the
freeway. Older homes, small buildings and a newer housing development can be seen
immediately across the lake to the north. Trees and heavy vegetation make it difficult to see
any development clearly. A wide dirt trail available for pedestrians to walk to the edge of the
lake is visible from the stadium.
                                                 4-89

A second boat launch and day-use public recreation area is located on the eastern edge of the
lake. The lake can be seen from north to south with the Santa Ana Mountains forming a
backdrop at this vantage point. The lake fills up a large portion of the viewpoint, making it the
dominant feature. Residential developments can be seen towards the west of the lake from the
boat launch. Unobstructed views of the residential development on the north end of the lake are
clearly visible from the boat launch. As of the summer of 2005, the visual character of land that
has been recently graded contrasts with the forest green shrubs and trees surrounding the new
project. Other development to the east of the boat launch is visible, but partially obscured by
trees.
The area immediately surrounding the boat launch is covered by dark sand and a short distance
to the north there is a small patch of grass and recreation-oriented facilities. Large shade trees
on the grassy patch provide relief from the sun for visitors. The area is characterized by more
recreational activities and facilities than other vantage points including a visitor parking lot,
boat launch, established swimming area, and restrooms.
From the Country Club Heights subdivision there’s a spectacular view of the lake where the
Aloha Pier, Yacht Club and Pavilion once stood. In the late 1920’s it was an obvious gathering
place along the shore, and in its heyday orchestras played in the pavilion and dances were held
on weekend nights. With boat races on the lake and swings and play equipment for children, it
was the spot where the action was.
Sources of Light and Glare
Appendix G of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines contains the Initial
Study Environmental Checklist form that includes questions relating to aesthetics. One of the
aesthetic issues addresses whether the “project” will create a new source of substantial light or
glare that would adversely affect the day or nighttime views of the area. Light and glare
impacts to the Palomar Mountain Observatory are of concern.
Based on data provided by Palomar Observatory, areas of light pollution impacts have been
identified through a “ring analysis” as seen in Figure 4.12, Palomar Lighting Impact Analysis
Area. Primary impacts to the observatory’s ability to study in dark sky’s fall within a 30-mile
radius, while secondary impacts are up to 45 miles. Mitigation for dark sky within these areas
will require the development of light pollution standards for individual projects.

In assessing current conditions, light and glare from existing development is minimal. Light
and glare during the day and night is created from various residential, commercial, and
industrial uses throughout the city. Examples of these sources include street lamps, accent and
security lighting on buildings, parking lot lighting, and vehicle headlights at night. Substantial
sources of night lighting include the existing ballpark and public parks. Alliance Skate Park of
Lake Elsinore located in McVicker Park is open until 9 pm most evenings and other public
parks are open until 10 pm for recreation purposes. Sources of glare during the day result
primarily from parked cars located in large parking lots and from sunlight reflected off of
window glazing on buildings.

4.9         Sustainable Environment
4.9.1       Introduction
As Lake Elsinore grows, so does the need to create and utilize additional strategies to counter
the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change. The built environment represents a
major opportunity for the City, along with local designers, engineers, developers, builders,
lenders, appraisers, and other sectors of the building trades, to address local and global
environmental adverse effects. Promoting “green building” and energy and resource efficient
building practices is one such strategy.
Green building practices provide the framework and tools to build in an efficient, healthy, and
ecologically responsible manner. Encouraging green building practices is in the public’s
interest because these techniques:
            Promote Lake Elsinore’s energy, land use, environmental, and growth-management
             policies.
            Conserve energy, water, and other natural resources.
            Strengthen established goals related to increased density, mixed-use, and transit-
             oriented development, storm water and erosion control, and increased bicycle and
             pedestrian access.

 Chapter 4.0
            Save building owners and tenants money through increased operation and
             maintenance efficiencies.
            Improve indoor air quality and the health, well being, and productivity of
             occupants.
            Help reduce public infrastructure costs related to development.
            Minimize significant local ecological effects on habitat, air, soil, and water through
             efficient site and building design, sustainable construction practices, and low
             impact building materials and operational practices.
            Keep money in the local economy and create new local industries and jobs thereby
             reducing the dependence on automobiles and fossil fuels.
4.9.2       Sustainable Environment Goal, Policies and Implementation
            Program
Goal 14         Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all activities within
                the City boundaries to support the State’s efforts under AB-32

4.1         Summary

Lake Elsinore’s natural resources and open space are important to the                 plants and
heritage, character, and overall quality of life of the community. This               thirty-six

4.2         Biological Resources
Biological resources include natural biotic
habitats     (vegetative     communities        and
corresponding wildlife habitats) and associated
flora and fauna. There are sixteen (16) distinct
biotic habitats plus agriculture and developed
lands that occur in the City and/or its Sphere of
Influence (SOI). Several of the habitats are
considered “sensitive” or “special status”
because they are unique, have a relatively
limited distribution in the region, or have a high
wildlife value as defined by federal, state, and
local government conservation programs. Each                      Coastal Sage Scrub
of these habitats provides cover, food, and water
necessary to meet biological requirements of a variety of animal species. Nineteen (19) plants
and thirty-six (36) animals within the City and/or the SOI’s habitats are accorded the “special
status” designation. However, only a few of these animals are on the Federal Endangered
Species Act List as threatened or endangered. Wetland features within the City and/or the SOI
include coastal and valley freshwater marsh, lacustrine ecosystems, and vernal pools.
Lake Elsinore is the permanent and seasonal home to a wide variety of birds and serves an
important role as a way station on the Pacific flyway for hordes of migrating waterfowl
traveling from Alaska to South America. A short list of resident and often nesting birds include
great blue herons, great egrets, night herons, osprey, white-tailed kites, western grebes, terns,
gulls, black-necked stilts, avocets, killdeer, and plovers. In addition, about 50 North American
white pelicans appear to reside at Lake Elsinore year-round and a number of white-faced Ibis
have been regularly spotted around the lake within recent years, both species of special concern
to the state. The heron nesting sites adjacent to Lake Elsinore are an integral part of the lake’s
                                                 4-1

 Chapter 4.0
natural heritage and aquatic ecosystem. Although these herons are not on the endangered or
threaten species list, they are, nevertheless, locally important wildlife resources.
In 2004, the City adopted the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation
Plan (MSHCP), a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional effort that focuses on conservation of 146
species and their associated habitats within western Riverside County. The MSHCP serves as a
Habitat Conservation Plan pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the federal Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as well as a Natural Communities Conservation Plan (NCCP) under the NCCP Act of
2001. The MSHCP is used to allow the participating jurisdictions (i.e., the County of Riverside,
City of Lake Elsinore, and the other fifteen (15) participating cities) to authorize “take” of plants
and wildlife species identified within the plan area for private projects and public works
projects within the MSHCP areas. Under the MSHCP, the wildlife agencies will grant take
authorization for otherwise lawful actions in exchange for the assembly and management as
coordination of the MSHCP Conservation Areas.
One of the conditions of the incidental take permits associated with the MSHCP is that the City
and other plan participants must assemble a reserve system of approximately 500,000 acres to
connect current and future conserved lands. Approximately 3,500 acres in the City and the SOI
are part of the existing reserve system within the MSHCP. The City’s conservation target under
the MSHCP is to add between 4,830 and 7,870 acres to the MSHCP over the next 25 years. This
conservation target is to be balanced to ensure that the City remains in an economically
competitive relationship with other Cities in terms of commercial and industrial development
as well as providing sufficient residential inventory to comply with regional housing
requirements.
The General Plan recognizes the need to balance growth with the conservation and
enhancement of the area’s natural resources as development can impact resources such as water
quality and associated watersheds. The goals and policies in this section are designed to
enhance and preserve the City’s existing natural resources while balancing the City’s other
imperatives for balanced economic growth.
4.2.1       Biological Resources Baselines
Existing and Proposed Conservation Areas
of the MSHCP
The City of Lake Elsinore is focusing its conservation
efforts on adding lands to existing core reserves and
linkages within and adjacent to the Elsinore Area Plan.
According to data available at the time this General
Plan Update was prepared, approximately 3,500 acres
in the City and SOI are part of the existing reserve
system within the MSHCP. The City’s goal is to add
between 4,830 acres and 7,870 acres to the reserve                Sign Identifying One of the City's
                                                                 Many Habitat Conservation Areas

system within the City over a 25-year period. As of the 2004 annual report, 868 acres were
conserved. Since February 2000, a total of 2,190 acres has been conserved, which is 34% of the
middle range of the target conservation. Under the MSHCP and its permits, the City reviews
proposed land uses in the “criteria area” to determine if they are consistent with the MSHCP’s
conservation goals and if the uses will contribute to assembling the reserves. The MSHCP in
the City of Lake Elsinore is addressed in open space and conservation policies in the General
Plan. There also are MSHCP survey, habitat evaluation, and mitigation fee requirements that
apply to projects in the City, which are administered through the Community Development
Department.
Existing Biological Resources
The City and SOI are located in the Elsinore Valley, which is bounded on the west by the east
flank of the rugged Santa Ana Mountains and rises into hills to the east. MSHCP maps, and
Table 4-1, indicate that approximately 13,000 acres of the total area are developed lands or have
exotic vegetation, and approximately 600 acres are agricultural lands. The remainder of the
MSHCP-designated area is natural vegetation communities, primarily chaparral and
Riversidian sage scrub. Table 4-1 indicates the natural community types. Each type and its
associated species are described in more detail in the sections below. Designated and proposed
conservation areas within the City and SOI are identified and described.
4.2.2       Natural Communities
There are sixteen (16) natural communities, plus agricultural and developed lands, that occur in
the City and its SOI as listed in Table 4-1 and shown on Figure 4.1, Vegetation Communities.
Several of the natural communities are considered “sensitive” or “special status” habitats
because they are unique, have relatively limited distribution in the region, or have high wildlife
value as defined by federal, state, and local government conservation programs. Many are, or
correspond to, vegetation series and associations identified in the California Natural Diversity
Database (CNDDB) as “rare.” Such communities within the City and its SOI include
    Coastal sage scrub                            Riparian Forest
    Riversidian sage scrub                        Riparian Scrub
    Diegan coastal sage scrub                     Southern willow scrub
    Riversidian alluvial fan sage scrub           Southern cottonwood-willow riparian forest
    Chaparral                                     Southern sycamore-alder riparian forest
    Oak Woodland                                  Coastal and valley freshwater marsh
    Coast live oak woodland                       Open Water/Reservoir/Pond
    Dense Englemann oak woodland                  Vernal pools

Nonnative Grassland
Nonnative grasslands are characterized by a dense to sparse cover of annual grasses with
flowering culms (stems) 0.2 to 1.5 meters high. They are often associated with numerous
species of showy-flowered native wildflowers, especially in years of favorable rainfall.
Flowering occurs with the onset of the late-fall rains, and growth, flowering, and seed-set occur
from winter through spring. With a few exceptions, the plants are dead through the summer-
fall dry season, persisting as seeds. Nonnative grasslands occur on fine-textured soils that are
moist during the winter rainy season and very dry during summer and fall. Adjacent
communities may include oak woodland on moister, better-drained soils.
Composed almost entirely of annual grasses and other herbaceous annuals, this community is
dominant over a large area immediately southwest of Lake Elsinore but existing also as a
mosaic interspersed with coastal sage scrub communities. Plants typical of this community
include several species of brome (Bromus spp.), wild oat (Avena spp.), filaree (Erodium spp.),
schismus (Schismus spp.), fescue (Vulpia spp.), and a variety of wildflowers such as California
poppy (Eschscholtzia californica), phacelia (Phacelia spp.), and goldfields (Lasthenia californica).
Coastal Sage Scrub
Coastal sage scrub is characterized by low shrubs and an absence of trees. Shrubs include either
pure stands or mixtures of coarse, deciduous species that drop their leaves in response to
periodic drought conditions. Coastal sage scrub occurs primarily below 914 meters (3,000 feet)
above mean sea level on western slopes of mountains; on steep, south-facing, wind-exposed
slopes; and in areas where the marine layer penetrates inland to foothills and canyons. Soils are
typically well drained and relatively shallow. Shrubs are more widely spaced than in chaparral
and do not have the characteristic rigidity or thick drought-resistant leaves of those in
chaparral. Remaining dormant throughout the dry season, plants either drop their leaves or
produce smaller leaves on secondary shoots, which reduces water loss. Root systems are
generally shallow, and some shrubs store water in succulent leaves and stems. Other plants
produce aromatic oils from the surfaces of leaves, making them less appealing to grazing
animals and reducing water loss but at the cost of increased flammability during the fire season.
Typical species in this community include California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), long-
stemmed buckwheat (E. elongatum), California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), white sage
(Salvia apiana), black sage (Salvia mellifera), bush monkeyflower (Mimulus longiflorus), brittlebush
(Encelia farinosa), California bush sunflower (Encelia californica), coast goldenbush (Isocoma
menziesii), laurel sumac (Malosma laurina), deerweed (Lotus scoparius), golden yarrow
(Eriophyllum confertiflorum), coast prickly pear (Opuntia littoralis), and lupines (Lupinus spp.).
Riversidian Sage Scrub
Riversidian sage scrub typically is a fairly open vegetation community, with at least 20 percent
cover by California sagebrush, California buckwheat, and Spanish brome (Bromus madritensis).
See description of coastal sage scrub above for additional details about plant species

composition. In the City and SOI, this community occurs in many locations, often on hills and
slopes adjacent to developed areas. In many locations, the herb layer of the Riversidian sage
scrub is dominated by nonnative invasive forbs and grasses, which reduces the quality of these
areas as potential habitat for various species.
Riversidian sage scrub is considered a special-status or sensitive habitat.
Diegan Coastal Sage Scrub
Similar to Riversidian sage scrub, this community is found where moisture is more abundant.
Dominant species are California sagebrush, California buckwheat, laurel sumac, lemonade
berry (Rhus integrifolia), and white sage. This community occurs only in small patches within
the existing City limits; substantially more acres of this type occur in the SOI than in the City.
Riversidian Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub
Riversidian alluvial fan sage scrub grows on sandy, rocky alluvial soils deposited by streams
that experience periodic flooding. The soils in these areas are well drained to excessively
drained and have low water-holding capacity and low fertility. Vegetation consists of drought-
deciduous subshrubs and large evergreen woody shrubs adapted to these soil characteristics
and capable of survival, or rapid recruitment, after intense periodic flooding and erosion.
Pioneer, intermediate, and mature stages of the alluvial fan sage scrub plant community are
often distinguished. The pioneer stage has sparse vegetation and low plant diversity. The
intermediate stage is characterized by dense vegetation dominated by subshrubs. The mature
stage has dense, full-grown subshrubs, along with evergreen woody shrubs. Scale-broom is a
shrub species found most often on alluvial soils associated with drainages. Other common
shrub species of this vegetation community are often characteristic species of either Riversidian
sage scrub or chaparral communities. These common subshrub species include coastal
sagebrush, California buckwheat, chamise, brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), hairy yerba santa
(Eriodictyon trichocalyx), sugarbush, birch-leaved mountain mahogany, and deerweed (Lotus
scoparius).
Small patches of this community are present in the City in washes where the soil has been
deposited and periodically scoured by flowing water from slopes above. Soils tend to be sandy
and porous. Substantially more acres of this community occur in the SOI than in the City.
Riversidian alluvial fan sage scrub is considered a special-status/sensitive habitat.
Chaparral
Chaparral is widely distributed on dry slopes and ridges at low and mid-elevations. It typically
consists of shrubs with tough, broad leaves, although species composition may vary
considerably with many different subtypes. This community also is highly adapted to periodic
natural fires.

Chamise chaparral, which is the most common chaparral type in Riverside County, is
dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum). Southern mixed chaparral often occurs
adjacent to Riversidian sage scrub and chamise chaparral but generally on sites with more
moisture. Common chaparral shrubs include toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), chamise, several
California lilacs (Ceanothus megacarpus, C. crassifolius, C. cuneatus, and C. spinosus), birch-leaved
mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), and scrub oak
(Quercus berberdifolia).
Generally taller and denser than sage scrub communities, this community is found in the City
primarily on the eastern slopes of the Santa Ana Mountains. It is more broadly distributed in
the SOI.
Oak Woodland
Oak woodland varies from open savannas with grassy understories to fairly dense woodlands
with shrubby understories. This community typically integrates with both nonnative grassland
and riparian woodland. Annual rainfall is generally between 38 and 64 centimeters (15 and 25
inches), and intermittent streams may be present. The dominant trees in the Riverside area are
coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), with smaller amounts of Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii),
black walnut (Juglans californica), western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), toyon, and blue
elderberry (Sambucus mexicana). Smaller trees and shrubs along with herbaceous plants and
grasses that form the vegetative understory include sugar bush (Rhus ovata), squawbush (Rhus
trilobata), poison–oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), coastal wood fern (Dryopteris arguta), and
bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinium).
Within the City and SOI this community is typically located near intermittent stream courses
and is known to occur in the canyons on the east face of the Santa Ana Mountains.
Coast Live Oak Woodland
Coast live oak woodlands vary from closed-canopy stands of coast live oak to mixtures with
conifers and broadleaf trees to open savannas. The shrub layer is poorly developed but may
include toyon, laurel sumac, or blue elderberry. The herb component is typically continuous
and dominated by rip-gut brome (Bromus diandrus) and several other introduced species. This
community typically occurs on north-facing slopes and shaded ravines.
Coast live oak woodland is considered a special-status/sensitive habitat. It occurs in both the
City and SOI, with substantially more acres in the SOI than in the City.
Dense Englemann Oak Woodland
Dense Englemann oak woodland is a climax woodland dominated by Englemann oak (Quercus
englemannii), with coast live oak as an additional significant constituent. The understory is
composed of typical grassland species. Canopy cover is dense. This vegetation community
                                                 4-9

appears on moderately moist sites, especially in steep canyons. Dense Englemann oak
woodlands are known to occur southeast of Lake Mathews between Gavilan Road and Lake
Mathews Drive.
Dense Englemann oak woodland is considered a special-status/sensitive habitat. It occurs in
the SOI but not within the City boundaries.
Riparian Forest, Woodland, and Scrub
Riparian forests and woodlands are dependent on the presence of or proximity to nonseasonal
water sources. The water may be surface water or shallow groundwater. Riparian woodlands
may measure a few meters in width to much broader, depending on water flow. Where non-
seasonal streams flow out of the mountains and onto flatter grasslands, the riparian woodland
community may be a relatively broad one, but in the higher elevations where water flows down
a narrow passageway often confined by steep hillsides, this community may be very narrow.
Riparian woodland may also occupy areas surrounding human-made lakes and reservoirs.
Typical species of this community include willows (Salix spp.), western sycamore, black walnut,
Fremont and black cottonwood (Populus fremontii and P. trichocarpa), white alder (Alnus
rhombifolia), coast live oak, mule fat (Baccharis salicifolia), and smaller plants such as poison-oak,
California blackberry, horsetails (Equisetum spp.), and scarlet and creek monkeyflower (Mimulus
cardinalis and M. guttatus).
Riparian scrub is characterized as a scrubby streamside thicket, dominated by any of several
willows, mule fat, or a mix of these. Vegetation may vary from open to impenetrable. Willows
typically occur on relatively fine-grained sand and gravel bars that are close to river channels
and/or groundwater. Coarser substrate soils or areas where there is relatively great depth to the
water table favors dominance by mule fat. This early successional community may precede any
of several riparian woodland or forest types absent severe flooding disturbance.
Riparian forest and scrub communities occur along streambeds in the City and SOI and along
the shore of Lake Elsinore. Types include southern willow scrub, composed of relatively small
willows and mulefat; southern cottonwood – willow riparian forest, with taller willows and
cottonwoods; and southern sycamore – alder riparian woodland, composed of western
sycamore, white alder, and often lower densities of willows, cottonwoods, or oaks. In general,
all riparian communities are considered to be special-status/sensitive habitats.
Southern Willow Scrub
Southern willow scrub is distinguished by dense, broadleaved, winter-deciduous riparian
thickets dominated by several willow species, including black willow, sandbar willow, red
willow (Salix laevigata), and arroyo willow, with scattered Fremont cottonwood and western
sycamore. Most stands are too dense to allow much understory development. Typical soils
include loose, sandy, or fine gravelly alluvium deposited near stream channels during flood
flows. This community requires repeated flooding to prevent succession to southern
                                                 4-10

cottonwood – sycamore riparian forest. It occurs in both the
City and SOI and is considered a special-status/sensitive
habitat.
Southern Cottonwood – Willow Riparian Forest
Southern cottonwoods are dominated by Fremont cottonwood,
black cottonwood, and several tree willows. Understories
consist of shrubby willows. The dominant species require
moist, bare mineral soil.         Sub-irrigated and frequently
overflowed lands along rivers and streams provide the
necessary conditions for germination and establishment. Other
typical plant species include California mugwort, mule fat,
wild cucumber (Marah macrocarpus), western sycamore,
Goodding’s black willow (Salix gooddingii), sandbar willow
(Salix exigua), yellow shining willow (Salix lasiandra), arroyo
willow (Salix lasiolepis), and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). It
occurs in the SOI and is considered to be a special-                       Gunnerson Pond
status/sensitive habitat.
Southern Sycamore—Alder Riparian Woodland
Southern sycamore – alder riparian woodland is a tall, open, broadleaved, winter-deciduous
streamside woodland dominated by western sycamore and white alder. These stands seldom
form closed canopy forests and may appear as trees scattered in a shrubby thicket of hard
drought-resistant evergreens and deciduous species. Soils consist of very rocky streambeds
subject to seasonally high-intensity flooding. White alder increases in abundance on more
perennial streams, while western sycamore favors more intermittent hydrographs. Other
common forms of vegetation include California mugwort, coast live oak, horsetail, smilo grass
(Piptatherum miiaceum), California blackberry, poison-oak, blue elderberry, and stinging nettle
(Urtica dioica). This woodland is considered to be a special-status/sensitive habitat.
Marsh
Marsh communities are dominated by perennial, emergent flowering plants (monocots)
generally up to 4 to 5 meters tall. Vegetation often forms completely closed canopies. Bulrush
(Scirpus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.) species dominate. Marsh communities are found on sites
permanently inundated by fresh water and lacking significant current. Conditions of prolonged
saturation permit accumulation of deep, peaty soils in this community.
Coastal and Valley Freshwater Marsh
This community is generally found in areas with slow-moving or ponded water where shallow
topography is subject to prolonged saturation. One of these areas is northeast of Lake Elsinore,

around a small lake that was created several years ago.
It is recognized by the presence of plants that grow up
through shallow water, such as cattail, bullrush, and
sedge. This community occurs in the City but not the
SOI and is considered a special-status/sensitive habitat.

ecosystems and are characterized by inland depressions           Rare White Pelicans in the Back Basin.
or dammed riverine channels containing standing
water, including both near-shore (limnetic) and deepwater habitats (littoral). Usually, to meet
this classification, each area must exceed 20 acres (8 hectares) and be deeper than 6.6 feet (2
meters). The lower San Jacinto River, Lake Elsinore, and several other ponds and creeks within
the study area provide open water habitat relatively free of vegetation that supports fish,
amphibians, and waterfowl. Among the warm water fishery species that provide recreational
fishing in Lake Elsinore are largemouth bass, catfish, and crappie. Recent efforts to improve the
water quality in Lake Elsinore have included the harvesting of carp in order to restructure the
fishery composition and the installation of a series of axial flow pumps designed to increase
vertical water circulation, thereby maintaining higher levels of dissolved oxygen in the water.
These areas are subject to a wide range of regulations and, depending on site-specific
conditions, typically are considered to be a special-status/sensitive habitat.
Vernal Pools
Vernal pools are seasonal wetlands that form in localized depressions with subsurface
hardpans, allowing ponded rainwater to remain above the surface into the dry season. These
seasonal wetlands create a moist environment to which a specialized group of plant species has
adapted. Species composition varies among pools and among years. However, common
species in vernal pools in or near the project area include woolly marbles (Psilocarphus
brevissimus), toad rush (Juncus bufonius), spike rush (Eleocharis species), wire-stem popcorn
flower (Plagiobothrys leptocladus), Mexican speedwell (Veronica peregrina ssp. xalapensis), annual
hairgrass (Deschampsia danthonioides), alkali pepper-grass (Lepidium dictyotum), and water
pygmy weed (Crassula aquatica); many special-status species are also present.
Agricultural Lands
Limited areas of groves, orchards, and cropland persist in the study area. These lands have
little value as habitat for wildlife other than those species highly adapted to disturbance.

Residential/Urban/Exotic
A substantial portion of the area within the Lake Elsinore SOI has been developed. Remaining
natural resources in this area are now limited to ornamental trees and garden shrubs that may
provide some habitat for nesting birds.
4.2.3        Special-Status Species
Plants and animals are identified as being “special status” species if they are listed or proposed
for listing under federal or state law; identified as “sensitive,” “a species of concern,” or “a
species of special concern” on lists maintained by federal or state agencies; or are on the list of
biologically endangered and rare plant species maintained by the California Native Plant
Society. Table 4-2 identifies the special-status species that are known to occur or have a
reasonable potential for occurrence in the City and its SOI.

4.2.4       Existing and Proposed Conservation Areas
The City is a participating agency in the MSHCP and as such is working with Riverside County,
other cities in the region, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), California Department of Fish
and Game (DFG), California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), California State Parks,
U.S. Forest Service, and U.S. Bureau of Land Management to consolidate the lands needed to
complete the MSHCP Reserve area over a 25-year period. Specifically, the City is focusing on
adding lands to existing core reserves and linkages within and adjacent to the Elsinore Area
Plan, public and quasi-public lands that are part of the existing MSHCP conservation area; and
the criteria area in and adjacent to the City and SOI as shown in Figure 4.2, MSHCP Criteria
Areas. MSHCP maps indicate approximately 3,500 acres in the City and SOI are part of the
existing MSHCP conservation area. The MSHCP criteria area depicted and discussed within
the maps and text published grids of one-quarter section descriptor “cells” allow the City to
focus and distribute the conservation effort between land owner development interests and
permanent conservation based on the City Council’s independent land use authority.
Development would be allowed in areas designated as MSHCP conservation areas through the
City LEAP program based on tradeoffs for conservation acreage dedication or acquisitions
pursuant to the MSHCP program.

                landowners.
Policies
1.1   The City shall continue to participate in the Western Riverside County Multiple Species
      Habitat Conservation Plan, the LEAPS program, and the Implementing Agreement; with a
      strategy that focuses on quality assemblage of conservation acreage. The City shall work
      toward the lower end of the conservation acreage range as promised by the County
      during the adoption of the MSHCP by the City.
1.2   Evaluate the installation of barrier fencing or other buffers between MSHCP Conservation
      Areas and proposed public and private land uses that may be incompatible with the
      Conservation Areas in order to minimize illegal/unauthorized public access, domestic
      animal predation, or dumping in the Conservation Areas while not impeding wildlife
      movement.
1.3   The City’s Conceptual Reserve Design shall be developed in accordance with Section 3.2.3
      of the MSHCP as amended, and may rely upon the flexibility permitted by the MSHCP
      where appropriate in conducting the Reserve Assembly Accounting set forth in Section 6.7
      of the MSHCP.
1.4   Encourage revegetation with native plants compatible with natural surrounding habitat
      where soils have been disturbed during construction, and discourage plants identified in
      the MSHCP as unsuitable for conservation areas.
1.5   The City shall coordinate with the Regional Conservation Authority to have that agency
      acquire native habitat areas as permanent open space and allow public trail access where
      appropriate.
1.6   The City shall establish a plan for a trail network intended for active or passive use within
      public open space areas and traversing around and through MSHCP Conservation areas
      where compatible with guidelines set forth in the MSHCP and City Council MSHCP
      policies.
1.7   The City shall require all new trails, trailheads, conservation signage, interpretive centers,
      and maintenance facilities established within MSHCP Conservation areas to follow the
                                                  4-23

 Chapter 4.0
      Guidelines for the Siting and Design of Trails and Facilities, as set forth in Section 7.4.2 of
      the MSHCP.
1.8   The City shall consult with the Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) and adjacent
      jurisdictions to ensure proper adherence to MSHCP guidelines and to allow for a
      maximum level of regional interconnection of trails systems. The City shall reduce,
      modify or add to the regional interconnections and linkages based on new biological
      analysis brought forward during the CEQA and LEAP processes.
Implementation Program        Through the MSHCP, LEAP and CEQA processes the City shall
      identify and conserve important biological habitats while balancing economic growth and
      property rights.

Goal 2          Protect sensitive plant and wildlife species residing or
                occurring within the City.
Policies
2.1   Biological resources analyses of proposed projects shall include discussion of potential
      impacts to any plant or wildlife species that is officially listed as threatened or endangered
      by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and/or the California Department of Fish
      and Game but not covered by the MSHCP.
2.2   Development or modification shall be discouraged in areas containing riparian habitat of
      high functions and values or corridors with 80% or more of natural native habitat that link
      larger patches of natural native habitat containing 80% or more native plant species.
      Further, development in areas described for conservation, including areas planned for
      riparian/riverine restoration included in the MSHCP, shall also be discouraged.
2.3   The City shall encourage the development of a Native Tree Planting and Maintenance
      Program that presents guidelines for selecting and locating trees to support wildlife,
      improve air and water quality, and reduce energy consumption.
Implementation Program        The City shall continue to implement the Western Riverside
      County MSHCP.

City’s increasing land values and increased commercial and residential
interest. Open space on lands that contain endangered species and
related habitat, or located within linkages, may be designated for permanent preservation
under the MSHCP during the project review process, subject to the City’s LEAP program.
Additional open space areas outside of the MSHCP will also be needed to achieve a healthy
balance between urban areas and the natural environment.
Direct public access is currently not widely available to many of the City’s open space areas and
may likely be restricted out of the MSHCP conservation area within the City and SOI.
Residents desire protection of these unique resources while also making the open space
resources more accessible to the public. The policies in this section are intended to protect open
space areas while also making them more accessible to the public for visual and recreational
opportunities.
4.3.2       Open Space Baselines
The General Plan Land Use designations exhibited in Figure 2.1a show areas designated as open
space within the City. Open space on land that contains endangered species and related habitat
may be designated for permanent preservation under the MSHCP. Land on steep slopes is
sometimes difficult and costly to develop and therefore will also likely remain as permanent
open space until land values and design standards allow development. Land currently within
the floodplain of local drainages, including Lake Elsinore and Temescal Creek, have been left
vacant currently in order to avoid flooding and have been delineated accordingly as Open
Space. Figure 4.3 illustrates a vacant land inventory in 2009.
4.3.3       Open Space/Recreation/MSHCP Land Use Designations
As of 2007, approximately 31,626 acres have been dedicated to parks and open space, with
approximately 322 acres devoted to parks and the remainder (approximately 31,304 acres)
designated as vacant land. This General Plan would allow for approximately 18,236 acres of
permanent open space, recreation, and MSHCP preserve areas. Approximately 13,525 acres
will be designated as open space, and 2,029 recreation. Further, approximately 7,187.1 acres
within the planning area are identified as within the MSHCP preserve.

4.3.4       Open Space Goal, Policies and
            Implementation Program
Goal 3          Provide an open space layout
                within the City that will
                enhance the recreational and
                visual experiences of all City
                residents and visitors.
Policies
3.1   Maximize the MSHCP conservation areas and                A View of the City from the West
      other open space that is available for public use.
3.2   The City shall ensure that passive and active open space uses are incorporated into
      development areas.
3.3   Development on steep slopes in public or private property shall require contour grading.
3.4   Preserve the City’s visual character, in particular the surrounding hillsides, which
      topographically define the lake region.
Implementation Program         The City shall consider modifying the existing grading ordinance
      to include contour grading or other methods and concepts that protect and enhance steep
      slopes, including enforcement procedures and appropriate access.

4.4         Water Resources
4.4.1       Introduction
The City lies in an arid region where water is a limited resource. Fortunately, the City contains
a wealth of raw and nonpotable reclaimed water resources, such as Lake Elsinore, the San
Jacinto River, and the Temescal Wash and treated water plants, as depicted in Figure 4.4,
Hydrologic Resources. As such, it is important that all water resources be protected and
conserved while enhancing their overall quality as the City increasingly becomes more
urbanized.

Lake Elsinore, which currently contains 3,412 surface acres of water and encompasses many
lake-oriented recreational facilities, is the City’s largest and most significant water resource.
However, Lake Elsinore varies widely in size in response to hydrologic conditions, ranging
from 6,000 acres in very wet years to portions of a dry lakebed in drought years.
Efforts to stabilize the lake level to a satisfactory level should be supported so that the area
surrounding the lake can be increasingly developed with water-oriented recreational
opportunities that the City’s residents can enjoy. The policies in this section are intended to
conserve and improve water resources.
4.4.2        Water Resources Baselines
The following discussion addresses the existing surface and groundwater hydrology, drainage,
water quality, and potential flooding conditions extant within the City.
Hydrology
The study area has a typical Mediterranean climate with wet, cool winters, and warm, dry
summers. Most of the rainfall occurs between November and April, with an average annual
rainfall of 13.7 inches.
Surface Water
The primary surface water features within the project area are Lake Elsinore, the San Jacinto
River, and Temescal Wash (see Figure 4.4). Railroad Canyon Reservoir releases flows to the San
Jacinto River. The San Jacinto River flows into Lake Elsinore, which in turn flows into Temescal
Wash during periods of high lake levels. As shown in Figure 4.4, the drainage patterns within
the City and SOI can be divided into three basins, including the Temescal area, Lake Elsinore,
and Santa Margarita.
Lake Elsinore is natural in origin and measures approximately 5 miles long by 2 miles wide. In
an effort to maintain a more constant lake level, a levee was constructed across the lake in 1995
to reduce the size of the water surface and minimize evaporation. The levee also provides flood
protection up to an elevation of 1,262 feet for the southern end of the lake, an area known as the
Back Basin (see Figure 4.4).
Lake Elsinore is fed by three (3) primary sources of water: runoff from local tributaries, direct
precipitation inputs to the lake surface, and inflows from the San Jacinto River. The percentage
of the total input for each of these sources is 8%, 20%, and 72%, respectively, indicating that the
San Jacinto River is by far the largest source of water reaching Lake Elsinore. Little
groundwater interaction is expected because the lake lies on a relatively impermeable layer of
clay soil.

Groundwater
Elsinore Groundwater Basin General Setting
The Elsinore groundwater basin is supplied primarily by infiltration of precipitation in the
surrounding watershed. Other sources of inflow include infiltration along the San Jacinto River
channel upstream of Lake Elsinore and agricultural and residential return flows. Municipal
pumping for potable water is the only major outflow from the Elsinore groundwater basin.
Some additional groundwater pumping is performed as necessary to help maintain the
elevation of Lake Elsinore at 1,242.4 feet above mean sea level.
Depth to Water Table and Groundwater
Gradient
The depth to groundwater varies considerably
across the project area, ranging from
approximately 50–60 feet in the northern
portion of the basin to approximately 400–
500 feet in the southern portion. The
groundwater gradient naturally follows this
variation in depth, flowing from the northwest
to the southeast underneath Lake Elsinore.
Two faults, Glen Ivy North and Rome Hill,
appear to partially block groundwater flow.

The average groundwater gradient is
approximately 0.016 in the middle of the basin, based on somewhat limited data. This steep
gradient is due to the considerable level of groundwater pumping in the Back Basin.
Groundwater Overdraft
The Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District (EVMWD) Groundwater Management Plan
includes a groundwater budget analysis of the Elsinore basin for the period 1990 to 2000. The
results of the analysis indicate that the basin experiences an average annual deficit of
approximately 1,800 acre-feet per year over the 11-year period studied. Eight of the 11 years
analyzed had a deficit, while the remaining 3 years without a deficit corresponded to above-
average annual precipitation totals. In addition, water levels in wells in the southern portion of
the basin dropped more than 200 feet in the same time period, providing further evidence of a
groundwater overdraft condition. Continuing overdraft may lead to ground subsidence as soils
compact over long periods of time, although no clear evidence of subsidence has currently been
identified around Lake Elsinore.

Flooding
Flood information from the 1990 General
Plan was researched and found to still be
applicable. Following this summary is an
update      of   the    Federal   Emergency
Management        Agency     (FEMA)     flood
mapping information based on a review of
the latest maps.
Regional flood control planning and
facilities construction are within the
                                                       San Jacinto River Bank Full Discharge
jurisdiction of the Riverside County Flood
Control District. The district is also responsible for the maintenance and operation of flood
control facilities, including debris dams, storm channels, and storm drains. The district’s
facilities may be characterized as the “backbone” system of flood control for the region. The
City of Lake Elsinore also owns and maintains certain flood control facilities in the City that are
generally constructed as part of the drainage plans for individual projects. The City ensures
that the construction of these facilities is consistent with the master plans of the Riverside
County Flood Control District.
FEMA prepared a study in 1980 and revised it in 1987 that identified the following flooding
sources in the City: Arroyo del Toro, Channel H, Elsinore Spillway Channel, Lake Elsinore,
Leach Canyon Channel, Lime Street Channel, McVicker Canyon, Ortega Wash, Ortega Channel,
Rice Canyon, San Jacinto River, Stovepipe Canyon Creek, Temescal Wash, Wash G, Wash I, and
Wasson Canyon Creek. The locations of these sources is presented in Figure 4.4.
The San Jacinto River is the major watercourse within the City. Runoff during a 100-year flood
is contained within the riverbed upstream of Interstate 15. Below that point, 100-year flows
presently cause flooding over portions of Railroad Canyon Road. In addition, San Jacinto River
inflows to Lake Elsinore cause the lake to rise substantially to an elevation of 1,267 feet,
inundating inhabited portions of the lakeshore along the southwest and west sides of the lake.
Flooding is exacerbated by the low capacity and high elevation of the Temescal Wash outlet
(1,260 feet).
Temescal Wash is a gradually sloped earth ditch with limited capacity. The channel has
experienced substantial encroachment from residential and commercial development. The 1980
flood caused the condemnation of more than 100 homes and property damage to residential,
commercial and industrial uses in the downtown area. Total damages cost approximately $34
million.
Flooding also occurs from the flow of Wasson Canyon Creek as water flows over Camino del
Norte and spreads out due to an irregular flow line and lack of any defined channel banks.

Backwater forms behind the railway bridge and extends upstream past the Collier Avenue weir
crossing at depths of nearly six (6) feet.
Sheet flow is a flood hazard that exists in developed areas below the mouths of Leach Canyon,
McVicker Canyon, and Rice Canyon. Fully improved, 100-year design channels have been
constructed for Leach Canyon and other washes. However, these facilities do not provide
adequate upstream control at the mouth of the canyons. As a result, only the channels pick up a
portion of the floodwaters, and the remaining runoff is in the form of sheet flooding toward the
lake, with depths of more than one (1) foot.
Flooding from Rice Canyon results from the failure of an earth berm located at the mouth of the
canyon. Failure of the dike allows expansive sheet flooding in a southwest direction into Lake
Elsinore, at depths of less than 1 foot. Flooding generated in McVicker Canyon results in sheet
flow on the alluvial fan below the mouth of the canyon. In the lower reach, these flows combine
with those of Leach and Rice Canyon to create an expansive area of shallow sheet flooding on
the western side of the lake. The potential of
floodwaters carrying debris was determined to
be high by FEMA for Channel H, Leach Canyon,
Lime Street Channel, Ortega Channel, and Rice
Canyon.
Flooding problems also exist in the Sedco Hills
area, east of Mission Trail. Sheet flooding at low
levels during rainy periods occurs in many areas
of Sedco Hills, washing out streets and flooding
property.
Inundation of property and the potential loss of
                                                                Dusk at Lake Elsinore
life due to failure of the Railroad Canyon Dam is
a hazard in the Railroad Canyon Road area and the eastern floodplain of the lake. Railroad
Canyon Reservoir is located in the Canyon Lake Hills development northeast of the City. The
reservoir, constructed in 1927, captures waters of the San Jacinto River, which is the primary
drainage course of the San Jacinto Mountains. The capacity of the reservoir is approximately
12,000 acre-feet. The Railroad Canyon Dam is a concrete arch dam. The City’s subdivision code
requires that the boundaries of the inundation hazard area be identified and noted on all final
maps prior to approval.
Figure 4.4 shows the current FEMA 100-year floodplain within the City and SOI. As shown in
Figure 4.4, the floodplain for Lake Elsinore extends into some areas that are currently developed
with urban uses. The floodplain for Temescal Wash, McVicker Canyon, and the Ortega
Channel also extends into areas characterized by development.
The Riverside County General Plan contains information on potential flooding and dam
inundation. According to the Elsinore Area Plan, the Temescal Wash, Murrieta Creek, and the
                                                4-36

San Jacinto River, as well as Lake Elsinore, pose significant flood hazards. Dam failure of the
Railroad Canyon Dam at Canyon Lake would cause flooding in the plan area.
The flood hazard areas identified in the Elsinore Area Plan are covered by the 100-year
floodplain information shown in Figure 4.4. The information on flood hazards discussed in the
Elsinore Area Plan for the 100-year floodplain do not extend beyond the updated 100-year
FEMA floodplain boundaries shown in Figure 4.4.
The Elsinore Area Plan also refers to the inundation potential associated with a failure of
Railroad Canyon Dam at Canyon Lake. The Elsinore Area Plan shows dam hazard zones that
would occur with failure of the Railroad Canyon Dam. Review of the Elsinore Area Plan finds
that inundation associated with dam hazard zones would not extend beyond the 100-year
floodplain shown in Figure 4.4 of this document. The extent of the High Dam Hazard Zone in
the Elsinore Area Plan actually corresponds with the boundary of the 100-year floodplain for
both Lake Elsinore and San Jacinto River shown in Figure 4.4.
The benefits of the Lake Elsinore Management Project include conserved water during dry
years by reducing evaporation loss and implementing a well system, reduced flood damage,
improved water quality by allowing more frequent discharges, improved recreational lake use,
and enhanced fish and wildlife habitat. Most of the projects were completed by the early 1990s,
but certain components, such as lake replenishment, are ongoing.
Surface Water Quality
Surface water quality is strongly influenced by
local land uses. Pollutant sources in the Lake
Elsinore area are historically caused by
agricultural uses that involve chemicals and
fertilizers.
State Water Resources            Control     Board
Impaired Water Bodies
The State Water Resources Control Board
(SWRCB), in compliance with Clean Water Act
Section 303(d), has prepared a list of impaired
water bodies in the State of California (SWRCB

the development of total maximum daily loads for each contaminant, or stressor, affecting the
water body. On July 25, 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave final
approval to California's 2002 Section 303(d) List of Water Quality Limited Segments.
            Within the City of Lake Elsinore, Lake Elsinore is listed as an impaired water body
             as a part of the SWRCB 303 (d) listing.

Lake Elsinore and San Jacinto Watersheds Authority and the Lake Elsinore
Stabilization and Enhancement Project
As part of the Safe Drinking Water, Clean Water, Watershed Protection, and Flood Protection
Bond Act of 2000 funding (also know as Proposition 13), the Santa Ana Watershed Project
Authority (SAWPA) was named as one of the members of a newly formed Joint Powers
Authority (JPA) called the Lake Elsinore and San Jacinto Watersheds Authority (LESJWA).
Members of LESJWA include Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District, the City of Lake
Elsinore, County of Riverside, the City of Canyon Lake, and SAWPA.
The LESJWA is the lead agency for the Lake Elsinore Stabilization and Enhancement Project.
The enhancement project is necessary because the lake is a “…eutrophic natural reservoir that
exhibits algal blooms, low water clarity, large variations in water level elevation and dissolved
oxygen content, fish kills, and high nutrient conditions.”
A total of $15 million was identified in Proposition 13 for LESJWA to implement projects to
address goals in the watersheds. SAWPA’s role includes providing representation on the
LESJWA board and administration of the agency. The administrative functions include
facilitation of financing projects and programs, including Proposition 13 funds and EPA grant
funds as well as unidentified federal and state financing; administrative support, including
management, accounting, and clerical services; and project management as requested by the
new JPA.
In addition to the Lake Elsinore Stabilization and Enhancement project, the LESJWA has
implemented other projects to improve water quality in the lake. In 2004, recycled water was
added to the lake, lake mixing facilities were constructed, striped bass were added, and carp
were removed from the lake.

             Implementation Program
Goal 4           Improve water quality and ensure
                 the water supply is not degraded as
                 a result of urbanization of the City.
Policies
4.1    Encourage developers to provide clean water systems
       that reduce pollutants being discharged into the
       drainage system to the maximum extent feasible and
       meet required federal National Pollutant Discharge
       Elimination System (NPDES) standards.

      drainage system.
4.3   Require Best Management Practices through project conditions of approval for
      development to meet the Federal NPDES permit requirements.
4.4   The City shall utilize the 1998 North American Vertical Datum to be consistent with the
      national standard for mean sea level, which would increase the measurement of the mean
      sea level for Lake Elsinore by approximately 2.4 feet.
Implementation Program         The City shall support the implementation of Best Management
      Practices to protect the City’s water resources.

4.5          Mineral Resource
4.5.1        SMARA Regulations
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) requires that general
plans classify and map mineral resources designations approved by the State Mining and
Geology Board. SMARA seeks to promote conservation and protection of valuable lands within
the State subject to urban expansion. Sand and gravel are necessary ingredients for urban
construction, and it is advantageous for builders to have a local source of these materials.
However, while extraction of minerals is important to the region’s economy, the general plan
must also balance residential, commercial and other development with mineral extraction
activities. Such mineral extraction activity is an interim use which may ultimately transition to
residential, commercial or other development in order to accomplish other goals of the general
plan. Consequently land use patterns in proximity to resource extraction areas must be carefully
considered to minimize potential conflicts.
Guidelines for Classification and Designation of Mineral Lands, adopted by the State Mining
and Geology Board, require that the State Geologist classify areas into Mineral Resource Zones
(MRZ). In order to classify lands according to availability of mineral resources, the following
MRZ categories are used by the State Geologist:
       MRZ-1: Areas where available geologic information indicates there is little likelihood for
       the presence of significant mineral resources.
       MRZ-2: Areas of identified mineral resource significance. This category is further
       divided on the basis of both degree of knowledge and economic factors. Areas classified
       MRZ-2a contain discovered mineral deposits that are either measured or indicated
       reserves. MRZ-2b areas contain discovered reserves that are either inferred reserves
                                                4-39

 Chapter 4.0
       (limited data) or are deposits presently considered sub-economic. MRZ-2a classification is
       of prime importance since it contains known economic mineral deposits.
       MRZ-3: Areas containing known or inferred mineral occurrences of undetermined
       mineral resource significance.
       MRZ-4: Areas of no known mineral occurrences where geologic information does not
       rule out either the presence or absence of significant mineral resources. There is
       insufficient data to assign any other designation.
4.5.2       Mineral Resource Areas
The City of Lake Elsinore lies within the Temescal Valley Area, Riverside County, California.
Special Report No. 165, prepared in 1991 by the State Department of Conservation, Division of
Mines and Geology, identified construction aggregate, clay deposits, and crushed stone with an
MRZ-2 designation in the City.
The construction aggregate resource areas include sand and gravel deposits in McVicker
Canyon, Rice Canyon and Temescal Wash. The mouth and upstream deposit areas at McVicker
Canyon are within lands subdivided and developed, thereby eliminating this area from
consideration as a sand and gravel reserve. The deposits associated with Rice Canyon and
Temescal Wash are being mined. The long term extraction and recommended use of these lands
are addressed in the specific plans for these areas.
A crushed stone site located along Railroad Canyon Road has been intermittently mined in the
past by the Riverside County Transportation Department and other operators, as a source of
base aggregate for roadway construction. The Railroad Canyon Road site is located within the
approved Cottonwood Hills Specific Plan area.
Significant clay resources are associated with the Alberhill area in the north portion of the City,
and classified by the State since 1982. Clays from this area have been used to produce two main
types of clay products, heavy products such as sewer pipe, brick and tile, and refractory
products such as fire brick, flue lining and pottery. In addition, red “bone clay” is sold directly
for cement use. The Pacific Clay Products deposits are located within the approved Alberhill
Specific Plan and pending Alberhill Villages Specific Plan. The mining activity is being phased
out in accordance with approved permits, and the continued use and ultimate reclamation of
these lands has been or will be addressed in the specific plans prepared for these areas.

4.5.3       Mineral Resources Goal, Policies and Implementation Program
Goal 5         Balance the importance of conserving mineral resource areas
               that have been determined to be significant, the need for
               extracted materials for local construction, and the potential
               impacts and conflicts that may result.
Policies
5.1   The City shall consider the public benefits in allowing extraction activities of mineral
      resources when making land use decisions.
5.2   The City shall require mined property to be left in a condition suitable for reuse in
      conformance with the General Plan land use designations and the California Surface
      Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA).
5.3   The City shall encourage the reuse and recycling of existing aggregate construction
      material for new residential, commercial and industrial development.
Implementation Program        Through the project, CEQA and permitting processes, the City
shall ensure a balance between the conservation of significant mineral resources, the need for
extracted materials for local construction, and proper mitigation for potential impacts and
conflicts between uses.

4.6         Cultural Resources and Paleontological Resources
4.6.1       Introduction
Prior to the era of the Spanish colonization in the late 18th century, the geographic area of the
City and the SOI was inhabited by the Luiseño Indians and possibly other Native Americans.
The term Luiseño has been used to refer to the Takic-speaking people associated with the
Mission San Luis Rey that was developed by the Spaniards.
With the independence of Mexico in the early 19th century, the mission period came to an end,
and it became common practice for large land grants to be issued to those friendly with the
Nationalistic Mexican cause. The Mexican period soon ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe-
Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded much of the southwest to the United States, including all the
lands around La Laguna, the City’s historic name, derived from the Spanish name Laguna
Grande. In 1858, Augustin Machado acquired La Laguna, renamed it Rancho La Laguna, and
became the first landowner to call the lakeshore home since the Indians.
                                               4-41

 Chapter 4.0
Franklin Heald then purchased Rancho La Laguna and founded the town of Elsinore in 1883,
which was named after the famous lake side City of Helsingnor from Shakespeare’s Hamlet.
With the construction of the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railroad and the discovery of
mineral ores in the late 19th century, immigration began to increase significantly to the lake
area. Many people also visited the newly created town of Elsinore looking for recreational
opportunities, which helped to stimulate its tourist industry. In 1972, by popular vote, the area
incorporated and officially became known as the City of Lake Elsinore.
As a result of its historical evolution, the City encompasses significant prehistoric and historical
archaeological sites in addition to a rich record of fossil life. The policies in this section are
intended to promote and preserve the City’s existing cultural and paleontological resources. In
addition, each of the 16 district plans contains goals and policies regarding historical sites and
buildings within its specific boundary.
4.6.2       Cultural and Paleontological Resource Baselines
Prehistoric and Historic Archaeology
The record search indicated that 157 prehistoric and historical archaeological sites have been
previously recorded in the City of Lake Elsinore. Of these 157 sites, two prehistoric
archaeological sites (CA-RIV-1022 and CA-RIV-2798) have been determined eligible for listing
in the NRHP. CA-RIV-1022 is described as a rock shelter and CA-RIV-2798 is recorded as a
prehistoric village site.
Archival research was conducted at the Lake Elsinore Historical Society; the University of
California, Irvine; and the research library at Jones & Stokes. This research was conducted in an
effort to determine the prehistoric, ethnographic, and historic contexts for the City of Lake
Elsinore. The City shall consider adopting the 1988 North American Vertical Datum of 1242.2.
Prehistoric Context
A distinct cultural sequence has yet to be specifically defined for Lake Elsinore. Traditionally,
this area has been incorporated within discussion of Luiseño ethnographic traits, and previous
descriptions depended upon the similarity of the limited assemblages with those from the more
extensively studied Pauma Valley sites (Hampson et al.1992). A discussion of Moratto’s (1984)
Southern Coast Region (San Diego) sequence is based on these comparisons and included here.
In addition, Moratto’s (1984) Desert Region (Colorado River) sequence is also discussed.
Southern Coast Region - San Diego Sequence
San Dieguito (Beginning ca. – 5500 Before Present (B.P.))
This period reflects a generalized hunting tradition distinct from the Desert Tradition.
California units of the San Dieguito Complex include the C.W. Harris site (San Diego County),
