TRANSPORTATION	AND	CIRCULATION	
This  Circulation  Element  provides  the  framework  for  decisions  concerning  the  Town’s  multi‐modal 
transportation system, which includes roadway, transit, bike, and pedestrian, as well as parking facilities.  
The  Circulation  Element  provides  for  coordination  with  the  Napa  County  Transportation  and  Planning 
Agency (NCTPA), which serves as the coordinating agency for transportation funding for Napa County. 
State law (California Government Code Section 65302(b)) mandates that the Circulation Element contain 
the  general  location  and  extent  of  existing  and  proposed  major  thoroughfares,  transportation  routes, 
terminals, military airports and port, and other public utilities and facilities, to the extent these items exist 
in  the  planning  area.    As  required  by  California  Government  Code  Section  65302(b),  the  Circulation 
Element is correlated closely with the land use element and is related to the housing, open‐space, noise, 
and safety elements. 
The Circulation Element reflects the Town’s desire to provide for complete street, bicycle, and pedestrian 
facilities as well as parking accommodations.   This element establishes standards that guide development 
of the transportation system through goals, policies, and actions. 
S ETTING 	
Urban	Context	
Yountville is a compact town set in a semi‐rural atmosphere with a coveted “small town” feel.  Yountville’s 
rustic  and  agricultural  roots  are  present  and  visible  throughout  Old  Town  and  the  community’s  other 
neighborhoods.  The Town of Yountville’s main attractions are famous restaurants and inns, located along 
Washington Street, the Town’s main commercial corridor.  About 30 percent of the population resides in 
the Veterans Home of California, located at the southwest corner of town. 
Being a small town of about 3,000 residents in the heart of the Napa Valley, Yountville is subject to a 
relatively heavy influx of people and cars related to wine country tourism.  Traffic and parking are heaviest 
during weekend afternoons when visitors and employees avail themselves of the many restaurants and 
inns of Yountville.  Maintaining its rural, small town character while accommodating visitors and employee 
impacts is a Town goal and challenge. Providing peaceful traffic flow, appropriate parking, and alternative 
modes of transportation are vital to maintaining Yountville’s reputation for being pedestrian friendly. 
Yountville is split by State Route (SR) 29, a regional route that provides access to Calistoga, St. Helena and 
Clearlake to the north and Napa to the south.  There is a variety of housing types in Yountville, from single 
family homes to townhouses to mobile home communities to the State of California’s Veterans Home.  
Yountville’s relatively small land area and flat topography create many opportunities for residents to walk, 
bicycle, or use the Town funded free trolley service to destinations throughout the community.

Street	Network	
This section describes the physical characteristics of Yountville’s roadway network.  Figure 1 shows the 
major routes in Yountville and the surrounding roadway system. 
SR 29 is the primary route connecting the Town of Yountville to the San Francisco Bay Area to the south 
and Lake County to the north.  The highway is the main route for outer‐Town travel and provides quick 
access to the other side of town. SR 29 is a four‐lane divided highway with an interchange at California 
Drive that transitions to a two‐lane highway as it approaches a signalized intersection at Madison Street.  
Existing daily traffic on the highway averages 22,800 vehicles per day and the posted speed limit is 60 
miles per hour (mph). 
Washington Street runs parallel to SR 29 and is a two‐way street that provides parking on both sides south 
of Yount Street.  It is the only street that provides north‐south connectivity.  North of Yount Street, there 
are many driveways, and only a few on‐street parking spaces.  Sidewalks are located on both sides of the 
street south of Webber Avenue and on the west side from Webber to Madison. The posted speed limit is 
25 mph. 
Yount Street runs north‐south through Yountville to the east of Washington Street which it intersects with 
a sharp skew in the center of town.  It is a two‐lane road with parking and sidewalks on both sides from 
Washington Street to Hopper Creek.  North of Hopper Creek sidewalks are located on the east side of the 
street only.  Bike lanes are located along portions of Yount Street north of the intersection of the Hopper 
Creek path.  The posted speed limit is 25 mph. 
California  Drive  is  a  two‐lane  street  that  connects  the  southeast  and  southwest  (Veterans  home,  golf 
course, Domaine Chandon) areas of town, passing under SR 29. It is the only connector for 30 percent of 
town residents—from the Veterans Home.  There are Class II bike lanes from Washington Street to Solano 
Avenue, sidewalks on the north side of the street, and the posted speed limit is 25 mph.  The portion 
between Washington Street and Solano Avenue is maintained by Caltrans. 
Madison Street is a two‐lane arterial that runs east‐west and connects the northeastern area of the Town 
to SR 29.  Bike lanes are located in both directions and a Class I pedestrian and bicycle path is located on 
the south side of Madison Street just west of Washington Street.  East of Washington there is a lack of 
sidewalk connectivity per Town Council Policy, and the posted speed limit is 25 mph.

  Town of Yountville General Plan Circulation Element
 Figure 1: Circulation Network

Yountville Cross Road runs east‐west and connects the eastern part of the Town to the Silverado Trail.  It 
has one lane in each direction with bike lanes on both sides.  The posted speed limit is 35 mph within 
Town limits, increasing to 45 mph and higher for the segment located in unincorporated Napa County. 
Solano Avenue is an access point into and out of Town at the southwestern edge of town. It has two lanes, 
narrow shoulders, and a speed limit of 35 mph.  The Vine Trail regional Class I path is currently under 
design and will be extended from Trancas Street in the City of Napa to California Drive in Yountville.  The 
path would be located on the east side of Solano Avenue between the railroad and the east side of the 
roadway.  It is scheduled to be constructed during the summer of 2015. 
Finnell Road is a two‐lane local street that extends east from Yount Street then turns north and provides 
access to Yountville Cross Road.  The road borders the Town Hall and adjacent school property on the 
south side and provides access to residential properties via Vista Drive and Heritage Way. 
Traffic	Controls	
The main type of intersection control throughout the Town of Yountville are two‐way (side street stop 
signs with free flow on main street) and all‐way stop controls.  There is one signalized intersection located 
at SR 29/Madison Street at the north end of town which is maintained by Caltrans.  There are nine all‐way 
stop controlled intersections throughout town: 
         Washington Street/Madison Street  
         Washington Street/Yount Street 
         Washington Street/Mulberry Street 
         Washington Street/Oak Circle 
         Washington Street/California Drive 
         Yount Street/Madison Street 
         Yount Street/Mount Avenue 
         Yount Street/Finnell Road 
         Finnell Road/Vista Drive 
         California Drive/Solano Avenue (proposed) 
The intersection of Yount Street/Humboldt Street is a non‐standard intersection due to the unbalanced 
stop control.  There are stop sign controls on the southbound and eastbound approaches with free flow 
conditions on the northbound approach.  The intersection of California Drive/Solano Avenue is proposed 
as an all‐way stop controlled intersection in conjunction with the Napa Vine trail project which will cross 
at this intersection. 
Vehicular	Traffic	Volumes	
Traffic volume counts were collected in late September 2014 for four days, Thursday through Sunday at 
three key street segments in  Yountville including  Yount Street  east of Washington Street,  Washington 
Street south of Madison, and Washington Street north of California Drive. 
Daily traffic volumes averaged 9,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on Washington Street near California Drive.  
The roadway experienced similar volumes throughout the four days of counts with a small range between 
the most and least traveled day, but Saturday experienced the highest volumes of vehicles and Sunday 
had the least amount of traffic.  The existing daily traffic volumes are shown in Plate 1.

Plate 3 – Four Day Count on Yount Street east of Washington Street 
These traffic volume count locations represent the three highest traffic volume locations in the Town of 
Yountville.    With  daily  traffic  volumes  of  9,000  vehicles  per  day  and  less,  the  existing  two‐lane  street 
configurations through the Town are sufficient to service this traffic volume level.  Generally, two‐lane 
roadways can accommodate up to 15,000 vehicles per day. 
Travel	Speeds	
Speed surveys were collected on a typical weekday in June 2014.  Travel speeds were surveyed on the 
primary streets in Yountville including Washington Street, Yount Street, Yountville Cross Road, Madison 
Street, and Finnell Road.  Vehicle speed surveys were completed by W‐Trans and the Town of Yountville 
as part of this effort.  Based on the data collected, the 85th percentile speeds were determined. 
As stated in the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (2012), the 85th percentile, or critical, 
speed is that speed at or below which 85 percent of the observed vehicles were traveling.  It is a well‐
recognized fact among traffic engineers that most drivers are able to drive at reasonable speeds without 
the benefit of any speed limits, speed signs, or enforcement.  The behavior of traffic is a good indication 
of the appropriate speed zone which should apply on a particular highway section.  It is generally felt that 
at least 85 percent of the drivers operate at speeds which are reasonable and prudent for the conditions 
pertaining to each situation.  Therefore, the 85th percentile speed of a spot speed survey is the primary 
indicator of a speed limit which might be imposed subject to the secondary factors of collision experience, 
traffic volumes, road features or other special situations. 
The majority of drivers on the streets in Yountville were traveling between 24 and 28 mph.  The most 
critical speeding conditions are on Yountville Cross Road where the 85th percentile speed was 39 mph in 
a 35 mph zone. Yountville Cross Road connects northeast Yountville with a rural part of Napa County.  It 
should be noted that there already is a radar feedback sign posted at this location.  Figure 2 shows the 
85th percentile speeds on Yountville streets.

 Figure 2: Existing Speed Conditions

Primary	Intersections	
The  following  three  intersections  were  identified  as  those  most  critical  to  Yountville’s  local  circulation 
system and its connectivity to the regional transportation network. 
     1.  Washington Street/Madison Street 
     2.  Washington Street/Yount Street 
     3.  Washington Street/California Drive 
A second set of traffic volumes were obtained in September 2014, during fall harvest season.  Operating 
conditions  during  the  p.m.  peak  period  was  evaluated  to  capture  the  highest  volumes  on  the  local 
transportation network.  The weekday p.m. peak hour occurs between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. and typically 
reflects the highest level of congestion during the homeward bound commute and tourist traffic activities. 
The intersection of Washington Street/Madison Street carries approximately 600 vehicles during a p.m. 
peak period, the intersection of Washington Street/Yount Street carries approximately 500 to 600 vehicles 
during the peak period, and the intersection of Washington Street/California Street carries 720 vehicles 
during the peak period. 
The locations of the study intersections and the existing peak hour traffic volumes are shown in Figure 3. 
In  comparing  these  traffic  volumes  to  past  data  collection,  volumes  at  the  study  intersections  have 
increased  by  approximately  5  percent  at  Washington  Street/Madison  Street  and  Washington  Street/ 
Yount Street and approximately 13 percent at Washington Street/California Street since 2004 which is 
growth rate of approximately 1.1 percent per year.  This is generally a lower rate compared with most 
streets in the North Bay counties which have experienced a rate of approximately 1.5 percent per year. 
Intersection	Level	of	Service 
Levels  of  Service  at  the  study  intersections  were  determined  using  methodologies  published  in  the 
Highway  Capacity  Manual  (HCM),  Transportation  Research  Board,  2000.    This  source  contains 
methodologies for various types of intersection control, all of which are related to a measurement of delay 
in average number of seconds per vehicle. 
The  study  intersections  with  stop  signs  on  all  approaches  were  analyzed  using  the  "All‐Way  Stop‐
Controlled”  Intersection"  methodology  from  the  HCM.    This  methodology  evaluates  delay  for  each 
approach  based  on  turning  movements,  opposing  and  conflicting  traffic  volumes,  and  the  number  of 
lanes.  Average vehicle delay is computed for the intersection as a whole, and is then related to a Level of 
Service. 
The ranges of delay associated with the various levels of service are indicated in Table 3.

LEVEL	OF	SERVICE	STANDARDS	
Objective 1 of the  current Yountville General Plan indicates that LOS C shall  be  the minimum Level of 
Service maintained at all intersections.  Generally, a LOS D threshold is used in most communities so that 
streets are not overbuilt.

Yountville is near complete development with residential units, retail, restaurant, lodging, and civic land 
uses.  It is anticipated that there will be 17 additional residential units built under the proposed General 
Plan land use assumptions of the housing cycle ending 2022, as well as the development of three parcels

SENATE	BILL	743/LEVEL	OF	SERVICE	CHANGES	
In 2013, Senate Bill (SB) 743 (Steinberg, 2013) was adopted, which creates a process to change the way 
that transportation impacts are analyzed under CEQA.  Specifically, SB 743 requires the Governor’s Office 
of  Planning  and  Research  (OPR)  to  amend  the  CEQA  Guidelines  to  provide  an  alternative  to  LOS  for 
evaluating transportation impacts.  Particularly within areas served by transit, those alternative criteria 
must  “promote  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the  development  of  multimodal 
transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses.”  (New Public Resources Code Section 21099(b)(1).) 
Measurements of transportation impacts may include “vehicle miles traveled, vehicle miles traveled per 
capita, automobile trip generation rates, or automobile trips generated.” (Ibid.)  OPR also has discretion 
to develop alternative criteria for areas that are not served by transit, if appropriate. (Id. at subd. (c).) 
Once  the  CEQA  Guidelines  are  amended  to  include  those  alternative  criteria,  auto  delay  and  Level  of 
Service will no longer be considered a significant impact under CEQA. (Id. at subd. (b)(2).)  Transportation 
impacts related to air quality, noise and safety must still be analyzed under CEQA where appropriate. (Id. 
at subd. (b)(3).) 
Street	Connectivity	
The majority of Town has acceptable street connectivity, especially the Old Town District which has easy 
access to both the Washington Street and Yount Street corridors.  Residential properties east of Yount 
Street are limited to access to the Yount Street corridor and Yountville Cross Road via other local streets.  
Exceptions include the Rancho de Napa and Gateway Mobile Home Parks, located at the south end of 
Town, which are limited with access only to Washington Street.  The Oak Circle neighborhood and the 
Toyon Terrace neighborhood are also limited to only Washington Street. 
Wayfinding	Signs	
The intent of the Wayfinding Sign Program is to inform pedestrians of the location of goods and services 
as they travel through Town on the public sidewalks.  By giving pedestrians information on the location of 
area  businesses,  it  is  anticipated  that  they  will  park  once  and  remain  on  the  sidewalk  when  moving 
between businesses, rather than returning to and relocating their vehicles, thereby reducing traffic and 
parking impacts. 
Participation in the program is voluntary.  Local businesses that elect to buy an annual subscription may have 
their business name and directional arrows on any of the 12 Wayfinding sign posts along Washington Street. 
P UBLIC	 T RANSIT 	
Two transit services operate within the Town of Yountville; the regional VINE service connecting Yountville 
to other towns north and south, and the local Yountville Trolley.

VINE	
VINE transit provides fixed bus route system within and around the Town of Yountville and is operated by 
the Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency (NCTPA). VINE Regional Routes 10 and 29 provide 
service in the Town of Yountville.  Route 10 operates Monday through Friday with approximately half‐
hour  headways  from  5  a.m.  to  12  noon,  and  then  continues  until  11  p.m.  with  one‐hour  headways. 
Saturday service operates from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday service operates from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., 
both with approximately one‐hour headways.  There are eight stops for VINE Route 10 along Washington 
Street, with four stops northbound and four stops southbound, as well as an additional stop on California 
Drive, west of SR‐29 near the Yountville’s Veteran’s Home. 
VINE Route 29 is a commuter route that travels between Calistoga and the El Cerrito Del Norte BART station 
on SR 29 and I‐80.  In Yountville, Route 29 makes one stop near the intersection of California Drive/Solano 
Avenue.  It operates Monday through Friday between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m., with more frequent headways 
during the morning and evening commute periods.  Figure 4 shows the transit routes in Yountville. 
Yountville	Trolley	
The Yountville Trolley, which is operated by NCTPA, provides rides for residents and visitors of the Town of 
Yountville,  including  the  Veterans  Home.    The  Yountville  Trolley  operates  a  deviated  fixed  route  that 
provides door to door service when requested by customers.  The trolley is free to ride through Town funding 
and operates Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Ridership information about the trolley service has been recorded since the beginning of 2012. Residents 
have been using the service since January 2012, but visitors did not start using the service until October 
2012.    Total  ridership  has  been  consistently  highest  in  June  and  July  of  each  year.    Plate  4  shows  the 
number of residents and visitors that have used the trolley since 2012.

Transit	Stops	
There are currently eight transit stops on Washington Street with three stops on the on the east side of 
Washington Street within less than 0.20 mile, per Town Council decision. 
Taxi	Service	
Taxi service in Yountville is provided by private operators that serve the greater Napa County area and 
beyond.  Taxi service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by calling in a service request.  The 
Town is also served by various Uber users. 
Park‐and‐Ride	Lots	
A Park‐and‐Ride lot is currently provided along Solano Avenue at California Drive, west of SR‐29.  The Napa 
County Transportation and Planning Agency purchased property and opened the lot in April 2012 with 15 
vehicle parking spaces.  From casual observation, it appears that the lot is utilized more on the weekends 
by recreational bike riders than weekday commuters.

Park‐and‐Ride lots provide intermodal access for commuter bicyclists and serve as potential staging areas 
for recreational riders during non‐commute hours.  Commuter parking at the NCTPA‐operated park‐and‐

B ICYCLE	AND	 P EDESTRIAN	 F ACILITIES 	
Bicycle	Facilities	
Bicycle circulation in Yountville is supported by an existing network of multi‐use paths, on‐street bicycle 
lanes,  and  bicycle  routes.    The  Yountville  Bicycle  Plan  was  prepared  in  partnership  with  NCTPA  and 
adopted by Town Council on June 5, 2012.  The Town’s existing and proposed bike facilities, shown in 
Figure 5, expands upon the existing network to create an improved bicycle circulation system in Yountville 
and better connectivity to towns north and south. 
The  Highway  Design  Manual,  California  Department  of  Transportation  (Caltrans),  2012,  classifies 
bikeways into three categories: 
         Class I Multi‐Use Path:  a completely separated right‐of‐way for the exclusive use of bicycles and 
          pedestrians with cross flows of motorized traffic minimized. 
         Class II Bike Lane:  a striped and signed lane for one‐way bike travel on a street or highway. 
         Class III Bike Route:  signing only for shared use with motor vehicles within the same travel lane 
          on a street or highway. 
Class  I  Multi‐Use  Paths  in  Yountville  include  the  path  on  the  south  side  of  Madison  Street,  west  of 
Washington Street and the path parallel with SR 29 (known as the “Yountville Mile”) along the eastern 
side of the highway running between Madison Street on the north and California Drive on the south.  The 
path which runs through town along Hopper Creek is not considered a Class I path since it is too narrow 
to accommodate both bicycles and pedestrians.  The Vine Trail regional Class I path is currently under 
design and will be extended from Trancas Street in the City of Napa to California Drive in Yountville.  The 
path would be located on the east side of Solano Avenue between the railroad and the east side of the 
roadway.  It is scheduled to be constructed during the summer of 2015. 
Class II Bike Lanes include Yountville Cross Road, Yount Street, Solano Avenue, California Drive, and on 
Madison Street.  There is a planned Class II bike lane on Finnell Road in front of the Elementary School. 
There are no existing Class III Bike Routes but there are planned facilities on Finnell Road, Mulberry Street, 
Washington Street, Webber Avenue, and Yount Mill Road. 
Table 6 summarizes the existing and planned bicycle facilities in the project vicinity, as contained in the 
Yountville Bicycle Plan.

BIKEWAY	TRANSITIONS	
Madison Street and Yountville Cross Road are popular streets for bicyclists to travel on to get to and from 
rural Napa Valley, but the two roads are offset with each other when they intersect with Yount Street.  
There  is  minimal  guidance  for  the  bicyclists,  especially  in  the  westbound  to  southbound  direction,  to 
negotiate  this  transition  area.    The  intersections  could  benefit  from  enhanced  striping  to  better  guide 
bicyclists through town as well as improve driver awareness of bicyclists.  Another transition point in need 
of enhancements is the termination of the bike lanes on Yount Street at the entrance to the Hopper Creek 
path as well as the transition of the proposed Vine Trail at California Drive/Solano Avenue with the exiting 
bike lanes on California Avenue. 
Pedestrian	Facilities	
Pedestrian  facilities  include  sidewalks,  crosswalks,  pedestrian  signal  infrastructure,  curb  ramps,  and 
streetscape  amenities.    Nearly  complete  sidewalk  coverage,  accessible  curb  ramps,  and  marked 
crosswalks  are  provided  along  arterial  streets  in  Yountville.    High  visibility  crosswalk  marking  and  in‐
roadway pedestrian warning signs, among other treatments, are provided at several uncontrolled mid‐
block crosswalk locations along Yount Street, Washington Street, and Finnell Road. 
SIDEWALKS	AND	WALKWAYS	
Sidewalks in Yountville generally range from four to five feet in width which is generally considered narrow 
for side by side pedestrian travel, especially in commercial areas.  There are street sections with wider 
sidewalks in some locations and a variety of pedestrian amenities are provided throughout the downtown 
including  accessible  pedestrian  ramps,  decorative  paving  and  crosswalk  treatments,  curb  extensions, 
pedestrian scale lights, benches, street trees, sidewalk dining, and public art, among others.  However, in 
the  historic  Old  Town  area,  which  is  bound  by  the  Cemetery,  Washington  Street,  Yount  Street,  and 
                                        April	7,	2015 |	General	Plan Circulation	Element	Report	               18
 

Humboldt Street, the rustic feel of the Napa Valley has been preserved by not developing walkways with 
concrete sidewalks, curb, and gutter.  In the past, residents in Yountville have supported using a more 
rural type of pedestrian path rather than a typical curb, gutter and sidewalk. 
While the pedestrian network is generally well‐developed throughout Yountville with the exception of the 
Old Town, there are some locations where gaps in the sidewalk network can be found.  Short gaps exist 
along  undeveloped  properties  and  various  frontages  on  Yountville  Cross  Road,  Finnell  Road,  and 
Washington Street.  Figure 6 provides an overview of sidewalk coverage in Yountville. 
The Washington Park Subdivision is a neighborhood where a more hybrid street section was provided 
intended to serve both pedestrian travel and parking activity.  The street includes 40 feet of width which 
includes seven feet of raised asphalt on either side separated from the 26 foot travelway by rolled curbs.  
The street condition has resulted in a number of complaints related to the mixing of the pedestrian way 
with the parked vehicles. 
CROSSWALKS	
Just as important as developed sidewalks in a small town like Yountville that has heavy pedestrian traffic 
on the weekends, are well‐marked and enhanced crosswalks.  Enhancements such as signage, median 
refuge, curb bulb‐outs, etc., can provide for a safer pedestrian crossing condition as well as create a vehicle 
traffic calming feature.  Below is a list of the “uncontrolled” crosswalks in the Town and the facilities which 
accompany them.  Uncontrolled crosswalks are marked crosswalks where no traffic controls (i.e. stop sign 
or signal) exist.  They are often midblock crossings, like many of the crossings on Washington Street and 
Yount Street. 
List of uncontrolled crosswalks with enhancements: 
     1. Washington Street north of Lincoln Avenue – brick, marked crosswalk, pedestrian crossing sign 
          on southbound approach

The Hopper Creek Pathway System serves alternative modes parallel to most of Hopper Creek that runs 
through Yountville.  There are places to extend the path both north and south to create a complete Hopper 
Creek Path.  This completed path would start at the intersection of Yount Street with Hopper Creek, run 
parallel to Hopper Creek, and continue until reaching the southern limit of Town.  The largest gaps that 
need to be completed are from Heritage Court to Heather Street and Oak Circle to Mission Street.

Intersection	Collisions	
The collision histories for the three primary intersections in Yountville were reviewed to determine any 
trends  or  patterns  that  may  indicate  a  safety  issue.    Collision  rates  were  calculated  based  on  records 
available from the California Highway Patrol as published in their Statewide Integrated Traffic Records 
System  (SWITRS)  reports.    The  most  current  five‐year  period  available  is  January  1,  2008,  through 
December 31, 2012. 
As presented in Table 7, the calculated collision rates for the study intersections, measured in collisions 
per million vehicles entering the intersection (c/mve), were compared to average collision rates for similar 
intersection types statewide, as indicated in 2010 Collision Data on California State Highways, California 
Department  of  Transportation.    Intersection  types  are  defined  by  the  type  of  traffic  control,  location 
(urban, suburban, or rural), and number of legs.  This data only includes collisions which are reported to 
a law enforcement agency and may not include minor collisions that the parties involved chose not to 
report.  Collision rate calculations for the study intersections are provided in Appendix A.

Two of the study intersections had collision rates lower than the statewide average.  The intersection of 
Washington  Street/Yount  Street  had  a  collision  rate  slightly,  but  not  significantly,  higher  than  the 
statewide  average.    Washington  Street/Yount  Street  is  a  tee‐intersection  with  the  fourth  leg  being  a 
driveway with very low traffic volumes.  Because of this, the statewide collision rate most likely represents 
a lower value than an average collision rate for a tee‐intersection with a driveway as the fourth leg.  It 
should  be  noted  that  the  driveway  at  the  Washington  Street/Yount  Street  intersection  was  realigned 
within the last several years specifically to address safety concerns with the previous offset configuration. 
In general, this examination of the collision history at the highest volume intersections indicate that there 
is not a safety concern with vehicle collisions that needs to be addressed. 
Bicycle	and	Pedestrian	Collisions	
Because Yountville has a significant amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic, the collision history for the 
Town was further reviewed for the most recent ten years to determine any trends or patterns with bicycle 
or pedestrian‐related collisions.  The most current ten‐year period available is January 1, 2003, through 
December 31, 2012.  The  collision data was analyzed using the  Transportation Injury  Mapping System 
(TIMS), published by the University of California, Berkeley.  It is important to note that TIMS only maps 
injury and fatal collisions. 
BICYCLISTS	
Town wide, there was one reported collision involving a bicyclist within the last 10 years.  This collision 
resulted in injuries, but no fatalities.  This collision occurred at Washington Street/Madison Street, which 
is a critical intersection for traffic coming into and leaving out of town. 
PEDESTRIANS	
There were five reported collisions resulting in an injured pedestrian.  Three of the five collisions occurred 
along  Washington  Street  at  different  intersections.    Two  of  these  pedestrian  collisions  occurred  at 
intersections that have complete sidewalks and marked crosswalks.  The other two collisions occurred in 
the vicinity of the Veterans Home in the southwest area of Yountville. 
A summary of bicycle and pedestrian collisions by location is provided in Table 8, and an exhibit showing 
the locations is provided in Appendix B.

In general, one collision involving a bicycle or pedestrian at any one location within a ten year period is 
not unexpected.  Multiple collisions at any one location should be a cause for further study.

C OMPLETE	 S TREETS 	
STATE	OF	CALIFORNIA	COMPLETE	STREETS	ACT	
On September 30, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 1358, the California Complete Streets Act 
of 2008, into law.  As of January 2011, AB 1358 requires any substantive revision of the circulation element 
of a Town or county’s general plan to identify how they will safely accommodate the circulation of all 
users of the roadway including pedestrians, bicyclists, children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and 
transit riders, as well as motorists. 
This section is intended to 1) fulfill this requirement, 2) identify existing features in Yountville which 
fall into the Complete Street category and 3) identify potential future Complete Street enhancements. 
The  National  Complete  Streets  Coalition  defines  complete  streets  as  follows:    Complete  streets  are 
designed and operated to enable safe access for all users.  Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit 
riders of all ages and abilities must be able to safely move along and across a complete street.  Creating 
complete streets means transportation agencies must change their orientation toward building primarily 
for cars. Instituting a complete streets policy ensures that transportation agencies routinely design and 
operate the entire right of way to enable safe access for all users. 
An ideal Complete Streets policy: 
        Includes a vision for how and why the community wants to complete its streets 
        Specifies  that  ‘all  users’  includes  pedestrians,  bicyclists  and  transit  passengers  of  all  ages  and 
         abilities, as well as trucks, buses and automobiles. 
        Applies  to  both  new  and  retrofit  projects,  including  design,  planning,  maintenance,  and 
         operations, for the entire right of way. 
        Makes  any  exceptions  specific  and  sets  a  clear  procedure  that  requires  high‐level  approval  of 
         exceptions. 
        Encourages  street  connectivity  and  aims  to  create  a  comprehensive,  integrated,  connected 
         network for all modes. 
        Is adoptable by all agencies to cover all roads. 
        Directs the use of the latest and best design criteria and guidelines while recognizing the need for 
         flexibility in balancing user needs. 
        Directs that Complete Streets solutions will complement the context of the community. 
        Establishes performance standards with measurable outcomes. 
        Includes specific next steps for implementation of the policy 
OTHER	GUIDANCE	
CALTRANS	DEPUTY	DIRECTIVE	64‐R1:		COMPLETE	STREETS	–	INTEGRATING	THE	TRANSPORTATION	SYSTEM	
In  2001,  Caltrans  adopted  Deputy  Directive  64;  a  policy  directive  related  to  non‐motorized  travel 
throughout  the  state.    In  October  2008,  Deputy  Directive  64  was  strengthened  to  reflect  changing 
priorities and challenges.  DD 64‐R1 states: 
     The  Department  views  all  transportation  improvements  as  opportunities  to  improve  safety, 
     access, and mobility for all travelers in California and recognizes bicycle, pedestrian, and transit 
     modes as integral elements of the transportation system.  Providing safe mobility for all users, 
     including  motorists,  bicyclists,  pedestrians  and  transit  riders,  contributes  to  the  Department's 
     mission/vision:  "Improving Mobility across California."

    TRANSPORTATION	AND	CIRCULATION	                                                    	
 
Successful long‐term implementation of this policy is intended to result in more options for people to go from 
one place to another, less traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, more walkable communities (with 
healthier, more active people), and fewer barriers for older adults, children, and people with disabilities. 
Economically, complete streets can help revitalize communities, and they can give families the option to 
lower  transportation  costs  by  using  transit,  walking  or  bicycling  rather  than  driving  to  reach  their 
destinations.    The  Department  is  actively  engaged  in  implementing  its  complete  streets  policy  in  all 
planning, programming, design, construction, operations, and maintenance activities and products on the 
State Highway System. 
DIRECTOR’S	POLICY	22	(DP‐22),	“DIRECTOR’S	POLICY	ON	CONTEXT	SENSITIVE	SOLUTIONS”	
Director’s Policy 22, a policy regarding the use of “Context Sensitive Solutions” on all state highways, was 
adopted by Caltrans in November of 2001.  The policy reads: 
     The  Department  uses  “Context  Sensitive  Solutions”  as  an  approach  to  plan,  design,  construct, 
     maintain,  and  operate  its  transportation  system.    These  solutions  use  innovative  and  inclusive 
     approaches that integrate and balance community, aesthetic, historic, and environmental values 
     with transportation safety, maintenance, and performance goals.  Context sensitive solutions are 
     reached through a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach involving all stakeholders. 
     The context of all projects and activities is a key factor in reaching decisions.  It is considered for 
     all State transportation and support facilities when defining, developing, and evaluating options.  
     When considering the context, issues such as funding feasibility, maintenance feasibility, traffic 
     demand, impact on alternate routes, impact on safety, and relevant laws, rules, and regulations 
     must be addressed. 
The  policy  recognizes  that  “in  towns  and  cities  across  California,  the  State  highway  may  be  the  only 
through street or may function as a local street,” that “these communities desire that their main street 
be an economic, social, and cultural asset as well as provide for the safe and efficient movement of people 
and goods,” and that “communities want transportation projects to provide opportunities for enhanced 
non‐motorized travel and visual quality.”  The policy acknowledges that addressing these needs will assure 
that transportation solutions meet more than just traffic and operational objectives. 
METROPOLITAN	PLANNING	COMMISSION	
The current Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) produced by MTC, Transportation 2035 Plan, was finalized 
in February 2009 and updates the previous 2005 RTP.  The 2035 Plan sets forth regional transportation policy 
and provides capital program planning for all regional, state and federally funded projects.  In addition, the 
2035  Plan  provides  strategic  investment  recommendations  to  improve  regional  transportation  system 
performance over the next 25 years.  Investments in regional highway, transit, local roadway, bicycle, and 
pedestrian projects are set forth in the 2035 Plan.  These projects have been identified through regional and 
local transportation planning processes.  Project recommendations are premised upon factors related to 
existing  infrastructure  maintenance,  increased  transportation  system  efficiencies,  improved  traffic  and 
transit operations, and strategic expansions of the regional transportation system. 
RECENT	ACCOMPLISHMENTS	BY	THE	TOWN	OF	YOUNTVILLE	
In general, the Town supports a road system that provides for pedestrian, bicycle and transit travel modes 
with a street infrastructure that encourages low speed travel.  A number of projects have been completed 
within the last 5‐10 years which support this goal:

Existing	Parking	Utilization	
In order to assess parking occupancy during typical summer conditions, parking surveys were completed 
on Wednesday, July 9, Friday, August 22, and Saturday, August 23, 2014 between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 
p.m.  to  capture  peak  daytime  summer  conditions.    All  of  the  on‐  and  off‐street  parking  spaces  were 
surveyed in the parking “study area” as shown in Figures 7A and 7B. 
The study area was arranged into 13 smaller, more manageable zones designated “A” through “M.”  In 
total,  there  are  nearly  1,600  on‐street  and  off‐street  parking  spaces  located  within  the  study  area.  
Following is a summary of each zone. 
    Zone “A” is located on the north side of Madison Street and includes on‐street parking on Lincoln 
    Avenue and Washington Street and off‐street parking on the hotel site west of Washington Street.  
    Zone “A” has a total supply of 102 parking spaces. 
    Zone  “B”  is  located  on  the  west  side  of  Washington  Street  between  Madison  Street  and  Pedroni 
    Street.  Zone “B” has a total supply of 137 parking spaces.

Weekday parking occupancy across Yountville is about 54 percent (52% on‐street and 56% off‐street), 
compared to 63 percent for a typical weekend day (68% on‐street and 59% off‐street).  Parking occupancy 
for  both  a  weekday  and  weekend  day  is  greatest  in  the  zones  closest  to  the  highest  concentration  of 
restaurants and shops around the intersection of Washington Street/Yount Street.  Parking occupancy 
decreases in the school and Town Hall zone “G” and Community Center, post office, police department 
zone “J” and increases in the retail/restaurant zones “E” and “I” on the weekends.  On‐street parking in 
the Old Town Historic zoning district (Zones C, D, and F) is 43 percent occupied on average, well below the 
town‐wide parking occupancy average. 
Generally, a parking occupancy of less than 85 percent is considered to be manageable for someone trying 
to  find  a  parking  space,  as  long  as  parking  spaces  are  “shared’  and  not  exclusive  to  one  business  or 
another.  During a typical weekday, only the zone with Yountville Elementary School and Town Hall is 
more than 85 percent occupied.  On a typical weekend day, some of the zones closest to restaurants, 
shopping, and recreational activities have parking occupancies greater than 85 percent, but zones “H” and 
“I”, adjacent to Washington Street/Yount Street, are approximately 65 percent occupied. 
Therefore, in general, there appears to be a sufficient supply of parking town‐wide to serve the current 
demand. 
The Town does have plans to increase parking spaces in the following areas: 
         Plans  are  underway  to  stripe  the  space  around  Yountville  Park  as  angled  parking  spaces.    The 
          north  side  of  Yountville  Park  is  already  striped  for  angled  parking.    Adding  angled  parking  on 
          Washington Street and the east side of Yountville Park could increase parking from 32 parallel 
          spaces to approximately 62 diagonal spaces. 
         Expanded parking spaces south of the Veterans Memorial park at California and Washington. 
         Diagonal parking on Humboldt Street. 
         New parking planned on Oak Circle.

   TRANSPORTATION	AND	CIRCULATION	                                                     	
 
S UMMARY	OF	 I SSUES	AND	 R ECOMMENDATIONS 
The State of California has mandated that all municipalities include a complete streets element in its General 
Plan.  Therefore, any substantive revisions of the circulation element of the general plan should identify how 
the  Town  will  safely  accommodate  the  circulation  of  all  users  of  the  roadway  including  pedestrians, 
bicyclists, children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and transit riders, as well as motorists. 
      Complete	streets	are	designed	and	operated	to	enable	safe	access	for	all	users.		
   Pedestrians,	bicyclists,	motorists	and	transit	riders	of	all	ages	and	abilities	must	be	
                       able	to	safely	move	along	and	across	a	complete	street.	
In order to comply with this requirement, the Town of Yountville will review and evaluate current policies 
and  consider several projects which  will improve the Town’s  circulation.   These recommendations are 
outlined below. 
Vehicle	Circulation	
Yount Street/Humboldt Street – The intersection is a non‐standard configuration due to the “unbalanced” 
stop control with stop signs on the southbound and eastbound approaches with free flow conditions on 
the northbound approach. 
         Recommendation:  The intersection should either be controlled with an all‐way stop or free flow 
         both northbound and southbound.  Pedestrian safety should be considered in the evaluation to 
         determine the ultimate controls. 
Yountville Cross Road Speeds – Speed surveys indicate that traffic on Yountville Cross Road is traveling 
with an 85th percentile speed of 39 mph in a 35 mph zone with the presence of a radar feedback sign. 
         Recommendation:  Consider designing and installing road treatments, such as narrowing and/or 
         speed tables to bring speeds to a lower and more desirable range at this gateway location. 
Local Street Connectivity – Several neighborhoods south of Finnell Road are limited with access only to 
Washington Street. 
         Recommendation – Consider provising a one‐lane emergency access connection at heather Street 
         and Heritage Court while maintaining the integrity of the pocket park. 
Operating	Standards	
Intersection Level of Service – Senate Bill 743 will soon be implemented which will no longer require auto 
delay  and  Level  of  Service  analysis  as  part  of  CEQA.    The  highest  volume  intersections  in  Yountville 
currently operate with LOS B conditions and are projected to remain within the LOS B range with buildout 
of anticipated land use. 
         Recommendation – Once Senate Bill 743 is implemented, consider replacement of vehicle Level 
         of Service standards for traffic conditions in Yountville with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) or other 
         recommended metrics. 
                                       April	7,	2015 |	General	Plan Circulation	Element	Report	              30
 

Bicycle	Facilities	
Madison Street and Yountville Cross Road Bike Lane Transitions – The two corridors are offset with each 
other when they intersect with Yount Street. There is minimal guidance for the bicyclists, especially in the 
westbound to southbound direction, to negotiate this transition area. 
        Recommendation – Provide enhanced bike lane striping at the intersections of Yount Street with 
        Madison  Street  and  Yountville  Cross  Road  to  better  guide  bicyclists  through  town  as  well  as 
        improve driver awareness of bicyclists. 
Yount Street at the entrance to the Hopper Creek Path – Bike lanes currently extend south from Madison 
Street and end at the Hopper Creek path. 
        Recommendation – Install complete street features such as signing and striping on Yount Street 
        between the terminus of the bike lanes and Washington Street. 
Hopper Creek Path – The existing path has gaps and is generally not wide enough to serve pedestrians 
and bicyclists side by side. 
        Recommendation – Complete the path system in the areas with gaps and, where possible, explore 
        the potential for widening the path to improve multi‐modal opportunities. 
Bike Plan Planned Projects – There are several uncompleted bicycle facility projects included in the Bike 
Plan. 
        Recommendation  –  Seek  funding,  complete  designs  and  implement  the  following  bike  facility 
        projects: 
            Class  III  bike  route  including  signage  and  sharrow  markings  on  Webber  Avenue  between 
             Washington  Street  and  Yount  Street  and  on  the  Vista‐Heritage‐Heather‐Mulberry  route 
             between Washington Street and Finnell Road.
            Modify the Bike Plan to designate a preference for sharrows on Finnell Road between the 
             Hopper Creek path and the eastern Town limit. 
Pedestrian	Safety	and	Connectivity	
Commercial  Width  Sidewalks  –  Sidewalks  in  Yountville  generally  range  from  four  to  five  feet  in  width 
which is generally considered narrow for side by side pedestrian travel, especially in commercial areas 
with tourist activity. 
        Recommendation  –  The  Town  should  consider  preparing  a  Sidewalk  Master  Plan  for  the 
        Washington  Street  corridor  from  Yountville  Community  Park,  north  of  Madison  Street,  to 
        Veteran’s Memorial Park, south of California Drive.  The Master Plan should weigh the competing 
        interests of providing wider sidewalks on both sides of Washington Street while maintaining and 
        enhancing  opportunities  for  landscaping  and  retaining  Yountville’s  rural  charm.    Consider 
        potential wider sidewalk plazas in the downtown core near key intersections. 
Sidewalk/Walkway Gaps – There are a number of sidewalk gaps throughout the Town. 
        Recommendation – With the exception of the Old Town district, gaps in sidewalks and walkways 
        should  be  identified  and  a  plan  to  fill  these  gaps  completed.    The  plan  should  consider  the 
        appropriateness of providing either raised curb or asphalt walkways on the following sections:

            Yountville Cross Road (South side) 
            Finnell Road (South side) 
            Washington Street ( East Side, South of California) 
            Washington Street (East Side, South of Madison) 
Washington Park Subdivision – The hybrid street section which mixes the pedestrian way with the parking 
lane has resulted in a number of complaints about safety. 
        Recommendation  –  In  order  to  more  fully  serve  and  separate  pedestrian  and  parking  activity, 
        review and evaluate modifications to the street cross section.  Options to be considered include 
        installing  selected  concrete  sidewalks,  separating  the  parking  from  the  pedestrian  walkways, 
        narrowing  the  travelway,  restricting  parking  in  selected  areas,  etc.    Pedestrian  improvements 
        should connect the neighborhood with adjoining paths and parks.  Plan alternatives should be 
        presented to the neighborhood for their input.  Based on the residents input a preferred plan 
        should be developed and implemented. 
Crossing Needs at Uncontrolled Crosswalks – There are a number of uncontrolled crosswalks in Yountville 
that do not include any safety enhancements other than a marked crosswalk. 
        Recommendation  –  Review  and  evaluate  existing  policy  and  determine  whether  additional 
        measures,  such  as  1)  raised  crosswalks,  2)  lighted  crosswalks,  3)  enhanced  signage  or  other 
        measures are appropriate at these locations: 
            Washington Street at Champagne Drive 
            West leg of Mulberry Street at Heather Street 
            West leg of Madison Street at Jefferson Street 
            California Drive at SR 29 Northbound on‐ramp  
            California Drive at Domaine Chandon Driveway
            Finnell Road at Yountville Town Hall Driveway
            Finnell Road at Hopper Creek Path
Crossing Needs at School Crosswalks – There are three uncontrolled school crosswalks which could benefit 
from additional safety measures. 
        Recommendation – Review and evaluate existing policy and evaluate these locations to determine 
        if  additional  physical  modifications  such  as  a  raised  crosswalk,  bulbouts,  medians,  etc.,  are 
        appropriate as well as warning enhancements such as `) lighted crosswalks,  2) enhanced signage 
        or other measures. 
            Yount Street north of Webber Avenue 
            Finnell Road 250’ east of Yount Street 
            Finnell Road about 580’ west of Yount Street
Traffic	Safety	
Veterans Home Pedestrian Safety – Based on a review of pedestrian collisions over a ten year period, 
there were two collisions involving pedestrians near the Veterans Home which resulted in injuries. 
        Recommendation – The pedestrian route between the Veterans Home and downtown Yountville 
        should  be  reviewed  to  determine  if  any  enhancements  such  as  sidewalks/walkways,  higher 
                                     April	7,	2015 |	General	Plan Circulation	Element	Report	              32
 

          visibility  crosswalks,  pedestrian  warning  signs  at  crosswalks  and  traffic  calming  elements  are 
          needed to increase the safety for pedestrians. 
Parking	
Parking in Old Town District – There is a perception that on‐street parking in the Old Town Historic zoning 
district (Zones C, D, and F) is overburdened, but the parking study revealed that it is 43 percent occupied 
on average, well below the town‐wide parking occupancy average. 
          Recommendation –Since there does not appear to be significant parking impacts in the Old Town 
          District,  parking  restrictions,  such  as  limiting  parking  to  residents  only  or  implementing  time 
          period restrictions, are not recommended under present conditions. 
Evaluate Parking Demand for all New Commercial Development – The Town’s parking standards provide 
the minimum number of onsite parking spaces that are required by use type.  In some cases, the Town’s 
minimum standards are not sufficient to meet customer and employee parking demand.  When this is the 
case, commercial parking impacts spill over into adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
          Recommendation – Evaluate parking demand for all new commercial development and require 
          onsite parking that meets or exceeds the Town’s minimum parking standards as determined by 
          the  Town  during  project  review.    In  making  this  determination,  the  Town  may  require  the 
          following: 
              Maximize onsite parking. 
              Submittal of Parking Management Plans to addresses customer and employee parking, both 
               on‐ and offsite. 
              Preparation of Parking Impact Studies to evaluate parking impacts associated with a proposed 
               use.
Opportunities of Additional Parking – The Town has plans to increase the number of parking spaces in the 
following areas: 
              Plans are underway to stripe the space around Yountville Park as angled parking spaces.  The 
               north side of Yountville Park is already striped for angled parking.  Adding angled parking on 
               Washington Street and the east side of Yountville Park could increase parking from 32 parallel 
               spaces to approximately 62 diagonal spaces. 
              Expanded parking spaces south of the Veterans Memorial Park 
              Evaluate diagonal parking on Humboldt Street. 
              Additional parking on Oak Circle. 
          Recommendation – Implement these planned parking expansions. 
Tourist  Parking  –  Tour  buses,  limousines,  and  other  tourist  service  vehicles  generally  frequent  the 
downtown core visitor areas during the tourist season with parking occurring in a variety of areas which 
can disrupt vehicle parking conditions. 
          Recommendation – The Town should consider designating a satellite parking lot for tour buses 
          and work with tour companies to ensure that parking occurs in these lots.  Enforce Town parking 
          restrictions for illegally parked vehicles.

R EGULATORY	 F RAMEWORK /I SSUES , 	 O BJECTIVES	AND	 P OLICIES 	
The Town of Yountville General Plan along with a variety of regional, state and federal plans, legislation, 
and policy directives provide guidelines for the safe operation of streets and transportation facilities in 
the Town of Yountville.  While the Town of Yountville has primary responsibility for the maintenance and 
operation  of  transportation  facilities  within  the  Town,  Yountville  staff  works  on  a  continual  basis  with 
responsible regional, state, and federal agencies including the Napa County Transportation and Planning 
Agency  (NCTPA),  the  County  of  Napa,  the  Metropolitan  Transportation  Commission  (MTC),  California 
Department  of  Transportation  (Caltrans),  and  Federal  Highway  Administration,  as  well  as  others,  to 
maintain, improve, and balance the competing transportation needs of the community and the region. 
The following circulation and transportation topics reflect the intentions of the Town to continue its goal 
to maintain most streets as two‐way, two‐lane streets, non‐signalized intersections (except for Madison 
Street at State Highway 29) and preserve the rural character of existing and new streets.

Objective C1A       Maintain  Safe  and  Efficient  Operating  Conditions  on  the  Townwide  Circulation 
                    Network 
        Policy C 1.1      Ensure that the Town’s circulation network is maintained and improved over time 
        to support buildout of the General Plan in a manner that is consistent with the Town’s Circulation 
        Network (Figure 1). 
        Policy C 1.2      Ensure that the Town’s circulation network is a well‐connected system of streets, 
        roads,  highways,  sidewalks,  and  bicycle/pedestrian  paths  that  effectively  accommodates 
        vehicular and non‐vehicular traffic in a manner that considers the context of surrounding land 
        uses and the needs of all roadway users. 
                  Action C 1:      Consider providing a one‐lane emergency access connection at Heather 
                  Street and Heritage Court while maintaining the integrity of the pocket park. 
        Policy C 1.3      The Town’s current operating standards call to maintain all street intersections at 
        a level of service “C” or better.  Consider replacement of vehicle Level of Service standards for 
        traffic conditions in Yountville with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) or other recommended metrics 
        once Senate Bill 743 is implemented. 
        Policy C 1.4      When analyzing impacts to the circulation network created by new development 
        or  roadway  improvements,  consider  the  needs  of  all  users  including  those  with  disabilities, 
        ensuring  that  pedestrians,  bicyclists,  and  transit  riders  are  considered  at  an  equal  level  to  the 
        needs of automobile drivers. 
        Policy C 1.5      Maximize the use of federal and other matching funding sources and Measure T 
        funds  in  2018  to  provide  ongoing  maintenance,  operation,  and  management  of  the  Town’s

                 require onsite parking that meets or exceeds the Town’s minimum parking standards as 
                 determined by the Town during project review.  In making this determination, the Town 
                 may require the following: 
                 ‐   Maximize onsite parking. 
                 ‐   Submittal  of  Parking  Management  Plans  to  addresses  customer  and  employee 
                     parking, both on‐ and offsite. 
                 ‐   Preparation of Parking Impact Studies to evaluate parking impacts associated with a 
                     proposed use. 
        Policy C 3.3      Encourage adjacent property owners to share access to parking lots and provide 
        connectivity between commercial properties to allow for shared parking activity.  When the times 
        that the parking spaces are used differs, allow the shared use of spaces.  Each development must 
        provide and maintain, at some location within the commercial area, the parking spaces required 
        by the Zoning Ordinance.  The realization of this policy relies on the collaboration of businesses 
        and landowners. 
        Policy C 3.4      Discourage permit parking restrictions which can push parking impacts to other 
        neighborhoods and residences.

        Policy C 3.5      Seek to expand parking to expand on‐street parking through re‐striping. 
                 Action C 25:       Seek to implement potential parking expansion areas such as 
                 ‐   Plans  are  underway  to  stripe  the  space  around  Yountville  Park  as  angled  parking 
                     spaces.  The north side of Yountville Park is already striped for angled parking.  Adding 
                     angled  parking  on  Washington  Street  and  the  east  side  of  Yountville  Park  could 
                     increase parking from 32 parallel spaces to approximately 62 diagonal spaces. 
                 ‐   Expanded parking spaces south of the Veterans Memorial Park. 
                 ‐   Evaluate diagonal parking on Humboldt Street. 
                 ‐   Additional parking on Oak Circle. 
Objective C3B      Reduce traffic congestion on Washington Street resulting from on‐street bus parking. 
        Policy C 3.6      The Town should consider designating a satellite parking lot for tour buses and 
        work  with  tour  companies  to  ensure  that  parking  occurs  in  these  lots.    Enforce  Town  parking 
        restrictions for illegally parked vehicles. 
        Policy C 3.7      Visitor buses and oversized limos should be discouraged and may be prohibited 
        from parking on the street, in order to keep space open for tourists, workers, and residents. 
        Policy C 3.8      Bus parking areas should not eliminate any existing off‐street parking stalls. 
Objective C3C      Screen off‐street parking from public view. 
        Policy C 3.9      Require new parking lots to be set back from the street, screened with buildings, 
        walls and/or landscape elements as set forth in the Design Ordinance, Chapter 1. 
        Policy C 3.10     Accommodate parking behind buildings, where feasible. 
        Policy C 3.11  Plant trees in parking lots, which provide shade and diminish the visual impact of 
        the lot, but do not obstruct view corridors as established in Chapter I of the Design Ordinance. 
        Policy C 3.12  Minimize the size of and impact of parking lots. For example, two separate well‐
        landscaped parking lots connected by a driveway are preferable to one larger parking lot.

INTRODUCTION
Purpose of the Climate Action Plan
  The Town of Yountville understands that climate change has
the potential to significantly affect Yountville’s residents and
businesses, as well as other communities around the world.
The Town also recognizes that local governments play a strong
role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the
potential impacts of climate change.
  The purpose of this Climate Action Plan (CAP) is to com-
pile existing and potential strategies (i.e., actions, projects, and
programs) that the Town’s government and the community can
use to address climate change. It provides a brief background
on what climate change is and its potential impacts, but focus-
es on the efforts Yountville can take to reduce its greenhouse
gas emissions and mitigate, to the extent feasible at the local
level, the potential impacts of climate change.
  Through the actions outlined in this plan, such as increasing
energy efficiency in buildings, encouraging less dependence on
the automobile, and using clean, renewable energy sources, the
Yountville community can experience lower energy bills, im-
proved air quality, reduced emissions, and an enhanced quality
of life. The Town’s preparation of the 2010 Greenhouse Gas
Emissions Inventory and this Climate Action Plan is the foun-
dation of an ongoing planning process that includes assessing,
planning, mitigating and adapting to climate change.
  Specifically, this plan does the following:
  ▪▪    Summarizes the various regulations at the federal, state,
        and regional levels.
  ▪▪    Incorporates the Town’s 2010 Greenhouse Gas Emission
        Inventory, which identified sources of greenhouse gas
        emissions generated by the community and the local gov-
        ernment.
  ▪▪    Estimates how these emissions may change over time un-
        der a business-as-usual forecast.
  ▪▪    Provides energy use, transportation, water, wastewater,
        waste and natural system strategies necessary to minimize
        Yountville’s impacts on climate change.
                                                        Town of Yountville Climat e Action Plan 5

                             Relationship to the General Plan
                               The Town of Yountville’s General Plan, adopted in 1992,
                             contains policies and programs in the plan’s Conservation
                             element that promote community sustainability and effec-
                             tive management of renewable and non-renewable natural
                             resources through energy and water conservation, and solid
                             waste reduction and recycling. The Circulation Element of
                             the General Plan was updated in 2015, and specific programs
                             from that element have been carried over to this plan in order
                             to maintain consistency. Greenhouse gas reduction measures
                             contained in the CAP are intended to provide the Town with
                             information needed to prioritize and implement specific pro-
                             grams. Many of these programs will require additional study
                             and analysis before implementation. Measures are advisory in
                             nature and are not mandates. The Climate Action Plan will be
                             incorporated into the update of the Town’s General Plan, now
                             underway.
                             Climate Change Background
                               A balance of naturally occurring gases dispersed in the at-
                             mosphere determines the Earth’s climate by trapping infrared
                             radiation (heat), a phenomenon known as the greenhouse
                             effect (Figure 1). Significant evidence suggests that human
                             activities are increasing the concentration of these gases
                             (known as “greenhouse gases” or GHGs) in the atmosphere,
                             causing a rise in global average surface temperature and con-
                             sequent global climate change. The greenhouse gases include
                             carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydroflourocar-
                             bons (Table 1). Each one has a different degree of impact
                             on climate change. To facilitate comparison across different
                             emission sources with mixed and varied compositions of sev-
                             eral GHGs, the term “carbon dioxide equivalent” or CO2e is
                             used. One metric ton of CO2e may consist of any combination
                             of GHGs, and has the equivalent Global Warming Potential
                             (GWP) as one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Accord-

                                        in California and the Bay Area
                                          According to a 2006 Summary Report from the California
                                        Climate Change Center, global warming could significantly
                                        impact California water and forest resources. The Center’s
                                        2006 Summary Report noted the following findings and po-
                                        tential risks to California:1
                                          ▪▪    Precipitation is the most important hydrologic variable
                                                and most difficult to forecast.
                                          ▪▪    Warming raises the elevation of snow levels with reduced
                                                spring snowmelt and more winter runoff.
                                          ▪▪    Less snowmelt runoff means lower early summer storage
                                                at major foothill reservoirs with less hydroelectric power
                                                production.
                                          ▪▪    Higher temperatures and reduced snowmelt compounds
                                                the problem of providing suitable cold-water habitat for
                                                salmon species.
                                          ▪▪    Rising sea levels would adversely affect many coastal
                                                marshes and wildlife reserves.
                                          ▪▪    Higher temperatures increase the demand for water by
                                                plants.
                                          ▪▪    Climate change in California will result in a higher fre-
                                                quency of large damaging fires.
                                          ▪▪    Regional climates that are hotter and drier will result in
                                                increased pest and insect epidemics within California’s
                                                forests.
                                          Historically, air temperatures over the western United States,
                                        including California, have risen significantly over the last sev-
                                        eral decades. However, quantifying how much warming has
                                        occurred in the San Francisco Bay region is problematic due
                                        to the siting of weather stations, as many have either moved
                                        or have experienced changes in the immediate surroundings
                                        of the station.2 Climate models predict warming, globally and

regionally over the San Francisco Bay, over the next century.
Through the first half of this century, the models show annual
temperatures rising approximately 1.5°C (2.7°F); by the end of
the century, temperatures are expected to rise between 2°C to
6°C (about 3.5°F to 11°F). The models indicate there will be
greater warming in the summer than in the winter in the Bay
Area, and that warming becomes greater at locations that are
distant from the coast. Heat waves are expected to last longer,
and extreme warm temperatures will likely begin in June and
could continue to occur in September.3
   Climate change simulations indicate the San Francisco Bay
region will retain its Mediterranean climate, with relatively cool
and wet winters and hot dry summers. At this time, changes
in precipitation are quite uncertain, although some models
suggest drier conditions in the Bay Area during the middle and
end of the century.4 A 2011 study found that extreme weather
events known as atmospheric rivers, which provide much of the
rainfall in the region and are responsible for the largest floods,
may increase both in intensity and frequency in some years.5
The study found that as climate change proceeds, occasional
atmospheric river storms may be exceptionally intense, and the
season for such storms may lengthen. This suggests a poten-
tial for more frequent and more severe flooding in the region,
especially when coupled with sea level rise.

                                           U.S. has used its rulemaking authority under the Clean Air Act
                                           to begin to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the
                                           EPA made an “endangerment finding” that GHGs threaten
                                           the public health and welfare of the American people.6 This
                                           finding provided the statutory prerequisite for EPA regula-
                                           tion of GHG emissions from motor vehicles and has led to a
                                           number of GHG regulations for stationary sources. In May
                                           2010, the EPA issued a “tailoring” rule that enables the agency
                                           to control GHG emissions from the nation’s largest GHG
                                           sources, including power plants, refineries, cement production
                                           facilities, industrial manufacturers and solid waste landfills,
                                           when these facilities are newly constructed or substantially
                                           modified. The EPA reports that its GHG permitting require-
                                           ments will address 70% of the national GHG emissions from
                                           stationary sources7. In 2013, the EPA announced proposed
                                           Clean Air Act standards to cut carbon dioxide emissions from
                                           power plants.
                                              In 2012, the Obama administration issued new rules that
                                           mandate an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon for
                                           cars and light-duty trucks by the 2025 model year, up from the
                                           current standard of 35.5 MPG in 2016.8 The new standards
                                           put pressure on auto manufacturers to step up development
                                           of electric vehicles as well as improve the mileage of conven-
                                           tional passenger cars by producing more efficient engines and
                                           lighter car bodies. In 2011, the EPA and the Department of
                                           Transportation issued the first-ever regulations for medium
                                           and heavy-duty trucks, busses and vans, covering years 2014
                                           through 2018.9 The new standards require a fuel consumption
                                           reduction of 10 to 20 percent by model year 2018, depending
                                           upon the type of truck.

tration can take to reduce GHG emissions. Actions include:
reducing emissions from power plants; accelerating renewable
energy production on public lands; expanding and moderniz-
ing the electric grid; raising fuel economy standards for pas-
senger vehicles; and accelerating energy efficiency initiatives.
STATE CLIMATE POLICY
   Since 2005, the State of California has responded to grow-
ing concerns over the effects of climate change by adopting
a comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions in the public and private sectors. Executive
Order S-3-05, signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
in 2005, established long-term targets to reduce GHG emis-
sions to 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below 1990 levels
by 2050. The 2020 GHG reduction target was subsequently
codified with the passage of the Global Warming Solutions Act
of 2006, more commonly known as AB 32. In 2015, Governor
Jerry Brown issued Executive Order B-30-15, establishing an
interim GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels
by 2030. In September 2016, the State passed legislation (SB
32) to enforce the 2030 target.
   The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is responsible
for monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions set
forth in AB 32, and is, therefore, coordinating statewide ef-
forts. In December 2008, CARB adopted a Scoping Plan that
outlines the actions required for California to reach its 2020
emission target. The actions include a broad set of programs,
including higher fuel-efficiency standards for light trucks and
passenger vehicles, mandates for generation of electricity from
renewable sources, higher energy efficiency standards for new
buildings, and incentives for solar energy installation. These
programs are detailed later in this plan.
   The Scoping Plan encourages local governments to adopt a
reduction goal for municipal operations emissions and move
toward establishing similar goals for community emissions
that parallel the State commitment to reduce greenhouse gas

                                         emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The State encourages, but
                                         does not require, local governments to track GHG emissions
                                         and adopt a Climate Action Plan that identifies how the local
                                         community will meet the reduction target. Yountville has in-
                                         ventoried both community and government operations GHG
                                         emissions for the baseline year 2010.
                                           SB 375, passed by the State Assembly and Senate in August
                                         2008, is another significant component of California’s com-
                                         mitment to GHG reduction. The goal of SB 375 is to reduce
                                         emissions from cars and light trucks by promoting compact
                                         mixed-use, commercial and residential development. The first
                                         step outlined in SB 375 called for the state’s 18 metropolitan
                                         planning organizations (MPOs) and the California Air Quality
                                         Board to establish a region’s GHG reduction target for pas-
                                         senger vehicle and light duty truck emissions. Then, the MPO
                                         was required to develop a sustainable communities strategy
                                         that demonstrates how the region will meet its GHG reduction
                                         target. Here in the Bay Area, four regional government agen-

achievement of this level; and continued monitoring to track
progress. The greenhouse gas reduction plan, once adopted
following certification of an EIR or adoption of an environ-
mental document, may be used in the cumulative impacts
analysis of later projects such as development or infrastructure
projects. An environmental document that relies on a green-
house gas reduction plan for a cumulative impacts analysis
must identify those requirements specified in the plan that
apply to the project, and, if those requirements are not other-
wise binding and enforceable, incorporate those requirements
as mitigation measures applicable to the project. This Climate
Action Plan has been developed as an advisory document only,
but it could be submitted to the Bay Area Air Quality Manage-
ment District for review and comment and adopted as a quali-

YOUNTVILLE’S GREENHOUSE
GAS EMISSIONS
Yountville Profile
  Located in the heart of Napa Valley, Yountville is a small town
with a land area of approximately 1.5 square miles. Yountville
enjoys a temperate climate, with cool, wet, and almost frostless
winters and warm, dry summers with frequent fog. The local
climate means that natural gas consumption rises in the winter
months and fluctuates according to average low temperatures
during the rainy season and water use spikes during the summer.
  According to the U.S. Census, the population of Yountville in
2010 was 2,933 and there were 1,252 housing units. The housing
stock is relatively older, with approximately 70 per cent of the
housing units built before 1990, providing excellent opportuni-
ties to upgrade homes to include more energy-efficient features
(American Community Survey, 2014).
  Yountville is a world-renowned wine country destination, with
restaurants, wineries and hotels that serve both visitors and
residents. The strong local economy provides about 1,600 jobs
(ABAG 2013 Projections).
  The Town has a public elementary school for grades K-5, a post
office, a library, a fire station, and a Town Hall. The non-residen-
tial sector of the built environment, which includes hotels, restau-
rants, retail and office buildings, as well as government facilities,
uses about 58 percent of all electricity and natural gas in the built
environment and is responsible for 40 percent of the communi-
ty’s greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the non-residential sector
has a significant role to play in reducing GHG emissions in the
community.
  Yountville enjoys good transit service. The Town is served
by the VINE system, which provides bus service to towns and
schools within Napa County and connects to the Vallejo ferry
terminal. Nonetheless, very few Yountville residents commute
to work by public transportation. While the majority of resi-
dents (62 percent) drive alone to work, approximately 5 per-
cent carpool (American Community Survey, 2014).
  The Town’s climate, compact size and mostly flat topogra-
                                                        Town of Yountville Climat e Action Plan 15

                            phy are conducive to walking and bicycling, and the Town’s
                            well-developed network of bicycle and pedestrian facilities
                            and amenities provides safe and convenient routes. Approxi-
                            mately 14 percent of Yountville residents walk to work and one
                            percent commute by bicycle (American Community Survey,
                            2014). Encouraging residents, employees and visitors to walk
                            and bike to destinations within and outside of Town could help
                            to reduce transportation emissions.
                              Community Emissions Inventory
                              The first step toward developing a climate action plan is to
                            identify sources of emissions and establish baseline levels. In
                            2015, the Town updated its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inven-
                            tories for community and government operations emissions
                            for the baseline year 2010. The inventories quantify green-
                            house gas emissions from a wide variety of sources, from the
                            energy used to power, heat and cool buildings, to the fuel used
                            to move vehicles and power off-road equipment, to the de-
                            composition of solid waste and treatment of wastewater. The
                            reports provide a detailed understanding of where the highest
                            emissions are coming from, and, therefore, where the greatest
                            opportunities for emissions reductions lie. The inventories also
                            establish a baseline emission inventory against which to mea-
                            sure future progress.
                              Community emissions are quantified according to
                            these eight sectors:
                              Residential. The Residential sector includes emissions gener-
                            ated by the use of electricity and natural gas in homes. Emis-
                            sions from wood burning and the use of diesel are also includ-
                            ed, although they play a very small role (less than one percent)
                            in residential emissions in Yountville.
                              Commercial. This sector includes emissions generated by
                            the use of electricity and natural gas in commercial buildings.
                            Emissions generated by schools, governments, and public
                            agencies are included in this sector.
                              Transportation. The Transportation sector includes emis-
                            sions from on-road vehicles travelling on local roads within the

Town limits, excluding the Veterans Home.
  Off-Road Vehicles & Equipment. This sector includes emis-
sions from vehicles and equipment used for construction,
landscaping, and other off-road activities (excluding agricul-
tural vehicles and equipment).
  Waste. This sector includes emissions generated by the de-
composition of solid waste deposited in landfills located out-
side the Town’s borders.
  Water. The Water sector inventories emissions generated by
the use of electricity and fuel in treating, conveying and dis-
tributing water from the water source to water users in the
community.
  Wastewater. This sector includes emissions generated by the
treatment of wastewater as well as fuel used by the wastewater
treatment plant.
  Agriculture. The Agriculture sector includes emissions gener-
ated from the application of nitrogen fertilizer on agricultural
fields and the use of off-road agricultural vehicles and equip-
ment.
  As described in Yountville’s 2010 Inventory of Communi-
ty Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the Town elected to report
community emissions under the “significantly influenced”
framework, which focuses on emissions the Town has signifi-
cant influence over. As a result, the Town excluded emissions
generated at the Veterans Home and from motor vehicles
travelling on Highway 29. Community greenhouse gas emis-
sions under this framework totaled 13,065 metric tons CO2e
in 2010, as shown in Table 2.

Government Operations Emissions Inventory
  In 2012, Yountville prepared a Local Government Opera-
tions Greenhouse Gas Inventory report for the baseline year
of 2010. The inventory shows that local government opera-
tions emitted an estimated total of 1,086 metric tons CO2e in
2010 from ten sectors, as shown in Table 3. By far, the largest
contributor of emissions was the Town’s Wastewater Treatment
Plant, at 793 metric tons CO2e. Most of these emissions (76
percent) were created from the venting of methane gas from
the treatment plant’s anaerobic digester into the atmosphere;
the rest of the emissions were generated from the use of elec-
tricity, natural gas, diesel fuel and refrigerants at the plant.
The Building and Facilities sector, which includes emissions
generated from the use of electricity at Town Hall and the
Community Center, was the second largest greenhouse gas
contributor at 62 metric tons CO2e.

                               The Climate Action Plan includes a business-as-usual (BAU)
                             forecast in which emissions are projected in the absence of
                             any policies or actions that would occur beyond the base year
                             to reduce emissions. The forecasts are derived by “growing”
                             2010 emissions by forecasted changes in population, number
                             of households, and jobs according to projections developed
                             by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Transportation
                             emissions are projected utilizing data provided by the Met-
                             ropolitan Transportation Commission, which incorporate the
                             vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions expected from the
                             implementation of Plan Bay Area. Table 4 shows that emis-
                             sions are expected to rise about 8 percent between 2010 and
                             2020 and 3 percent between 2020 and 2030. The Town has
                             adopted a GHG reduction target of 20 percent below 2010
                             levels, which is 10,453 metric tons CO2e.

ACTIONS TO REDUCE
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Introduction
  The Climate Action Plan includes a variety of regulatory, incen-
tive-based and voluntary strategies that are expected to reduce
emissions from both existing and new development in Yountville.
Several of the strategies build on existing programs while others
provide new opportunities to address climate change. State
actions will have a substantial impact on future emissions. Local
strategies will supplement these State actions and achieve addi-
tional GHG emissions reductions. Successful implementation
will rely on the combined participation of Town staff along with
Yountville residents, businesses and community leaders.
  The following sections identify the State and local strategies
included in the Climate Action Plan to reduce community and
government operations. Emissions reductions are estimated for
each strategy; combined these indicate the Town will reduce
emissions 36 percent below baseline emissions in 2020 and 50
percent by 2030, which is enough to surpass the State’s goals for
those years. As shown in Figure 3, State actions are expected to
reduce emissions to 15 percent below baseline emissions in 2020,
and local actions will reduce emissions another 21 percent. In
2030, State actions are projected to reduce emissions 17 percent
below baseline emissions, and local actions another 33 percent.

                               approved, programmed and/or adopted and will reduce local

                               able sources, including solar, wind, small hydroelectric, geo-
                               thermal, biomass and biowaste, to 20 percent by 2010 and to
 24 Town of Yountville Climate Action Plan
33 percent by 2020. Senate Bill 350, passed in September of
2015, increases the renewable requirement to 50 percent by
the end of 2030. In 2014, PG&E’s electric power generation
mix contained 27 percent eligible renewable energy. Marin
Clean Energy’s electricity contained 57 percent eligible renew-
able energy.
LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY FLEET REGULATIONS
  Assembly Bill 1493 (Pavley), signed into law in 2002,
requires carmakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
new passenger cars and light trucks beginning in 2009 through
increased fuel efficiency standards. The California Air Re-
sources Board (CARB) adopted regulations in September
2009 that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new passenger
cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles for model years
2012-2016. CARB expects the new standards to reduce GHG
emissions from California passenger vehicles by about 22 per-
cent in 2012 and about 30 percent in 2016, while improving
fuel efficiency and reducing motorists’ costs. The Advanced
Clean Cars rule will further reduce GHG emissions from au-
tomobiles and light-duty trucks for 2017-2025 vehicle models
years. CARB estimates that implementation of the ACC rule
will reduce statewide emissions from light-duty vehicles by 3.8
million MTCO2e in 2020, or by approximately 2.5 percent.
TITLE 24
  The California Energy Commission (CEC) promotes energy
efficiency and conservation by setting the State’s building
efficiency standards. Title 24 of the California Code of Regu-
lations consists of regulations that cover the structural, electri-
cal, mechanical, and plumbing system of every building con-
structed or altered after 1978. The building energy efficiency
standards are updated on an approximate three-year cycle,
and each cycle imposes increasingly higher demands on energy
efficiency and conservation. The CEC’s 2007 Integrated
Policy Report established the goal that new building standards
achieve “net zero energy” levels by 2020 for residences and by
                                                     Town of Yountville Climat e Action Plan 25

                            2030 for commercial buildings. The California Public Utility
                            Commission’s California Long Term Energy Efficiency Strate-
                            gic Plan, dated July 2008, endorses the Energy Commission’s
                            zero net energy goals for all newly constructed homes by 2020
                            and for all newly constructed commercial buildings by 2030.
                            Emissions reductions are based on lower energy budgets man-
                            dated by existing Title 24 energy efficiency standards.
                            LIGHTING EFFICIENCY AND TOXIC REDUCTION ACT
                              AB 1109, the Lighting Efficiency and Toxic Reduction Act,
                            tasks the California Energy Commission (CEC) with reduc-
                            ing lighting energy usage in indoor residences by no less than
                            50 percent from 2007 levels by 2018, as well as requires a 25
                            percent reduction in indoor and outdoor commercial buildings
                            by the same date. To achieve these efficiency levels, the CEC
                            applies its existing appliance efficiency standards to include
                            lighting products, as well as requires minimum lumen/watt
                            standards for different categories of lighting products. The bill
                            also expands existing incentives for energy efficient lighting.

                            creates a $25 million per year, 10-year incentive program to
                            encourage the installation of solar water heating systems that
                            offset natural gas and electricity use in homes and businesses
                            throughout the state. The goal is to install 200,000 solar water
                            heaters by 2017.

Summary of Local Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Reduction Strategies
  The local mitigation measures prvesented in this section,
and as summarized in the tables below, achieve greenhouse
gas emissions reductions in the community of approximately
2,700 metric tons CO2e in 2020 and 4,300 metric tons CO2e
in 2030. When State reductions are added (see Table 6 for a
breakdown of State actions), emissions in Yountville would be
approximately 36 percent below 2010 levels in year 2020 and
50 percent below baseline emissions in 2030 – enough to allow
the Town to exceed State targets for both years.
  Government operations represent a subset of community
emissions. Within government operations, the Town could
achieve reductions of 823 metric tons CO2e by 2020 by im-
plementing the local reduction strategies described in this
chapter and detailed in the Appendix. Combined with State
actions, the Town could reduce government operations emis-
sions 72 percent below 2010 levels by year 2020 and 74 per-
cent by 2030 (see Table 9). A wide range of programs that
result in GHG emissions reductions that exceed the State’s

                                      goal have been included to allow for the evaluation and pri-
                                      oritization of potential programs and capital improvement
                                      projects as new program and funding opportunities arise. The
                                      Town has already realized GHG reductions from the imple-
                                      mentation of many of these programs, including the Methane
                                      Recapture program at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (578
                                      metric tons CO2e), energy efficiency projects at Town Hall,
                                      the Community Center, and the Wastewater Treatment Plant
                                      (24 metric tons CO2e), and LED streetlight retrofits (7 metric
                                      tons CO2e). These actions total 609 metric tons CO2e, which
                                      means the Town has already reduced emissions from govern-
                                      ment operations 56 percent and community emissions nearly 5
                                      percent.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
   The two fundamental means for reducing emissions from
electricity and natural gas use are decreasing consumption
through both efficiency and behavioral change, and switching
from fossil fuels to renewable sources.
   Increasing the efficiency of buildings is the most cost-effec-
tive approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Pro-
grams that require minimum energy efficiency upgrade for
home remodeling, such as increasing insulation and sealing
heating ducts, have demonstrated energy savings of up to 20
percent. More aggressive “whole house” retrofits can result
in even greater energy savings. Many “low-hanging fruit”
improvements can be made inexpensively and without remod-
eling, yet can be extremely cost-efficient; these include use of
efficient lighting, and use of advanced shower heads and irri-
gation controllers. Installing Energy Star-certified appliances
                                                              Town of Yountville Climat e Action Plan 29

                                   and office equipment, high-efficiency HVAC systems, and
                                   LED lighting not only save energy but reduce operating costs
                                   in the long run.
                                     New construction techniques and building materials, known
                                   collectively as “green building,” can significantly reduce the
                                   use of resources and energy and creation of waste in homes
                                   and commercial buildings. Green construction methods can
                                   be integrated into buildings at any stage, from design and
                                   construction to renovation and deconstruction. The State of
                                   California requires green building energy-efficiency through
                                   the Title 24 Building codes. The State updates these codes ap-
                                   proximately every three years, with increasing energy efficien-
                                   cy requirements since 2001. The 2016 code update requires
                                   a 28 percent reduction in energy use for new homes and a 5
                                   percent reduction for new commercial buildings over the 2013
                                   code. The State’s energy efficiency goals are to have all new
                                   residential construction to be zero net energy by 2020 and all
                                   new commercial construction to be zero net energy by 2030.
                                   Local governments can accelerate this target by adopting
                                   energy efficiency standards for new construction and remodels
                                   that exceed existing State mandates.
                                     Yountville residents and businesses have two primary op-
                                   tions to switch to renewable energy – either by installing solar
                                   energy systems or, beginning in 2016, purchasing Marin Clean
                                   Energy’s “Deep Green” electricity from 100 percent renew-
                                   able energy sources. Existing solar energy systems in Yountville
                                   supply about 3.5 percent of the residential electricity and 8.2
                                   percent of commercial electricity needs. Local governments
The Town has converted about
70% of its streetlights to energy-
                                   can help to increase solar adoption rates by providing incen-
efficiency LED fixtures, and will  tives, enabling property assessed clean energy loan providers
work with PG&E to convert the      to operate within their jurisdiction, streamlining permit pro-
remaining streetlights.            cessing, and amending design guidelines and zoning ordinanc-
                                   es to encourage both small and large-scale solar installations.
                                     The Town can reduce energy consumption in its own op-
                                   erations by working with PG&E to upgrade the remaining
                                   streetlights to LED lights, installing solar energy systems at
                                   the Community Center, the Wastewater Treatment Plant and
                                   the Pump Station, implementing energy efficiency protocols,
                                   and purchasing energy-efficient equipment. Finally, the Town
                                   should consider offsetting the rest of its electricity use through
30 Town of Yountville Climate Action Plan

the purchase of Marin Clean Energy Deep Green electricity.
ACTIONS THE TOWN HAS ALREADY TAKEN
  The Town has implemented the following actions to reduce
energy use and foster renewable energy use in government
operations and in the community:
  ▪▪  Replaced 200 of the Town’s 284 streetlights with LED
      lights. These energy-efficient lights use about 50 percent
      less electricity. All of the remaining non-LED streetlights
      are owned and/or maintained by PG&E. The Town re-
      quires all new streetlight and park lighting installations to
      be LED lighting.
  ▪▪  Implemented HVAC and lighting improvements, includ-
      ing occupancy sensors, at the Town Hall and the Commu-
      nity Center, and insulated the Public Works building. At
      the Wastewater Treatment Plant, the Town modified aer-
      ation blowers and replaced a water heater and six motors
      with energy-efficient models. These improvements save
      the Town over 100,000 kWh of electricity and nearly 500
      therms of natural gas each year.
  ▪▪  Approved installation of three solar energy systems at
      Town properties: a 217.3 kW DC ground-mount sys-
      tem at the Wastewater Treatment Plant; a 36.0 kW DC
      ground-mount system at the Pump Station; and a 95.4
      kW DC carport structure at the Community Center.
      These three systems will produce nearly 515,000 kWh of
      electricity each year, which is approximately 80 percent of
      the electricity these facilities consumed in 2014.
  ▪▪  Joined Marin Clean Energy (MCE), which gives Yountville
      residents and business the choice to either use MCE elec-
      tricity or remain with PG&E as their electricity provider.
      MCE provides high renewable energy content electricity
      and 100% renewable electricity options. MCE has com-
      mitted to providing its customers with electricity that is at
      least 95 percent greenhouse gas free by 2025.
  ▪▪  Implemented the California CALGreen Building Stan-
      dards Code and the Energy Standards Code, which re-
      quire energy-efficient buildings.
  ▪▪  Adopted an ordinance to enable HERO, a property-as-
      sessed clean energy (PACE) program, to operate within
      the Town’s jurisdiction. PACE programs allow a property
      owner to finance energy-saving projects on their property

Transportation
  Transportation emissions include greenhouse gasses emit-
ted from vehicles traveling on local roads (excluding roads
within the Veterans Home property) and emissions from the
operation of off-road vehicles and equipment. These emis-
sions represent 15 percent of community emissions. Federal
and State legislation aimed at improving vehicle fuel efficiency
will have the single greatest impact on reducing transporta-
tion emissions over the next fifteen years. Nonetheless, there
is significant work that the local government can undertake
to encourage residents, employees and visitors to use alterna-
tive modes of transportation, including bicycling, walking and
public transportation. Local governments can expand the net-
work of pathways, sidewalks and bicycle routes and lanes, and
ensure there are adequate facilities to lock and store bicycles.

                              Increasing the use of electric vehicles is an important way to
                            reduce emissions, as electric vehicles are estimated to generate
                            less than 20 percent of the emissions produced by a gas-pow-
                            ered vehicle. There are several publically accessible electric
                            vehicle charging stations in Yountville located at hotels and
                            Town parking lots. The CALGreen building code requires
                            new commercial and multifamily buildings to provide electric
                            vehicle parking spaces and “raceways”, or conduit, that will
                            enable future installation of electric vehicle (EV) chargers.

                            are required to provide raceway and electrical service panels

ACTIONS THE TOWN HAS ALREADY TAKEN
  The Town has taken the following actions to reduce
transportation emissions in government operations and in
the community:
  ▪▪   Purchased two electric vehicles for the Town fleet and has
       a policy to upgrade to more fuel-efficient or electric vehi-
       cles whenever possible as vehicles are replaced.
  ▪▪   Purchased a hybrid vehicle for Town employee commuting.
  ▪▪   Installed one dual-port electric vehicle charging station
       at Town Hall and four dual-port charging stations at the
       Community Center.
  ▪▪   Completed pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure and
       safety improvements to encourage residents, employees
       and visitors to walk or bike rather than drive to their
       destinations.

Water and Wastewater
WATER
  Yountville has an agreement with the California Department
of Veterans Affairs (CDVA) to provide the Town with 500 acre
feet of drinking water per year, and more when it is available.
The CDVA treats water from Rector Reservoir for the Veter-
ans Home of California, the California Department of Fish
& Game and the Town. In an emergency, the Town purchases
water from the City of Napa and can use the municipal well
that was built in 2005. 
  Water conservation efforts not only save water but reduce the
demand for electricity to pump, treat and convey water from
the water source to water users in Yountville. In addition, con-
servation reduces the need to treat wastewater at the Wastewa-
ter Treatment Plant, where GHG emissions are created during
the treatment process and through the consumption of energy
to run the facilities.
  The State mandates water-efficient fixture and landscaping
through the State building codes and other State laws. New
residential and non-residential construction is required to
install water-efficient fixtures, including low-flow faucets and
showerheads and water-efficient toilets and urinals. In addi-
tion, single family homes are required to replace all non-com-
pliant plumbing fixtures in the home whenever remodeling.
Non-compliant fixtures include toilets that use more than 1.6
gallons per flush and showerheads with a flow capacity of more
than 2.5 gallons per minute. As of January 1, 2017, single
family homeowners will be required to replace all non-compli-
ant fixtures upon resale. Commercial and multi-family build-
ing owners will be subject to similar requirements in 2019.
  The State’s model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance
requires water-efficient landscaping through the design, instal-
lation, and maintenance of new and rehabilitated landscape
projects. The law currently applies to new construction proj-
ects with a landscape area greater than 500 square feet and
rehabilitated landscape projects with a landscape area of 2,500
square feet or more. In addition, the CALGreen building code
requires weather or soil-based controllers for landscaping that

                            WASTEWATER
                              The Yountville Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater
                            produced by the Yountville community, including the Veter-
                            ans Home. As wastewater is treated, chemical processes in
                            anaerobic conditions create two greenhouse gases, methane
                            and nitrous oxide. In 2010, the Wastewater Treatment Plant
                            was the largest source of government operations emissions
                            (793 metric tons CO2e), largely due to the venting of meth-
                            ane into the atmosphere. The Town implemented a Methane
                            Recapture Program in 2012 which re-uses digester gas to
                            heat digester sludge, thereby preventing methane from being
                            released into the atmosphere and displacing natural gas that
                            was previously purchased from PG&E. Methane is now either
                            re-used or flared off, although a small percentage (approxi-
                            mately 1 percent) escapes into the atmosphere. This single
                            program reduced 2010 emissions by approximately 578 metric
                            tons CO2e, which is more than half of government operations
                            emissions.
                              The Wastewater Treatment Plant treats all of the wastewater
                            so that it can be used for irrigation. During periods of high
                            flows and when a 45/1 dilution ratio is achieved, the Town is
                            able to discharge the highly treated effluent to the Napa River.

                            in government operations and in the community, and to
                            reduce emissions from water and wastewater treatment and
                            conveyance:
                              ▪▪   Provides rebates for water-efficient toilets and low-flow
                                   fixtures. The Town currently provides a $100 incentive for
                                   each toilet replacing a 3.0+ gallons per flush (gpf) toilet
                                   with a toilet using no more than 1.28 gpf, and up to $100
                                   for replacing inefficient shower heads and bathroom sink
                                   faucets and accessories.
                              ▪▪   In partnership with PG&E, provides a rebate of up to
                                   $150 for replacing inefficient washing machines.
                              ▪▪   Provides a cash incentive of $1.00 per square foot, up to
                                   $750 for a single family home and $2,500 for a commer-
                                   cial or multi-family building, to replace turf grass with
                                   drip-irrigated low water use plants.
                              ▪▪   Works with the City of Napa to provide Waterwise Gar-
                                   dening workshops and promote water conservation.
                              ▪▪   Adopted the State Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance
                                   and implements State regulations for water-efficient
                                   plumbing fixtures and landscapes.
                              ▪▪   Installed water-efficient plumbing fixtures in the Town
                                   Hall and Community Center.
                              ▪▪   Installed an EPIC irrigation system to irrigate the lawn on
                                   the north side of Community Hall from below the ground,
                                   which greatly reduces the amount of irrigation water and
                                   loss of water to evaporation.
                              ▪▪   Installed new efficient sprinklers and weather-based irriga-
                                   tion controllers.
                              ▪▪   Replaced park and pathway landscaping with drought-
                                   tolerant plants as shown in Figure 5.
                              ▪▪   Replaced residential and commercial water meters with
                                   new meters that allow property owners to better track
                                   usage and improve leak detection.

                                          Waste Reduction, Reuse and Recycling
                                            The reduction of waste, as well as the reuse and recycling of
                                          products, is key to reducing impacts on the environment. It
                                          is necessary to rethink what has traditionally been regarded as
                                          garbage and treat all materials as valued resources instead of
                                          items to discard. This requires shifting consumption patterns,
                                          more carefully managing purchases, and maximizing the reuse
                                          of materials at the end of their useful life.
                                            The Town contracts with Upper Valley Disposal Service
                                          (UVDS) for residential and commercial recycling and waste
                                          collection and processing services. UVDS owns and operates
                                          the Clover Flat Landfill, located outside Calistoga, and the
                                          Upper Valley Recycling Redemption Center, located south of
                                          St. Helena. Waste from government operations includes refuse
                                          from Town buildings, parks and street cans, as well as sludge
                                          from the Wastewater Treatment Plant’s drying beds.
                                            Emissions from the waste sector are an estimate of methane
                                          generation from the decomposition of organic solid waste and
                                          alternative daily cover sent to the landfill. These emissions are
                                          not generated in the year the waste is landfilled, but instead
                                          result from the decomposition of the waste over 100+ years.

                                            Recycling and composting diversion programs are very
                                          important tools for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the
                                          community. Composting of biologic waste, such as food and
                                          yard waste and sludge, not only reduces the volume of waste
                                          material in the landfill, the end compost product can be used
                                          as a soil enhancer.
                                            Composting is typically an aerobic process and a large frac-

tion of the degradable biologic carbon in the waste material is
converted into carbon dioxide. Methane is formed in anaer-
obic sections of the compost, but is oxidized to a large extent
in the aerobic sections of the compost. Anaerobic sections are
created in composting piles when there is excessive moisture
or inadequate aeration, or mixing, of the compost pile. The es-
timated methane released into the atmosphere ranges from less
than one percent to a few percent of the initial carbon content
in the material. Composting can also produce emissions of ni-
trous oxide. The range of the estimated emissions varies from
less than 0.5 percent to 5 percent of the initial nitrogen con-
tent of the material. The greenhouse gas emissions protocol
does not currently include standardized methodologies as it
assumes well-managed piles of compost are adequately aerated
and emit negligible methane and nitrous oxide emissions.
  New State legislation is focusing on eliminating organics
from the landfill in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Commencing January 1, 2020, landfill operators will no
longer be allowed to count green material used as alternative
daily cover (ADC) towards its recycling targets. Upper Valley
Disposal Services states that 100 percent of organic ADC
material will be diverted to compost or converted to renewable
energy at a planned biomass gasification plant at the Clover
Flat Resource Recovery Center by 2020. UVDS currently has
a high recycling rate. The facility recycled 71 percent of waste
in 2012 (excluding ADC) and has a goal to reach nearly 75
percent recycling by 2020.
  State law currently requires all businesses and public entities
that generate four cubic yards or more of waste per week and
multifamily buildings with five or more units to recycle. Also,
businesses that generate eight cubic yards of organic waste
or more a week are required to source separate food scraps
and yard trimmings and arrange for recycling services of that
organic waste. By 2019, the requirement will be expanded
to cover businesses generating 4 cubic yards a week of solid
waste, and may be imposed on smaller business operations
in 2020 if State targets are not met. The statewide goal is to
divert 50 percent of all organic commercial waste diverted
from the landfill by 2020 and 95 percent by 2030.
  Another source of greenhouse gas emissions is from wood

                            and other organic waste found in construction and demolition
                            debris. The State’s CALGreen building code currently man-
                            dates 50 percent of nonhazardous construction and demoli-
                            tion waste to be diverted from the landfill. The requirement
                            applies to new residential and commercial construction, as
                            well as additions and alterations that meet certain thresholds.
                            The requirement increases to 65 percent beginning in January
                            2017.
                              UVDS implements all State laws and plans to meet recycling
                            and diversion targets through expanded food waste programs
                            to residences as well as businesses, increased gasification tons,
                            and expanded mandatory commercial recycling.

                            Natural Systems and Sequestration
                              The natural environment has been extensively altered by
                            human civilization, often with little consideration for how
                            natural systems function, depriving us of the important bene-
                            fits they offer. Clearing and draining of wetlands, forestlands,
                            grasslands and other open space for agricultural production
                            or urban development decreases or eliminates the capacity
                            of those natural systems to store carbon. The carbon dioxide
                            stored in soil, trees and other vegetation is released into the
                            atmosphere when forestland and open space is converted to
                            other uses. Restoration of these natural areas, and establish-
                            ment of new ones, has the potential to tie up or sequester
                            greenhouse gas emissions in the form of soil and wood carbon.
                            One way Yountville can sequester emissions is by encouraging
                            tree planting in the community.
                            ACTIONS THE TOWN HAS ALREADY TAKEN
                              The Town has already taken the following actions to plant
                            trees in public spaces and encourage tree planting in the com-
                            munity:
                              ▪▪    Requires property owners to plant replacement trees
                                    whenever a tree removal permit is granted. If a replace-
                                    ment tree is not feasible, the property owner may pay an
                                    in-lieu fee to fund tree planting on public land.
                              ▪▪    Is a Tree City USA community and plants at least one
                                    non-replacement tree per year in order to maintain its
                                    status.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN
  Yountville recognizes that responding to and preparing for
climate change is a critical step toward a sustainable future. The
Town’s early actions to reduce its contribution to climate change
reflect the Town’s history and commitment to decrease the im-
pacts of day-to-day activities on the natural environment while
enhancing its vibrant quality of life. Mitigating climate change
will require everyone — residents, businesses, government agen-
cies, and nonprofit organizations — to work together to imple-
ment this plan.
  This plan provides a strategy to achieve emission reductions
that will achieve local levels consistent with State goals to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and 40 percent
below 1990 levels by 2030. A wide range of programs have been
included in this plan to allow for the evaluation and prioritiza-
tion of potential programs and capital improvement projects as
new program and funding opportunities arise. Successful im-
plementation of the plan will require staff and the Town Council
to identify and commit resources to climate change mitigation
activities, and to monitor and report on progress towards meeting
emissions reduction goals.
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
CAP 6-1
Annual Monitoring. Monitor and report on the Town’s progress
annually. Create an annual priorities list for implementation.
CAP 6-2
Update GHG Emissions Inventories. Update the greenhouse gas
emissions inventory for community emissions annually and
every five years for government operations.
CAP 6-3
Inter-Agency Coordination. Participate in public and private
partnerships with Marin Clean Energy, PG&E, Napa County
Energy Watch, Napa Valley Transportation Authority, Upper
Valley Disposal Services, Yountville Elementary School, Sus-

Methodology and            Calculation assumes 13.7% PV market penetration by 2020 based on 2014
Assumptions                annual growth rates of 36% for residential systems and 12% for non-
                           residential systems. PV residential market penetration is estimated at
                           3.5% in April 2016, and non-residential penetration at 8.2%. The estimate
                           of PV to be installed is restricted to installations on existing homes and
                           commercial properties, excluding government facilities.

Assumptions                 assumes the remaining 84 streetlights, which are owned and/or maintained
                            by PG&E, will be converted to LED by 2020.
                            Electricity consumed by PG&E streetlights was included as an information
                            item in the Town's 2010 LGO Emissions Inventory. Therefore, the action is
                            identified as a community action, and not a government operations action.
                            Savings are based on LED streetlights conversion projects for similar towns
                            in Marin County.

                                       County Bicycle Coalition recruited nine pilot schools in four different
                                       geographic locations. Initial surveys reported that 62% of the students
                                       were arriving by car, with only 14% walking, 7% biking to school, 11%

                                       At the end of the pilot program, the participating schools experienced a

Methodology and          The VINE transit system is operated by the Napa Valley Transportation
Assumptions              Authority (NVTA). In 2012, NVTA redesigned the Vine system to better meet the
                         needs of the community and transit riders. Ridership changed between 2010
                         and 2015 as follows:
                         Vine Transit: 407,336 in 2010 and 824,383 in 2015, a 202% increase.

                         Combined, this is a 196% increase over 2010 ridership.
                         We have assumed a 2% annual growth in ridership for years 2016 through
                         2030.

Methodology and      We assume 41% of residential water consumption is for indoor use, and
Assumptions          33.2% of indoor water use is hot water (AWWA Research Foundation)
                     We assume 82% of commercial water use is for indoor use and 39% of
                     indoor water use is hot water, based on EPA estimates of end uses of water
                     by commercial subsectors.
                     We assume 40% of commercial buildings use natural gas to heat water,
                     based on the 2012 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey.
                     The Pacific Institute has found a potential of 33 gallons per capita per day
                     by retrofitting homes with the latest models of water-efficient appliances
                     and fixtures and eliminating water loss from leaky pipes and fixtures.
                     Potential savings for fixtures that use hot water (faucets, showers, clothes
                     washers, and dishwashers) are 15.2 gallons per capita per day.
                     Approximately 8.1 gallons are hot water.
                     The Pacific Institute estimates commercial water use can be reduced by 30 to
                     50 percent.
                     Similar to energy efficiency programs, we assume an annual water efficiency
                     savings of 1% due to water efficiency programs.
                     This measure applies water savings to existing homes and commercial
                     buildings only, as new buildings are required to install water-efficient
                     fixtures.
                     The California Energy Commission estimates that it takes 3,500 kWh of
                     electricity per million gallons to convey, treat and distribute water from the
                     water source to the customer and 1,911 kWh/MG to treat wastewater in
                     northern California.

Methodology and      We assume 59% of residential water consumption is for outdoor use in
Assumptions          (American Water Works Association)
                     We assume 18% of commercial water use is for outdoor use (EPA).
                     The Pacific Institute estimates moderate landscape conversions could reduce
                     outdoor water use by 30%, while more extensive conversions could reduce
                     outdoor use by 70%. CAPCOA also estimates water-efficient landscapes can
                     reduce outdoor water use by up to 70% (CAPCOA Measure WUW-3). The
                     Water Research Foundation estimates water reductions of 20-50% when
                     using mild to aggressive landscape conversion programs.
                     The Water Conservation Act (SBX 7-7) requires the state to achieve a 20%
                     reduction in urban per capita water use by the year 2020. Similar to energy
                     efficiency programs, we assume an annual water efficiency savings of 1% due
                     to water efficiency programs after 2020.
                     The California Energy Commission estimates that it takes 3,500 kWh of
                     electricity per million gallons to convey, treat and distribute water from the
                     water source to the customer.

                          Water-efficient landscape irrigation systems reduce outdoor water use by
                          6.1% (CAPCOA Measure WUW-4).
                          The Water Research Foundation estimates water reductions of 20-50% when
                          using mild to aggressive landscape conversion programs.
                          Weather-based irrigation systems reduce water use by 9.4% at single family
                          sites and 27.5% at commercial sites. Since Town properties are well-
                          maintained, we have assumed the average, or approximately 18%, for this
                          measure.
                          The California Energy Commission estimates that it takes 3,500 kWh of
                          electricity per million gallons to convey, treat and distribute water from the
                          water source to the customer.

                                   increasing recycling, reusing materials, and reducing consumption.

              Methodology and      Commencing January 1, 2020, AB 1594 mandates that the use of green
              Assumptions          material as alternative daily cover (ADC) no longer constitutes diversion
                                   through recycling. UVDS states that 100% of organic ADC material will be
                                   diverted to compost and gasification by 2020.
                                   AB 1826 requires businesses that generate 8 cubic yards of organic waste
                                   or more a week to source separate food scraps and yard trimmings and
                                   arrange for recycling services of that organic waste, beginning in 2016. By
                                   2019, the requirement covers all businesses generating 4 cubic yards a
                                   week of solid waste. On or after January 1, 2020, if CalRecycle determines
                                   that the statewide disposal of organic waste has not been reduced by 50
                                   percent of the level of disposal in 2014, the organic recycling requirements
                                   on businesses will expand to cover businesses that generate 2 cubic yards
                                   or more of commercial solid waste per week. The Statewide goal is to have
                                   50% of all organic commercial waste diverted from the landfill by 2020 and
                                   95% by 2030.
                                   We assume 50% of households will divert food waste from their garbage
                                   cans, with through home composting or curbside collection by 2020 and
                                   90% by 2030.
                                   We assume recycling rates for paper waste and residential green waste will
                                   increase so that 50% of is diverted by 2020 and 90% is diverted by 2030
                                   over 2010 levels.

Methodology and         The Town has a tree replacement policy for trees on private property.
Assumptions             Whenever a tree is removed that requires a tree removal permit, the property
                        owner must plant a replacement tree at the owner’s expense. If a replacement
                        tree is not feasible, then the owner may pay an in-lieu fee, and the Town will
                        then plant a tree somewhere in the Town (usually at a park or open space).
                        This measure quantifies GHG savings from planting additional, non-
                        replacement trees.

                        with age, and will be completely offset by losses from clipping, pruning, and
                        occasional death.

Program Description        The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires electricity providers to
                           increase the portion of energy that comes from renewable sources to 33%
                           by 2020 and 50% by 2030.

                -2,137.6   2020
                -2,151.2   2030
Methodology and            This State Action assumes both electricity providers will meet the
Assumptions                Renewable Portfolio standard requirements. Additional GHG reductions
                           related to MCE 's more aggressive GHG reduction policies are quantified
                           separately as a local action.
                           The CPUC calculator only provides projected emission factors for 2020.
                           Therefore, the same projected emission factor was used for 2030.

                                        requires a 25% reduction in indoor and outdoor commercial buildings by
                                        the same date. To achieve these efficiency levels, the CEC applies its existing
                                        appliance efficiency standards to include lighting products, as well as
                                        requires minimum lumen/watt standards for different categories of lighting

   CHAPTER I.                                                           INTRODUCTION
A.               INTENT: REESTABLISHING TOWN STRUCTURE
The 1992 revision to the Yountville General Plan represents an important milestone in the Town's
history and evolution. Like many other towns, large and small, throughout California,
development in Yountville reflects two distinctly different eras of planning and development. The
town was chartered in 1879 as an agrarian settlement with a gridiron of streets. As was typical of
American towns in the nineteenth century, growth was directed by a town map which located
streets and individual lots. Within this town structure individual settlers and builders made the
town, one building at a time. In recent years the patterns of growth in Yountville, and most other
American towns, has been very different. Recent development has been on large parcels of land,
without a pre-configured pattern of streets, blocks, and lots. Planned Development procedures
encouraged development of these parcels as self-contained areas, with minimal connection to the
existing town fabric. Planned Developments, as they have evolved in California, reflect both the
dominance of the automobile and the fact that most construction is now the domain of professional
developers, not individual settlers building for their own use.
In the lengthy public discussion that accompanied this General Plan revision, citizens of Yountville
debated the merits of those parts of town built the old way, lot by lot on a grid, versus the parts of
town built the new way through the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Planned Development
process. People noted many differences in character and detail of older areas and newer ones in
the mixture of uses, the sense of the landscape around the town, the design of streets, the
relationships of buildings to streets, and buildings themselves. Most residents of Yountville and
the Citizen's Task Force expressed particular affection for the parts built the old way. It is the
character of the old part of town that is particular and distinctive.
This document, therefore, represents a conceptual break from the planning practice of the recent
past. It also recognizes that conditions are fundamentally and permanently different from those
that produced the nineteenth century town. This Plan and its companion documents, the Zoning
Ordinance and Design Ordinance, acknowledge contemporary facts regarding the automobile,
tourism, professional developers and the distribution of goods and services by large organizations.
Working within these constraints, this Plan seeks to reshape Yountville's future growth. It resists
the encroachment on Yountville of generic, placeless suburbia and gives form to a rebirth of the
historic agrarian town so loved by its residents.
B.                                                   TOWN HISTORY & SETTING
The Town of Yountville is located in the heart of the Napa Valley about sixty miles north of San
Francisco, halfway between the cities of Napa and St. Helena. From most parts of the town, there
are views of the Mayacamas Range to the west, and the Howell Mountain Range to the east. The
map on the following page shows Yountville's position relative to other prominent cities in the
vicinity.

Like some other small towns in Napa Valley, Yountville began as an agricultural settlement
surrounded by fields and vineyards. Today, the city limits remain small and compact,
encompassing about two and a half square miles; however, the planning area is less than one
square mile. (See Map of Soils Classifications, Figure IV.1, for complete view of incorporated
city limits.) Incorporated as a California city in 1965, Yountville has grown to a population of
about 3,300, of which about 1,300 reside in the Veterans Home of California.
Yountville has an established reputation for fine restaurants and shops. However, this commercial
success has created pressure for expansion to serve the increasing number of visitors to the Napa
Valley. In an effort to maintain its rural small town qualities, recent commercial growth has been
restricted to modest expansion of local-serving businesses.
Although there are few remaining un-built parcels, it is critical to direct their development in ways
that preserve Yountville’s setting and vitality.

C.                                                          LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
By State Law, every community in California is required to have a General Plan. A General Plan
must contain and address the following seven elements: Circulation, Open Space, Land Use,
Housing, Conservation of Natural Resources, Safety, and Noise. An updated Housing Element that
is consistent with State housing laws must be submitted to the State for review every five years.
The Town Council adopts the General Plan by resolution as a legal document. The General Plan
must be internally consistent among the seven elements and with other legal documents pertaining
to the community. The last review and revision of Yountville's General Plan was in 1985, with
several additional revisions between 1985 and 1992. Concurrently with the 1992 update of the
General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance is being revised. A new Design Ordinance is also being
prepared.
D.         CITIZEN PARTICIPATION & THE PUBLIC PROCESS
In 1990, the Yountville Town Council initiated a review of the current General Plan that was
adopted in 1985. There was concern that the Land Use, Housing and Circulation Elements as well
as the Zoning Ordinance, were not fully achieving the goals of the 1985 General Plan. It has been,
and remains, the desire of Yountville residents to retain its small town character, scale, and pace of
life.
The Town has made a concerted effort to reach out to the vast majority of its residents. Over 30
public meetings were held during the past two years. Two mailings were sent to every property
owner; once at the beginning of the process, and again for the first public hearing. Meeting dates
and information about the process appeared in the local papers, bi-monthly in the Community and
Recreation Newsletters, and on Channel 6, the local Community Access television channel.
In July 1992, a 20 member Task Force was appointed by the Town Council to guide the
development of the General Plan as the community's policy statement. The Town Council held
three public hearings on the Plan in October 1992, and the Plan was adopted by resolution 935-92
on November 10, 1992. The 1992 Yountville General Plan supersedes the 1985 General Plan and
all amendments made to the 1985 Plan.
E.                           ORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The Yountville General Plan is organized into four chapters that discuss the seven elements
required by State law. Town Structure is emphasized in Chapter II and includes three elements:
circulation, open space/parks, and land use. A key feature of Chapter II is the Town Map that
establishes a framework for future growth in the way that Town Maps guided the growth of most
American towns when they were first established. Each chapter consists of text, charts, and other
illustrations that express the concerns of the Town Council and the community. Each chapter
concludes with issues, objectives and policies followed by strategies for implementation for each
of the seven required General Plan Elements. The chart on the following page specifies where each
of the State-mandated elements and related information is located within each chapter.

F.                             RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
The General Plan must be internally consistent and cross-referenced with other regulating
documents of the town. The Zoning Ordinance has been updated, reformatted, and coordinated
with the General Plan. A new Design Ordinance has been created to regulate the design of the
town and its buildings through design standards. The Design Ordinance has been adopted as an
ordinance. The ambiance of the town, its pedestrian character, and the way in which the public
spaces are shaped by buildings, depends upon the interaction between land use and the details of
design. Accordingly, the three documents are closely related and cross referenced. It is necessary
that anyone who considers building in the town be familiar with the intentions and provisions of all
three documents.
G.                                                   PREVIOUS GENERAL PLANS
This is the fourth General Plan since the Town of Yountville was incorporated. Like others before
it, this General Plan builds on those that precede it. Each new plan is part of the town's growth.
The 1992 General Plan acknowledges the cumulative nature of the process and that the town will
continue to change to respond to the needs of its residents and businesses. Listed below are
highlights of previous plans.
1966 - The first General Plan focused on the shift from an agricultural community to a small town
consisting of neighborhoods with commercial uses interspersed. Excluding the Veterans Home of
California, the town was about one square mile with about 800 residents. Its primary objective
was to plan adequately for the influx of people and business moving into Napa Valley. Projections
made at the time stated that in 1985 Yountville would need to accommodate a population of
30,000.
1975 -The second General Plan addressed the growth of the Napa Valley as a result of the
expanding wine-making industry and the large numbers of people moving to California in general.
The size of the town did not change, however, the density of building increased substantially and
residents began to feel that the rural character of the town was eroding.
1985 - The third General Plan reconsidered the amount of land zoned for commercial and
residential uses. At that time, about half of the land in the town remained in vineyards, orchards or
was undeveloped. There was concern that development since 1975 was not adequately achieving
the primary goal of the 1975 General Plan, that of "conserving the small town character, scale and
pace of life in Yountville". Because many feared that the town would be overwhelmed by visitor-
oriented commercial development, land was rezoned and the potential for commercial uses
restricted. The conservation of natural resources was acknowledged as an important part of the
town’s character and the Plan established polices to retain the natural character of Hopper Creek
and other open space.

H.                                                     AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY
Within the town limits of Yountville, there are about 70 acres of land available for future
development. A large portion of this land is designated for residential development and some
highly visible properties are zoned for commercial uses. These properties will have an effect on
the quality of the town as significant as the combined development of the last 20 years. The
principal objective of the General Plan revision and the accompanying documents, the Zoning
Ordinance and Design Ordinance, is to shape these future developments in a way that captures and
perpetuates the flavor of Yountville's oldest neighborhoods. Figure I.3 identifies these parcels.
I.                              ADMINISTERING THE GENERAL PLAN
State law defines how cities should maintain their Plan as a contemporary policy guide. The
California Government Code requires each planning department to report annually to the Town
Council on "the status of the Plan and progress of its implementation" (Section 65400[b]). That
report must include the Town's progress in fulfilling its "fair share of its regional housing needs."
The report must be reviewed by the Town Council and submitted to the California Department of
Housing and Community Development no later than 30-days after the Town Council hears the
report.
In addition, the Town Council should review the Plan comprehensively every five years to
determine whether it reflects community values and needs. The Housing Element has an
established schedule for review every five years; Northern California cities are required to update
their Housing Elements for adoption by July 1995. Once a year, the Town Council should review
the accomplishments and status of implementation programs set forth in the General Plan.
Amendments to the General Plan are encouraged in conjunction with this review, although
amendments may be accepted at other times of the year.
The State of California permits up to four amendments to the General Plan per element per year
(Government Code Section 65358[b]). Amendments may be made to any part of the text, issues,
objectives, or policies in response to changing needs or accomplishments of the community.
General Plan amendments may be initiated by the Town Council, Town staff, or Yountville
citizens. Detailed information on the procedure and timing for amendments is available at Town
Hall. All amendments require application to the Town and public hearings by the Town Council.
Environmental review in accordance with provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
is required for every General Plan amendment.

CHAPTER II.                                                        TOWN STRUCTURE
A.                                                   INTENT OF THE TOWN MAP
The Yountville Town Map is the most important element of the Town's planning documents.
Originally, town maps were the primary tools by which the organization of American towns was
established. The disappearance of town maps is linked with the transformation and widespread
disintegration of the structure of American towns after World War II. There is a clear difference
between a town whose street locations and land division are guided by a map and a town that
grows without such a map. With this kind of map there is a collective civic order that shapes and
controls private investment on private property. Without such a map, private property is
autonomous and private investment is directed principally toward its own needs. A map can make
individual acts part of the collective act of town-making. Things add up. Without a map that
establishes a town structure that is larger than private parcels of land, there is no organizing
principal that links private parcels together into a cohesive town fabric. The 1992 Yountville Town
Map shows the layout of streets, including new streets within future development parcels. The
framework established by these streets supports a network of open spaces, parks, and pedestrian
and bike paths through out the town and reinforces its view corridors. Figure II.1 is the Town Map
for Yountville. The original is on display at Town Hall.
B.                                                                           CIRCULATION
The Circulation Element of the General Plan is most closely aligned with the Land Use Element,
and discusses circulation and transportation needs for the planned land uses.
B.1                                                                                   The Grid
Yountville streets are organized in two ways. In the area known as Old Town, the blocks between
Washington and Yount Streets represent the classic American pattern of a main street and
residential grid. Heritage Estates, Vintage Estates, and the mobile home parks include
characteristics of the post-World War II pattern of curvilinear streets, collectors, and cul-de-sacs.
The character and functioning of these two patterns is very different. Collectors with cul-de-sacs
create privatized residential areas with no through traffic, but with concentrations of traffic on
collector roads. Gridiron planning links development together in continuous town fabric, and most
significantly for Yountville, creates streets which function as view corridors to the surrounding
landscape. The Task Force members voted unanimously in favor of the grid layout for new streets
and development. Therefore, the 1992 Yountville General Plan utilizes gridiron planning whenever
possible for future development, and locates connections amongst existing areas to enable streets
to function according to the principles of the gridiron.

Washington Street is Yountville's main street, the focus of its commercial and civic life. However,
Washington Street has gaps and inconsistencies. Some recent commercial development has been
inward-focusing, set away from the street and without definition. This plan, together with the
Zoning Ordinance and Design Ordinance, intends to direct new commercial development in order
to strengthen Washington Street as a pedestrian-oriented commercial main street with a cohesive
building frontage.

This section discusses existing conditions found within the town. These include the street system,
pedestrian and bike paths, traffic patterns and congestion, transit routes, and the accommodation of
off-street parking. Figure II.2 identifies existing streets by number and proposed streets by letter.
B.3.a                                                           Existing Street System
The existing street network is a combination of the two street systems described above;
the original grid of residential streets, and a newer pattern of collectors and private streets, which
are linked by two north-south streets known as Washington and Yount Streets. The proposed new
streets continue to direct visitor traffic to Washington Street, Yountville's "Main Street" and only
arterial street.
Washington Street is a two-way street that provides parking on either side, south of Mulberry
Street. North of Mulberry Street there are many access drives, and only a few on-street parking
spaces. The Town Hall and Library front onto Yount Street which is two-lanes with on-street
parking on either side. The U.S. Post Office is located at the ‘Y’ where Yount Street merges with
Washington at the center of town.
East-west streets include Madison Street, Yountville Cross Road, Finnell Road, and California
Drive. Each of these has a different character and width, but each is designed to accommodate
through traffic.
In Old Town, the streets provide many routes to serve its residents but do not accommodate large
volumes of through traffic. They are rural in character and have no concrete curbs, gutters, or
sidewalks. Jefferson Street, a well-used residential street, has a paved width of 36 feet with gravel
shoulders on both sides for walking and potential on-street parking.

Other east-west streets that link newer residential developments to Yount and Washington Streets
include Mulberry Street, Oak Circle, and Yountville Cross Road. These streets are more suburban
in character with concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. There are also private streets that are
located primarily in the mobile home parks; these are typically narrow paved lanes with swales in
the paving for drainage.
B.3.b                            Existing Traffic Patterns & Congestion
Traffic count data collected in October 1988 indicates that there is little congestion on streets
within the town. Volume counts and capacity for critical intersections were recorded and analyzed
for twenty-four hour periods. The capacity of streets to accommodate traffic volumes is based on
the ability of specific intersections to handle traffic volumes and turning movements. Based on
traffic volumes, the capacity of heavily traveled streets are categorized by the level of service,
referred to as L.O.S.
Washington Street, north of California Drive, carries the highest volume of vehicles of any street in
the Town; and during the critical weekend day peak hour of 1:00 to 2:00 p.m., drivers may
experience congestion in the L.O.S. "D" category at California Drive. Another major congestion
location is the left turn movement from Madison Street onto State Highway 29. This intersection
has a L.O.S. "F" during the peak weekend traffic hour of 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. Other locations within
the town are at a L.O.S. "C" or better. (Omni-Means report "Traffic Circulation Analysis for the
Town of Yountville-Jan 89)
Along Washington Street there are frequent driveways serving off-street parking areas for both
commercial and residential development. Cars making left turns to enter and exit driveways disrupt
and congest traffic on Washington, especially during the peak hour on weekdays, weekends and
holidays. Also, visitors to commercial areas loop around Washington to Humboldt to Yount and
back when searching for a place to park. This circulation pattern creates additional congestion in
the neighborhood.
The grid of Old Town provides multiple cross-town routes that disperse traffic and alleviate the
need for directing or discouraging through traffic. Although Madison Street generally carries the
most traffic, the other streets, Monroe, Starkey, Webber, or Humboldt, also serve as a cross-town
connection.
B.3.c             Existing Accommodation for Off-Street Parking
The demand for parking in Yountville is primarily generated by the commercial uses adjacent to
the “Y” where Yount Street merges with Washington Street. Parking lots within individual parcels
and on adjacent streets are shared by the entire area. Shoppers walk across Washington Street with
ease. However, there remains a need for additional off-street parking. Some new parking was
provided by the Town with the completion of the U.S. Post Office in 1992 and is shared by
Community Hall.
On an average weekend day during peak demand hours, the off-street parking lots are often full,
but some on-street spaces remain available on nearby streets. However, future growth in the
commercial area will overburden the existing off-street parking and increase the demand for on-
street spaces. As a result, traffic congestion will increase as drivers search for parking. All new
businesses must provide adequate off-street parking and limit access onto Washington Street to
minimize potential traffic conflict and to prevent over-burdening of on-street parking. To reduce
pedestrian crossings and potential accidents, additional off-street parking must be provided with
addition or expansion of any commercial uses, particularly those fronting Washington Street
between California Drive and Webber Avenue.

To eliminate congestion created by visitor buses along Washington Street, designated off-street
visitor bus parking spaces are needed within existing parking areas. Half a dozen or more spaces
currently exist within the Vintage 1870 parking lots near the tennis courts. Additional spaces in
town still are needed.
B.3.d                                                        Existing Transit Routes
Yountville’s public transportation includes local and regional bus service. Since 1982, public
transportation has been provided throughout town and to the Veterans Home of California;
however, Yountville has no transportation terminals within its service network. The town was
once served by the railroad adjacent to the west side of State Highway 29. Since passenger service
is no longer provided, the Town does not view rail service as integral part of the transportation and
circulation network. The Town has an active program to improve and increase the number of
pedestrian and bicycle routes which connect the residential neighborhoods to commercial business
area.
In 1990, the State of California mandated that each county develop and annually review a County
Congestion Management Plan, CMP. It has become the prerequisite for obtaining local subvention
funds from the State, including funds from the State Transportation Improvement Program, STIP,
to have a CMP established. In 1992, the County of Napa, and the five municipalities formed a
joint powers congestion management agency which now serves as the basis for meeting the State's
requirements.
State Highway 29 defines a portion of Yountville's western boundary. This portion of the CMP
arterial network includes the Yountville Overpass which provides access to California Drive, and
the on-grade intersection at Madison Street. Continued monitoring of this intersection is necessary
to ensure that signalization occurs. In addition to the street network, there are alternative modes of
transportation which provide services to Yountville. These include the following:
BEAR FLAG EXPRESS , BFE
The BFE provides regular bus service within the town east of State Highway 29, and to the
Veterans Home of California, west of 29. It is operated by the Town of Yountville through a
contract with the Veterans Home of California.
GREYHOUND BUS COMPANY
A national private company, Greyhound, provides one stop daily to Yountville with connections to
the neighboring cities, and the greater Greyhound network.
AMTRAK BUS/RAIL
Although connecting service to Yountville is provided by Amtrak bus, riders are required to
purchase their Amtrak rail ticket before boarding the Amtrak bus to the Martinez rail station.
Ticketing procedures may change and should be checked periodically.
NAPA VALLEY TRANSIT
A joint powers, inter-city transportation system which makes several stops in Yountville daily,
except Sunday.
VAN-GO
A paratransit demand/response system that serves Yountville's elderly and handicapped persons.

B.4       Description of Proposed New Streets
For the most part, the circulation system for Yountville will remain unchanged. New, local-serving
streets will be provided on the remaining un-built parcels when they are developed. The proposed
new streets, illustrated in the Town Map, Figure II.1, extend the gridiron pattern of streets found in
Old Town. New streets or alleys will be rural in character and built according to standards
established in the Design Ordinance, Chapter I, Section A.1. New streets are indicated by letter in
the Street Identification Map, Figure II.2, and keyed to Table II.4 below.
There are two locations where individual site conditions require additional surveying and
engineering studies to determine feasible locations for new development. There are problems
associated with existing flood channels and other topographic conditions of adjacent parcels that
make it untimely to designate even new street locations. These parcels are known as the Vintage
Partners Property and the Catholic Church Property.
The preferred location for a new street on the Vintage Partners property south of Vintage 1870 is
indicated on all maps with a dashed line and is intended to provide through-access and connect
Mulberry Street with Oak Circle. Although not mandatory, the new street could provide additional
access to properties fronting Washington Street and assist in reducing traffic congestion along
Washington Street. Final street location will be determined during site planning review by the
Town Council.
Since the Catholic Church property lies within the "special flood hazard" zone as shown in Figure
IV.4, development potential is even more unknown, and therefore, only the access street into the
property is shown on the maps. The proposed access street begins at Washington Street, follows
along the northern boundary of the parcel and crosses Hopper Creek. It is intended that the access
street connect to adjacent properties and new development not interfere with activities of the
church. A detailed study of this property that addresses potential flooding and its mitigation is
needed to determine the location of new development and its streets.

With the exception of telephone service, existing utilities are discussed in Chapter IV.,
Conservation. Electric and gas service is discussed in Section A.6, Energy; water service in
Section A.3, Water; and refuse collection and recycling in Section A.7, Solid Waste.
Pac Bell currently provides telephone service through overhead transmission lines. The Town will
continue to support efforts made by Pac Bell to underground existing and new lines.

       Objective
8      Continue to review and update parking ratios in the Zoning Ordinance, and design standards
       in the Design Ordinance to reflect trends in vehicular size and use.
       Policies
8.1    Allow adjacent property owners to share access to parking lots. When the times that the
       parking spaces are used differs, allow the shared use of spaces. Each development must
       provide and maintain, at some location within the commercial area, the parking spaces
       required by the Zoning Ordinance. The realization of this policy relies on the collaboration
       of businesses and land owners.

The following is a list of measures that will be taken by the Town to implement the policies stated
above. All implementation measures should be undertaken as soon as possible relative to
economic feasibility and long-term planning goals.
UPDATE OF DESIGN ORDINANCE
The parking requirements in the Zoning Ordinance, and design standards in the Design Ordinance
shall be periodically reviewed and revised to implement the concept, objectives, and policies of the
Circulation Element.
PARKING STUDY FOR COMMERCIAL AREA
The Town, in conjunction with representatives of local businesses, should continue the study of
parking issues in the commercial area, and develop a solution that is agreeable to all parties
involved. Consideration should be given to the possibility of shared parking among small
businesses. The study should focus on the accommodation of parking along Washington Street,
from California Drive to Madison Street, in ways which reinforce the continuity of Washington
Street as a commercial-oriented main street.
HIGHWAY 29-MADISON STREET INTERSECTION
The Town Council has made repeated requests and will continue to ask CalTrans for the
installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of State Highway 29 and Madison Street. Future
street improvement plans should consider existing and planned land use in the town and be
implemented as soon as funding is available.
FUNDING OF STREET, BICYCLE, AND PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS
All new developments which require street improvements and are located on sites which the
pedestrian and bicycle path network traverses, will be required to install and finance the entire cost
of the improvements. Long term improvements will be financed by gas tax funds, transportation
grants, and other public funding sources. The Town may establish a traffic mitigation program
which estimates the cost of all improvements necessary to keep the required level of service as
stated in Section B.5.a, Objective 1, and assess new development a mitigation fee based upon
projected trip generation. These fees would be used towards the financing of improvements.
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
The Town has a development review process which requires all new development proposals of a
medium or large scale to submit a traffic study with their applications. The traffic study must
address the impact of the proposed development on the local street system, adjacent streets and
highways, plus its conformance with the circulation objectives, congestion management plan and
policies of the Plan. The study shall be prepared by a traffic consultant retained by the Town, or as
part of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the proposed project, and its costs
shall be borne by the applicant.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
The Traffic Study prepared in October, 1988 contains a number of recommendations to address
existing traffic problems. A long term capital improvements plan should be prepared by the Town
which includes a timetable for projects and recommended studies.

C.1                                     View Corridors And Sense of Place
An important feature of the traditional American street grid is the connection it makes between
townscape and landscape. In a gridiron town streets function as view corridors. One's place in the
landscape and the particular features of landscape are clear and visible. This principle applies in
cities like San Francisco and Seattle and in towns like Sonoma and Yountville. Awareness of the
landscape makes these places distinctive and different from one another. On curvilinear streets
and cul-de-sacs this principle disappears. Views are blocked, one tends to lose track of where one
is and places become similar to one another. The sense of belonging to a particular and distinctive
community is lessened. Entry points or gateways provide an important opportunity to establish this
community sense of place creating an initial visual impression and reflecting the character of the
community. Since its splendid setting is one of Yountville's principal assets, it is essential that all
future growth protect view corridors, establish new ones wherever possible, and maintain the
highest quality design at the primary gateways to the community.
C.2                                                               Existing Conditions
Existing town parks and open space within the town limits are identified in the map on the opposite
page. Town parks are publicly owned and maintained while other open space is generally privately
owned. In addition to its other civic and symbolic roles, the town cemetery provides a scenic vista
along the town’s northern limits. The vineyards and orchards, which remain within the town limits,
contribute a special quality to the rural character of the town. Unfortunately, it is these lands and
their unique qualities that are being lost as new development occurs, and therefore, it is critical to
preserve existing view corridors and open space within new developments.
MEASURE J AND TOWN LIMITS
The intent of “Measure J“ is to preserve the Napa Valley as a productive agricultural landscape. It
states that county land designated as agriculture, cannot be re-designated to another land use or
subdivided into less than 40 acres and allows only one house per parcel. General Plan amendments
dealing with open space cannot be made until the year 2020 without a yes vote of the people.
Measure J stipulates that new growth must be accommodated within the urban limit lines of
existing communities.
VIEW CORRIDORS
The numerous view corridors provide a strong sense of the surrounding landscape throughout most
of Yountville, especially in Old Town. Existing north-south view corridors include Washington,
Jefferson, and Yount Streets looking north; and east-west view corridors include Oak Circle, Creek
and Webber Streets looking west, and Finnell Road and Mulberry Street looking east. On Heritage
Way there is a 30 foot wide easement which extends the street right of way and functions as a view
corridor.
SOUTHERN ENTRY TO TOWN
For many years an important Yountville landmark has been the small vineyard operated by the
Vintage 1870 Partners at the southern end of their property next to the principal entrance to town
at California Drive and Washington Streets. This property along with the vacant property opposite
California Drive at Washington, provide an opportunity to create a primary gateway that is
reflective of the overall character of the Town. The General Plan must anticipate the future
development of the entire Vintage 1870 property. The General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and Design
Ordinance must balance the needs and rights of the property owners with the importance of this
gateway area to the character of the town. Accordingly, the Land Use, Open Space and Town
Structure maps classify a portion of the Vintage 1870 land now occupied by vineyard as
Agricultural, and the Land Use map designates the Washington-California intersection as a
primary gateway entry. The Zoning Ordinance and Design Ordinance, however, make provision
Fourth Printing                                   21
March 2000

for publicly acceptable commercial uses on the balance of the Vintage 1870 land which would be
compatible with this portion of the property's role as Agricultural. Use of this land, and the
adjacent vacant land at the Washington-California Drive intersection, should be judiciously
controlled to ensure a gateway of high aesthetic quality and reflective of the Town's character.
PARKS AND PLAYFIELDS
Two of town's public parks are located adjacent to the major entrances to town. To the north, at the
intersection of Madison Street and Washington Street, lies Yountville Park; and at the southern
entrance, Veterans Memorial Park. A third public park, called Vineyard Park, lies along the
eastern boundary of the Vintage subdivision and adjacent to vineyards just outside of town limits.
Within this park are tennis courts and picnic grounds. Smaller parks within newer subdivisions
include: Heritage Estates Park, Toyon Terrace Tot Lot, Washington Street Park, and Hopper Creek
Park adjacent to the Vintage. Behind the school and east of the Hopper Creek pedestrian and bike
path, there are large playfields.
HOPPER CREEK
Hopper Creek is the primary natural watercourse that traverses the entire town. In addition to
providing storm drainage, it serves as open space and in a few places, as a park. It also contains a
pedestrian and bike path. The pedestrian and bike paths currently in place within the town are not
part of the California Recreational Trails system. Policies related to its continued preservation are
outlined in Chapter IV, Conservation.
AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Several land parcels within the town limits are currently used for agricultural purposes. The
portions of the parcels in viticulture uses are as follows: Pelissa property, 30 acres; Bardessono
property, five acres; Vintage Partners property, six acres; Catholic Church property, 10 acres; and
the Forrester property, 13 acres. There is also a three-acre parcel, the Lande property, which is
currently used as a prune orchard. In addition, the Veterans Home of California has 30 acres of its
land utilized for the production of hay; however, the Town of Yountville has no land use control
over this land as long as it remains used for State purposes.

REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS
The following areas within un-built parcels should be reviewed to determine whether the proposed
design adequately fulfills the intent as stated by the objectives and policies in Section C.3.
1      Proposed Open Space as Neighborhood Parks
       The Open Space Parks Identification Map indicates areas within two parcels, APN 36-040-
       12 & 14 (Forrester) and APN 36-090-02 (Catholic Church), for the creation of open space
       to serve as new neighborhood parks. Dispersed throughout the new development, these
       areas are intended to serve surrounding residents and must be built concurrently with the
       adjacent housing.
2      Proposed Open Space
       The Open Space Parks Identification Map indicates areas within one parcel, APN 36-330-
       07 (Vintage Partners), for Agricultural. The open space shown on the Vintage Partners
       parcel as a single large area preserves the rural character at one of major entrances to town.
3      Proposed and Existing View Corridors
       Open Space Policy 2.2 outlines specific locations that must provide view corridors in their
       future developments. Chapter I of the Design Ordinance addresses existing and proposed
       view corridors. One example of an existing view corridor is that of Heritage Way, wherein
       an easement has been established on two parcels as a view corridor into the vineyards and
       mountains to the east. Similar provisions must be included in the conditions of approval for
       all future development.

4      Hopper Creek
       Open Space Policy 5.1 provides for the maintenance of Hopper Creek as a natural resource
       and feature of the town. In the future development of parcels bordering on Hopper Creek,
       the natural quality of the creek must be preserved. In addition, parcels bordering on Hopper
       Creek must address in their future development the terms and conditions of the Hopper
       Creek Pedestrian/Bike Plan.

Typically, the land use element is the heart of a General Plan. This General Plan, however, is based
upon the observation that typical land use designations have not provided the town with adequate
tools to retain, extend, or reinforce Yountville’s historic town structure. Therefore, this section on
land use is intended to supplement the Town Structure established by the Circulation and Open
Space/Parks portions of the Plan. In Section B.3.a, Circulation, new streets are located within the
remaining parcels to create new parcels similar in size and scale to blocks in Old Town. The
proposed street network shown in the Town Map will encourage incremental development and
easily accommodate a mix of residential uses and building types. The land use designations
outlined below have been designed to address the civic design issues, and economic and housing
needs that face the Town and its citizens. The issues, objectives, and policies related to land use
follow the definitions of the land use designations.
D.1                                     Integrated Uses and Building Types
The distribution of land uses and building types in a traditional town, such as Yountville, is more
intricate than the classifications of typical land use or zoning maps. Such maps usually segregate
residential, commercial and institutional uses into separate zones, and often fail to distinguish
among the varied activities that are classified as “commercial.” Segregated land use zones are
directly related to automobile-dependent suburban patterns in which all activities are linked by car
trips. To preserve (and in some places to restore) the intimate, pedestrian character of Yountville,
it is desirable to permit patterns of use that are not as simple and diagrammatic as those on a
typical zoning map. For example, it is necessary to distinguish between large commercial buildings
that distribute goods and services in large volume to both residents and visitors, and smaller
buildings that are the same size as houses and primarily serve a local market. Buildings that are
work places, or which house both work and dwelling but generate little traffic or parking, are
another category. It is important that land use classification protect residents from noxious or
inappropriate uses without needlessly restricting private endeavors that contribute to the richness
and interest of the town.
D.2                                                                 Existing Conditions
Yountville is a small, primarily residential town in a rural setting. Commercial development
accounts for only a small percentage of the land area. Until recently, residential development has
been rural in character and perceived density. However, the average density in single-family
neighborhoods in Yountville is greater than single-family planned unit developments in many
suburbs.
In the last 15 years, residential development that has occurred mostly east of Yount Street has been
very different in character and pattern from Old Town. These new developments include Vista
Condominiums, Crossroads Condominiums, Hopper Creek Village, and Heritage Estates.

March 2000

The many different types of buildings in Yountville make the town’s neighborhoods distinctive in
character. Some neighborhoods blend with adjoining parts of the town; and others remain
deliberately separate. The residential building types include single-family homes, townhouses,
duplexes, triplexes, four-plexes, apartments, mobile homes, condominiums, and congregate care
facilities. At the perimeter are residential-scaled commercial buildings, small inns, and a few home
occupations. Larger commercial buildings and larger inns front Washington Street.
Old Town is a 13-block neighborhood with large trees, a mix of building types, and houses of
various style and design. Toyon Terrace and Heritage Estates are more like typical contemporary
suburban developments. The Vintage limits access and offers a mix of house types clustered
together in order to maximize open space. The houses in Toyon Terrace are of consistent character
and on lots similar in size and shape. Heritage Estates subdivision was recently built with large
homes on large lots. The Vista Condominiums and Hopper Creek Village are based on design
themes and are similar to development in the Bay Area where developable land is limited and
construction costs are relatively high. The mobile home parks are exclusively for older citizens,
and somewhat isolated. The congregate care residential facilities located at the Seventh Day
Adventist complex off Finnell Road and at the Veterans Home of California provide a special kind
of residential use.
Yountville's commercial uses are located principally along Washington Street. Vintage 1870,
located at the center of town, and Washington Square, located at the north end of town, provide a
combination of local-serving and visitor commercial businesses. With the exception of the inns,
Old Town is mostly a residential neighborhood with a few locally oriented commercial uses.
A variety of restaurants and specialized retail outlets thrive along Washington Street. The
occupancy of overnight lodging facilities indicates that Yountville's visitor industry is healthy.
Market studies submitted as a part of the review of the Washington Square show that, although
there is a demand for local service goods, the needs of residents supports only a few small local-
serving businesses.
Recent economic and market studies indicate a continuing demand for inn rooms and recommend
the following actions:
     1) Maintain some degree of balance of inn and retail uses in the Town’s remaining
           commercial development, preserving opportunities for additional retail uses, and
     2) Retail uses should be concentrated within and around the existing central business core
           that is focused along Washington Street, generally between Humboldt Street and
           California Drive.
Located near the center of town are the Town Hall, Yountville School, Community Hall, and new
Post Office that are discussed in Section E, Existing Civic and Community Facilities. More than 40
percent of the town's residents live in the Veterans Home of California located west of Highway
29, within walking distance of the town center. Existing open space and parks are discussed in
Section C.2.
Almost all of Yountville’s undeveloped land west of Highway 29 is owned by the State. The
majority of Yountville's undeveloped land east of Highway 29 is located east of Yount Street and
is zoned for residential development.
D.3                                   Definition of Land Use Designations
Listed below are land use designations for residential, commercial, open space/parks, agricultural,
and civic and community facilities. A description of each designation includes the basis for its
location within town. The Land Use Map, see Figure II.1, shows the location of proposed land uses
for the entire town.

Part of Yountville's character derives from the fact that commercial, residential, and civic uses are
not neatly segregated as on a typical land use map. To preserve this intimate mix of things, specific
existing commercial uses throughout town are designated as Retained Uses with site-specific
prescriptions. It is intended that these sites will not simply be converted to the surrounding
prevailing use in the future, thereby making areas more homogeneous and the town less interesting.
Conversely, care must be taken not to regulate these parcels and their uses so permissively that
visitor-oriented businesses displace local-oriented ones. Most Retained Uses are commercial
enterprises within predominantly residential areas.
Retained Uses
This as an overlay is intended to protect existing businesses that are an important part of
Yountville, and ensure that they or similar businesses will contribute to the mixed-use, pedestrian
character of the town in the future. New or modified uses on properties designated for Retained
Uses overlay must remain similar in scale and impact to existing establishments on that property.
Detailed criteria appear in Section 5.5 of the Zoning Ordinance, and Chapter III of the Design
Ordinance.
D.3.b                                                                            Residential
The General Plan identifies several residential land use designations. These designations are
intended to specify different types and mixes of housing rather than a continuum of housing
densities. Some residential land use designations such as Single-family Residential and Mobile
Home Park Residential are intended for one type of housing, while others such as Mixed
Residential and Old Town Historic allow single family and multiple family housing. The Master
Planned Residential and Mobile Home Park Residential designations are intended to maintain
these Master Development Plan neighborhoods with their adopted housing mix and density.
Fourth Printing                                  31
March 2000
The allowed densities for areas not already master planned are based on a variety of criteria in
addition to, or in place of, common measure of units per gross acre. The term "gross acre" means
all of the land within the property lines of a parcel. Single-family housing densities within the
Single-family Residential and Old Town Historic designations are restricted to a maximum density
per gross acre. The Mixed Residential designation has a maximum allowed total gross density, but
specific overall densities and build out ranges are identified for each property within this
designation as shown in Table III.20. The maximum number of units permitted for a property does
not constitute an entitlement or a guarantee. Development of multiple-family housing is not
restricted by gross density on an infill parcel or a parcel within a Master Development Plan, but
rather by design restrictions such as minimum and maximum lot sizes, setbacks, height, and FAR;
and any applicable affordable housing density bonuses.
The provisions of the Design Ordinance will impart to all new residential development the scale,
street orientation and, where possible, the diversity of buildings found in Old Town. Continued
effort will be made to encourage reuse of older buildings for residences.
Single-family Residential (up to 7 units per gross acre)
This is an existing residential designation that covers a large portion of the town. It will continue to
regulate those areas where additions to existing houses and second units occur. House size is
regulated by building type, height, setbacks, and floor area ratio, FAR. Specific ratios are listed in
the Design Ordinance, Chapter II., Section C.
Mixed Residential This land use designation is intended to provide a variety of housing types and
sizes integrated with affordable housing on the remaining un-built parcels. Although the
predominant building types will be single-family houses and duplexes, some smaller multiple-
family homes are encouraged, and should be interspersed with new development. Where possible,
new housing should consist of both rental and ownership units. Figure III.20, Available Land for
Residential Use, indicates the range of dwelling units for un-built parcels within the land use
designation RM, Mixed Residential. Actual numbers of dwelling units are to be determined
through the preparation and adoption of Master Development plans as per section 7.4 of the
Zoning Ordinance. The lower figure is the minimum number of units that each parcel shall
provide. The higher figure is the maximum potential number of dwelling units permitted for any
development, and is dependent on the fulfillment of affordable housing requirements as established
in Section 6.1 of the Zoning Ordinance, environmental constraints, and town design issues.
With the application of a Use Permit, this designation of use is allowed on properties in Old Town
where the overlay Retained Uses applies. There are properties within Old Town upon which multi-
family development currently exists. These properties and others similar in size should be
encouraged to provide a mix of housing types compatible with the character of Old Town. It is the
intention of this plan to maintain existing small lots and housing stock, and therefore, the
aggregation of existing small lots into fewer, larger parcels is not permitted.
Old Town Historic (up to 8 units per gross acre for single family homes)
It is intended that the area known as Old Town remain predominantly single-family detached
houses on relatively small lots. Infill multiple family housing is allowed at densities that meet all
design criteria in the Design Ordinance. New residential development is encouraged to have
architectural design that reflects the historic building character of Old Town. It is Yountville's
intent to maintain the older buildings in Old Town through rehabilitation. Second units, in
accordance with Section 4.5 of the Zoning Ordinance, are permitted throughout Old Town.
Limited commercial uses that are locally oriented are allowed in Old Town as Retained Uses. Uses
that are not sympathetic to the rural character of Old Town are not allowed.

March 2000
Mobile Home Park Residential (up to 10 units per gross acre)
The intent of the Mobile Home Park designation is to maintain the mobile homes that exist within
Yountville. These factory-built homes are the only form of residential development allowed in
these areas. The purpose of this restriction is to provide an area where large numbers of lower cost
housing units can be accommodated. As of 1992, there are 317 mobile homes within two mobile
home parks. Densities allowed are those that were approved with the original project. No new
areas of land are designated for mobile home parks.
Master Planned Residential
The Master Planned Residential land use designation is intended to preserve the character of
master planned residential developments and neighborhoods that are existing or under construction
at the time of adoption of this General Plan. The types and densities of housing allowed in this land
use designation are only those originally approved in the master development plans for these
residential developments and neighborhoods. Some Master Planned Residential areas contain only
single-family homes, while others contain multiple-family homes or a mix of both housing types.
D.3.c                                                                            Commercial
The Town Council and the citizens of Yountville recognize the strong contribution made by
existing shops, restaurants, inns, and businesses; however, there is concern that the building of new
commercial development will change much of the town into a visitor-oriented commercial strip. In
response to pressures for accommodating additional commercial uses which serve the increasing
number of visitors, the General Plan establishes areas where additional visitor-oriented commercial
uses are permitted, and areas where resident-serving commercial businesses will be encouraged.
Commercial areas fronting onto Washington Street will reinforce it as a traditional main street. To
avoid the potentially negative qualities of a commercial strip at the center of town, it is essential
that new commercial development be street and pedestrian-oriented, not inward focusing, and that
visitor-oriented business also provide some benefit to town residents.
Yountville has several distinctive qualities that help to define the nature and location of
commercial development. These qualities, which are mentioned in different contexts at several
points in this document, are as follows:
1    Commercial uses in Yountville are not strictly segregated from residential neighborhoods.
     Integrated land use is the historic pattern of the town and should be perpetuated in ways that
     do not threaten existing housing or neighborhoods.
2    Yountville is a main street town and Washington Street is the main street. New commercial
     development can help reinforce Washington Street as the heart of town and can prevent
     Yountville from becoming diffuse and center-less.
3    Washington Street has the unusual characteristic of being flanked on its west side by Highway
     29, a major regional freeway, and on its east by residential neighborhoods. The existing
     pattern in which larger commercial buildings are on the west side of Washington Street and
     small, residential-scaled commercial buildings are on the east side of the street, should be
     perpetuated and reinforced by future buildings. Large concentrations of parking on the east
     side of Washington Street could be highly disruptive to the fabric of the town. Street-oriented
     commercial buildings on the west side of Washington Street, however, create opportunities for
     well concealed but convenient parking lots between the highway corridor and the backs of
     Washington Street commercial buildings.
This Plan establishes two commercial land-use classifications and the two overlay designations that
respond to the conditions described above. Each classification has its own permitted uses and its
own design criteria. Permitted uses and criteria for alteration or expansion of existing uses are
outlined in the Zoning Ordinance. All commercial development in Yountville must obtain a Use
Permit from the Town Council. The Use Permit process is specifically intended to prevent further
Fourth Printing                                    33
March 2000
development of visitor-oriented businesses which have negligible benefit to residents, rely upon
day visitors, and sell merchandise that is generic in nature, or shops which specialize in schlock,
impulse-purchase items. The intent is to encourage local ownership of commercial uses, and the
creation of a distinctive local character, even for visitor-oriented business. New restaurants will be
restricted to certain areas and are defined in Section 4.8 the Zoning Ordinance. The two
commercial land-use designations are summarized below. General conditions and regulations are
established in Sections of the Zoning Ordinance, and more detailed design standards are outlined
in Chapter II of the Design Ordinance.
Primary Commercial
This is the most permissive commercial designation and applies only to the west side of
Washington Street. Under this land use designation visitor-oriented businesses, inns, new
restaurants as defined by the Zoning Ordinance, professional offices and other businesses which
provide goods and services for the recurring needs of the town's residents and the surrounding area
are permitted. Buildings that accommodate various combinations of working and dwelling are
permitted, such as housing above commercial, commercial adjacent to housing on the same parcel
and live/work buildings in which the workspace exceeds 25 percent. Primary commercial buildings
are not required to be residential in scale.
Parking requirements are relatively high for this type of commercial because of a high proportion
of visitor clientele. The principal orientation and entry location for most tenants should be on
Washington Street. There should be minimal gaps in street frontage for parking and parking
access, with buildings, walls and landscape elements used to screen parking areas from
Washington Street. Trees also should be planted to screen parking areas from Highway 29.
Old Town Commercial
This designation is applied to specified properties that front along Washington Street. It is intended
to reflect Yountville’s commercial beginnings and in so doing create a commercial district separate
and distinct from those of the Primary and Residential-Scaled Commercial Districts. To promote
the preservation of the historic character of this part of Old Town, maintenance, and rehabilitation
of those existing structures that embody this character are encouraged. (Resolution Numbers 1787-
00 and 1844-01)
Uses in the District are intended to serve both residents and visitors alike with the scale of
businesses and structures small and reflective of Yountville’s early development in the period from
1870 to 1920.
Commercial businesses, including retail, office and small restaurant uses, are allowed as well as
mixed commercial/residential uses such as housing above commercial, commercial adjacent to
housing on the same parcel, and live/work buildings. In addition to these uses, overnight
accommodations and restaurants with more than 75 seats shall be permitted on the west side of
Washington Street for property within this classification. No industrial uses shall be permitted.
It is also the intent of this classification to promote an interesting, attractive environment for
pedestrians, and enhance the interface between commercial uses and the street.
1.   That Assessor Parcels 036-033-001, -013, -014, and –015 are hereby reclassified to the Old
     Town Commercial land use designation (Resolution Number 1787-00)
2.   That Assessor Parcels 036-032-006, -007, -008, and –009 and 036-440-001 are hereby
     reclassified to the amended Old Town Commercial land use designation. (Resolution Number
     1844-01)
Residential-scaled Commercial
This designation is used where the Washington Street commercial area abuts residential
neighborhoods. It is intended to blend Washington Street commercial areas into the residential
fabric of the town, and ensure that it is not set apart as a separate tourist district. New restaurants
Fourth Printing                                    34
March 2000

and other businesses that rely principally on visitors for their clientele are not permitted. All
buildings must be residential in scale according to criteria established in Chapter II of the Design
Ordinance.
D.3.d                                                                  Open Space/Parks
This land use designation includes existing and planned park and recreation facilities, bikeways,
pedestrian paths, and other open spaces that preserve the town's rural character. There are two
subcategorize within this designation; 1) open space which includes existing agricultural use, view
corridors, Hopper Creek and the cemetery; and 2) parks-playfields which include Town parks,
neighborhood parks and school playfields. These are discussed in detail in Section C, Open
Space/Parks of this document.
D.3.e                                          Civic and Community Facilities
This land use designation consists of all public and semi-public uses including existing public
buildings, institutions, and schools. These buildings and uses include the Veterans Home of
California, Town Hall, Yountville School, Cemetery, Wastewater Treatment Plant, and town
corporation yard, Community Hall, U.S. Post Office, Vintage Partners Laundry, the 0.4- acre
parcel adjacent to California Drive, and the railroad right-of-way.
D.3.f                                                                            Agriculture
This existing land use designation for agricultural uses remains unchanged, and will continue to
regulate existing agricultural lands where alterations and additions may occur. Preservation of the
surrounding agricultural land is mandated by “Measure J” and serves to preserve the rural
character of the town.
D.4 Land Use                                          Issues, Objectives, Policies
This section addresses issues facing the town regarding its overall identity and character, and
specific issues related to residential densities and the intensity of commercial development.
Additional issues, objectives, and policies are outlined in Chapter III, for housing, and in Section
C.3 of this chapter, for open space and parks.
D.4.a                              Issue: Identity and Character of Town
Objective
     1 Enhance local identity and sense of community.
Policies
1.1 Consider the needs of the town as a whole of greater importance than the needs of individual
     developments.
1.2 Promote new developments that are designed to serve the needs of all income levels and the
     residents of the town.
1.3 Foster the protection and preservation of the surrounding agricultural uses.
1.4 Designate the primary gateway to Town to require special design review to ensure the highest
     aesthetic quality of development is achieved here.
1.5 Maintain a viable and attractive central Washington Street business area that reinforces the
     aesthetic character and activity focus of the community.
Objective
2      Preserve the rural, small town character, scale, and pace of life in Yountville and the town’s
       connection to the natural beauty of its setting.
Fourth Printing                                    35
March 2000

       Policies
2.1    Require that new development, including rehabilitation and expansion of existing buildings,
       be of a scale, intensity, and design that integrates with both the immediate neighborhood
       and the town as a whole.
2.2    Encourage a variety of building heights and sizes in new development.
2.3    Provide setbacks along streets, pedestrian and bike paths, and open space frontages for
       proposed new development and expansion of existing developments.
2.4    Permit two-story buildings that do not have a large mass, do not obstruct view corridors,
       and are compatible with adjacent structures. As detailed in the Design Ordinance, single-
       story elements along street frontages for commercial and residential developments are
       preferable in most situations.
2.5    Encourage multiple, smaller buildings that combine to form courtyard-like spaces.
2.6    Require new developments to maintain some of the natural, historic, and cultural
       characteristics of their respective sites.
2.7    Create Town policies, land use designations and design standards that reinforce the “Y” as
       the town’s center.
       Objective
3      Preserve the character, scale, and atmosphere of Old Town. (The following policies are in
       addition to those stated above in #2).
       Policies
3.1    Ensure compatibility of character and scale of all new construction in Old Town through
       design review.
3.2    Limit the amount, scale, and impact of commercial development in Old Town.
3.3    Do not allow the conversion of existing residential structures or portions thereof in Old
       Town for commercial uses.
3.4    Require new or existing commercial uses that are allowed in Old Town be: 1)
       accommodated in existing commercial properties, and 2) compatible with the residential
       character of the area.
3.5    Institutional and quasi-public uses such as the Pac Bell communications building at Adams
       and Yount Streets are not considered commercial uses in Old Town. However, such uses
       are non-conforming and the property shall revert to residential use if said non-conforming
       uses are abandoned or terminated.
    Objective
    4 Manage future growth to ensure an orderly development of the town, preservation of
    natural and cultural resources, extension of services and protection of the rural setting.
    Policies
    4.1 Limit future growth, through the year 2020, to the town's current limits and the number of
          housing units permitted in this General Plan.
    4.2 Allow future growth based on the ability of the Town to provide necessary public
          services, protect the natural and physical constraints associated with development of a
          given site, balance the costs and revenues associated with new development, and mitigate
          the effects on traffic circulation.
    4.3 Require that development proposals of a magnitude and size that, if developed
          immediately, would drastically change the scale and character of the town be phased to
          allow new development to be assimilated into the town fabric with minimal disruption.
    4.4 Ensure that the timing of new development will not create intolerable traffic conditions.
          Require new developments that have an extensive impact on the existing street network to
          be phased over a realistic time-period. The costs of street improvements should be shared
          by the developments that create a need for them.
Fourth Printing                                   36

    4.5 Consider preparing an incremental growth management plan by January 1994.
    4.6 Preserve opportunities for retail development along central Washington St. to maximize
          the concentration of retail activity within the business core area.
       Objective
5      Maintain, improve, and expand the town's urban infrastructure in a manner which is
       consistent with the land use and other elements of the General Plan.
       Policies
5.1    Continue to require the under-grounding of all utilities in new developments, and initiate a
       program for under-grounding for the rest of the town.
5.2    Maintain an adequate water supply and water service system to accommodate existing and
       new development.
5.3    Continue to pursue rehabilitation programs to reduce the amount of infiltration into the
       sewer system. Alternatively, the Town can increase its sewage pumping and treatment
       capacity to handle wet weather flows.
5.4    Except where there is a specific need for sidewalks or gutters, continue to encourage street
       designs that are rural in nature, provided such an approach will not result in local drainage,
       erosion or sedimentation problems. “Rural in nature” means narrow streets with gravel
       shoulders and street trees but no concrete gutter or sidewalk.
       Objective
6      Establish standards in the Design Ordinance consistent with maintaining and enhancing the
       identity and character of the town.
       Policies
6.1    Limit the scale and mass of development by establishing floor area ratios in commercial and
       residential land use designations.
6.2    Establish architectural design standards and design review for all new and modified
       commercial and residential buildings.
6.3    Special design criteria shall apply to the primary gateway to Town. These criteria shall
       provide that development at the gateway shall be residential in scale and reflect the aesthetic
       and historical character of the Town.
D.4.b                                                     Issue: Residential Density
       Objective
7      Establish residential densities for development on vacant and other available parcels to be
       compatible with the town character.
       Policies
7.1    Establish residential densities at a level that promotes multi-family buildings that are
       integrated and visually compatible with single-family houses.
7.2    Development of moderate density is most appropriate along Washington Street and on sites
       facing or abutting commercial development.
7.3    Allow densities at the high end of the range where environmental constraints are few, and
       the development meets the objectives of the General Plan.
7.4    Allow single-family detached houses on smaller individual lots. Encourage duplexes and
       triplexes that look similar to single-family houses.
7.5    Encourage the sale of lots within large developable parcels to individuals.

D.4.c Issue: Intensity of Commercial Development
          Objective
8   It is important to promote the character and design of the Washington Street commercial area
    in a manner that integrates it into the immediate neighborhood and the town as a whole.
    Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that new commercial development reinforces Washington
    Street's role as a pedestrian-oriented main street and does not allow it to be transformed into
    either an auto-oriented commercial strip or a series of inwardly focused malls.
    Policies
8.1 Require most new commercial establishments on Washington Street to face the street and have
    street oriented pedestrian entrances.
8.2 Limit the amount of Washington Street frontage that can be used for parking or parking
    access.
8.3 Screen parking where possible with buildings, walls, and/or landscape elements.
8.4 Continue to enforce strict signage policies that do not permit large or internally illuminated
    signs.
8.5 Prohibit raising the natural grade on the west side of Washington Street in excess of that
    necessary for adequate drainage.
8.6 Enhance pedestrian activity and linkages along central Washington St. by requiring that the
    majority of new land uses within this area be street frontage oriented retail.
    Objective
9   Ensure that new commercial development respects and reinforces adjacent existing
    development on the east and west sides of Washington Street.
          Policies
9.1 Require that all commercial structures on the east side of Washington Street be residential in
    scale.
9.2 Do not permit new restaurants or establishments that rely principally on visitors for their
    clientele on the east side of Washington Street.
9.3 Do not permit large aggregations of parking on the east side of Washington Street.
9.4 Allow a greater intensity of commercial development on the west side of Washington Street
       and a lesser intensity on the east side.
       Objective
10     Retain the existing balance of residences and small commercial establishments in Old
       Town.
       Policies
10.1 Re-designate existing non-conforming uses as Retained Uses.
10.2 Do not allow any residential property in Old Town to be redesignated for commercial use.

D.4.d                            Issue:        Civic and Community Facilities
       Objective
11     Continue to maintain and improve all public facilities and services for residents.
          Policies
11.1 Continue to support facilities operated by public agencies: Yountville Elementary School,
       the Fire Station, the U.S. Post Office, the Veterans Home of California.
11.2 Continue to support joint-use facilities: Clinic Ole and the Library.
D.4.e                                                               Issue:        Agriculture
       Objective
12     Continue to support the agricultural uses adjacent to town and in the Napa Valley.
       Policies
12.1 Discourage annexation of agricultural lands to the town through the year 2020.
12.2 Discourage the re-designation of agricultural land within the town limits.
D.5                                                                         Implementation
STATE REQUIREMENTS
The California Government Code, Section 65860, requires that a “city Zoning Ordinance shall be
consistent with the General Plan of the city. A Zoning Ordinance shall be consistent with a city
General Plan only if: (1) the city has officially adopted such a plan; and (2) the various land uses
authorized by the ordinance are compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and
programs specified in such a plan.” Tentative and final subdivision maps must be in agreement
with applicable Specific and General Plans. Uses must be consistent with all elements of the
General Plan and not just the land use element and map. For there to be a finding of consistency,
the plan must be complete. In addition, the plan must be “an integrated, internally consistent and
compatible statement of policies” for the adopting agency. Consistency is measured by three
parameters: use, boundaries, and time.
1    The Zoning Ordinance is considered consistent with the General Plan when the allowable uses
     and standards contained in the text of the Zoning Ordinance tend to further the policies in the
     General Plan and do not inhibit or obstruct the attainment of the articulated policies.
2    The boundaries of land use areas on the land use map are intended to be specific. Uses not
     specifically shown on the map shall be consistent with the written objectives and policies of
     the plan.
3    A use may not necessarily be permitted prematurely in an area reserved for future
     development even if it is consistent with the land use map. This is consistent with the Town's
     objective to manage growth and provide for phasing of development.
REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS
Section D.6, the summary of Land Use Changes, outlines changes in land use designation since the
1985 General Plan. Section D.6 also indicates new classifications of specific parcels. All future
development must adhere to these designations of land use.
POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES IN LAND USE
1 At the center of town there is a triangular shaped block defined by Yount, Washington and
   Humboldt Streets; the southern portion of this block is presently occupied by a gas station, a
   restaurant, and shops. In the event the current use ceases to operate, this parcel should be
   rezoned to provide a use more fitting to its location at the heart of Yountville. It is
   recommended that the use be civic in nature, such as open space or a community facility, and
   serve as a landmark for the town.

D.6                                              Summary of Land Use Changes
In general, land use designations were made specific to the remaining un-built parcels but are
unchanged in kind. For example, most land previously zoned for residential uses remains
designated as residential, but may have different permitted building types and total number of
units. The Land Use Map, Figure II.6 on page 24, identifies the proposed uses. The following list
summarizes changes for remaining un-built parcels shown on Figure I.3, in Chapter I.
1 Eight properties previously zoned for low, medium, or high density residential are designated
     as mixed residential. The potential number of units and related density for each parcel is listed
     in Figure III.20 of Chapter III, Housing. They include:
     a APN 36-090-22&23 (Bardessono), except commercial portion listed in #2 below,
     b APN 36-090-02             (Catholic Church),
     c APN 36-090-01             (Filippi),
     d APN 36-040-13             (Lande),
     e APN 36-040-10             (Mayeri),
     f APN 36-040-12&14 (Forrester),
     g APN 36-040-11             (Knight), and
     h PAPN 36-090-05            (Rabe).
2    A portion of the Bardessono property, APN 36-090-22 & 23, adjacent to Community Hall is
     designated as residential-scaled commercial. Specific design standards for residential-scaled
     commercial specific to this property are outlined in the Design Ordinance.
3    A portion of the Filippi property, APN 36-090-01, fronting on Washington Street was
     discussed as having potential as residential-scaled commercial. Upon the request of the owner,
     the Town Council may consider a change in use that reinforces Washington Street as the
     town's main commercial street, and otherwise meets the Town's objectives.
4    Properties previously zoned as commercial have been reviewed and designated as one of the
     new commercial designations and are as follows:
     a APN 36-081-10             (Byrnes)                      Primary Commercial
     b APN 36-081-08             (Carbone)                     Primary Commercial
     c APN 36-361-01             (Patton)                      Residential-scaled Commercial
     d APN 36-082-08,-09         (Altamura)                    Residential-scaled Commercial
5    The following existing businesses will be defined as "Retained Uses" and their use, expansion
     and regulation is addressed in the Zoning Ordinance:
     a APN 36-033-01             Yountville Market
     b APN 36-033-15             Pancha's Bar
     c APN 36-033-14             McGrath's Garage
     d APN 36-090-05             Napa Valley Express
     e APN 36-090-05             Debbie's Beauty Salon
     f APN 36-040-11             Knight Lumber
     g APN 36-053-04             Webber Place
     h APN 36-051-03             Bordeaux House
     i APN 36-051-05             French Laundry
     j APN 36-061-15             Former Post Office
     k APN 36-440-01             Burgundy House
6        Existing businesses currently designated as commercial and located on the west side of
Washington Street are to be rezoned as "Primary Commercial," and existing businesses currently
designated as commercial and located on the east side of Washington Street are to be rezoned as
"Residential-scaled Commercial".

7    The Vintage Partners property, APN 36-330-07, previously zoned for high-density residential
     is designated as Primary Commercial with a portion to the south zoned as Agricultural.
     Permitted uses within the Agricultural will be limited to those uses which are civic in nature,
     and are outlined in the Zoning Ordinance.
8.   The Altamura Property, APN 36-090-26, previuosly zoned for mixed residential is
     designated as Residential Scaled Commercial.
E.              EXISTING CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Described below are existing civic and community facilities currently servicing town residents. At
this time, the town has adequate civic and community facilities and no plans for new ones.

The Town Hall and Library share a building located at the corner of Yount Street and Finnell
Road. To the south, adjacent to the Town Hall, a manufactured building houses the Community
Health Clinic Ole. The clinic leases ground from the Town. To the north, adjacent to the Town
Hall and linked by an open hallway, is Yountville Elementary School and a Day Care facility for
children. One block to the south on Yount Street and opposite the “Y” is the U.S. Post Office
completed in 1992. Adjacent to the post office is Community Hall that accommodates various
community services including aerobic classes, wedding receptions, and town meetings.

The Veterans Home of California is a combination of group living quarters and a medical facility
and is located at the town’s southwestern boundary on the west side of State Highway 29. The
multi-use complex includes recreation facilities that are shared with the Town.

The historic cemetery, which includes George Yount's burial place, defines the northwestern town
boundary and extends from Washington Street to Yount Street.

F.1                                                        Boundaries and Linkages
Although Yountville has only a few neighborhoods, it is important to the life and vitality of the
town that they remain distinct but linked to one another. The land use designations and their
permitted building types, outlined in the following section, have been created to enhance an
existing district or neighborhood with addition of adjacent new development. It is important that
each new development be permeable and open with many links to surrounding areas. The location
of available land for new development falls into two categories; that which serves as a link from
one neighborhood to another, and that which extends an existing neighborhood or street one block.

CHAPTER III.                                                                     HOUSING
A.        INTRODUCTION
A.1       Guidelines For Preparing Housing Elements
The California Government Code requires each city to develop and maintain a General Plan, and
each General Plan to contain a Housing Element that includes: (a) an identification and analysis of
existing and projected housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
meeting those needs; (b) a statement of goals, policies, and quantified objectives; and (c) a
discussion of scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
The Government Code also requires that each update of a Housing Element evaluate: (a) the
effectiveness of the previous Housing Element in attaining the community’s housing goals and
objectives; (b) the appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
meeting the State housing goal; and (c) the progress of the Town in implementing the Housing
Element. State law has been amended recently to require the analysis of special housing groups,
including the homeless. The law also requires localities to identify sites suitable for emergency
shelters and transitional housing.
State law requires that a General Plan and its elements “comprise an integrated, internally
consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The Housing Element must be consistent with
population projections and land use goals and policies set forth in the Land Use Element and
closely coordinated with the Circulation Element of the General Plan, both of which are found in
Chapter II, Town Structure.
This update of the Housing Element is part of a complete and concurrent revision of the entire
General Plan. In this process, the Town’s consultants and staff examined all parts of the Plan for
consistency with each other. Concurrently with the General Plan update, the Town is revising its
Zoning Ordinance and adopting a new Design Document. These two documents are being crafted
to carry out the policies of the General Plan and promote the Town’s affordable housing policies.
The intent of the Housing Element is to help accommodate the Town’s housing needs. At the same
time, Yountville intends to protect its small-town character and appearance, its sense of
community, and its natural and historic setting.

This chapter is an update of the Housing Element adopted by the Yountville Town Council in May
1985. New information on housing conditions, needs, programs, and constraints has been added
where possible.
The Yountville Town Council reviewed housing issues and the draft Housing Element revision at
over 20 workshops, meetings, and public hearings in 1991 and 1992, and a preliminary draft was
published in February 1992 but did not go to public hearing. A 20-member Citizens Task Force
was appointed in July 1992. Housing issues and proposed changes to policies were reviewed by
the Task Force at six meetings in July and August 1992.

B.        Review of the 1985 Housing Element
B.1                                                                    Accomplishments
The 1985 Housing Element set forth a number of housing objectives for the town, to be carried out
through associated policies and programs. Each of these objectives and policies is presented
below, along with an evaluation of what the policy or program has accomplished since 1985.
Objective 1 (1985). Maintain existing and develop new affordable housing units by:
•   Including a range of unit types and sizes, particularly smaller single-family units. —The town
    created an Apartment Opportunity Overlay District to encourage affordable multi-family
    housing. The apartment overlay was not successful—not one unit was built. More successful
    were Town policies aimed at smaller, single-family units, such as second units and FAR
    restrictions in the Historic District.
•   Providing rent assistance for resident workers. The Town’s objective was to start a Section 8
    program with four certificates and increase to 20 over a five-year period. —The Town
    developed a program with the County. Four Section 8 certificates are provided by the City of
    Napa Housing Authority for Yountville. There are 19 households on the waiting list.
•   Reducing development and financing costs. —The Town reduced fees for two low-income
    units at Burgundy Commons.
•   Encouraging self-help programs such as FmHA Section 523 Technical Assistance for Self-
    Help Housing. —The Town had previously participated in a project in 1983, which resulted
    in the construction of eight new single family homes for low-income families. The Town
    maintains a first right of refusal upon sale. Three of these units were purchased using the
    Housing Opportunity Fund and sold to low-income families.
•   Restricting condominium conversion if the percentage of renter units falls below 35 percent of
    the housing stock. —The proportion of renter households fell below the 35 percent target, so
    no condominium conversions were allowed.
•   Maintaining mobile home parks through the MHP zoning. —Through this action, Yountville
    assured the preservation of 317 existing mobile homes.
•   Permitting additional housing units through a second unit ordinance. —The Town has
    allowed the construction of 10 second units, while legalizing the status of eight existing units.
    These units rent for an average of $450 per month, affordable to very low-income households.
•   Creating a Housing Opportunity fund. —The Town’s inclusionary Zoning Ordinance re-
    quired developers to either provide affordable units or pay in-lieu fees. The fees are paid into
    the Housing Opportunity Fund, which the Town uses to support affordable housing. This
    fund now has a balance of $400,000.

Objective 2 (1985). Preserve affordable housing in areas that are redeveloped or rehabilitated by:
•   Regulating rents when rehabilitation is publicly financed. —No publicly financed reha-
    bilitation occurred, so this policy was not applicable.
•   Restricting conversion of residential units to other uses. —The Town prevents houses from
    being converted to commercial use, and the Town inaugurated a Bed and Breakfast Control
    Program to prevent residential dwellings from being converted to overnight lodging.
Objective 3 (1985). Provide a broad range of housing choices by:
•   Maintaining an owner/renter ratio of 65 percent/35 percent. —The proportion of occupied
    units that are renter-occupied has fallen from 35 percent in 1980 to 29 percent in 1990.
    (U.S. Census, 1990)
•   Encouraging affordable single-family detached houses. —Based on the 1990 census, the
    Vintage subdivision provided 29 single-family detached houses affordable to moderate
    income households. Separately, the Hopper Creek Village condominiums, and the Vintage
    townhouses provided 82 units of multi-family residential which were affordable to moderate-
    income households.
•   Retain residential mix in commercial development. —In 1983, the Town amended its
    commercial zoning district to require commercial development proposals to either retain
    existing residential units on the site, or provide like numbers of affordable units off-site, or
    pay an in-lieu fee if residential is removed. This has resulted in preservation of three
    residential units: two of these were preserved on site on the developer’s initiative, and the
    third was moved to a new location.
•   Seeking government and private funding for very low-, low- and moderate-income
    households. The Town’s Quantified Objectives were for the Federal Multifamily Rental
    Housing Programs 221(d)(3) and (d)(4) to produce 20 units. The Town’s goal for
    Homeownership Assistance for Low and Moderate Income Families (Section 235) was to
    produce eight units. —No federal funds were available for housing construction in Yountville
    between 1985 and 1990.
•   Requiring written agreements for continued affordability. —Two units created under the
    Town’s inclusionary Zoning Ordinance are required to maintain affordability until 2018.
    Agreements with subdividers also provided for continued affordability of six existing rental
    units.
[Objective 4 duplicated Objective 3]
Objective 5 (1985). Insure that below-market-rate units are located in a healthful environment and
    do not deteriorate quality of life in existing residential neighborhoods by:
•   Requiring that below-market-rate units harmonize with other residential structures, be
    dispersed throughout the development, and have a similar number of bedrooms to the rest of
    the development. —This was accomplished with the two units built under the inclusionary
    Zoning Ordinance.

Objective 6 (1985). Rehabilitate and maintain deteriorating housing stock by:
•   Working with the countywide housing authority to seek rehabilitation funds. The objective
    was to rehabilitate 20 units using funds from the CHFA Home Ownership and Home
    Improvement Loan Program. The Homeownership and Rehabilitation Loans Program (FmHA
    Section 502) was intended to rehabilitate 30 units. The FmHA Section 504 Home Repair
    Loans and Grants Program was intended to provide 40 units. —No federal funds were
    available to the town from these programs.
•   Encouraging owners to rehabilitate. —The Town notified property owners of the availability
    of funds for rehabilitation of lower-income housing, but none responded. An estimated five
    single-family units were rehabilitated by private owners.
•   Adjusting building permit fees which discourage rehabilitation. —Building permit fees are
    under the control of the County; the Town is unable to affect this.
•   Allowing repairs to historic buildings without conformance to all code requirements. —No
    applications were filed for this exemption.
Objective 7 (1985). Encourage energy efficiency by:
•   Requiring energy conservation in the design and modification of housing.             —All new
    construction is governed by State law requiring energy efficiency.
•   Requiring energy-efficient site planning. —Of three new developments with 150 units
    between 1985 and 1990, one development of 38 units incorporated solar energy efficiency
    measures in the site planning.
Objective 8 (1985). Provide housing for farmworkers by:
•   Working within the Napa Valley Housing Authority to further develop a farmworker housing
    program. —The Farm Bureau funded a study of farmworker housing needs conducted by the
    Rural California Housing Corporation which will serve as the basis for future planning. The
    Town assisted in financing 40 temporary beds for farmworkers.
•   Encouraging on-site farmworker housing. —The Town has used its position on the Napa
    Valley Housing Authority to encourage on-site farmworker housing.
•   Providing a fair share of farmworker housing. —Yountville in 1990 housed 1.2 percent of the
    farmworker population in the county, compared to 1.7 percent of the county’s total household
    population.
Objective 9 (1985). Meet the housing needs of elderly, single parents, handicapped, minorities,
    and homeless by:
•   Encouraging fair housing practices. —The Town Administrator has facilitated the resolution
    of all types of housing complaints, by referring complainants to the appropriate County
    agencies.
•   Supporting the Veterans Home of California. —The Town has supported the Veterans Home
    by funding a transit system which is used primarily by the residents of the Veterans Home; the
    Town operates the swimming pool at the Home; and the Town has contributed financially to a
    museum and special events at the Home.
Fourth Printing                                  46

•    Protecting the MHP zoning district. —This zoning was maintained, preserving 317 mobile
     home units.
•    Working with other groups to provide temporary shelter for the homeless. —The Town
     contributed several thousand dollars to the Napa County Commission on Economic
     Opportunity to support its temporary shelter program.
Objective 10 (1985). Provide for the needs of existing very low-, low-, and moderate-income
     households while encouraging other communities to do more. —The Town maintains a
     program to buy back units at Oak Leaf Court to preserve affordability.
Objective 11 (1985). Develop available land in a well-planned and timely manner by:
•    Not approving housing developments at the expense of the environment. —This policy was
     vague and provided little guidance for new developments.
•    Not building affordable units in the floodplain.       —No construction took place in the
     floodplain.

B.2                           Areas Where Further Progress is Needed
Some of the objectives and policies contained in the 1985 Housing Element were based on
resources which did not become readily available to the Town. A town of only 3,000 has limited
resources, both in money and in staff time, for undertaking housing programs. Hopes for achieving
some goals relied on federal programs that unfortunately were suffering reductions in funding at
the same time the need for them was growing. Because funding was not available to meet the
objectives for federally assisted programs, the Town joined in creating the joint powers Napa
Valley Housing Authority. The Authority developed 120 migrant farm worker beds, obtained
$6,000,000 in Mortgage Revenue Bond Authority that it converted to $1,500,000 in Mortgage
Credit Certificate Authority, conducted a nexus study for obtaining housing in-lieu fees from new
commercial development, and manages resale agreements for affordable ownership units.

March 2000

Eighty-three new units were constructed and only three were demolished, for a net gain of 80 units.
Of these, 33 were condominiums affordable to moderate-income households.
The Town intends to pursue policies and programs that make housing more affordable, while
ensuring that new developments fit with the character of the community, and do not result in an
overly dense environment. For the period covered by this Housing Element, the Town will select
those policies and objectives that more closely match the resources available, while still striving to
meet its share of the regional need for affordable housing.

C.1.a                                                  Population and Households
The Town of Yountville has grown in population from 2,893 in 1980 to 3,259 in 1990, an increase
of 366 (12.7 percent). These figures include the Veterans Home. Napa County has grown during
the same 10 years from 99,199 to 110,765, an increase of 11,566 (11.7 percent.) Minorities made
up 14.4 percent of the Yountville population in 1980 and 1990, and 17.1 and 18.9 percent of the
county population in 1980 and 1990.
The average household size in 1980 was 1.96 in Yountville and 2.55 in Napa County. In 1990,
household size was 2.08 in Yountville and 2.69 in the county. Numbers for household size for
Yountville do not include the Veterans Home or the Retirement Center.

HOUSEHOLD INCOMES
The median household income in Yountville for 1989 was $27,863, more than double the 1980
figure of $13,874 (these numbers do not include the Veterans Home). The household income
distribution has changed slightly since 1980: the proportion of households in
Fourth Printing                                   48

the very low-income category remained about the same (35 percent), as did the proportion of
above moderate-income households (25 percent). However, low-income households declined from
24 percent to 20 percent while moderate-income households increased from 16 percent to 20
percent.

 Figure III.3                                            Household Income Distribution in Yountville
Household income categories are computed according to the method used by ABAG in its Housing
Needs Determinations, 1989. ABAG compares income levels to a region-wide (nine counties)
median. For 1980 that median was $20,607; by 1990 it had risen to $41,565. Income categories
are: very low-income = 50 percent of the median and below, low-income = 50 percent to 80
percent of the median, moderate-income = 80 percent to 120 percent of the median.
COST OF HOUSING
The median home value in Yountville in 1980 was $65,852. In 1990 it was $189,900 (based on a
survey by Town staff), a 288 percent increase over 1980. In Napa County it was $78,200 in 1980
and $183,600 in 1990, a 234 percent increase. Thus, housing prices in Yountville rose faster than
in the rest of the county and also rose faster than the 200 percent increase in household incomes.
Recent data from the County Assessor indicate that home sales prices vary widely around the
$189,900 median. Some homes have sold for as little as $116,000, while others sell for as much as
$445,000. Many sales were in the $160,000 to $180,000 range. In general, older and smaller
houses sell for less; newer and larger homes cost more.
A survey of 70 rental units in Yountville in February 1991 indicated that the average studio
apartment rents for $424 per month; the average one-bedroom apartment rents for $472 per month,
and the average two-bedroom apartment rents for $650 per month. The average one-bedroom
house rents for $496 per month and the average two-bedroom house rents for $563 per month.
(See Figure III.4.) The median rent found by the 1990 U.S. Census was very close to these

 Figure III.5                 Household Income and Effect of Interest Rates on Loan Affordability
Fourth Printing                                50
March 2000
With a 10 percent down payment, a household at the 1992 Napa County median income level of
$42,200 could afford to purchase a house costing $133,500 if interest rates were at 10 percent. If
interest rates were as low as 8 percent, the median-income household could purchase a house at
$160,000. If the median-income household paid 20 percent down and obtained an 8 percent 30-
year mortgage, they could purchase a house costing $180,000. Therefore, depending on interest
rates and down payment (and based on home values reported by homeowners responding to the
1990 Census), somewhere between 17 percent and 38 percent of owner-occupied dwellings in
Yountville would be affordable to the median-income household. The highest earning moderate-
income household (income at 120 percent of median, $50,640 in 1992) could afford to purchase a
house between $160,000 and $192,000 depending on the interest rate, with 10 percent down.
Buying a median-priced house would require an income of $50,000 to $60,000, depending on
interest rates.
For units of comparable size, rental housing is more affordable than ownership housing. A
household at the low-income level (80 percent of median income) could afford to pay $831 per
month for rent. Nearly 72 percent of the rental units in Yountville would be affordable to these
households. A very low-income household would be able to pay $520 per month. Even at this
level, 36 percent of the units in town would be affordable.

OVERPAYMENT
Despite the apparent affordability of rental housing in Yountville, many households still are
overpaying for housing. Figure III.7 indicates that 71.5 percent of the lower income (includes both
very low- and low-income) renter households pay more than 30 percent of income for rent.
Overpayment among this group is significant—67.3 percent pay over 35 percent, and some may
pay as high as 50 percent.
In February, 1995, the Town undertook a comprehensive survey of the residents of the Town's two
mobilehome parks, Rancho de Napa and Gateway. This survey indicated that nearly 76% of the
respondents are low to very low income and approximately 35% of these lower income residents
pay in excess of 30% of their incomes towards housing costs. (revised 4/25/5, Resolution 1114-95)
The survey asked respondents to indicate whether or not they needed help with rent, mobile home
repairs or other assistance. A total of 19 lower income households indicated that they needed rent
and/or utility assistance. (revised 4/25/5, Resolution 1114-95)
Overpayment is less of a problem for lower-income owners; only 11.5 percent of lower-income
owners pay more than 30 percent of income for housing costs.

ELDERLY
In 1990, the median age of the Yountville population (including the Veterans Home) was 64.8
years, while it was only 36.5 years for Napa County. Even excluding the largely elderly
population of the Veterans Home and the Retirement Center, the average age of the town
population is older compared to most other Bay area communities. Over 30 percent of the non-
institutional population is over age 65. Nearly 45 percent of the town’s households have one or
more elderly residents. Of the town’s 266 renter households, 62 are headed by a person 65 or
older. Of 624 owner households, 335 are headed by a person 65 or older. Figures III.8 and III.9
compare the age distribution of Yountville’s population (excluding the Veterans Home and the
Retirement Center) with the age distribution for the state.

The Town provides space for the Title III Senior Nutrition Program which serves a daily meal for
20 to 30 seniors. The Town has also supported non-profit agencies that provide mediation
services for elderly residents. The two mobile home parks (which are restricted to senior
residents) and the Town provide space for recreational activities, flu shots, blood pressure
screening, and seminars on health and financial planning. A low-income health clinic that serves
many of the senior residents, has also been supported by the Town.
The Town operates the Bear Flag Express, a local bus service that, while serving all residents, is
of special importance to senior residents who do not own cars or have mobility limitations. The
bus line connects the town with the Veterans Home.

HOUSEHOLDS WITH DISABLED RESIDENTS
The 1990 U.S. Census identifies two types of disabilities for Yountville’s non-institutional
population: work disability and mobility limitation. Figure III.10 shows the number of disabled
persons in Yountville.
Fourth Printing                                 54
March 2000

A person with a work disability may have a health condition that limits the kind or amount of work
that he or she can do or that prevents working at a job or business altogether. A work disability
may also be a health condition that limits the choice of jobs. According to the 1990 Census, 71
(7.1 percent) of Yountville’s 996 residents aged 16 to 64 had work disabilities. Some 203 (36.2
percent) of 562 persons over age 65 had work disabilities.

The Census also reported that 93 persons in the 16-64 age group (9.3 percent) had a mobility
limitation. In the over-65 age group, 196 (34.9 percent) had a mobility limitation. The proportion
of disabled persons in this age group is higher for all categories of disabilities.
The total number of disabled persons in Yountville (excluding persons in institutions and the
military) was 296, or 19 percent of the population over 16 years old. Many of these people have
more than one type of disability. The number of households with disabled persons cannot be
determined from Census data.
Disabilities can affect housing needs in a number of ways. Persons with a work disability may be
unable to afford adequate housing because their disability limits the income they can earn or
prevents them from working altogether. Persons with mobility limitations may need housing
located close to special services. Some disabled people may require housing modifications such as
ramps and grab bars to make it possible for them to live independently.
It is the intent of the Town Council to comply fully with all standards of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) by 1995. The Bear Flag Express transit system (described on page 13 of
the Town Structure Chapter) already meets ADA requirements for accessibility.
LARGE FAMILIES AND OVERCROWDING
By the State’s definition, a housing unit that has more than one person per room (excluding
bathrooms and kitchens) is considered to be overcrowded. The 1990 Census revealed only 14
overcrowded units in Yountville; all of these were renter-occupied. The 1.6 percent rate of
overcrowding in Yountville was much lower than in the rest of Napa County (5.5 percent).
The problem of overcrowding is often related to household size; i.e., large families are more likely
to be overcrowded. Average household size in Yountville is low at 2.08 persons per household,
and the number of large households (five or more persons) is very small (5.1 percent). Of these 45
large households, 13 are owners and 32 are renters. Over one-third of Yountville households have
only one person, and three-fourths have one or two persons.
Figure III.11 compares household sizes and size of housing units. While only 14 percent of
households have four or more members, 91 percent of units have four or more rooms. This is
consistent with the very small level of overcrowding measured by the Census.

FARMWORKERS
The State of California Employment development department estimates that agricultural
employment in Napa County varies from a low of 2,400 in November to a high of 4,700 in
September.
The agricultural work force in the county is overwhelmingly (98 percent) male. Sixty-two
percent of these workers were married and they had a median household income of
$10,000. About 87 percent of farm worker households were in the very low-income cate-
gory. Nearly 80 percent were in overcrowded housing (more than one person per room).
Seventy-one percent were paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing.
Given the importance of agriculture to the Napa County economy and the housing prob-
lems faced by farm workers, there is a substantial need for new farm worker housing.
The Survey of Farm worker Housing Needs in Napa County by the County Farm Bureau
recommends both the construction of dormitory-style housing for migrant workers and
two- and three-bedroom apartments for permanent workers and their families.
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Figure III.12 shows that 68 of Yountville’s 504 families in 1990 were headed by women. This was
13.4 percent of all the families in the town and 7.6 percent of all households. Of these families, 41
had children under 18. While the percentage of female-headed households has declined slightly
since 1980, the proportion with children under 18 has increased. Many of these families have
lower incomes and, therefore, have difficulty finding affordable housing. Female-headed
households may also need nearby day-care and recreation for children and convenient access to
public transit.

HOMELESSNESS
The housing needs of homeless persons are more difficult to assess than those of any other
population subgroup. Since these individuals have no permanent addresses, they are not likely to
be counted in the Census, and since they also are unlikely to have stable employment, the market
provides them with few housing opportunities. Others in need of emergency shelter include
battered women and children, persons displaced from their homes by disasters such as fires,
tenants who have been evicted from rental housing, and runaways.
While the 1990 census indicated that there were no homeless people identified in Yountville,
homelessness is a regional problem requiring regional solutions. Therefore the Town will continue
to support NCCEO financially and assist local church and civic groups in their ongoing program
for providing temporary shelter for the homeless.
C.1.d                                                     Subsidized Units at Risk
Federal, State, and local government programs have provided both low interest loans and rent
subsidies to private developers of multi-family rental housing. In return, developers were required
to build and operate their rental projects under agreements which established a schedule of below-
market rents for lower income households. The restrictions to low-income occupancy were set for
a limited period of time, usually in accordance with the length of term of the government subsidies.
When the low-income occupancy restrictions expire, the owner may convert the units to market
rate rentals.
The potential impact of conversion on the state’s affordable housing stock is significant. From
1990-2005, 117,000 low-income rental units in California could convert to market rate.
The Housing Element is required to identify the number of units at risk of conversion to market
rate by 1996 and by 2001, and to include programs to mitigate or preclude the loss of any “at risk”
units between 1991-1996.

An “Inventory of Federally Subsidized Low-Income Rental Units at Risk of Conversion” shows
that there are no federally subsidized units in Yountville that are at-risk. Fourteen affordable units
have been developed through Town programs. Of those, four existing units were set aside for low-
income occupancy in an agreement with a developer. These four units are required to remain
affordable until 2021.
Eight low cost sweat equity units at Oak Leaf Court are covered by buy-back agreements. The
Town has set aside $90,000 from the Housing Opportunity Fund to insure that these units remain
affordable.
Two new units have been built under the Town’s Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance. These units are
required to remain affordable housing until 2018.

There were 1,021 dwelling units in Yountville as of July 1992, plus group quarters. Single-family
detached houses comprise 38 percent of the 1,021 units, and mobile homes comprise an additional
31 percent. The remaining 31 percent are apartments, second units, duplexes, and condominiums.

C.2.b                                           Occupancy and Vacancy Rates
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (1987 California Statewide
Housing Plan, Phase I) suggests that an overall vacancy rate of 5.0 percent in urban areas
generally indicates a market reasonably well-balanced between supply and demand. The 8.7
percent vacancy rate shown in Figure III.14 would seem to indicate adequate consumer
opportunity for mobility and choice in living accommodations. However, many of these vacant
units were not available to housing consumers: 46 of the vacant units were counted as seasonal
vacancies, and an additional 8 units were vacant for unspecified reasons. Only 12 units (1.2
percent) were available for rent and 19 (1.9 percent) were available for sale. Because so many of
Yountville’s vacant units were not on the market in 1990, the effective vacancy rate was lower than
ideal at 3.1 percent.

The occupancy of units varies by type. Larger buildings are occupied almost entirely by renters,
while single-family homes are occupied primarily (although not entirely) by owners. Over 28
percent of single-family homes were occupied by renters. Mobile homes are the units least likely
to be rented.

C.2.c                                        Rehabilitation and Replacement
Much of Yountville’s housing is quite new. Over 60 percent of the units have been built since
1970 (including 317 mobile homes installed in two mobile home parks). Only 126 units (12.9
percent) were built before 1940.
The private sector has been active in rehabilitating some of the older structures (an average of one
per year). Many of these units were purchased, renovated by the new buyers, and sold at above-
median prices.
In February 1995, a windshield survey of the Town's housing stock was carried out rating the
condition of 291 housing units. Approximately 433 newer housing units were identified by Town
staff and were not included in the survey. These consisted of recent subdivisions that were less
than 20 years old. The 319 mobile home park spaces were not included in the windshield survey,
although a separate survey of the mobile home parks provided information on the number of
mobile homes built prior to 1976. State rehabilitation guidelines indicate that mobile homes built
prior to 1976 are in need of rehabilitation because they were not required to comply with UBC
standards.
The mobile home resident survey also asked if there were rehabilitation needs. Of the responses,
33 lower income households in the two mobile home parks indicated their homes were in need of
repairs.
The results of these surveys indicate that approximately 44% of the Town's housing stock is in
need of rehabilitation. Figure III.15a shows 1995 housing conditions and rehabilitation needs.

C.3.a              Analysis of Population and Employment Trends
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) publishes projections of population,
household, and job growth for the Bay Area and its cities and counties. The ABAG document is
called “Projections 92: Forecasts for the San Francisco Bay Area to the Year 2010,” (July 1992).
Figure III.17 shows the latest ABAG projections for Yountville. ABAG predicts that population
growth in Yountville will not keep pace with Napa County between 1990 and 2010. The town’s
total population is expected to increase by 27 percent during this 20-year period, compared with a
30 percent increase countywide.

 Figure III.17                               Population and Employment Projections, 1980–2010
For the purpose of the housing element, it is more appropriate to look at household population
because many of the town’s residents live in either the Veterans Home or the retirement facility
operated by the Seventh Day Adventist. The household population is projected to grow by 25
percent, compared to 30 percent for the county. Household size grew between 1980 and 1990, but
ABAG expects household sizes to decline between 1990 and 1995. Yountville will continue to
have a smaller household size than either the county or the region as a whole.
The number of employed residents in Yountville is fewer than the number of available jobs—one
reason being the high percentage of elderly, and this situation will likely continue.

C.3.b                                     Share of Region’s Housing Needs
ABAG is responsible for determining housing needs for the Bay Area. Its most recent calculations
are reported in its publication Housing Needs Determinations (January 1989). The housing needs
projections are based on the region-wide population, employment, and household forecasts
contained in Projections 87, an earlier version of Projections 92.         ABAG determined the
projected (1988-1995) housing need for the Bay Area, and distributed a share of the total regional
need to each city and county.
“Existing housing need” is defined as the number of units that would be needed to raise the
vacancy rate in each city to 4.5 percent. The 1988 existing need in Yountville was eight housing
units.
The “Projected housing need” is the Town’s share of the region’s housing need for the years 1988-
1990 and 1990-1995. The ABAG housing need projections are shown in Figure III.18.

State law requires that housing needs be determined so that the shelter requirements of all income
groups are identified. Accordingly, ABAG has prepared estimates of housing needs for the
following income categories:
     Very-low income = less than 50 percent of the area median;
     Low income = 50-80 percent of the area median;
     Moderate income = 80-120 percent of the area median.
The projected need by income category is shown in Figure III.19. Just over half of the total seven-
year need (172 units between 1988 and 1995) was built in the four years 1988-1992. However, all
of these units were in the moderate- and above-moderate income category, so that all of the
remaining “fair share” need for new housing is in the very low- and low-income categories.

Since 1988, 89 units have been built in Yountville, thus the remaining need for new construction is
for 83 units. The completion of the Hopper Creek Village in 1989 met the need for 33 moderate-
income units. The other 56 units built from 1988 to 1991 would have been affordable only to
above moderate-income households, therefore the remaining new construction need is for 48 very
low-income units, 33 low-income units, and 2 above moderate-income units.

D.        Housing Resources
D.1                                                                        Land Inventory
Concurrently with the General Plan revision (of which this Housing Chapter is a part), the Town is
revising its Zoning Ordinance, with the result that the number of units permitted on each of the re-
maining vacant or redevelopable parcels in the town is being increased to create additional
opportunities for affordable housing. The General Plan and new Zoning Ordinance permit du-
plexes, (and triplexes and fourplexes with a Use Permit) on all vacant residential parcels, and also
limit the sizes of individual single-family houses. The new Zoning Ordinance will also permit
additional second units and duplexes on many existing lots occupied by single-family dwellings.
All residential developers will be required to either provide affordable housing or pay in-lieu fees
to the Town’s Housing Opportunity Fund. This approach has the added advantage of dispersing
affordable housing throughout the town, rather than concentrating it in one particular area. The
Town will be more pro-active in using the Housing Opportunity Fund to generate affordable
housing.
The parcels listed below are all developable within the remaining years of this Housing Element.
All property owners are given the opportunity and encouragement to develop their land to the
maximum potential allowed by the Town, in order to meet affordable housing goals. The parcels
listed below and in Figure III.20 include only the major vacant and redevelopable sites within the
Town. In addition, infill sites and lots will be permitted to have additional units under the new
Zoning Ordinance. These lots will provide further opportunities for affordable housing.
D.1.a                                                                           Vacant Sites
                                            (includes agricultural land with one single-family house)
A primary factor affecting the supply of housing is land availability. Yountville’s growth is also
influenced by the fact that the town is surrounded by prime agricultural land. There are currently
six vacant sites within the town limits zoned for residential use, totaling 35.6 acres. Several of
these sites can have higher densities as a result of land use changes made in this General Plan.
(See Section D, Chapter II, Town Structure.) The Town’s affordable housing policy (Policy 8.5)
grants density bonuses for meeting specific requirements relating to providing housing for targeted
income levels. The potential number of units is 164–231, far in excess of the remaining need for
83 units by 1995.
Figure III.20, Available Land for Residential Use, shows a range of units for each parcel. The
lower minimum figure is the maximum number of dwelling units that may be built by a developer
who chooses to pay in-lieu fees rather than build dwelling units which meet affordable
requirements. The higher figure is the maximum number of dwelling units that may be built by
developers who choose to take the density bonus by providing affordable housing. Figure III.23,
Housing Unit Counts by Income Level, shows the Town’s realistic estimate of the number of units
that can be constructed in the remaining two years of this Housing Element. (The assumption is
that about one-fourth of the potential affordable units will be provided.) The Town is prepared to
process applications for the number of units shown in Figure III.23; however, nothing in this
General Plan precludes the production of the total number of units shown in Figure III.20.

a) 36-090-22, 23 (Bardessono). This 6.8-acre parcel is located on the southeast corner of Yount
Street and Finnell Road. Town Hall and Yountville Elementary School recreation facilities are
across Finnell Road to the north. East of this property is the 42-unit Heritage Estates subdivision.
There is currently one house and a vineyard on the Bardessono property. The maximum
development potential for this 6.8-acre parcel would be 40-56 units. Two-thirds of an acre
fronting on Yount Street has been zoned for residential-scale commercial use
b). 36-090-02 (Catholic Church). This property consists of two parcels. A six-acre parcel
fronting on Washington Street could have from 17 to 24 units. An 11-acre parcel is located on the
east side of Hopper Creek adjacent to the Town’s southern boundary. Adjacent to the property on
the north is the Gateway Mobile Home Park. The 11-acre property is currently used for a
vineyard. Development potential would be 40-56 units. The zoning allows for open space/parks
to be designed within the development and adjacent to Hopper Creek. (In general, all parcels
abutting Hopper Creek have setback requirements and must preserve the natural vegetation.) This
property is also within the floodplain and is subject to regulations established in the Zoning
Ordinance, Section 6.9.
c) 36-330-01 (Filippi). This 2.9 acre property is located between Highway 29 and Washington
Street. The Burgundy Commons residential development is adjacent on the north, Highway 29 is
adjacent on the west, and Vintage Inn is adjacent on the south. Hopper Creek runs through this
property, significantly limiting vehicular access to the triangle-shaped 0.5 acres north of the creek.
The General Plan land use designation for this half-acre is proposed to be changed from High
Density to Agriculture, and preferably for use as open space. If the General Plan designation for
the 2.4-acre site south of the creek is changed to Mixed Residential as proposed, the development
potential would be 17-24 units.
d) 36-040-13 (Lande). This 4.7-acre parcel is located on the east side of Yount Street opposite
Adams Street. The lands north and south of this property are divided into low-density residential
lots. The property is currently occupied by a house and orchard. The maximum development
potential would be 24-33 units.
e) 36-040-10 (Mayeri). This 2.4-acre parcel is on the south side of Yountville Cross Road and is
adjacent to the Knight property. The Town Council has approved a final subdivision map with 10
detached houses; however, General Plan changes will permit 13–18 units.
(amended Resolution 1173-96 1-23-96)
D.1.b                                           Potential Redevelopment Sites
The Town has identified three potential “redevelopment” sites, totaling 20.5 acres. (The sites are
considered “redevelopable” rather than vacant because they have more than just one single-family
dwelling.) These sites are currently occupied by limited commercial or residential development,
and are designated for residential use by the General Plan. The potential number of units on these
sites is 112–156.
g) 36-040-12, 14 (Forrester). This 15.9-acre parcel is located on the east end of Mount Street, off
Yount Street. The property is bordered by residential developments on the south and the Town
boundary on the east. The property is currently occupied by six houses and a vineyard. The
development potential would be 90-125 units.
h) 36-040-11 (Knight). This 2.44 acre parcel is located on the south side of Yountville Cross
Roads adjacent to the Town’s eastern boundary. The property is currently used as a lumber yard
and retail hardware business, and has been identified as a Retained Use. If this existing business is
continued and the remainder of the parcel developed, the development potential on the south
portion would be 7–10 units. However, the General Plan allows 13-18 units over the entire parcel.
i) 36-090-05. (Rabe). This 2.2-acre parcel is located on the east side of Washington Street and
straddles Champagne Drive. The Gateway Mobile Home Park is adjacent to this property on the
east. The property is currently developed with two non-conforming commercial buildings. The
development potential would be 15–21 units, depending on whether the existing buildings are
retained.

MANUFACTURED HOUSING
Mobile homes and manufactured housing provide a source of lower-cost housing. There are 317
mobile homes in Yountville (32 percent of all units) in two mobile home parks.
Yountville has adopted the Medium Density Mobile Home Park (MD-MHP) Ordinance which
allows only mobile home parks on lands so zoned. The Town zoned the land occupied by the
Rancho de Napa and Gateway mobile home parks MD-MHP. Through this action, Yountville is
attempting to assure the preservation of 317 existing mobile homes. This action will eliminate
pressure to convert these parcels to other forms of residential development and will help maintain a
large local supply of affordable housing.

HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED
Yountville has a very large proportion of housing for the elderly and disabled: 1,325 persons lived
at the California Veterans Home and another 84 at the Retirement Center in 1990. In addition, the
two mobile home parks with 317 units (one-third of the town's total housing stock) are limited to
senior citizens. The Town does not consider it necessary to designate any specific sites for
additional elderly or disabled housing.
VERY LOW-, LOW-, AND MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING
The Town views all residentially zoned parcels as potential sites for affordable housing. A portion
of the identified housing needs can be met through the Second Unit Ordinance. In addition, the
Town is developing a system of density bonuses and inclusionary requirements that will result in
the provision of affordable units in all future developments.
D.2                                                        Availability of Services
All of the sites in Figure III.20 can be provided with necessary services and facilities, but at
varying costs.
Water supplies are generally adequate to provide for new residential growth until 2020. The
primary source of water is the State-owned Rector Reservoir which supplies the State Veterans
Home and the town. This supply is subject to reductions if the water is required by another State
agency. A secondary water supply from the North Bay Aqueduct also is subject to reductions from
the State in case of drought, and significant restrictions were imposed in the summer of 1991 as a
result. Nevertheless, it is expected that water from these two sources will be available to meet the
need for new housing construction during the period of this housing element (1990-1995).
The town’s wastewater treatment facility has adequate capacity to handle growth to a population of
about 5,300. This capacity will be adequate for new housing construction in the 1990-1995
period.
D.3                      Financial Resources for Housing Assistance
Through the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, a Housing Opportunity Fund was established to
provide seed money for housing developments or programs. Revenues are generated from in-lieu
fees received from new commercial and residential developments. The funds will be used to
purchase land for new construction or will be used for other housing opportunity programs.
The fund had a balance of $400,000 as of July 1992. Of this amount, $90,000 is reserved to buy
back affordable units constructed in a 1983 self-help program. The remainder of the fund is
available for new programs. In addition, $15,000 from the general fund is committed as
Yountville's share in the joint-powers Napa Valley Housing Authority.
The Town has applied for federal and State funds in the past but has been unsuccessful in its
attempts. It is believed that, in general, these funds will not be available to the Town in the near
future.
The Town is a participant in the Napa Valley Housing Authority and some funds may be available
from its programs, but amounts are not known at this time.

E.        Constraints to Housing Production
E.1                                              Local Government Constraints
E.1.a                                                               Land Use Controls
Yountville has a Zoning Ordinance and new Design Document that regulate land use, lot sizes,
density, and building size and type. Without such controls, the remaining vacant land in the town
would likely be developed with luxury homes, affordable only to the very few. To prevent that
from occurring, and to provide for a variety of housing types affordable to different income levels,
the Town is revising its Zoning Ordinance concurrently with this General Plan update. The revised
Zoning Ordinance will insure that the remaining land within the town limits will be developed with
smaller single-family homes (than those built recently), duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes; and
that a portion of these will be for low-and moderate-income households.
Parking requirements are not a constraint to affordable housing. Yountville currently requires two
parking spaces per dwelling unit, but does not require these spaces to be covered. In addition, the
Town’s new Zoning Ordinance will reduce parking requirements for affordable housing. Duplexes
will provide two parking spaces; triplexes, four spaces; and fourplexes, six spaces.
Second units are permitted in all residential zones. Second units constructed concurrently with the
primary dwelling are not required to have a Use Permit. Maximum size of second units is 600
square feet.
E.1.b                                                       Codes and Enforcement
The Town follows the Uniform Building Code in its requirements for new construction. There are
no local amendments to the UBC. Yountville’s building code requirements are no different from
those in most other cities. While it is recognized that building codes affect the cost of housing
development by establishing structural and occupancy standards, the code as applied in Yountville
is not a constraint on housing development.
E.1.c                                                  Fees and Other Exaction's
Fees do not constitute a constraint on housing development in Yountville. Figure III.21 compares
fees in Yountville with those in the City of Napa and the Bay Area average. Building fees are set
by the County. Growth impact fees, which are under the control of the Town, are substantially
lower than in the rest of the Bay Area. Total fees are only 70 percent of the Bay Area average.
The Town’s in-lieu fees that come from the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance are not included in
Figure III.21. While these fees may increase the cost of some housing, they are intended to
increase affordability over-all. The Affordable Housing Provisions of the Zoning Ordinance
provide that all fees may be waived for affordable housing.

E.1.d                           Local Processing and Permit Procedures
After acceptance of plans and their review by the Town, the processing of building permits is
handled by the Napa County Building Department. After Town review, permits for single-family
dwellings can be obtained in three to five weeks, according to the Town Administrator. Permits
for construction in the historic district take longer, 30 to 45 days, because of the requirement for
design review.

It may require some additional time for developers to understand their obligations under the new
Zoning Ordinance to build affordable housing or contribute to the Housing Opportunity Fund. The
design review requirements may add some time; however, the Town will look at ways to
streamline the processing of applications and give priority in the design review process to
affordable housing projects.
E.1.e                                           On- and Off-Site Improvements
To maintain its rural character, the Town of Yountville has very simple standards for on-and off-
site improvements. As of 1992, the Town permitted v-gutters and required sidewalks on only one
side of the street, resulting in substantial savings in subdivision costs. The Town Standards
proposed in the Design Ordinance (a companion document to this General Plan) do not embrace
common suburban improvements, and will require less investment in concrete and asphalt.
As of 1992, the Town requires only those off-site improvements necessitated by the development,
such as larger pipes or road widening.

E.2                                             Non-governmental Constraints
E.2.a                                                                             Land Costs
The price of finished lots is a significant component of housing cost—one-quarter or more of the
total cost of a house. Land costs in the Bay Area have been increasing since World War II as a re-
sult of inflation, increased immigration, and decreasing land supply. This cost increase has an
adverse effect on the ability of households, particularly low- and moderate-income households, to
pay for housing. For example, each $250 increase in the cost of a unit adds about $10 per month
to the cost of housing.
According to the Town Administrator, land in the Yountville area costs around $200,000 per acre.
This results in a cost for improved lots of $90,000 to $150,000 depending on size and location. A
typical 5,000 square foot lot in Old Town, with utilities, cost about $125,000 in 1992.
E.2.b                                            Cost of Housing Construction
Construction cost increases, like increases in land cost, have raised the cost of housing and have
affected the ability of consumers to pay for housing. Construction cost increases are due to the
cost of materials, labor, and higher government-imposed standards (e.g., energy conservation
requirements). Construction costs in 1990 for a single-family home in Yountville ranged from $65
to $120 per square foot. Housing construction costs in the Bay Area, on average, make up about
42 percent of the total cost of a single-family starter home. (Bay Area Council, Taxing the
American Dream, May 1988.) Figure III.22 shows an approximate breakdown of the components
of the cost of new housing.

E.2.c                                                    Availability of Financing
The availability of money is a significant factor in both the cost and the supply of housing. Both
(1) capital used by developers for initial site preparation and construction, and (2) capital for
financing the purchase of units by homeowners and investors have suffered high and fluctuating
interest rates in recent years. During the 1980s, interest rates for conventional mortgages and con-
struction loans ranged from 8 to 21 percent. For many, high mortgage interest rates made home
ownership infeasible because incomes were not adequate to meet required mortgage payments.
(Each 1 percent rise in interest rate would cause the monthly payment on a $70,000 mortgage to
increase by $54.)
For builders, high interest rates translate to higher development costs, which in turn are passed on
to the home buyer in the form of higher prices for new units. At times, builder financing is
difficult to obtain even though the cost of take-out (mortgage) financing may be reasonable. Until
the late 1980s, credit enhancement for multi-family developments was available. In the early
1990s, it has been almost impossible to secure financing for multi-family projects. Thus the cost
and availability of financing has had a direct impact on Yountville’s housing supply, steering new
development away from producing affordable multi-family units and toward more expensive
single-family homes.

F.        Affordable Housing Policy
The preceding sections document the scope and variety of Yountville's housing needs. It is clear
that these needs are best met by policies that encourage the construction of a variety of dwelling
types within each major parcel slated for future development. In addition, the citizens Task Force
has emphatically expressed preference for the character of neighborhoods with the diversity of
building types found in Old Town. The Zoning Ordinance therefore contains a density bonus
system whereby housing developers are granted additional development rights in return for
providing affordable units or for meeting special housing needs. Developers who elect not to
provide affordable housing as defined in the Zoning Ordinance are required to pay an in-lieu fee
for their contribution to the affordable housing component.
F.1                                                                Density Bonuses - Residential
F.1.a                                                                        Unit Density Bonus
The General Plan provides the opportunity for a density bonus through allowing an increased
number of units on a property if a developer builds 20% of the total units onsite as low and
moderate income housing. The General Plan along with the Design Ordinance provides specific
density ranges for the larger vacant or redevelopable properties in town. These properties are all
designated Mixed Residential and are identified in Figure III.20.
Infill properties in the Old Town Historic area can be developed by use permit with multiple-
family housing that could qualify for a unit density bonus if affordable housing is provided.
Normally, a multi-family structure can contain no more than four units within this land use
designation. However, if 20% or more of the units are affordable, then a 40% density bonus is
allowed for up to six units on a property. A corresponding 40% increase in FAR is also allowed.
All developments must meet other setbacks and design criteria as specified in the Design
Ordinance.
F.1.b                                                     Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Density Bonus
The General Plan and its implementing ordinances allow an additional type of density bonus as an
incentive to develop affordable housing. While this type of bonus does not result in more units, it
can result in homes with more bedrooms to house larger families. The Town limits the floor area
ratios of new residential structures to 0.25 FAR in most cases. A project with 10% or more onsite
affordable housing is allowed to increase the FAR's of the single family homes according to the
amount of affordable housing and the lot size of the homes. For example, a development with 10%
affordable housing is allowed a 0.30 FAR on lots of 5,000 to 5,999 square feet while a
development with 20% or more affordable housing is allowed up to 0.40 FAR on lots of 6,000 to
8,000 square feet.
F.2                                                                 Density Bonus - Commercial
Development of mixed use commercial structures is encourage by the General Plan. In order to
provide an incentive for residential units in commercial developments, residential units are allowed
in commercial structures with a bonus of 0.05 FAR above the normal limit on commercial
structures of 0.25 FAR. Inclusion of residential units within a commercial structure is the only
method allowed to increase the FAR in commercial land use designations. It is anticipated that
residential units developed under this provision would be either worker housing or lower cost
rental units.
G.        OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
The Town of Yountville recognizes the need for greater energy efficiency in both existing dwelling
units and in new construction. Adequate windows, insulation, weather stripping, and caulking all
can reduce energy consumption in buildings.
Opportunities for energy conservation are greatest in new construction. The Town will continue to
enforce UBC and State standards for energy efficiency in all new residential construction.
H.        Issues, Objectives, and Policies
State housing element law requires, for each housing policy adopted by the Town, the time frame
within which the policy will be accomplished, the agency or official responsible for accomplishing
the policy objective, and a count of the number of housing units that will be created or preserved
during that time frame. The Town intends to pursue policies and programs that make housing
more affordable, while ensuring that new developments fit with the character of the community,
and do not result in an overly dense environment. The Town’s approach is to combine incentives
Fourth Printing                                   75
March 2000

for developers to produce median-income housing with a pro-active Town effort to assist low- and
middle-income households. All policies in this section are the responsibility of the Town Council,
for implementation by 1995, unless otherwise noted following the policy statement. For all
policies that refer to revisions of the Zoning Ordinance or Design Document, the target date for
implementation of these changes is 1992. Where quantifiable, estimated housing unit counts are
provided following the policy statement.
H.1                                                         Issue:        Housing Variety
       Objective
1      Provide Sufficient Land for Residential Development.
       Policies
1.1.   Maintain the bulk of available vacant land zoned as residential.
               This program stems from one of the Town’s primary goals—to maintain its rural
               character—and also relates to Objective 3, to develop a variety of housing
               types. There is a limited amount of land in Yountville. The thrust of this pro-
               gram is that most lands currently zoned residential will remain residential.
1.2.   Identify vacant/underutilized infill sites.
       Objective
2      Develop Adequate Amounts of Multi-family Housing.

       Policies
2.1.   Encourage that a percentage of all new housing be designated for multi-family units.
               Multi-family housing in Yountville is defined as “two or more dwelling units on
               a single lot or parcel.” Second units, detached rental units, condominiums, and
               duplexes are considered multi-family. This policy represents a continuing com-
               mitment by the community to housing types in addition to the single-family de-
               tached house and the mobile home. It is a pro-active statement to assure that
               Town zoning is not a constraint on the development of affordable housing. The
               40 percent density bonus being established in the Zoning Ordinance and
               provisions for multi-family housing in other residential districts will induce
               developers to construct multi-family units.
               Housing Unit Count:        15 units
               Responsibility:            Town Planner
2.2    Encourage that a percentage of new multi-family units be rentals .
               The density bonus will be used to encourage the production of affordable rental
               units, but the Town recognizes that some subsidies will be required to make
               units affordable to very low- and low-income households.
2.3    Require new development to build at no less than the minimum number of dwelling units
       prescribed by the Town Structure Chapter of the General Plan for specific properties.
               Development at less than the minimum shown for specific properties will not be
               allowed unless the Town makes specific findings that the reduction in number of
               units will not undermine the General Plan’s overriding objectives to produce
               more, smaller, and more affordable housing units.

3.1.   Require new developments of five or more lots or units to provide a range of house sizes
       and lot designs.
               New developments with a density of five or more units or lots shall provide a
               range of building types and sizes and lot designs, with the intent to encourage
               lower-cost housing. This policy applies the requirement based on the size of the
               development. Further, the thrust of Policy 3.1 promotes variety in housing
               within a development.
               In implementing this policy, the Town will require a minimum of different lot
               sizes, depending on the size of the parcel being subdivided. The Town will also
               establish the required degree of difference between lot sizes in the same devel-
               opment, and formulas or a map will be prepared to establish the number or per-
               cent of lots of each size.

3.2    Encourage lot-by-lot development.
               The Town will investigate how to implement this policy, including such possi-
               bilities as financing and installing the necessary infrastructure through assess-
               ment districts or other means.
3.3    Encourage smaller lot sizes in single-family residential areas.
               “Smaller” is defined as 6,000 square feet or less. The size of the smaller lots
               can be graduated.
               Housing Unit Count:      22 small single-family houses from the combination of
                                        policies 3.1 through 3.5
               Responsibility:          Town Planner
3.4    Continue to encourage the construction of smaller-sized residential units and rental housing.
               Floor area ratios (FARs) will be established for all residential land use cate-
               gories. In addition, the Town will allow duplexes on single-family lots.
3.5    Consider controlling the size of houses.
               The Town will encourage smaller houses by applying a permissive building en-
               velope together with low floor area ratios (FARs).
3.6    Continue to permit second dwellings units on single-family lots.
               The Town has never denied an application for a second unit and has attempted
               to notify homeowners of the opportunity to build second units. The new Zoning
               Ordinance will permit second units to be constructed concurrently with the
               primary unit without a separate Use Permit, but as part of a Master
               Development Plan review process.
               Housing Unit Count:      10 very low-income units
3.7    Seek below-market-rate financing for units that will be made available to very low and low
       income households.
               The Town will seek funding from at least three sources: (1) local banks seeking to
               meet their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, (2) investors seeking
               Low Income Housing Tax Credits, provided that program is continued, and (3)
               federal and State funds, including those available under the HOME program. The
               Town will also work with developers to assist them in seeking funding for affordable
               housing.
3.8    Ensure that low-income units are dispersed throughout the community.
       Objective
4      Develop Mixed-use in Appropriate Areas.
       Policies
4.1    Continue to require commercial development to preserve existing on-site dwelling units, or
       provide like-replacement residential units off-site, or pay an appropriate in-lieu fee to the
       Housing Opportunity Fund.
Fourth Printing                                    78
March 2000

               The Town’s method for determining the amount of the commercial in-lieu fee
               has not been codified. The Town has been operating since 1986 on a
               discretionary basis in setting the fee. In 1987, the Legislature adopted
               requirements that must be followed in establishing fees. The Town must identify
               the purpose of the fee, the use to which the fee will be put, and the relationships
               between the fee’s use, the type of development on which the fee is imposed, and
               the need for the facility that will result. Having determined that a “nexus”
               (connection) exists, the Town must determine that there is a reasonable
               relationship between the fee imposed and the cost of the facility to be developed.
               Therefore, in order to continue this program, the Town will undertake the
               economic study necessary to show that the connections exist between fee and
               use, and that the amount of the fee is reasonable. Alternative contributions, as
               substitutes for in-lieu fees, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
               Housing Unit Count:        Build seven very low- and low-income units, preserve five
                                          very-low income units
               Time Frame:                Complete nexus study in 1993, construct units in 1995.
Objective
5      Provide for Manufactured Housing.
       Policies
5.1    Permit manufactured housing by right where residential use is permitted, and which meets
       design standards of the land-use designation in which it is located.
               This has been a State requirement for more than 10 years.              The Zoning
               Ordinance will be revised to conform to State law.
5.2    Preserve and protect existing mobile home parks.
               This will be accomplished by maintaining the existing MHP zoning.
               Housing Unit Count:        Preserve 317 existing mobile homes
       Objective
6      Develop Housing for Households with Special Needs.
       Policies
6.1    Consider shared housing programs for the elderly and for single parents.
               Housing Unit Count:        Four very low-income units
6.2    Support the Veterans Home of California .
               The Town has supported the Veterans Home by funding a transit system that is
               used primarily by the residents of the Veterans Home; the Town operates the
               swimming pool at the Home; and the Town has contributed financially to a
               museum and special events at the Home.
6.3    Encourage or allow live/work units for artists, professionals, or telecommuters in specific
       areas.
               Live/work units differ from home occupations. Home occupations allow a com-
               mercial or business activity to be conducted within a home in a residential area,
Fourth Printing                                      79
March 2000

               provided the business activity is clearly incidental to the residential occupancy.
               Live/work units are primarily locations for commercial or business activity
               within which facilities are provided for sleeping, cooking, eating, and
               sanitation, so as to allow the space to be occupied as a dwelling by the commer-
               cial or business proprietor. Live/work units will be allowed in all commercial
               areas and are encouraged by allowing a 0.05 FAR density bonus for
               commercial structures with one or more residential units.
               Housing Unit Count:       Seven very low- and low-income units
               Responsibility:           Town Planner
6.4    Continue to financially support the cooperatively developed shelters operated by the Napa
       County Commission on Economic Opportunity (NCCEO) and other similar ventures.
               The program identifies shelter sites, establishes a committee responsible for the
               program, sets up an operating procedure, and provides a mechanism whereby
               the public is informed of the shelter program. NCCEO currently operated two
               shelters in Napa.
6.5    Permit emergency shelters and transitional housing in specific commercial or overlay
       districts.
               This has been a provision of State law since 1990.
6.6    Encourage the development of a program to meet the housing needs of permanent and
       migrant farm workers.
               The Town is working with the Napa Valley Housing Authority and other agen-
               cies in this effort. Two farmworker camps with 120 beds were opened in North
               County in August 1992. The Town contributed $4,000 to the provision of 30
               temporary shelter beds.
               Housing Unit Count:       30 beds
               Responsibility:           Town Council
               Time Frame:               Accomplished
6.7    Through the joint powers Napa Valley Housing Authority the Town will encourage the
       County of Napa and the agricultural industry to develop more on-site farm labor housing.

       Objective
7      Prevent Conversion of Existing Housing to Other Uses.
       Policies
7.1    Continue the Bed and Breakfast Unit Control Program.
               The Town has established guidelines that prevent the conversion of existing res-
               idential units to overnight lodging.
               Housing Unit Count:       Preserve eight very low-income units

7.2    Continue to restrict conversion of rental units to condominiums.
               An ordinance is in effect that prevents conversions because the percentage of
               renter-occupied units has dropped below 35 percent.
               Housing Unit Count:      Preserve 266 units
7.3.   Do not allow the conversion of residential units to commercial uses in areas of the Town
       designated for residential use.
               Housing Unit Count:      Preserve two very low-income units.
7.4    In areas planned for non-residential uses, any conversion of an existing residential use or
       residential building shall require “like” replacement in a residential area.
               Housing Unit Count:      Replace six very low-income units
7.5    Preserve affordable housing throughout town to be rehabilitated or redeveloped.
       Objective
8      Maintain Affordability for All Income Groups.
       Policies
8.1    Produce an annual report on progress in meeting housing goals.
               The report need not be lengthy. It should reproduce this list of housing policies
               and indicate the accomplishments (or lack of accomplishments) to the date of
               the report.
               Responsibility:          Town Planner
               Time Frame:              Annually
8.2    Help non-profit developers coalesce proposals for new affordable rental housing.
               Non-profit developers will also be able to take advantage of the density bonus to
               produce multiple family housing. The Town will offer loans from the Housing
               Opportunity Fund for pre-development costs and introduce non-profits to the
               situation in Yountville. The Town will work with any qualified non-profit
               developers to produce affordable rental housing. If no existing non-profits are
               able to put together such a project, the Town will look into creating a local non-
               profit development corporation.
               Housing Unit Count:      10 very low-income units
8.3    Work with a non-profit to acquire market-rate rentals for conversion to mixed market-rate
       and affordable housing, possibly in conjunction with a mixed-use development.
               Most such units are studio apartments. There is no building with more than 13
               such units.
               Housing Unit Count:      Two very low-income units, plus two low-income

8.4    Encourage self-help (sweat equity) to reduce construction costs to home buyers.
               The Town will seek the assistance of the California Self-Help Housing Program,
               the FmHA Technical Assistance for Self-Help Housing Program, and any
               qualified non-profit corporation to develop a self-help program.
               Housing Unit Count:      Ten low-income units
8.5    Use density bonus incentives in conjunction with an alternative requiring inclusionary units
       to encourage the private market to produce moderate-cost family units.
               The Town has an inclusionary Zoning Ordinance which requires a developer of
               5 or more units to offer 10 percent of the units in the project for low and mod-
               erate income households. The developer has the option to pay an in-lieu fee.
               The ordinance places restrictions on the resale or long term rental of targeted
               units. The inclusionary Zoning Ordinance offers a 40 percent density bonus for
               providing 20% affordable units, but requires in-lieu fees if the density bonus is
               not used. An FAR bonus is also allowed for developments with 10% or more
               onsite affordable single-family and multiple-family housing as specified in the
               Affordable Housing Ordinance and the Design Ordinance. The density bonus
               provisions will be targeted at the median income household in Yountville, which
               is a low-income household by HCD’s area (Napa County) median income
               standard.
               Housing Unit Count: 12       very low- and low-income             units,  28   above
                                           moderate-income units
8.6    Use the Town’s Housing Opportunity Fund to create seed money or assistance money for
       affordable housing projects.
               The Town will take a more active role in using the Housing Opportunity Fund
               along with other programs (mixed use, self-help, assistance to non-profits) to
               develop housing for very low- and low-income households. The effectiveness of
               the fund will be maximized by leveraging funds whenever possible.
               Housing Unit Count:      Seven low- and moderate-income units
8.7    Single-family detached units purchased with public subsidies will be restricted to owner
       occupancy.

9.1    Participate within the Napa Valley Housing Authority (NVHA) in a Mortgage Credit
       Certificate (MCC) program to be used, in part, in Yountville.
               Qualifying applicants are first-time home buyers who meet specific income lim-
               its ($42,200 in Napa County for households of one or two persons and $48,530
               for households of three or more persons) and purchase either new or existing
               houses, condominiums, or mobile homes that fall under the government’s estab-
               lished price limits ($183,510 in Napa County for new homes and $160,470 for

       Objective
10     Fair Housing for All.
       Policies
10.1 Encourage fair housing practices and initiate procedures to ban discrimination in housing
       based on race, age, sex, family size, or marital status.
               In the past, the Town Administrator has referred housing discrimination
               complaints to the County Social Services Department. The Town will request
               assistance from the district office of the California Department of Fair
               Employment and Housing to develop a more formal program for resolution of
               housing discrimination complaints.
       Objective

               Responsibility:          NVHA
12.3 Work within the Napa Valley Housing Authority to use Community Development Block
       Grants, CDBG, funds for rehabilitation.
               Eleven units in Yountville need rehabilitation. However, the Town has found it
               difficult to compete with other cities for relatively scarce CDBG funds because
               the town’s target groups are relatively well-off compared to the competition.
               Town staff estimates that five units can be rehabilitated by the owners through
               private sector loans; six units will require the help of Community Development
               Block Grants.
               Housing Unit Count:      Six units (included in Policies 12.1 and 12.2)
               Responsibility:          NVHA
12.4 Continue to work within the Napa Valley Housing Authority to seek funds for rehabilitation
       from local lenders, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies.
12.5 Encourage owners of deteriorated housing units to rehabilitate their dwellings.
               The Town has provided information on assistance programs and has made
               applications available. On some occasions, the Town has notified owners of
               deteriorated buildings of the need for rehabilitation. Policy 12.6 (below) is
               another method by which the Town encourages rehabilitation.
               Housing Unit Count:      Five moderate-income units
12.6 Utilize appropriate sections of various codes which allow repairs and alterations to be made
       to historic buildings without compliance with all requirements of the Code, when authorized

A.                                                                        CONSERVATION
It is important to identify Yountville's natural resources to ensure preservation and proper
maintenance. This section discusses the following: air quality; water; soils and minerals;
vegetation and wildlife habitat; archaeology; energy; wastewater treatment and solid waste. The
issues, objectives and policies follow a description of existing conditions and intend to enhance,
and in some cases, improve these resources. Some of the text in this section has been excerpted
from the Environmental Resources Element of the 1985 General Plan.
A.1                                                                                 Air Quality
The State of California monitors air quality to see that it meets both State and federal Ambient Air
Quality Standards. These standards address six air pollutants which damage air quality. They
include: chemical ozone; carbon monoxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen; particulate matter and lead.
This section discusses factors which affect the existing air quality of Yountville.
A.1.a                                                               Existing Conditions
Since Yountville is a small town, most places and services can be accessed by walking and biking.
There is little traffic congestion, except on weekends as a result of visitors to the Napa Valley
region. Gridiron planning as discussed in Chapter II, Town Structure, establishes the
interconnection of streets throughout town which reinforces paths for pedestrians as well as cars.
The proposed street system reinforces walking by extending existing streets into new developments
and connecting new streets to one another, and is described Chapter II, Section B., Circulation.
The Town also supports a local and regional bus transit system. Continued efforts to further
reduce daily car trips and increase walking are part of the trip reduction plan administered by the
Joint Powers Congestion Management Agency, see Chapter II, Section D.
A.2                                                                   Soils and Minerals
A.2.a                                                               Existing Conditions
Soils is an important resource for water absorption, sustenance of native vegetation, and for the
underlying stability of building foundations. Generally, the soils in Yountville are in good
condition and it is important to use proper grading and construction techniques to maintain these
conditions. Specific soils classifications are outlined below, and shown on the adjacent page in
Figure IV.1.
The town lies upon soils in classification 1 - alluvial fan deposits bordering uplands. Adjacent
soils conditions to the east and south are classification 2, fluvial deposits at the outer edge of
alluvial fans. To the north of town, the Yountville Hills consist of soils classification 4, andesitic
to basalitic lava. The Veterans Home is largely located upon soils in classification 7 - andesitic to
basalitic. Adjacent soils conditions to the north are classification 6 - alluvial, moderately to highly
dissected to the north and to the west, soils classification 8 - mudstone, siltstone. There are no
significant mineral resources within the town limits.

A.3.a                                                               Existing Conditions
The Town of Yountville obtains its water supply from two sources: the North Bay Aqueduct
(NBA) and the Veterans Home of California. The water supply is considered safe, high quality,
and presently reliable.
The North Bay Aqueduct, coming from the Sacramento River at Barker Slough across Solano
County into Napa County, will provide a maximum supply of 500 A.F. in the year 2020. This
supply is subject to reductions by the State of California in the event of drought or in the event that
more water has been allocated to the users than can be supplied with the existing State Water
Project (SWP) facilities. In the summer of 1991, significant reductions were imposed due to the
statewide drought. Unless additional facilities are constructed, State-imposed reductions will
likely occur more frequently as the users increase their water demands.
The Veterans Home of California has a small dam, referred to as Rector Reservoir, located two
miles northeast of town on the east side of the Silverado Trail. This reservoir has a capacity, or
safe yield of 1,200 A.F. (Water Resource Study of the Napa County Region, J. Montgomery
Engineers - January, 1991). The Town has an agreement with the State for 325 A.F. a year
providing no other State agency is in need of this supply.
These two sources provide a total 825 A.F. of available water, assuming no drought and no
demand beyond available ability of NBA to deliver, and no requests from State agencies to utilize
the capacity of Rector Reservoir .
The town does not have any water treatment facilities and instead, relies on the treatment of Rector
Reservoir water by the Veterans Home of California and the treatment of NBA water by the City
of Napa. Annual tests from both of these sources indicate a water quality that meets or exceeds the
State Health Department requirements for a municipal water supply (See "Annual Water Report -
1992".)
Water pressure throughout town varies from 60+ to 75+ psi, and is controlled by adjusted pressure
reducing valves at Yount Street and Finnell Road and Yountville Cross Road. The water is
supplied to the town through a grid system of eight and six inch pipes.
Assuming unrestricted access to its full water supply, the town could continue its past level of
water use, adjusted for projected growth, until the year 2020. If the Town of Yountville initiated
even modest water conservation measures, the water supply would remain sufficient well beyond
the year 2020. This makes the following assumptions: no State-mandated reductions due to
drought; no new oversupply demand for NBA water; and no State agencies claiming all or a
portion of the Rector Reservoir supply not utilized by the town.
It is important to recognize the Yountville has an NBA allocation of 500 A.F. a year. Because all
of the NBA has not been constructed, the full demand on the system would go beyond the State's
present ability to deliver. For this reason Yountville and other municipalities have prudently
estimated only a 55% yield from the system. For planning purposes in Yountville, this translates to
275 A.F. annually. The 275 A.F. plus the 325 A.F. from Rector Reservoir totals 600 A.F. which
would be barely adequate for full build out of town in the year 2020.
The Town has an agreement with the Domaine Chandon Winery which permits the use of water
from two wells on the Domain Chandon property, provided that the wells produce more water than
is needed for the regular operation of the winery. The wells are located at the northwest corner of
the Veterans Home of California and Highway 29. The use of these wells is conditioned upon an
"emergency" finding by the State of California or the Town itself. The amount of excess water
Fourth Printing                                  89
March 2000
available from the wells is estimated to be 3.0 million gallons a day of 9.2 acre foot. This
emergency supply is not considered for long-term permanent use.
A.4                                          Vegetation and Wildlife Habitat
A.4.a                                                             Existing Conditions
The soil quality is considered good as is evident by the surrounding agricultural land
predominately planted in vineyards. Within the town there are native large trees and native
vegetation along Hopper Creek which are important to preserve. In 1991, the Town Council
appointed a committee to study Heritage trees. The findings and conclusions of this study have not
been completed. Environmental Impact Report studies to date have revealed no rare or
endangered species within the town limits.
A.5                                                                             Archaeology
A.5.a                                                             Existing Conditions
Native American burial grounds are believed to exist within the town cemetery, however,
investigations to date have not revealed findings of any significance. The Town Administrator
stated that there have been no indications that anything of archaeological significance exists.
A.6                                                                                      Energy
A.6.a                                                             Existing Conditions
Yountville receives its gas and electric power from Pacific Gas and Electric through local
distribution systems. Recognized as a leader in development of alternative power and energy
conservation, PG&E generates electricity from a variety of energy sources. The Town of
Yountville supports the energy conservation programs of PG&E and other agencies through
recycling programs, promoting the use of energy efficient building materials and expanding its
pedestrian and bike paths.
A.7                                                                              Solid Waste
A.7.a                                                             Existing Conditions
Yountville contracts with the Upper Valley Disposal Company for refuse collection and disposal.
Through 1992, this waste was deposited in the Clover Flat Landfill. Solid wastes include any
unwanted or discarded material except for liquids, gases and yard (green) wastes. Reducing
discarded waste by recycling extends the life of landfills.
The Town maintains a separate agreement with Upper Valley Disposal Company to provide
curbside collection of recyclables for Yountville residents. The State Legislature passed the
California Integrated Solid Waste Management Act in 1989. The Act requires the solid wastes to
be reduced by 25 percent in 1995 and by 50 percent in the year 2000. The law also requires towns
to adopt Source Reduction and Recycling Plans that specify how waste reduction will be achieved.
On August 25, 1992, the Town of Yountville, in collaboration with Calistoga, St. Helena and the
unincorporated parts of Napa County, adopted four documents pertaining to the source reduction
and recycling of solid wastes. Additionally, most of all yard (green) waste from maintenance of
public parks and street trees is composted by the Town.

A.8                                Wastewater Treatment and Transmission
A.8.a                                                                Existing Conditions
The Wastewater Treatment Facilities are located on approximately five acres in southeastern
portion of the town limits near the Veterans Home of California. The facilities are operated by the
Town, and the cost of operation and maintenance is shared jointly between the Veterans Home and
the Town based upon actual usage. At present, the usage is approximately 50 percent Town, and
50 percent Veterans Home.
With the exception of the Veterans Home of California, the town's wastewater flows through sewer
lines to a 'lift' station located at the northwest corner of Lands Lane and Beard Ditch. A force main
then carries the raw sewage from the 'Lift' station westerly to the Town's Wastewater Treatment
Facilities.
The treatment facilities provide advanced secondary treatment program including a trickling filter
system with solids contact and removal of excess solids. Provisions have been made to expand the
treatment system by a nitrogen removal program which can be added in the future if new
conditions should make this removal desirable or mandatory.
After treatment, the wastewater is utilized by the Veterans Home to irrigate about 50 acres of hay
field and by the Town to provide irrigation to about 60 acres of privately owned Chimney Rock
Golf Course located on the Silverado Trail. The Town discharges its treated wastewater to the
Napa River during the winter months.
The capacity of the Wastewater Treatment Facility is 0.55 mgd for organic loading and 2.0 mgd
for hydraulic loading. This capacity is adequate to handle the projected buildout population
equivalent of 5,300. This equivalent represents 1,700 residents in the Veterans Home and 2,700
residents in the Town, plus 900 for tourism and non-residential employment. Although under
present regulations, the facilities can handle the projected population increase, it is likely that the
regulatory agency California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), San Francisco
Bay Region, will continue to upgrade the present requirements during the period of the General
Plan.
Additionally, the Town must maintain and/or expand its agreements for the use of its reclaimed
wastewater for irrigation purposes. The summer flows of the Napa River are generally insufficient
to meet dilution requirements established by CRWQCB.
The Town has a well established wastewater transmission system which has undergone extensive
maintenance to reduce wet weather inflows. This continuing maintenance program will be an
ongoing requirement to protect the treatment facilities from overload and to prevent major sewage
overflows within the town.

SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING PLAN
The Town currently has a recycling plan which encourages the reduction and recycling of wastes,
and operates in conjunction with the Household Hazardous Waste Plan.
ENERGY CONSERVATION ORDINANCE
The Town has no ordinance which encourages energy conservation. It is the intent of the Town
Council to develop and adopt an Energy Conservation Ordinance within one year.
WATER CONSERVATION ORDINANCE
The Town has no ordinance which regulates water conservation. The Town is required by the
State of California to develop and implement its own landscape irrigation ordinance by January 1,
1993, or utilize the existing State ordinance. The most recent development, the Heritage Estates
subdivision, was required by the Town to provide drought resistant landscaping as a water
conservation measure and a condition of development approval. The Town will consider the
development of a Water Conservation Ordinance that complies with State regulations within one
year.
REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS
The Town currently uses a two stage process for review of development proposals. It is the
intention of the Town Council to adopt a three stage process in the near future. The addition of a
preliminary step or Concept Approval would ensure that any proposed development be in
compliance with the intent of the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the Design Document.

This section addresses several safety related environmental conditions and emergency response
services which include seismic, geologic, flooding, hazardous materials, police and fire protection.
Some text has been excerpted from the Environmental Resources Element of the 1985 General
Plan.
B.1                                                                     Natural Disasters
This section includes a description of the existing geology, watercourses and storm drainage
conditions related to potential seismic and flood hazards which are followed by the issues,
objective and policies relevant to the safety of the town.
B.1.a                                                              Existing Conditions
SEISMIC ACTIVITY AND GEOLOGY
The existing soils conditions for Yountville are outlined in Section A.3 of this chapter. However,
the entire State of California lies within Zone 4 Classification for seismic activity as defined in the
Uniform Building Code. Surveys by the United States Geological Survey show fault lines and
areas of activity in the general Napa Valley area. There is no indication of the status of seismic
activity in the Yountville area itself. Specialists in seismic studies at the University of California
confirm that the seismicity of the Yountville area is the lowest in the Zone 3 category. None of the
major fault lines, the Hayward, Calaveras, San Andreas, or Healdsburg, are near the Town of
Yountville. The nearest seismic incident occurred in Vacaville and Winters over 60 years ago, and
in Santa Rosa along the Healdsburg fault on October 1, 1969 . It has not been determined whether
or not the fault lines in the Yountville area are active. Therefore, site studies for individual
projects to determine any impact will be necessary and prudent. Planning and construction of
buildings in relation to seismic and other geological conditions will need to be considered for
specific sites.
STORM DRAINAGE
Hopper Creek is the major watercourse that traverses the town and is the primary collector for
storm water. Hopper Creek discharges to Dry Creek two and a half miles south of town, and Dry
Creek discharges into Napa River. Other characteristics of Hopper Creek are discussed in Section
C.2, Open Space/Parks, Existing Conditions.
A secondary storm water collector is Beard Ditch which begins near Yountville Cross Road east of
the Knight Lumber Company and follows the town’s eastern boundary to the south. Initially, it is a
very minor swale which continues south and gradually becomes wider and deeper. Significant
widening of the ditch near Finnell Road was made at the time of the Hertiage Estates development.
There are three other minor channels which provide drainage for a small portion the total storm
water. Hinman Creek flows from Lake Hinman north of the Veterans Home of California and to
the south along the western edge of State Highway 29. A second and unnamed drainage channel
flows from the Yountville Park at Madison Avenue towards the cemetery and beyond the town
limit. A third minor channel flows between Vintage 1870 and State Highway 29 and provides
drainage south to California Drive into underground pipes, across Washington Street and finally
discharges into Hopper Creek.

FLOOD HAZARD
Portions of Yountville are within the 100-year flood plain at risk of flooding caused by excessive
overflow of the Napa River or Hopper Creek. In 1990, the boundary of the 100-year flood plain
was revised to the boundaries shown on the map to the left, Figure IV.2, Flood Conditions Map.
The 'special flood hazard' area, as defined by FEMA, includes the two mobile home parks, the
easterly half of Toyon Terrace and most of Heritage Estates. New development in these areas
must provide design and engineering solutions to protect from potential flooding.
Since the early 1980's, the Town has required all development adjacent to Beard Ditch and Hopper
Creek to address and mitigate the drainage problems associated with these regional drainage
channels. In 1989, the Town established the Mesa Court-Tallent Lane Storm Drainage Benefit
District to provide for drainage improvements within the northern portion of the town.
In addition to existing development, the District includes three undeveloped properties: 1) APN
36-040-12 and 14 (Forrester); 2) APN 36-040-11 (Knight); and                     3) APN 36-040-10,
(Mayeri), an approved but unbuilt subdivision called Stags View. All properties within the Benefit
District are required to pay a "per lot" fee in order to provide for long-term improvements to the
drainage problems of the District. With the completion of the anticipated improvements, Beard
Ditch will be capable of handling a flood of level Q25 or once every 25 years. To ensure this level
of safety is provided and maintained, a portion of the ditch was widened and cleaned out
concurrent with development of Heritage Estates.
Hopper Creek is more difficult to quantify because it is a natural watercourse. Generally, it is
considered as Q10 level or slightly less. Future improvements at critical points could improve its
carrying capacity, including Finnell Road.
The potential for future flooding of the town has been greatly reduced by recent improvements
with the exception of an overflow from the Napa River. These include in the early 1980's,
improvements made to Hopper Creek as part of the Vineyards subdivision and in 1990,
improvements made to Beard Ditch as part of the Heritage Estates subdivision.
There have been no significant improvements on the Napa River which would alleviate the
potential flooding of the southern portion of Yountville in the event of a 100 year storm. In the
vicinity of the mobile home parks located at the southeastern portion of town, there is a history of
flooding as a result of an overflow of the Napa River. The most recent flood caused by overflow
of the Napa River occurred in 1986. A large number of mobile homes in the southeastern portion
of town sustained major damage. There are no projects underway by the federal or State
government that would correct the potential flooding of Yountville.
Through its own initiative, the Town successfully petitioned the Federal government to revise its
established requirements for finished floor elevations of any structures built within the flood-prone
areas. (Flood Insurance Rate Map - FIRM, Community Panel Number 0602090001C, Revised
September 28, 1990). The requirements for finished floor elevations mandate the new building
must have a finished floor (FF) elevation at least one foot above the projected 100-year flood
elevation. Information is on file at Town Hall regarding the Base Flood Elevation for every
property within the town limits.

FIRE PROTECTION
The Town of Yountville receives fire protection through the California Department of Forestry,
CDF, which is under contract with Napa County. The Town of Yountville also maintains a
contract with the County. The CDF currently maintains a station on Webber Street in Yountville
which houses two trucks and is staffed by CDF personnel. All requests for fire-fighting services in
Yountville receive equal priority relative to other fire districts. The CDF responds to all fires and
ranks them according to their intensity and other CDF criteria. There are currently no plans to
change the level of service provided to the Town of Yountville at the annual review of the contract.
POLICE PROTECTION
Under the terms of the current contract with Napa County, the Town of Yountville is provided with
complete police protection through the Napa County Sheriff's Department. The Napa County
Sheriff's Department defines five sub-regions within Napa County. The Town of Yountville is the
regional office for one of these five sub-regions. All requests for police services in Yountville
receive equal priority, except in the case of an emergency, which is defined by the Sheriff's
Department as a matter of life or death. Emergency conditions receive top priority. The contract
with Napa County is reviewed annually and has remained essentially the same since 1965. There
are currently no plans to change the nature of services in future versions of the contract.
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
The County of Napa provides Emergency Medical Service for Yountville. The Town has
contributed $7500 to the County to maintain and upgrade their communications capability, and
will continue to support those services.
EVACUATION PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES
The following plans exist for emergency services and have application in Yountville: The Napa
County General Plan, the Napa County Emergency Services Plan and the Yountville Emergency
Services Plan. Provisions for emergency procedures and services outlined in these plans vary
according to the particular incident. In the case of earthquake, temporary housing and emergency
services are provided. In the event of an explosion due to Suburban Propane Co., evacuation
should occur to the south and east of the site of the accident. In the event of flooding, provision
for evacuation is primarily to the west. Primary evacuation routes are Washington Street, State
Highway 29 and Solano Avenue. Due to the town's small size, evacuation for fire is not a
constraint.

The intent of this element of the General Plan is to identify noise sources and develop strategies to
reduce excessive exposure to noise for Yountville residents. On the opposite page Figure IV.3, the
Noise Contours Map, indicates noise contours for measurements recorded by CalTrans in 1973
and projections for noise levels in 1995.
C.1                                                                                      Sources
Current data regarding noise conditions in Yountville is limited. The following text is a
compilation from the Napa County General Plan, Section F of the August 1992 EIR prepared for
the Wine Train and the 1985 Yountville General Plan.
C.1.a                                                              Existing Conditions
Noise includes excessive sounds made by both stationary and motor vehicle sources. In
Yountville, the primary sources of noise are vehicular traffic, building construction, landscape
maintenance machines, amplified music, trains, people and animals. State and federal legislation
have established vehicle noise standards which the Town can enforce but not make stricter. The
Town can only prohibit sound-amplifying equipment such as speakers, horns or sirens, and engines
without suitable mufflers. In the past, complaints regarding noise have been addressed by staff;
however, a detailed Noise Ordinance has been requested by the Town Council but remains
unformulated.
Sound intensity typically is measured in A-weighted decibels or dBA, with ordinary conversation
recorded at about 60. Environmental noise fluctuates over time and uses qualifiers to account for
its variability. The most common are Leq and Ldn, where Leq is the measured time-averaged
noise level and Ldn is a 24-hour noise level measurement adjusted for increased sensitivity at
night. The Wine Train EIR shows that Yountville residents experience noise levels ranging from
65 dBALdn at Yountville Park to 72 dBALdn at California Drive. In 1990, noise levels at the
Veterans Home show an ambient noise level of 54 to 57 dBALdn. The noise element of the Napa
County General Plan states that an exterior sound level up to 60 Ldn is compatible with residential
use.
While traffic sources create relatively steady background noise, there are intermittent increases as a
result of trains and aircraft overflights from Napa County and Calistoga airports, the Pacific Union
College Flight Center, and hot air balloon adventures. Other noise sources are related to
agricultural uses and are seasonal. To ensure that exterior noise levels are kept to a minimum and
to prevent transmission from outdoor sources to indoor receptors, review of new development
applications is essential.
C.2                                                  Transmission and Reception
In addition to reducing noise at its source, it is possible to further reduce noise levels by
obstructing the transmission path and insulating from its reception. Both are very effective in
limiting the area affected by noise. Often noise barriers which include masonry walls, earth berms
or natural topographic features, and accessory buildings such as garages or sheds, are sufficient to
reduce noise. Landscaping can provide additional interference for noise transmission and a visual
screen which reduces the appearance of sound barriers. The combination of noise barriers with
landscaping is the most effective. Noise levels can also be reduced through proper site design and
building construction methods.

1.3    Require the review of new development applications for potential noise problems, and if
       needed, provisions for adequate mitigation measures.
       Objective
2      Reduce noise levels at the source.
       Policies
2.1    Support State and federal legislation regulating noise produced by motor vehicles.
2.2    Continue to enforce State muffler and exhaust laws.
       Objective
3      Encourage the reduction of perceived noise levels.
       Policies
3.1    Use the development review process to ensure the placement of new buildings in ways
       which assist in reduction of noise levels.
3.2    Continue to enforce noise insulation requirements for new or significantly remodeled
       structures as outlined in Title 24 of the Uniform Building Code.
C.4                                                                        Implementation
NOISE ORDINANCE
Regulations governing noise within the town do presently exist, but they are not complete in their
scope. The town shall consider and adopt a fully formulated Noise Ordinance within one year of
the adoption of this General Plan.
REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS
Current regulations require an evaluation of noise impact for any major development.
Considerations include: long term noise production, construction phase noise production, limiting
the hours of work and regulating the routes used during construction. As a part of the Use Permit
process, mitigating measures for noise, if necessary, are outlined in the conditions for approval for
any development.
UPDATE OF NOISE LEVEL STUDY
Updates to the Noise Level Study occur periodically as a result of the review process for new
development proposals.

JANUARY 2015                             TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE
                                      iv
                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT
  A.       INTRODUCTION
  A.1 GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING HOUSING ELEMENTS
  California law requires that each jurisdiction develop and maintain a General Plan. The General Plan must
  contain a Housing Element that includes an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing
  needs, including those of specific special needs populations, and an inventory of resources and constraints
  relevant to meeting those needs; a statement of goals, policies, and quantified objectives; and a discussion of
  scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
  State law also requires that each update of a Housing Element evaluate the effectiveness of the previous
  Housing Element in attaining the community’s housing goals and objectives; the appropriateness of the
  housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to meeting the state housing goal; and the progress of
  the community in implementing the Housing Element.
  State law requires that a General Plan and its elements “comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and
  compatible statement of policies.” The Housing Element must be consistent with population projections and
  land use goals and policies set forth in the Land Use Element and closely coordinated with the Circulation
  Element of the General Plan, both of which are found in Chapter II, Town Structure.
  The intent of the Housing Element is to help accommodate the Town’s housing needs. At the same time,
  Yountville intends to protect its small-town character and appearance, its sense of community, and its natural
  and historic setting, consistent with the General Plan.
  A.2 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
  The Town recognizes the importance of engaging Town residents and stakeholders in the process of drafting
  the Housing Element update. Engaging a variety of stakeholders and residents creates an opportunity for
  dialogue in which problems are identified and potential solutions are developed. The Town held a series of
  public hearings and reached out directly to several organizations to gather input and feedback on the Housing
  Element.
  A.2.a Public Hearings
  The Town’s public outreach effort consisted of a series of public hearings during the update, as well as
  consultations with organizations that assist persons with lower incomes and special housing needs. A hearing
  with the Zoning & Design Review Board was held on July 8, 2014 to review and discuss the draft Housing
  Element. A workshop and a hearing were held with the Town Council on July 29, 2014 and August 5, 2014,
  respectively, prior to submitting the initial 60-day draft to the California Department of Housing and
  Community Development (HCD). Following revisions made to the draft Housing Element after the 60-day
  review, Town staff presented the draft Housing Element to the Town Council on January 20, 2015 seeking
  adoption of the draft.
  The hearings were noticed on the Town’s website, in the Yountville Sun newspaper, and at selected locations
  in Town. In addition, Town staff specifically notified organizations and individuals interested in housing
  issues and representing groups with special needs, including Napa Valley Community Housing, Community
  Action Napa Valley, North Bay Regional Center, the Building Industry Association, Yountville Chamber of
  Commerce, Yountville Veterans Home, Gateway Mobile Home Park, and Rancho de Napa Mobile Estates.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                             JANUARY 2015

  A.2.b Stakeholder Consultations
  The Housing Element consultant, on behalf of Town staff, reached out directly to several organizations that
  provide important services and resources for Yountville residents. In-person or telephone consultations were
  held with the North Bay Regional Center, an organization that contracted with the state to provide services to
  persons with development disabilities; the Housing Authority of the City of Napa, which monitors and
  administers affordable housing units in Yountville; Napa Valley Community Housing, a non-profit
  organization that develops and administers affordable homes; and the Yountville Veterans Home, a large-
  scale facility that is home to more than 1,000 veterans. Input and feedback from these organizations were
  used to assess housing needs in the town and determine appropriate policies and programs to address
  identified needs during the planning period.
  B.        REVIEW OF THE 2009 HOUSING ELEMENT
  The 2009 Housing Element set forth housing objectives for the Town to be carried out through associated
  policies and programs. These objectives, policies, and programs were designed to guide the Town in the
  production of new housing and the rehabilitation of existing housing units for all segments of the community.
  Government Code, Section 65588(a)(2) “Review and Revision” requires that each local government review its
  Housing Element to evaluate the effectiveness of program implementation in attainment of the community’s
  housing goals and objectives. Table 1 describes actions taken to implement housing programs since the
  adoption of the 2009 Housing Element.
  B.1 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
  The Town made significant progress in achieving the 2009 Housing Element goals. Most notably, the Town
  facilitated the construction of 54 new affordable housing units, exceeding the total very low-, low-, and
  moderate-income housing allocation of 47 units. Key accomplishments include:
           Facilitated the construction of 71 new residences, including:
                o     54 homes restricted for affordability to very low-, low-, and moderate-income households
                o     6 market rate multi-family homes (in duplexes)
                o     4 market rate mixed-use apartments
                o     2 second units
                o     6 market rate single-family homes
           Contributed annually to Napa Valley Community Housing for farmworker housing assistance, the
            CANV homeless shelter program, and the Fair Housing Napa Valley renter liaison assistance
            program.
           Facilitated the resale of two below market-rate homes to existing Yountville residents through the
            application of local preference points and the lottery system.
           Established a Senior Mobile Home Park Overlay zone to maintain and improve affordable housing
            options for seniors.
           Adopted the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code (CalGreen).
  The City also approved 4 new affordable units and 16 new market rate units. These homes will be available
  for occupancy in the 2014-2022 RHNA period and are described in further detail in Section D.1.a.

  C.          HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
  According to state law, the Housing Element must analyze demographic trends, housing characteristics and
  market trends, economic and income data, and the special housing needs of certain segments of the
  population. The analysis in this section primarily utilizes data compiled by the Association of Bay Area
  Governments (ABAG) in the Data Profiles for Housing Elements, released in January 2014. The profiles
  include population, housing stock, and economics data from the 2000 and 2010 US Census, the California
  Department of Finance (DOF), 2013 ABAG projections, the US Department of Housing and Urban
  Development’s (HUD) Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) database, and the US Census
  American Community Survey (ACS). ACS figures are estimates based on samples; for an extremely small
  town like Yountville, reported figures may be subject to large margins of error and therefore the numbers
  reported may be different than numbers reported from other data source. Despite the inaccuracy in absolute
  numbers presented, ACS data is the only source for some topics and still presents the best available estimate
  for Yountville. ACS data is best interpreted by reading the relative proportions or percentages of
  subcategories. Data that was not included in the ABAG Data Profiles for Housing Elements packet was
  obtained from direct contact with public agencies, Town staff, or other publicly available data sources.

  C.1.a Population and Household Characteristics
  Population Trends and Projections
  As of 2013, the Town of Yountville population was estimated at 2,983 (California Department of Finance).
  As shown in Table 2, the Town of Yountville’s population slightly increased from 2,916 in 2000 to 2,933 in
  2010, an increase of approximately 1 percent (17 persons). Over the same period, the Napa County
  population as a whole grew from 124,279 to 136,484, an increase of approximately 10 percent (12,205
  persons).
  According to ABAG projections, the Yountville population will increase approximately 29 percent from 2010
  to 2040, to a population of 3,800. For the same period, the countywide Napa population is expected to
  increase by 20 percent to 163,700 persons.

  Household Characteristics
  As of 2010, approximately 66 percent of the Yountville population (1,945 persons) resided in a household
  and 34 percent of the population resided in group quarters (988 persons). As shown in Table 3, the
  percentage of residents in group quarters in Yountville is significantly higher than that of Napa County as a
  whole. This is attributable to the significant number of persons residing in the Veterans Home and Seventh-
  Day Adventist Retirement Estates in Yountville.

  The average household size, which excludes persons living in group quarters, was 1.85 persons in Yountville
  in 2010, down slightly from 1.95 in 2000 (US Census). The average in Yountville was the smallest in Napa
  County. Napa County as a whole had an average household size of 2.69 persons. ABAG projects that the
  average household size in Yountville will remain small, but increase steadily to 1.91 in 2040.
  Age Characteristics
  Current and future housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of a community’s residents. Age
  can contribute to lifestyle choice, housing preferences, earning capability, and need for services and amenities.
  The median age of Yountville residents increased from 60.4 in 2000 to 64.0 in 2010, which is significantly
  older than the Napa countywide median of 39.7 and the statewide median of 35.2. As shown in Table 4,
  approximately 57 percent Yountville residents were 60 years of age or older as of 2010, up from 50 percent in
  2000. This is partially attributable to the large percentage of the population that resides in the Veterans Home
  and Seventh-Day Adventist Retirement Estates.
  Approximately 33 percent were aged 20 to 59 and only 8 percent were children or young adults age 19 or
  younger.

  Jobs/Housing Balance
  The ratio of jobs to housing is used as a measure of the degree to which communities and subregions are
  inducing commuter travel as growth occurs. A community with a balance of jobs and housing has as many
  jobs as residents that are able to work. For example, a city with 1,000 employed residents requires 1,000 jobs
  to be in balance. A community is out of balance if it has more jobs than employed residents or has more
  employable residents than jobs.
  In 2010, Yountville had a jobs-to-employed residents ratio of 1.52 (1,600 jobs/1,050 employed residents),
  indicating that there are more jobs in the Town than there are housing units. This may be attributable to the
  high concentration of jobs at the Veterans Home. As shown in Table 8, ABAG projects that this ratio will
  steadily increase through 2040 up to 1.69.

  Household Income
  According to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the area median
  income in Napa County was $86,100, as of 2014. According to the ACS 2007–2011 Five Year Estimates, the
  median family income in Yountville was $68,370, up from $63,374 in 2000 (adjusted up from $46,944 for
  inflation to provide a better comparison).
  In addition to publishing annual area median incomes, HCD publishes income amounts by income category
  (extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income). Categories and associated income amounts are used
  to assess affordability levels for purposes of analysis and program qualification. Table 9 shows 2014 income
  levels by category for Napa County.

  Table 10 shows the distribution of Yountville households by the income categories described above. Note
  that due to variations in data sources and the timing of information publication, the distribution in this table
  is based on the median family income from HUD’s CHAS database, based on the 2006–2010 ACS, and does
  not align directly with the 2007–2011 median family income or 2014 area median incomes described above.
  In addition, ACS data has a high margin of error for small communities such as Yountville; thus it is
  appropriate to focus on percentages and trends rather than specific numbers for analysis.
  Approximately 61 percent of Yountville households earned moderate- or above-moderate incomes as of
  2010. The percentage of extremely low- and very low-income households was higher among homeowners
  (approximately 22 percent) than among renters (approximately 8 percent). While a larger number of low-
  income households were homeowners, low-income households accounted for a larger percentage of renter
  households (approximately 37 percent).

  The median home sales price in Yountville was $675,000 as of 2013. Figure 1 and Table 11 show median
  home sales prices in Yountville and nearby jurisdictions from 2010 to 2013. The median price in Yountville is
  higher than that of Napa County as a whole and the nearby jurisdictions of the City of Napa and Calistoga
  but is lower than Saint Helena.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                                          JANUARY 2015

  The median price in Yountville decreased from 2010 through 2012 before increasing sharply in 2013. This
  trend is similar to that of the Bay Area and metropolitan areas throughout California and can be attributed to
  low interest rates, job growth, and greater economic stability following the recession.
  Assuming a 10 percent down payment and 5.75 interest rate, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a household would
  need to earn approximately $170,000 per year to afford a home priced at the 2013 median. It is important to
  note, however, that while the median is high, home prices can vary widely. For example, in April 2014, a
  three-bedroom single-family home was listed for sale at $750,000 (www.redfin.com). Another three-bedroom
  home, a manufactured home, was listed for sale at $164,600 (note that the manufactured home was listed in a
  park and is subject to monthly lot fees for common maintenance and amenities).

  Table 12 reports the results of a point-in-time survey of available rental units conducted in March 2014.
  Asking rents range from $1,050 to $1,800 for a one-bedroom, $2,150 to $2,300 for a two-bedroom, and
  $2,499 to $2,600 for a three-bedroom. Assuming that an affordable payment is equivalent to 30 percent of a
  household’s monthly income (based on HUD standards), a family would need to earn $42,000 per year to
  afford rent for a one-bedroom unit, $88,000 for a two-bedroom unit, and $99,960 for a three-bedroom unit.

  Affordability
  As previously noted, HUD has established that households should spend no more than 30 percent of their
  monthly income on housing costs in order for their housing payment to be considered affordable. Table 13
  shows the monthly income, maximum affordable monthly rent prices, and maximum home sale prices for
  households in a range of sizes by income category. For example, the annual income limit for an extremely
  low-income, two-person household was $20,700 (see Table 9). The monthly income is calculated by dividing
  the annual income by 12 months, and thus the monthly income is $1,725. Thirty percent of monthly income
  was calculated to determine the maximum monthly rent, which was $518 per month. The maximum sales
  prices was calculated by determining the price affordable to households at different income levels based on
  30 percent of gross income spent for mortgage payments, a 5.75 percent interest rate, and 10 percent down.
  The ability of households to purchase a home and secure a mortgage with an affordable monthly payment
  may be difficult for households earning less than a moderate income. For example, a four-person, very low-
  income household can afford to purchase a home with a maximum sales price of $166,400, which is lower
  than the median sales price in Yountville. However, as noted above, a manufactured home may serve as an
  affordable option for this household.
  To create affordable home ownership and rental opportunities, the Town will continue to implement its
  inclusionary housing program (Program 4), allow small lot single-family dwellings (Program 9), and
  incentivize affordable housing development (Program 12). In addition, the Town will work with HACN to
  explore opportunities to encourage home ownership such as Mortgage Credit Certificates and a down
  payment assistance program (Program 24).

   Monthly mortgage calculation: http://www.mortgage101.com/Calculators/Afford.asp?p=amo
   Note: Affordable housing sales prices are based on the following assumed variables: 10% down payment, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 5.75% annual
   interest rate. 30% of household gross income used to calculate affordable monthly mortgage payment. Taxes, interest, hazard and mortgage insurance are
   assumed in the total cost of ownership.
  Overpayment
  Definitions of housing affordability can vary; however, as previously noted, according to HUD standards, a
  household should spend no more than 30 percent of its monthly income on housing costs. Households that
  pay more than 30 percent are considered to be overpaying for housing and households that pay more than 50
  percent are considered severely overpaying. HUD’s CHAS database reports information on overpayment by
  tenure. As illustrated in Table 14, approximately 34 percent of households (427 households) paid 30 percent
  or more of their income toward housing as of 2010. Approximately 1 percent of Yountville households (103
  households) had a cost burden of 50 percent or more.

  C.2 HOUSING CONDITIONS
  C.2.a Existing Housing Stock
  According to the DOF, there were an estimated 1,252 dwelling units in Yountville as of 2010. As shown in
  Table 15, approximately 63 percent of Yountville housing units were single-family homes (attached or
  detached). Mobile homes accounted for 23 percent of the housing stock and multi-family structures with two
  or more units comprised the remaining dwelling units in the town.

  C.2.b Occupancy and Vacancy Rates
  HCD suggests that an overall vacancy rate of 5 to 6 percent indicates a market that is reasonably well
  balanced between supply and demand. As of 2010, Yountville had a vacancy rate of approximately 16
  percent. While this would seem to indicate an abundance of supply and consumer options, it is important to
  note that over half of the units described as vacant units were held for seasonal, recreational, or occasional
  use and were not available for rent or purchase. The effective vacancy rate of about 2 percent was lower than
  ideal, potentially resulting in upward price pressure. The percentage of vacant homes in Yountville that are

  C.2.c Age and Condition
  Housing Age
  Over two-thirds of Yountville homes have been built since 1970 (including approximately 300 mobile homes,
  almost all of which are located in two mobile home parks). Only 8 percent of Yountville homes were built
  before 1940. Table 17 shows the age of Yountville’s housing stock by year built.

  Housing Conditions
  The Town conducted a windshield survey of housing conditions in 2009. The survey focused on homes
  located in older neighborhoods that tend to have a greater need for rehabilitation. Neighborhoods included
  the old town historic district (northwest of Yount Street), the subdivisions located east of Yount Street, and

  both mobile home parks (Gateway Park and Rancho de Napa). A total of 538 homes were surveyed, 317 of
  which were located in the mobile home parks.
  Surveyed homes were determined to be in one of the following conditions:
           Sound – A unit that appears new or well maintained and structurally intact. The foundation appears
            structurally undamaged and roof lines are straight. Siding, windows, and doors are in good repair
            with good exterior paint condition. Minor problems such as small areas of peeling paint and/or other
            maintenance items are allowable under this category.
           Minor – A unit that show signs of deferred maintenance or which needs only one major component
            such as a roof.
           Moderate – A unit in need of replacement of one or more major components and other repairs, such
            as roof replacement, painting, and window repairs.
           Substantial – A unit that requires replacement of several major systems and possibly other repairs
            (e.g., complete foundation work, roof structure replacement and re-roofing, as well as painting and
            window replacement).
           Dilapidated – A unit suffering from excessive neglect, where the building appears structurally
            unsound and maintenance is nonexistent, not fit for human habitation in its current condition, may
            be considered for demolition or, at minimum, major rehabilitation will be required.
  As shown in Table 18, a large share of surveyed homes were found to be in sound condition. A small portion
  of mobile homes were found to be in need of minor or moderate rehabilitation. None of the homes surveyed
  were categorized as “dilapidated.” Appendix A provides a map highlighting the surveyed areas.

  Based on survey results and observations from Town staff, homes in Yountville are generally maintained in
  good condition and there is not a significant need for rehabilitation; however, as stated in Program 28, the
  Town will work with the Housing Authority of the City of Napa (HACN) to pursue funding for a
  rehabilitation loan or grant program to assist Yountville homeowners with repairs, improvements, and
  modifications.
  Veterans Home
  The Yountville Veterans Home is an important source of housing and services for approximately 1,000
  veterans. Veterans Home residents are accounted for in the population figures shown in tables and analysis
  throughout this section, but are excluded from the household figures. The US Census divides the population
  between those living in households and those living in group quarters. Residents of the Veterans Home are

  counted as part of the population in group quarters. Thus, in tables and analysis that analyze the Yountville
  population according to households, Veterans Home residents and residents in other group living facilities are
  not included.
  There are 1,021 beds in units that offer a range of assistance levels – skilled nursing (231 beds), assisted living
  (153 beds), and independent living (637 beds). In addition, the facility has 25 housing units for staff members.
  The Veterans Home features a wide range of amenities and historic structures on approximately 615 acres of
  State-owned land. In December 2012, the California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) released a
  Facilities Master Plan Evaluation that describes the condition of existing facilities and identifies opportunities
  for improvements. The plan calls for substantial improvements to housing units, clinics, community spaces,
  and employee housing over a 20 to 30 year period. The Town is supportive of upgrades to the Veterans
  Home and will work closely with the Veterans Home, CalVet, and other relevant parties to discuss and refine
  planned improvements (Program 29).
  C.2.d Subsidized Units at Risk
  Federal, state, and local government programs have provided both low interest loans and rent subsidies to
  private developers of multi-family rental housing throughout the nation. In return, developers were required
  to build and operate their rental projects under agreements that established a schedule of below-market rents
  for lower-income households. The restrictions to low-income occupancy were set for a limited period of
  time, usually in accordance with the length of term of the government subsidies. When the low-income
  occupancy restrictions expire, the owner may convert the units to market-rate rentals.
  The Housing Element is required to identify the number of affordable units at risk of conversion to market
  rate for the next 10 years and to include programs to mitigate or preclude the loss of any at-risk units between
  2015 and 2025. An inventory provided by California Housing Partnership Corporation showed that there are
  no federally subsidized units in Yountville at risk during this period; however, four affordable homes
  developed under local programs have affordability restrictions that are expected to expire in 2018.
  As shown in Table 19, 96 affordable units have been developed through Town programs and assistance. For
  ownership units, homes must be sold to qualifying lower-income buyers at a rate below the market rate until
  affordability restrictions expire. Rental units must be rented to households that meet income restrictions at
  rates that are affordable to these households.

      Units at risk of converting to market rate

      The Arroyo Grande Villas project contains 25 affordable units. The portion shown are those that were built with the assistance of and
    are monitored by the Town of Yountville. The additional units are monitored by Napa County.
  The Town contracts with the HACN to monitor and enforce the rent restriction and homeownership resale
  agreements for all of the above developments. As presented in Table 19, there are a total of four units
  considered to be at risk of conversion to market-rate units. The units are duplex developments and both have
  affordability agreements that expire in 2018. The Town will monitor affordability agreements and take
  appropriate steps to preserve the affordability of expiring affordability agreements (Program 16).
  In addition, 14 families in Yountville receive Section 8 rental assistance, which is administered by the HACN.
  Preservation and Replacement Options
  The cost to construct new affordable units varies greatly due to land costs and availability. For example, the
  Arroyo Grande Villas were constructed at a cost of approximately $320,000 per unit ($262 per square foot).
  Note that the land was donated for this project so this estimate does not include land costs. Using this cost
  example, the cost to construct four new units would be $1.28 million, assuming land could be identified and
  purchased.
  Generally, the cost of preserving assisted housing units is estimated to be less than replacing units through
  new construction. Preserving units entails covering the difference between market rate and assisted rental
  rates. This cost varies greatly based on the willingness and interest of the seller in keeping the units
  affordable, the condition of the units, and the market rate value of the property.

  Financial Resources to Assist in Preservation
  Costs to preserve or replace housing units that rent at levels significantly below market rates are substantial.
  The Town must consider what resources are available to help preserve or replace at-risk units so that lower-
  income tenants are not displaced in the event that the projects are converted to market rates. The Town has
  access to a range of different funds that could potentially assist in a preservation effort including:
               CDBG
               HOME
               Mortgage revenue bonds
               State grant programs
               Federal grant programs
               Low-Income Housing Tax Credits
               HUD Housing Choice Vouchers
  In addition, Program 4 directs the Town to consider revising the Town’s inclusionary housing program to
  allow greater flexibility in the payment of in-lieu fees. This would allow the Town to accumulate funds in the
  Housing Opportunity Fund to be used to assist in the preservation of at-risk units.
  Affordable Housing Developers and Property Managers Interested in Participating in
  Preservation Projects
  In many cases, the Town will find it advantageous to collaborate with private affordable housing developers
  or managers to develop and implement a viable plan to preserve affordable housing units. Private developers
  can often bring additional expertise and access to funding, such as tax credits. HCD maintains a list of
  affordable housing developers and property managers who have expressed an interest in working with local
  communities on preservation of affordable housing projects. The database lists numerous organizations that
  have expressed interest in working on preservation projects in Napa County in particular. This list includes
  such organizations as Affordable Housing Foundation, Bridge Housing Corporation, Christian Church
  Homes of Northern California, Inc., Housing Corporation of America, Napa Valley Community Housing,
  Nehemiah Progressive Housing Dev. Corp., Petaluma Ecumenical Properties Inc., Rural California Housing
  Corp., Senior Housing Foundation, Solano Affordable Housing Foundation, and Vallejo Neighborhood
  Housing Services, Inc.
  C.3 SPECIAL NEEDS
  C.3.a Seniors
  As of 2010, seniors, those aged 65 and over, made up approximately 49 percent of the Yountville’s
  population. This is an increase from 2000 when approximately 45 percent of the population was seniors. As
  shown in Table 20, the senior population grew by 114 persons, an increase of approximately 9 percent. As
  mentioned in the discussion regarding age characteristics, the large population of seniors is chiefly attributable
  to the number of residents in the Veterans Home and Seventh-Day Adventist Retirement Estates. In
  addition, a portion of the homes located within the Town’s two mobile home parks are reserved for persons
  aged 55 or older.

  Senior households are defined as households in which one or more persons is over 65 years of age. As shown
  in Table 21, nearly 33 percent of all households in Yountville included one or more senior in 2010.
  The majority (more than 75 percent) of senior households own their homes. While homeownership is
  beneficial in that costs are generally stable, which is important because many seniors live on fixed incomes, it
  can become difficult for seniors to maintain their homes and yards due to financial and physical constraints.

  In general, seniors have lower earning capacity than middle-aged persons. However, the 2007–2011 ACS
  reports that the majority of senior residents earned at least $50,000 per year as shown in Table 22. Senior
  income estimates may be misleading, as many elderly persons have access to capital outside the earned
  income measured by the US Census.

    The ACS has a very large margin of error for small communities. Residents of the Veterans Home and Napa Valley Adventist
    Retirement Estate are not included in the household population.
  The Town funds operation by Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency (NCTPA) of the
  Yountville Trolley, a local bus service that, while serving all residents, is of special importance to senior
  residents who do not own cars or who have mobility limitations. The bus provides free door-to-door service
  through residential and commercial areas of the Town and connects the Town with the Veterans Home.
  Many senior housing opportunities are available in the Town. The Veterans Home, the Seventh-Day
  Adventist Retirement Estates, and the 55 and older mobile home parks provide a range of housing choices
  limited primarily to seniors. Programs 26, 29, 30, and 31 commit the Town to maintaining and improving
  these resources.
  C.3.b                Disabled Persons
  Disability status was not counted in the 2010 US Census and the ACS does not provide estimates for very
  small cities such as Yountville. As such, 2000 Census data is the best available and is used in this analysis as a
  proxy for current disability figures.
  The 2000 US Census provided data for the following disability types:
            Sensory – blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment
            Physical – a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities, such as walking,

  As shown in Table 23, the 2000 US Census reported 663 disabilities in the Town. There were zero disabilities
  for persons age 15 and younger, 338 for those aged 16 to 64, and 325 for those aged 65 and older. The largest
  share of total disabilities was for persons with a physical disability (25 percent), followed by employment
  disabilities (22 percent). The data in Table 23 contains a count for the total disabilities of residents in the
  Town and does not quantify instances in which persons have multiple disabilities.

  Persons with disabilities may have unique housing needs such as affordability issues due to limited incomes or
  a need for accessibility features. The Town complies fully with the standards of the Americans with
  Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as all building code provisions, to improve access for disabled persons. The
  Yountville Trolley transit system (described above) meets ADA requirements for accessibility.
  The Town will continue to provide transit services for those with mobility impairments (Program 30) and
  contribute to regional efforts to provide housing and services for disabled persons (Program 32).
  C.3.c Developmental Disabilities
  Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires that the Housing Element include an analysis of the special housing needs of
  individuals with a developmental disability within the community. According to Section 4512 of the Welfare
  and Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an individual
  attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
  disability for that individual, which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term
  also includes disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment
  similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping
  conditions that are solely physical in nature.
  Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional housing
  environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is
  provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
  attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the
  first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
  situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.

  The California Department of Developmental Services currently provides community-based services to
  approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide system
  of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The North Bay
  Regional Center (NBRC) is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides point of entry to services
  for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts
  with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their
  families.
  According to the NBRC, the center serves nine developmentally disabled persons who reside in and around
  Yountville (those residing within the 94559 zip code). As shown in Table 24, nearly 90 percent of these
  residents are age 22 or younger and thus are likely to live at home with family and receive services through
  public schools.

  A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-subsidized
  homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home
  purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity
  to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of
  considerations that are important in serving this need group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new
  multi-family housing (as required by California and federal fair housing laws) is especially important to
  provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the
  affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
  To improve access to housing for those with developmental disabilities, this Housing Element includes
  Program 32, which directs the Town to contribute to agencies providing housing and assistance to persons
  with development disabilities.
  While the NBRC and its service partners typically promote and work toward a scattered-site housing model in
  which persons with developmental disabilities reside in housing units that are incorporated into the
  community, group facilities remain an option for some clients with more severe medical needs. Sonoma
  County is home to the Sonoma Developmental Center, one of four remaining large group care facilities in
  California. The center is home to over 400 persons with developmental disabilities.
  While plans and a specific time frame have not yet been finalized, the State is slated to close the Sonoma
  Developmental Center. The closure will result in a need for new housing sites for center residents. Program
  34 directs the City to monitor the potential closing of the Sonoma Developmental Center and work with the
  NBRC, relevant agencies, other local jurisdictions, and housing and service providers to provide support and
  assistance, as appropriate.

  C.3.d               Large Families and Overcrowding
  According to the state definition, a housing unit that is occupied by more than one person per room
  (excluding bathrooms and kitchens) is considered to be overcrowded. As of 2010, only 1 percent of
  Yountville housing units were overcrowded. This was much lower than in Napa County, where
  approximately 7 percent of housing units were overcrowded. As shown in Table 25, among the 14
  overcrowded units in Yountville, 10 were renter-occupied and 4 owner-occupied.
  The problem of overcrowding is often related to household size. As shown in Table 26, only 1 percent of
  Yountville households included five or more persons as of 2010.

  C.3.e Farmworkers
  According to the 2012 Napa County Farmworker Housing Needs Assessment, a report prepared by Bay Area
  Economics (BAE) in 2013, the Napa County economy is based in its $430 million agriculture industry. Wine
  grapes make up approximately 98 percent of annual crop values. It is difficult to obtain accurate data
  regarding agricultural workers; however, the California Employment Development Department indicates that
  agricultural employers in Napa County hire an average of approximately 5,000 farmworkers per year. This
  estimate does not include farmworkers who are hired casually or those employed by contractors based
  outside of the county.
  The 2007–2011 ACS five-year estimate indicates that, as of 2011, 17 Yountville residents were employed in
  the “agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining” sector. This number was down from the 2000 US
  Census count of 42. This decrease may be attributable to the large margins of error associated with ACS data
  for small communities. While there are a limited number of farmworkers currently living in Yountville, there
  may be additional demand for housing in the Town from farmworkers employed in other areas of Napa
  County.
  The BAE report notes that most farmworker households have extremely low or very low incomes. There are
  very few market-rate options available at rates affordable to households earning at these levels, resulting in
  many farmworker households overpaying for housing or living in overcrowded conditions.
  Unaccompanied men have the option of residing in one of the three Napa County farmworker centers
  (owned and operated by the Napa County Housing Authority). The centers, located in Calistoga, Saint
  Helena, and Napa (this facility is approximately two miles from Yountville), provide dormitory beds and
  subsidized meals for 180 farmwokers. In addition, licensed private farmworker housing facilities can house up
  to 130 farmworkers. One such facility, Yount Mill Vineyards, is located near Yountville (outside of Town
  limits) and can accommodate up to 32 persons.
  Most farmworkers seek and find housing situations that are not specifically designated for farmworkers.
  Permanent rental housing, such as Yountville’s Arroyo Grande Villas, is an important housing option for
  farmworkers, particularly for farmworker families.
  The Town contributes approximately $5,000 per year to Napa Valley Community Housing to assist with the
  provision of farmworker housing. The Town will continue to support regional efforts through funding and
  assistance (Program 32). In addition, the Town amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow agricultural employee
  housing in residential and agricultural zoning districts.
  C.3.f Female-Headed Households
  Female-headed single-parent households may experience a variety of housing problems, including
  affordability, overcrowding, insufficient housing choices, and discrimination. Often with only one source of
  income, female-headed households have more difficulties finding adequate, affordable housing than families
  with two income-earning adults. This special needs group would benefit generally from expanded affordable
  housing opportunities. More specifically, the need for dependent care also makes it important that housing
  for female-headed families be located near child care facilities, schools, youth services, and medical facilities.
  As shown in Table 27, as of 2010, approximately 13 percent of Yountville families were headed by a female
  with no husband present. Approximately 41 percent of female-headed families included a child or children
  under 18 years of age. According to the 2007–2011 ACS (ABAG Housing Element Data Profiles), 552 female
  residents live alone in Yountville.

  C.3.g Homelessness
  The housing needs of homeless persons are more difficult to assess than those of any other population
  subgroup. Since these individuals have no permanent addresses, they are not likely to be counted in the US
  Census, and since they also are unlikely to have stable employment, the market provides them with few
  housing opportunities. Others in need of emergency shelter include battered women and children, persons
  displaced from their homes by disasters such as fires, tenants who have been evicted from rental housing, and
  runaway youth.
  The Napa Valley Shelter Project, a program of Community Action of Napa Valley (CANV), operates Napa’s
  homeless shelters, open to any homeless person but with a priority for those from Napa County.
  Additionally, Progress Foundation operates homeless outreach as part of its clinical services and housing for
  the mentally ill, which includes three residential treatment centers in and around Napa.
  HUD data identified a homeless population of 248 persons in Napa County (see Table 28) in 2012. Among
  these, approximately 63 percent were sheltered in an emergency or transitional housing facility. In a phone
  interview, the Napa County Sherriff’s Office in Yountville indicated that there was one chronically homeless
  person in Town. Occasionally, other transient persons or families will pass through.

  Table 29 provides a list of homeless resources in Napa County. According to personal communication with
  the operator of the largest shelters, CANV, the shelters tend to operate at capacity. The Town supports
  CANV by providing pass-through funding for the agency’s effort to provide staffing for the countywide
  Homeless Prevention Program.

  The Town will continue to fund and support regional efforts to address homelessness (Program 32). In
  addition, the Town amended its Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right in at least one zoning
  district and allow transitional and supportive housing as residential uses, subject only to the same regulations
  that apply to other uses of the same type in the same district on September 16, 2014.
  C.3.h                Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities
  Senate Bill 244 (2012) requires that jurisdictions identify and analyze the housing and infrastructure needs of
  disadvantaged unincorporated communities, which are inhabited areas of 10 or more dwellings located
  adjacent to or in close proximity to one another in which the median household income is 80 percent or less
  than the statewide median income ($49,306 according to the 2010 American Community Survey). Based on a
  map of disadvantaged unincorporated communities produced by the US Department of Agriculture (using
  data from the 2006-2101 ACS), there are no disadvantaged communities located within or adjacent to the
  Yountville sphere of influence.
  Summary of Special Needs
  Most of the Town’s special needs relate to the lack of affordable housing, e.g., for overpaying households,
  those with disabilities, and single-parent head of households. Section H.9 contains programs designed to
  provide for increased affordability to address affordable housing needs of special needs groups. Seniors and
  overcrowded households do not appear to require additional Town actions, and farmworker housing and
  homelessness require regional solutions in which the Town continues to participate.

  C.4 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
  State law (Government Code Section 65580 et seq.) requires HCD to project statewide housing needs and
  allocate the anticipated need to each region in the state. For the greater Bay Area, including Napa County,
  HCD provides the regional need to ABAG, which then distributes the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
  (RHNA) to the towns, cities, and counties within the ABAG region. ABAG allocates these housing
  production goals to member jurisdictions based on their projected share of the region’s household growth,
  the state of the local housing market and vacancies, and the jurisdiction’s housing replacement needs.
  ABAG adopted the 2014–2022 RHNA in July 2013. Projected housing needs for the planning period are
  described by income categories as established by HCD: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate
  income. Housing needs for extremely low-income households are assumed to be half of the number allocated
  for very low-income households.
  Yountville’s share of the 2014 to 2022 RHNA is 17 units. Refer to Table 30 for a breakdown of units by
  income category.

  D.        LAND AVAILABILITY AND HOUSING RESOURCES
  As shown in Table 30 and described in Section C.4 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), Yountville
  has a RHNA of 17 units for the 2014 to 2022 planning period. Local governments can employ a variety of
  strategies to meet RHNA housing production goals, as provided in Government Code Section 65583(c)(1),
  including identifying entitled and unentitled vacant land, development potential on underutilized sites, and the
  potential for the addition of second units.
  As shown in Table 31, the Town can accommodate its RHNA through a combination of units of entitled
  projects, vacant land, and underutilized sites. As of April 2014, there were 21 units approved for
  development, several of which are under construction. Two of these units will be restricted for affordability
  to lower-income households and two will be affordable to moderate-income households. Vacant land can
  accommodate 45 units, 18 of which are likely to be affordable to lower-income households (refer to the
  analysis in D.1.b Vacant Land). Underutilized sites can accommodate an additional 26 units, which are
  assumed to be appropriate for moderate- and above moderate-income housing for purposes of this analysis.
  Refer to Appendix B for a map of sites identified to meet the RHNA.
  As stated in Program 8, the Town will continue to track and monitor the inventory of available sites
  throughout the planning period to ensure that adequate sites remain available to accommodate the Town’s
  RHNA.

      As described in the Approved Projects section, these two units will be deed-restricted for affordability to lower-income households under
    an agreement with the developer.
    2
      As described in the Vacant Land section, 15 of these units are estimated for Site 6, a site that allows affordable housing at 20–25
    units per acre under the Town’s Affordable Housing Overlay. The other three units are estimated on Site 7. Because of the size of a
    potential development on that site, it will be subject to the Town’s inclusionary ordinance. Lower-income units provided would be deed-
    restricted for affordability.
  D.1 LAND INVENTORY
  D.1.a                   Approved Projects
  As of April 2014, 21 housing units in five development projects were approved in Yountville, several of
  which were under construction (see Table 32). The Vineyard Oaks project (Site 1), which includes a total of
  16 units, is under construction. The project includes 12 market-rate single-family homes and an affordable
  four-plex. The affordable component will offer deed-restricted rental homes, two of which will be affordable
  to moderate-income households, and two will be affordable to low-income households.
  There are three single-family homes entitled for development (Sites 2, 3, and 5), one of which includes a
  second unit. In addition, a new apartment is planned as part of the Stewart Tasting Room mixed-use
  development (Site 4). The project is approved and it is expected that a building permit will be issued shortly.
  Appendix B provides a map of residential projects approved for development.
  The number of units listed for each approved site is the actual number approved, based on the planned
  development program and agreements with the developer or property owner.

     1 The Vineyard Oaks development includes a four-plex that will include two units restricted for occupancy by low-income households
     and two units restricted for moderate-income households.
  D.1.b                 Vacant Land
  As shown in Table 33, vacant sites can realistically accommodate 45 units on 18.69 acres. Appendix B
  provides a map of vacant land appropriate for residential development. Sites 6 and 7 are most likely to
  develop with projects that include lower-income units, while Sites 10 through 14 will likely develop as single-
  family homes affordable to moderate- or above moderate-income households. Note that Site 14 is likely to
  accommodate a single-family home as well as a second unit. Sites 8 and 9 hold potential for mixed
  residential/commercial developments. While they are not subject to a maximum residential density, it is
  assumed that units on these sites would be affordable to moderate or above moderate households based on
  recent similar developments.
  Site 6 is within the Primary Commercial (PC) zone and the Town’s Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO). The
  underlying PC zone allows residential uses in combination with commercial uses with a use permit. The
  AHO designation allows for a residential only product and establishes the maximum density on this site. All
  undeveloped parcels in this zone are subject to Master Development Plan (MDP) review, which is intended
  to establish the site layout, parking, circulation, lighting, and building design. The MDP process allows
  multiple exceptions to the Zoning and Design Ordinance standards that are generally not possible outside the
  MDP process. Potential exceptions include modifications to minimum yards and setbacks, max building
  height, min and max lot size, max floor area ratio, and minimum number of parking spaces. The MDP
  process requires a minimum of one meeting at the Zoning and Design Review Board (ZDRB) and one public
  hearing at the Town Council. The ZDRB reviews a project in its advisory capacity and provides comments
  and recommendations to the Town Council. The Town Council evaluates the project in its decision making
  capacity. Applicants, however, may elect to go before the ZDRB and/or Town Council on more than one
  occasion if they are looking for feedback before submitting a formal application or to review a revised design
  that is in response to comments made by the ZDRB at the first meeting.
  This parcel was envisioned for use as an inn as well as affordable workforce housing. While the potential
  project has stalled, the AHO remains in place and the site remains viable for affordable housing. Under the
  AHO designation, a project that includes affordable housing is eligible for a density bonus (beyond the
  amount offered under state density bonus law) as well as incentives and concessions such as direct financial
  aid, waived, reduced, or deferred fees, modifications to zoning or design standards, and priority review
  processing.

  Under the AHO, a project in which 25 percent of the units are affordable may develop at a density of up to
  20 units per acre. Based on the size of Site 6, this could result in a development project of 64 units. However,
  because this property allows for a mix of uses, it is conservatively estimated that the site will provide 15
  affordable units.
  The AHO has a been a very effective tool for achieving affordable housing development in Yountville.
  During the 2007–2014 planning period, 55 new affordable units were developed in AHO sites. Through
  implementation of the AHO, the Town fully met its RHNA construction goals.
  Site 7 is a large vacant site adjacent to the Gateway Mobile Home Park. The site is large and zoned RM,
  which allows residential development at a density of up to 10 units per acre. Should a potential developer opt
  to apply the AHO to this site, it could be developed at up to 25 units per acre. Based on the RM density, the
  site could potentially accommodate up to 169 units; however, the site is constrained by potential flooding
  (within a floodplain area). Thus, it is estimated that the site could realistically accommodate 18 units on the
  portion of the site that fronts on Washington Street. Based on the Town’s inclusionary housing provisions, a
  development of this size would be required to designate three units (15 percent) as affordable to lower-
  income households.

  1 Site 6 is subject to the AHO designation, which allows a density of 20 to 25 units per acre for projects that include a certain percentage of
  affordable units. Based on a previous planned development project and recent experience on other AHO sites, it is assumed that 15 units on
  this site will be affordable to lower-income households.
  2 Due to flooding constraints, a limited number of units is feasible on this site. However, based on the zoning designation and site features, 18
  units are feasible on this site. Based on the Town’s inclusionary requirement, three of these units must be affordable to lower-income
  households.
  3 There is no established maximum residential density for these districts. Both sites hold potential for mixed-use development. The maximum
  density is estimated at 10 units per acre and realistic capacity is assumed at 50 percent of the maximum.

  D.1.c               Underutilized Sites
  As shown in Table 34, there is potential capacity for an additional 26 housing units on sites that are currently
  underutilized. Underutilized sites are those in which, under existing zoning regulations, there is potential to
  subdivide the lot or add units to an existing parcel. Appendix B provides a map of underutilized residential
  sites.
  Due to the size of the lots and the allowed density, it is assumed for purposes of the RHNA analysis that
  these sites will develop with homes that are affordable to moderate- or above moderate-income households.
  Note that there is sufficient capacity in approved projects and on vacant land to meet the RHNA; however,
  these sites are included to show excess capacity and additional residential development opportunities.

  D.2 AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES
  All of the sites identified in Tables 32, 33, and 34 can be provided with services and facilities. The most
  current information about water demand and supply is provided in the Town of Yountville Feasibility Study
  and Facilities Planning Report (2012). The information in the following domestic water and wastewater
  subsections comes from this report.
  Domestic Water
  The 2012 report reviewed water use and availability in the Town’s municipal boundaries, including the
  Yountville Veterans Home, and approximately 4,000 acres of vineyards within a 5-mile radius of its existing
  recycled water pipelines. The report identified four sources of water, with Rector Reservoir and groundwater
  as the Town’s principal water supplies.
  Rector Reservoir on Rector Creek is owned and operated by the State of California and delivers local surface
  water to the Veterans Home and the Town for municipal supply and to the California Department of Fish
  and Wildlife (CDFW) for environmental uses and a fish hatchery. There have been several studies of Rector
  Reservoir’s capacity and safe yield. The most recent technical study by the California Department of Water
  Resources in 2000 calculated the reservoir capacity to be 4,535 acre-feet. The safe yield was estimated to be
  1,670 acre-feet annually based on actual deliveries during the 1992 drought, including 1,190 acre-feet per year
  in flow releases needed to meet the CDFW’s in-stream flow requirements. The Town’s contractual capacity
  allowance in Rector Reservoir is 500 acre-feet per year minimum.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                                JANUARY 2015

  Yountville overlies the Napa Valley groundwater subbasin, which provides municipal and agricultural water
  supply in the area. The groundwater level data illustrates generally stable long-term trends in the St. Helena,
  Yountville, and Napa areas. Groundwater quality is generally good; selected areas along the Napa Valley floor
  have elevated levels of nitrates. The Town has developed a groundwater supply system that is anticipated to
  yield 300 acre-feet annually and is generally used as backup to the Rector Reservoir supply. In 2005 the Napa
  County Flood Control and Water District, as part of its water supply functions, developed the 2050 Napa
  Valley Water Resources Study, which reviewed the water supply and demand balances for municipal and
  agricultural uses in Napa County. The study projected that the safe yield of the Napa Valley groundwater
  subbasin is 28,000 acre-feet. The study indicated that basin demands could exceed supply during dry years by
  6,000 acre-feet in 2020 and 10,000 acre-feet in 2050.
  Wastewater
  The Town’s wastewater treatment plant, known as the Joint Treatment Plant or JTP, treats wastewater from
  the Town and the Veterans Home. The average discharge rate from 2004 to 2007 was 0.57 million gallons per
  day (mgd), and the highest maximum daily effluent flow rate during this period was 1.76 mgd. The JTP can
  accept up to 2.8 mgd through its primary system during peak wet weather conditions. Flows in excess of the
  JTP’s secondary treatment capacity are stored in a 3.8-million-gallon pond for later treatment. The Joint
  Treatment Plant has adequate capacity to treat flows from the service area and to comply with its water
  quality and discharge requirements.
  Pursuant to SB 1087, which requires the Town to ensure a copy of the adopted Housing Element reaches its
  water and wastewater providers, the Town will forward its adopted Housing Element to the Town Public
  Works Department. Government Code 65889.7 requires water and wastewater providers to establish a
  schedule that prioritizes services toward developments with affordable housing. The Town will forward the
  adopted Housing Element to local water and wastewater agencies to assist those agencies with prioritizing
  water and wastewater allocations.
  D.3 FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE
  Through the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, a Housing Opportunity Fund was established in 1992 to
  provide seed money for affordable housing developments or programs. Revenues are generated from in-lieu
  fees received from new commercial and residential developments. The Zoning Ordinance requires that
  money deposited into the Housing Opportunity Fund is used to increase and improve the supply of housing
  affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
  Money in the Housing Opportunity Fund will be used in accordance with the affordable housing priorities
  identified in the Housing Element and affordable housing implementation strategies. Such strategies include
  assisting other government entities, private organizations, or individuals with construction or rehabilitation, or
  providing subsidies for very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing.
  In the previous planning period, the Town contributed over $800,000 toward the development of the Arroyo
  Grande Villas, which the Town and Napa Valley Community Housing partnered to develop.
  In addition, the Town partnered with the NVCH in the development of Arroyo Grande Villas. The Town
  contributed funds toward the cost of development. In addition to lending money and providing funds from
  the Housing Opportunity Fund, the Town waived $524,000 in processing and building permit fees for the
  development of Arroyo Grande Villas and Hopper Creek Apartments, all of which provide affordable
  housing.

  E.          POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION
  Various interrelated factors can constrain the ability of private and public sectors to provide adequate housing
  and meet the housing needs for all economic sectors of the community. These factors include potential
  constraints that result from governmental policies or actions and potential non-governmental constraints that
  are generally driven by market conditions. Potential governmental constraints consist of land use controls,
  development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code enforcement, site improvement
  costs, development permits, and approval processing. Potential non-governmental constraints include land
  availability, land cost, construction costs, and availability of financing.
  E.1 POTENTIAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
  E.1.a Land Use Controls
  The Yountville General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and Design Ordinance regulate residential land use, lot
  sizes, density, and building size and type. To provide for a variety of housing types affordable to households
  at a range of income levels, the Town’s zoning regulations establish minimum densities, maximum lot and
  unit sizes, and mixed residential unit types.
  General Plan land use designations are implemented by zoning districts of the same name. Table 35 lists
  these designations/zones and describes the allowed density and general intent.

  Mobile Homes
  The MHP designation is intended to protect existing mobile homes from conversion to conventional types of
  housing. It is intended to reinforce the Town’s policy to provide affordable housing, retain its existing
  housing stock, and safeguard mobile homes from potential economic forces that could encourage their
  removal. Permitted use types are designated by the master development plan of each mobile home park with
  the MHP designation, which provides protection of mobile home units in the MHP zones. Growth is limited
  to 8 units per acre in the MHP zones, which does not constrain the development of mobile homes in the
  MHP zones.
  In addition to land within the MHP designation, mobile and manufactured homes are permitted in the A, RS,
  RM, and H districts.
  Second Units
  The Town recognizes the potential of second units as a source of affordable rental housing. Section 116.010
  of the Town’s Zoning Ordinance establishes standards for second unit construction. The Zoning Ordinance
  allows second units, attached or detached, on single-family residential lots in excess of 6,000 square feet in the
  RS, RM, and H districts. Unit sizes may be up to 600 square feet, 300 square feet of which is exempt from
  FAR requirements.
  One additional parking space is required for the second unit, as is 100 square feet of adjacent open space.
  Each second unit must have its own bathroom (with toilet, sink, and bath and/or shower) and kitchen (with
  sink and standard appliances). In keeping with state law, second units are approved ministerially and
  efficiency units and manufactured homes may be utilized as second units. The Town’s regulations for second
  units are consistent with state law and are not considered a constraint to second unit construction.
  Emergency Shelters
  Senate Bill (SB) 2 (2007) requires that all California jurisdictions allow emergency shelters by right in at least
  one zoning district and must show adequate vacant or underutilized land to accommodate the development
  of a shelter within the designated zone. An emergency shelter is defined as a shelter with minimal supportive
  services for homeless persons, with limited term occupancy not to exceed six months.
  The Town to amended zoning regulations to allow emergency shelters as a permitted use in the PF zone on
  September 16, 2014. The PF zone is appropriate for emergency shelters as they are close to transit and
  services. There is one vacant lot (10,000 square feet) located at the south end of Veteran’s Park which is
  located in the PF district. Development of an emergency shelter would be permitted by right on this site.
  The Town amended the Zoning Orinance to replace the homeless shelter use with emergency shelter, include
  a revised definition, and allow emergency shelters by right in the PF district.
  Transitional and Supportive Housing
  SB 2 also requires jurisdictions to allow transitional and supportive housing, subject only to the regulatory
  standards as those governing other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The Town amended
  the Zoning Ordinance on September 16, 2014 to add definitions for supportive housing and transitional
  housing, and treat these uses as residential uses, in compliance with SB 2.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                                JANUARY 2015

                       HOUSING ELEMENT
  Extremely Low-Income
  AB 2634 (2006) requires jurisdictions to quantify and analyze the existing and projected housing needs of
  extremely low-income households. Extremely low-income households are defined as those earning less than
  30 percent of the area median income. As reported in Table 10 in the Needs Assessment, approximately 9
  percent of Yountville households were extremely low-income, as of 2010. It is assumed that half of the
  Town’s very low-income RHNA will be extremely low-income households; thus this Housing Element plans
  for a need for housing appropriate for two additional extremely low-income households during the planning
  period.
  The Institute for Local Governments Housing Resource Center has identified that in most locations, single-
  room occupancy (SRO) residences are the lowest-cost type for permanent housing. The definition of an SRO
  varies in each jurisdiction; however, it is generally understood that an SRO project is a type of residential
  hotel offering low-cost long-term occupancy. Residents in SROs share common facilities, such as bathrooms
  and/or kitchens, which lowers development cost, thus providing housing at a rate affordable to lower-income
  households.
  In 2004, the Town updated the Zoning Ordinance to include a definition and development standards for
  congregate residences. The Town defines congregate residences as “rental housing with communal dining
  and/or bathroom facilities.” It is the intention that congregate residences will serve a similar purpose as SROs
  and provide affordable housing options for extremely low-income residences. Congregate housing also assists
  in providing affordable housing and support services for the elderly population. The Zoning Ordinance
  allows for the development of congregate residences in the PF and PC zones with a use permit.
  Through the actions described in Programs 17, 18, and 21, the Town will work to provide housing
  opportunities for extremely low-income households.
  Housing for Disabled Persons
  SB 520 (Chapter 671, Statutes of 2001) requires all local jurisdictions to undertake an analysis of
  governmental constraints to the development, improvement, and maintenance of housing for persons with
  disabilities and to include a program to remove constraints to, or provide reasonable accommodations for
  housing designed for occupancy by, or with supportive services for persons with disabilities.
  In 2004, the Town adopted revisions to the Zoning Ordinance to include a definition and development
  standards for residential care facilities. Residential care facilities provide 24-hour, non-medical care for six or
  fewer persons in need of services for sustaining the activities of daily living. The adopted 2004 revisions to
  the Zoning Ordinance allow the development of residential care facilities in the RS, RM, and H districts as a
  permitted use. The regulations governing the placement of residential care facilities are the same as those
  governing similar residential uses in each of the three districts, which comply with the regulations of SB 520.
  Housing for disabled persons could be constrained if additions or alterations (such as a new access ramp or
  an expansion to a bathroom or hallway) to an existing residence needed to encroach into a setback or would
  result in exceeding floor area limits. The Town amended the Zoning Ordinance to include a specific
  procedure for processing requests for reasonable accommodation on September 16, 2014.
  The Town utilizes the latest version of the California Building Code and other building-related codes, and has
  no amendments that would impact housing for disabled persons. The Town also follows requirements of
  Title 24 and those described in the California Disabled Accessibility Guidebook. The County of Napa

  enforces all of the provisions of those codes related to disabled access, though most such provisions apply to
  public buildings, rather than single-family and other residential uses.
  Agricultural Employee Housing
  The Zoning Ordinance does permit a variety of housing types in residential zones that typically best serve
  agricultural employees. Mobile homes, manufactured homes, and second units are permitted uses within
  residential zones in the town. Agricultural employees are often lower wage earners dependant on housing that
  is affordable. The permitted housing types within the town are suitable for meeting the affordability
  requirements of agricultural workers.
  Health and Safety Code 17021.6 requires that jurisdictions with land designated for agriculture allow for up to
  36 beds or 12 units as a single-family use for employee housing, and Health and Safety Code 17021.5 requires
  that jurisdictions allow employee housing with six or fewer persons as a single-family use type. The Town
  amended its Zoning Ordinance in compliance with these requirements on Sepetmebr 16, 2014.
  Residential Development Standards
  Residential development standards are intended to ensure that new development is orderly and compatible
  with existing land uses. This analysis of residential development standards identifies potential regulatory
  constraints to the development of housing for all income levels in the town. An analysis of housing density,
  lot size, floor area ratio, setbacks, open space provisions, and parking requirements is provided below.
  Residential standards in the RS and RM district represent the majority of residential standards in the Town’s
  Zoning Ordinance and are the basis for the analyses of each development standard.
  Housing Density
  Residential densities range from up to 7 units per acre in the RS zone to up to 10 units in the RM zone. The
  RM zone is intended to facilitate a mix of residential use types; thus a minimum of 50 percent of the site area
  of a project must be reserved for single-family development and 25 percent must be reserved for multi-family
  development. However, the conditions regulating a variety of use types and densities are broadened for RM
  parcels with an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO). Parcels in the RM zone with an AHO are permitted to
  be developed at up to 25 units per acre. In addition, RM parcels designated AHO may allocate less than 50
  percent for single-family development.
  The allowable density in each of the identified residential zones does not place a constraint on the
  development of housing for all income levels.
  Lot Size
  The RS and RM districts are intended to accommodate the majority share of new residential development and
  the H, MHP, and MPR districts are established residential districts that are generally built out.
  Single-Family Residential (RS)
  The minimum lot size allowed in the RS zone is 4,000 square feet and the maximum is 8,000 square feet.
  Floor area ratios (FAR) are established for lots in the RS zone, which regulate the percentage of each lot that
  is allowed for residential structures. FAR provisions are discussed in a subsequent analysis.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                                JANUARY 2015

                       HOUSING ELEMENT
  Mixed Residential (RM)
  The minimum lot size allowed in the RM district is 4,000 square feet and the maximum is 8,000 square feet.
  FAR regulations also dictate the allowable percentage of each lot that is allowed to contain a residential
  structure.
  The minimum and maximum lot sizes allowed do not constrain the development of housing for all income
  levels. FAR standards ultimately dictate the utilization lots are allowed to realize.
  Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
  FARs have been established for the residential zones throughout the town. The intent of FAR regulations is
  to prevent development from over-utilizing land and implement the Town’s goal of ensuring that growth is
  compatible with existing uses. The Town’s Design Ordinance establishes the maximum FAR allowed on lots
  zoned for residential development. The Design Ordinance also includes FAR bonuses for affordable housing
  and FAR exemptions.
  Lots of less than 8,000 square feet in the RS zone are allowed a FAR of 0.30 for living space and 0.35 for the
  gross building square footage (including garage). Lots greater than 8,000 square feet are allowed a maximum
  of 0.25 FAR for living space and 0.30 for the gross building square footage. In the RM district, the maximum
  FAR allowed is 0.25, except that with a FAR bonus, lots are allowed a FAR of up to 0.40 depending on the
  percentage of affordable units included.
  FAR Bonus for Affordable Housing
  The Design Ordinance provides incentives to builders constructing single-family projects on lots in the RM
  zone. The Town’s inclusionary housing program requires that a minimum of 15 percent of units in new
  developments with five or more units must be affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income
  households. Table 37 displays the maximum FAR bonus granted to developers based on the percentage of
  affordable units included in the project beyond the 15 percent required in the inclusionary program. The FAR
  bonus is a regulatory incentive that allows developers to provide affordable housing units beyond those
  required in the inclusionary program.

  FAR Exemptions
  The Design Ordinance permits a variety of structures and elements that are exempt from being considered in
  the FAR calculation. Up to 300 square feet of second residential units are exempt from consideration of FAR,
  which provides incentive for the construction of second residential units, which are often rented at levels
  affordable to lower-income households. Other types of exemptions provided do not directly promote or

  constrain the development of housing. Rather, the exemptions are established to allow construction of
  varying preferences representing housing demand. For example, swimming pools, basements, and interior
  staircases are exempt from FAR calculations.
  The Town’s FAR regulations do not constrain the development of housing for all income levels. In fact, the
  FAR bonus provision and second unit exemption promote the construction of affordable housing by
  providing cost savings to developers through regulatory controls.
  Setbacks and Open Space
  The Design Ordinance does not set minimum open space requirements for single-family residential units.
  However, duplexes are required to provide a minimum of 200 square feet of open space, and structures with
  three or more units are required to provide 100 square feet of open space for each residential unit. Open
  space requirements do not constrain the development of housing for all income levels.
  Table 38 provides a summary of setback requirements for the variety of residential use types allowed in the
  town. The setback requirements intend to promote orderly development. The size of residential structures are
  limited with a combination of FAR, lot size limits, and open space and setback requirements. Without such
  regulations, development and growth would likely not occur in an orderly manner.

                        HOUSING ELEMENT
  Provisions for Affordable Housing
  The intent of the affordable housing policy established in this section is to provide housing for people of all
  income levels who live and work in Yountville; however, its fulfillment depends on the initiative of the Town
  and the private efforts of developers and landowners.
  The basis of the affordable housing provision policy is inclusionary zoning and an incentive system that
  grants bonus dwelling units for providing affordable housing units within a development and a FAR bonus
  on single unit and multiple-family unit lots.
  Inclusionary Requirements
  The inclusionary zoning requirements of the Town provide that, for developments of five residential units or
  more, a minimum of 15 percent of the units must be affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income
  households. The inclusionary units must be approximately divided among the three income groups.
  To meet the demands of lower-income households at a range of sizes, inclusionary units must be provided in
  a range of number of bedrooms. No more than 25 percent of inclusionary units may be studios and at least
  25 percent of required units must have more than one bedroom. Regulating a variety of housing sizes restricts
  developers from fulfilling the inclusionary requirement by developing studio and single-bedroom units, which
  would not meet the demands of larger lower-income households.
  The Town’s inclusionary housing program also provides developers with alternatives to providing required
  units, including the donation of land to a nonprofit housing developer, constructing the units on another site,
  or a cash payment into the Town’s Housing Opportunity Fund.
  Density Bonus
  The Town has adopted provisions of the state density bonus law as described by California Government
  Code Sections 65915 and 65917. In addition, the Town offers local density bonus incentives to encourage the
  provision of housing affordable to lower-income households by allowing increases in density for projects that
  include 25 percent or more affordable housing units. Since the Town’s AHO density bonus provides for
  beyond the States density bonus provisions, applicants can use either the State’s density bonus or the Town’s
  AHO, but they can not be combined. Since applicants receive a greater bonus from the Town’s AHO, recent
  examples shown that applicant’s prefer this to the State density bonus program. The density bonuses shown
  in Table 40 apply to development proposals in sites with the AHO designation.

  FAR Bonus
  As previously presented in the discussion of FAR regulations in the Development Standards section of this
  Housing Element, the Town allows developers to increase the floor area of residential structures if the
  proposed number of affordable housing units exceeds the inclusionary requirement.
  Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO)
  The AHO allows for increased densities through the provisions set forth in the density bonus program,
  mainly through density bonuses. The AHO designation can be applied to any lot allowing residential
  development as long as the total acres in the town with an AHO designation do not exceed 5 (Program 13
  directs the Town to remove this limitation). Sites within the AHO are permitted to be developed at up to 25
  units per acre. The density bonuses granted in the AHO are based on the percentage of affordable units
  proposed.
  E.1.b Codes and Enforcement
  The Town follows the California Building Code (CBC) in its requirements for new construction, as adopted
  at a statewide level. There are no local amendments to the CBC for new construction. However, the Town
  has adopted a local amendment requiring fire sprinklers in certain remodels and additions to single-family
  residences.
  Yountville’s building code requirements are largely identical to those in most other cities. While it is
  recognized that building codes affect the cost of housing development by establishing structural and
  occupancy standards, the code as applied in Yountville is not a constraint to housing development.
  The Town enforces code compliance to enforce the Town’s zoning regulations and ensure compliance with
  use permits. Code compliance is primarily conducted in response to complaints.
  E.1.c Fees and Exactions
  Table 41 provides a comparison of fees for single-family and multi-family development in Yountville. The
  fees are presented as a per unit basis. The fees for multi-family development are $7,328.34 less per unit than
  single-family development. Thus, a four-unit multi-family project would cost $29,313.36 less than a project
  consisting of four single-family homes. In addition to the cost savings related to multi-family development,
  the Town has waived fees for many recent affordable housing projects, including the Arroyo Grande Villas.
  The Town’s development fees do not constitute a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
  In-lieu fees that may be paid as an option to satisfy inclusionary zoning regulations are not included in Table
  41. These fees are applicable only to projects with five or more units proposed, and the Town has generally
  chosen to require the provision of affordable units, rather than accepting an in-lieu fee. The impact of the
  inclusionary requirements has not been estimated for the market-rate units, but the Town believes the benefit
  of providing affordable units well exceeds the marginal additional cost per market-rate unit. The affordable
  housing provisions of the Zoning Ordinance also provide that all fees may be waived for affordable housing,
  further reducing those costs.

  E.1.d Processing and Permit Procedures
  The Town of Yountville requires design review of new homes, a process that generally takes one to two
  months. After Town review, building permits for single-family dwellings are obtained from the Building
  Department in two to six weeks, mainly driven by how quickly the developer responds to plan check
  comments. Design review for multi-family development could likely be completed within a similar time
  frame. Multi-family development projects must be reviewed by the Zoning & Design Review Board (ZDRB),
  followed by approval from the Town Council. Arroyo Grande Villas, Hopper Creek Apartments, and
  Ghirardi Place Affordable Housing are examples of recently approved multi-family developments.
  Design Review for Multi-Family Development
  The multi-family design standards are intended to ensure the compatibility of multi-family residential
  buildings with single-family houses in ways which encourage new development to provide a mix of residential
  building types.
  Multi-family development applications require approval from the Town Council. The approval process
  consists of three stages: 1) Concept, 2) Preliminary, and 3) Final.
            The Concept stage consists of one meeting with the Town Council in which the applicant and staff
             share information; thus there is no action taken and no findings necessary.
            The Preliminary stage consists of two meetings. The first is a review and comment meeting with the
             ZDRB and the second is a public hearing with the Town Council. ZDRB comments are reported
             and considered by the Town Council. The Town Council is responsible for approving applications in
             the Preliminary stage. Required Council findings for the Preliminary stage are defined in the Design
             Ordinance (Section 7.3.e) and include the identification of site layout, circulation, parking, setbacks,
             FAR, and open space.
            The Final stage also consists of a review and comment period by the ZDRB and a public hearing
             with the Town Council. The ZDRB reports comments to the Town Council. The Town Council is
             responsible for approving applications in the Final stage based on findings related to architectural
             design, building materials, building height, colors, landscape, and lighting.
JANUARY 2015                                                                             TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE
                                                                   56

                                                              HOUSING ELEMENT
  There are a total of five meetings in the multi-family design review process. Council review and decisions are
  informed by the review by the ZDRB, staff reports, and public testimony. The design review process
  typically takes two to four months.
  The process can be shortened into two stages to help expedite affordable housing projects. If an applicant
  presents a completed application, the Preliminary and Final stages can be combined into one meeting.
  The design review for multi-family development does not constrain the development of housing affordable to
  lower-income households. It is the intent of the review to ensure compatibility of multi-family residential
  buildings with single-family homes, which encourages new multi-family development and provides a mix of
  residential use types.
  E.1.e On- and Off-Site Improvements
  To maintain its rural character and ensure that new development does not adversely impact existing
  neighborhoods, the Town of Yountville imposes basic standards for on- and off-site improvements. The
  Town requires only those improvements necessitated by the development. Typical improvements include
  storm drainage features, sewer and water connections, utility connections, water conservation measures, and
  landscaping.
  The Town Structure chapters of the General Plan and Design Ordinance provide that the alignment of streets
  is conceptual and that the Town Council may approve varied alignments upon review of proposed new
  development. Providing the Town Council with discretion for approving new street alignments allows
  flexibility to developers by not constraining the possibility of new development to specific street alignments.
  E.2 NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
  E.2.a Land Costs
  Yountville’s growth is limited by the fact that the town is surrounded by prime agricultural land and the town
  has no sphere of influence outside its corporate limits. Measure J, adopted by Napa County voters in the late
  1990s, requires voter approval for any reclassification or subdivision of agricultural land. Such approval is
  unlikely to be given for any land adjacent to the town’s boundaries.
  Land costs in the Bay Area have escalated at an extremely rapid rate since the mid-1990s. Whereas the price
  of finished lots used to comprise about one-quarter of the total cost of a house, the land cost now frequently
  exceeds the cost of even a newly constructed home on the lot. This cost increase has an obvious adverse
  effect on the ability of households, particularly low- and moderate-income households, to pay for housing.
  Few properties have been sold or were listed for sale in early 2014. Land in the Yountville area was listed
  (Loopnet.com) at a wide range of prices, from $376,569 to $800,000 per acre.
  E.2.b Construction Costs
  Construction cost increases, like increases in land cost, have raised the cost of housing and have affected the
  ability of consumers to pay for housing. Construction cost increases are due to the cost of materials, labor,
  and higher government-imposed standards (e.g., seismic and energy conservation requirements). As noted in
  the analysis of affordable units at risk of converting to market rate, construction costs for the recent Arroyo
  Grande Villas project were estimated at $262 per square foot.
TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE                                                                               JANUARY 2015
                                                           57

                          HOUSING ELEMENT
  Estimates can vary greatly based on assumptions and variables. Based on information from Building-cost.net,
  construction costs in 2013 for a single-family home in Yountville were estimated to begin at approximately
  $200 per square foot (on the low end). The estimate was based on a 1,300-square-foot, single-story, single-
  family home. The estimate includes building materials, labor, and the contractor’s markup. Though the
  valuation is based on basic building materials, many of the homes in Napa County are built at considerably
  higher costs to include high-quality building materials and interior finishes.
  E.2.c Availability of Financing
  The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a home affects the
  availability and affordability of housing. Higher interest rates reduce the buying power of potential
  homebuyers and may render a housing project that could have been developed at lower interest rates
  infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates increase.
  Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products, including graduated
  mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower
  initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans. However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for
  low- and moderate-income households that live on tight budgets. In addition, the availability of variable rate
  mortgages has declined in the last few years due to greater regulation of housing lending markets. Variable
  rate mortgages may allow lower-income households to enter into homeownership, but there is a definite risk
  of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the fixed interest
  rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable interest rates.
  Table 42 illustrates interest rates as of January 2013. The table presents both the interest rate and annual
  percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an amount of
  money which is paid for its use for a specified time, and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses
  the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and
  mortgage insurance and is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest rate alone.
  However, the loan's interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

  F.       OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
  The Town of Yountville recognizes the need for greater resource efficiency in existing dwelling units as well
  as new construction. The federal and state government provide incentives, such as rebates and tax benefits,
  for incorporating energy-saving devices into residential units. Examples include the installation of energy-
  efficient appliances or providing solar panels for water heating. Assistance with identifying upgrade
  opportunities and financial assistance is available through Sustainable Napa County
  (www.sustainablenapacounty.org) and Energy Upgrade California (energyupgradeca.org).
  Additionally, Title 24 of the California Building Standards Code requires that all new residential units (and
  additions) be designed to comply with relatively stringent energy-efficiency standards. These standards
  address windows, insulation, and weather stripping, as well as heating and cooling system efficiencies. For
  subdivisions and larger projects, an environmental review is generally required, in compliance with the
  California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The review must include an evaluation of energy and
  infrastructure impacts and suggest measures to minimize any negative impacts.
  In addition to energy conservation, the Town recognizes the need to improve water use efficiency in
  residential development. The Town adopted the California Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance and
  is in the process of expanding its recycled water distribution system. The expansion project will minimize
  discharge to the Napa River and reduce the use of local and imported water.
  The Town will continue to require tree planting for residential projects to provide cooling in the summer
  (Program 35) and continue to implement CalGreen standards and the Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance
  to encourage resource efficiency in residential projects (Program 36).
  To improve financing options for residential energy and water efficiency projects, the Town opted in to the
  Home Energy Renovation Program Opportunity (HERO) program. The program provides low-cost loans
  for approved improvement projects. It is anticipated that financing through HERO will be available by late
  summer 2014.
  G.       GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
  State law requires that “the general plan elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally
  consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The purpose of requiring internal consistency is to avoid
  policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future maintenance, improvement and development of
  housing within the Town.
  All elements of the Town of Yountville General Plan, including the goals, policies, and implementation
  measures have been reviewed for their internal consistency with this Housing Element. In addition, the Town
  of Yountville Zoning and Design Ordinances have been reviewed for compatibility with this Housing
  Element’s goals, policies, and implementation measures. The Town will continue to review the General Plan,
  Zoning Ordinance, and Design Ordinance for internal consistency as amendments are proposed and
  adopted.

  H.        HOUSING OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
  The Town will continue to pursue policies and programs that increase affordable housing opportunities,
  while ensuring that new development is consistent with the character of the community and does not result in
  adverse impacts on the environment. Policies include inclusionary housing requirements, as well as
  development incentives for the provision of affordable housing. The Town will continue to participate pro-
  actively in the production of affordable housing.
  The programs outlined below indicate the entity that is primarily responsible for implementation, the
  anticipated date for completion and, for new programs and those requiring Town contributions, the expected
  source of funding. Following the goals, objectives, policies, and programs, Table 43 summarizes quantified
  objectives for the 2015–2023 planning period.
  H.1 TOWN CHARACTER
  Objective
  1. Preserve the rural, small-town character and scale of Yountville.
  Policies
  1.1 Establish residential densities that continue to allow the development of single-family detached houses.
  1.2 Continue to limit maximum lot sizes and unit sizes in single-family residential areas.
  1.3 Encourage the design of multi-family units to integrate with the Town’s character.
  1.4 Ensure that multi-family housing units for workforce housing are dispersed throughout the community.
  1.5 Protect the Town’s agricultural properties.
  Program 1:        Continue to create a range of use types in the mixed residential (RM) zoning district.
  Description:      Sites zoned for mixed residential use are currently assigned a density range of 8 to 10 units
                    per acre. The Town’s Zoning Ordinance intends to create a mix of residential use types in
                    the RM zone; thus a minimum of 50 percent of the site area of a project must be reserved
                    for single-family development and 25 percent must be reserved for multi-family
                    development except under the following conditions:
                        The project site is subject to the Affordable Housing Overlay and a lower percentage is
                         required to accommodate the proposed number of affordable units; or,
                        The project has received a density bonus under the state density bonus program and a
                         lower percentage is required to accommodate the proposed number of affordable units.
                    Responsibility:            Planning Department, Town Council
                    Time Frame:                Ongoing; implemented as projects are proposed through the
                                               Planning Department.
                    Funding:                   General Fund
  Program 2:        Retain Zoning Ordinance provisions limiting single-family lot sizes and residence sizes.
JANUARY 2015                                                                          TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE

                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
  Description: The Town’s regulations limit lot sizes to a maximum of 8,000 square feet in the RS (single-
               family), RM (mixed residential), and H (old town historic) zones. Floor area ratios are
               established for all uses, such that house sizes are kept relatively small, with potential
               increases dependent on providing additional affordable housing units. This program will
               maintain those limitations for single-family residences and recognize existing developed lots
               that are brought into closer conformance.
               Responsibility:            Planning Department, Town Council
               Time Frame:                Ongoing; implemented as projects are proposed.
               Funding:                   General Fund
  Program 3:   Continue to review the design of proposed multi-family development and, when feasible,
               streamline the process to approve affordable housing projects.
  Description: The Town’s review process requires design review approval of proposed developments by
               the Zoning & Design Review Board and the Town Council, subject to findings that ensure
               compatibility with the community. Typically this involves a three-stage process and a total of
               five meetings throughout the multi-family design review process. The Town is committed to
               allowing a shortened process to help expedite affordable housing projects and will work with
               applicants to combine stages of the review process to help facilitate an expedited review.
               Additionally, the Town will continue to offer applicants assistance with the application
               process prior to the review process.

               Time Frame:                Ongoing; implemented as projects are proposed.
               Funding:                   General Fund
  Program 4:   Continue to implement the Town’s inclusionary housing program and consider
               modifications to the program to provide greater flexibility in the payment of in-lieu fees and
               add a minimum length of term requirement on the affordable units.
  Description: The Town’s inclusionary zoning requirements mandate that, for a project of five or more
               units, a minimum of 15 percent of the units must be designated for housing affordable to
               very low-, low- and moderate-income households. The affordable units must be evenly
               divided between very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. It also requires that a
               mix of household sizes be provided (e.g., no more than 50 percent of the units should be
               studios, and at least 20 percent should have two or three bedrooms). Floor area ratio
               bonuses are allowed if an increased percentage of affordable units is provided, but are
               adjusted to relate not only to the percentage of affordable units, but also to the number of
               affordable units constructed.
               In general, it is intended that such units will be provided on-site as part of the proposed
               project. Fees in lieu of construction are only considered when an off-site affordable housing
               project has been approved and when the fees would be sufficient to allow construction of an
               equivalent number of affordable units (in addition to those required for the receiver site).
               The Town will consider revising the requirements to allow greater flexibility in the payment
               of in-lieu fees. This will allow the Town to build the Housing Opportunity Fund to make
               funds available for use in the preservation of existing affordable units.

                   Funding:                   General Fund
  Program 5:       Continue to retain the current agricultural (A) zoning on the Pelissa property (APN 31-120-
                   05).
  Description:     This 32.5-acre parcel is in active vineyard use and is intended to remain as such throughout
                   the planning period and beyond. The site forms an appropriate transition between the more
                   urban town uses and the agricultural uses in the county.

  H.2 PROMOTION OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
  Objective
  2. Promote the development of infrastructure and regulations that accommodate increased residential
      development of all housing types.
  Policies
  2.1 Ensure that public services, particularly for sewage disposal and water supply, are adequate to
      accommodate potential housing increases.
  2.2 Require new development to build at no less than the minimum number of dwelling units prescribed by
      the Town Structure Chapter of the General Plan.
  2.3 Allow flexibility in the alignment of future streets and extensions.
  Program 6:       The Town shall continue to ensure adequate water capacity for new residential projects.
  Description:     The Town currently has a long-term agreement with California Department of Veterans
                   Affairs (CDVA) to supply water from the Rector Reservoir Water Treatment Plant, which is
                   owned and operated by the CDVA. The Town will continue to require water-conserving
                   fixtures in new construction and other mitigation measures to compensate for new demand.
                   The amount of water requested is expected to be adequate to supply all new growth,
                   including all potential affordable housing units outlined in the Housing Element. In
                   accordance with SB 1087, the Town will grant priority capacity allocation to affordable
                   projects.

  Program 8:      The Town will maintain an inventory of sites available and appropriate for residential
                  development for households at all income levels.
  Description:    To ensure that adequate sites are available through the planning period to meet the Town’s
                  Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), the Town will continue to maintain an
                  inventory of potential residential development sites. In keeping with state “no net loss”
                  provisions (Government Code Section 65863), if development projects are approved at
                  densities lower than anticipated in the sites inventory, the Town will evaluate the availability
                  of sites appropriate for lower-income housing and, if necessary, rezone sufficient sites to
                  accommodate the RHNA.

                    25 percent of the units are affordable to very low- or low-income households. The allowed
                    density increases, on a sliding scale, from 20 units per acre up to a maximum of 25 units per
                    acre if 100 percent of the units are affordable. The overlay may be applied to appropriate
                    portions of each site to be more precisely determined in conjunction with site analyses with
                    affordable housing developers and participating property owners. Incentives included with
                    the overlay, similar to those for other affordable units, include floor area ratio bonuses,
                    expedited processing, and reduced or waived permit fees.
                    Currently, the maximum number of acres permitted to have the overlay is 5. In order to
                    ensure that developers have the opportunity to take advantage of the incentives of the
                    overlay, the Town will remove the 5-acre limitation, allowing more opportunity for
                    affordable housing development.

  Description: The Town will work with NVCH and other interested affordable housing developers to seek
               opportunities to provide additional affordable units in Yountville. This may involve a variety
               of opportunities, including construction of a new project or conversion of existing market-
               rate units to affordable housing. The Town will apply for funding and/or partner with
               NVCH to apply for funding to assist with the development of new units affordable to
               extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. As appropriate, the
               Town will prioritize funding for the development of housing affordable to extremely low-
               income households.
               To further this objective, the Town will annually provide information about potential
               affordable housing overlay sites and requirements to a minimum of five affordable housing
               developers, and will solicit their interest in identifying a potential project or projects on those
               sites, along with a financial contribution by the Town. Housing developers will be identified
               in consultation with the HACN and the California Department of Housing and Community
               Development.
               Responsibility:            Planning Department, Town Council
               Time Frame:                Provide site information annually; apply for funding annually, or as
                                          potential projects are proposed.
               Funding:                   General Fund, Housing Opportunity Fund
  Program 18:  Contribute funding from the Town’s Housing Opportunity Fund to create or assist with the
               provision of affordable housing, including a commitment of seed money for an affordable
               housing project.
  Description: The Town will continue to seek ways to use the Housing Opportunity Fund to support the
               development of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing units.
               Primary among these efforts is a commitment to contribute seed funding to support
               development of an affordable housing project by a nonprofit housing developer. Remaining
               funds may be used to provide for down payment assistance (silent second mortgages) for
               new homeowners, for use with self-help projects, and with cooperative efforts with private
               developers to create affordable housing. The Town will also continue to contribute to
               HACN programs through the Joint Powers Agreement.
               Responsibility:            Planning Department, Town Council, Town Manager
               Time Frame:                Annually develop a priority list for the use of Housing Opportunity
                                          Funds; consider funding proposals as they are received.
               Funding:                   Housing Opportunity Fund
  Program 19:  The Town will annually review permit fees and review processes to minimize costs to
               construct affordable housing units.
  Description: The Town will reduce the per-unit cost of multi-family development and reduce or eliminate
               fees for affordable housing units on a project-by-project basis. In particular, design review
               fees for affordable units will be waived, and impact fees for water and sewer connections will
               be evaluated to assess whether a reduced fee for smaller units is appropriate. Other fees may
               be waived for affordable units at the time of the application to the Town. The design review
               process provides for expedited processing for projects that propose 20 percent or more of
               the total units to be affordable to very low- and low-income households.

  H.5 COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
  Objective
  5. Optimize opportunities for residential development, but allow for mixed-use and commercial
      development in appropriate areas, subject to providing for their fair share of the Town’s housing needs.
  Policies
  5.1 Require developers of nonresidential projects to assume responsibility for a share of the workforce
      housing needs generated by such development.
  5.2 Provide enhanced opportunities for mixed residential and commercial uses on commercial sites.
  5.3 Where residential land is to be converted to commercial use, ensure that existing dwelling units and
      affordable housing opportunities lost due to zoning reclassifications are mitigated and that workforce
      housing for new employees is provided by the developer, with assistance from the Town.
  Program 20:     Maintain standards for residential development in commercial zones, including evaluation of
                  floor area ratio (FAR) incentives.
  Description:    The Town currently allows residential development on commercial parcels and provides a
                  0.15 FAR increase for mixed-use projects. This program evaluates the various standards
                  applicable to mixed use on commercial sites, with an emphasis on potential increases in FAR
                  and/or to allow rezoning of a portion of a site with an Affordable Housing Overlay to
                  accommodate affordable housing units.
                  Responsibility:        Planning Department, Town Council
                  Time Frame:            Ongoing; as projects are proposed through the Planning Department.
                  Funding:               General Fund
  Program 21:     Where the conversion of residentially zoned land to commercial uses is permitted, require
                  provisions for adequate affordable housing to compensate for the loss of residential units.
  Description:    Where conversion is allowed, the Town will work with individual property owners to require
                  an affordable housing component that attempts to achieve the goal of providing affordable
                  housing units equivalent to: 1) the minimum affordable units that would have been required
                  of residential development on the site, plus 2) housing units for one-half of the number of
                  expected full-time equivalent jobs generated by the commercial use. This would result in an
                  increase in the number of affordable units on the site (minimum required for residential plus
                  50 percent of jobs created), though the total units on the site would be reduced. Property
                  owners may satisfy this requirement through on-site construction, off-site construction as
                  part of another development project, or through the payment of fees in-lieu of construction.
                  Flexibility will also be provided to consider single-room occupancy (SRO) housing for
                  commercial developments, and a ratio of SRO housing unit equivalency will be established.
JANUARY 2015                                                                         TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE

                   The Town may participate in the development of the affordable housing component of the
                   project by contributing land, construction costs, or financial assistance. The Town will
                   evaluate funding options for its commitment to include, but not be limited to, dedicating
                   sales tax or transient-occupancy tax from the development to affordable housing, soliciting
                   the assistance of nonprofit affordable housing developers, and/or providing financing
                   contributions from the Housing Opportunity Fund.

  I.        QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
  Based on the goals, policies, and programs outlined in the Housing Element and findings from the Housing
  Needs Assessment, the objectives shown in Table 43 represent a reasonable expectation of the maximum
  number of new housing units that will be developed, rehabilitated, or conserved and the number of
  households that will be assisted over the 8.5-year planning period. New construction goals are aligned with
  the RHNA. Rehabilitation goals are based on proposed rehabilitation loan programs to be administered
  through the HACN. The preservation goal is based on the four affordable units at risk of converting to
  market rate during the planning period.
