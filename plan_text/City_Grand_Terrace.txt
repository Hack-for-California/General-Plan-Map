2.0 LAND USE ELEMENT
2.1     INTRODUCTION
2.1.1 Purpose and Function
The Land Use Element is often considered the
most critical element of a General Plan. It
provides overall guidance to all properties
within the City through the distribution of
land uses, by type, including residential,
commercial, industrial, institutional, and open
space. The Land Use Element identifies each
land use designation's location and intensity,
and its interrelationship with other land uses.
The Land Use Element translates the City's long range vision for development in the City and
provides a Land Use Plan, goals, policies, and implementation programs to achieve that vision.
In order to provide guidance for the physical development of the City, the Land Use Element
must take into consideration the other elements of the General Plan that identify constraints or
opportunities for the development of individual properties. Issues that must be considered
include transportation systems, regional drainage, utilities, and geographic and geologic
constraints, among others.
2.1.2 Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
City Zoning Code
The City of Grand Terrace Zoning Code sets forth the City's standards, guidelines, and
procedures relating to the development and maintenance of all land uses within the City. These
regulations are intended to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan while being
consistent with the designations of the Land Use Plan. They are intended to protect the physical,
social, and economic stability of City residents and businesses and their property; reduce or
eliminate hazards to the public; and enhance the City's physical, social, and economic advantages
through comprehensive land use and resource planning.
Barton Road Specific Plan and Other Specific Plans
The Barton Road Specific Plan serves as the zoning code for most properties fronting along or
directly related to Barton Road. It is intended to provide guidance for the development of
predominantly commercial property along the primary transportation corridor through the City.
Since incorporation, the City has approved approximately 15 project-oriented Specific Plans.
The locations of the Barton Road Specific Plan and other Specific Plans are identified on Exhibit
                                                 II-1

City of Colton General Plan
The City of Colton borders Grand Terrace to the north, east, and west. The area west of
Interstate 215 includes pockets of Grand Terrace property intermingled with pockets of Colton
property. As such, the City of Grand Terrace must carefully monitor development and land uses
in the City of Colton adjacent to Grand Terrace. Development in adjacent areas of Colton have
the opportunity to create land use compatibility conflicts, generate traffic problems within Grand
Terrace, and potentially generate environmental hazards that could impact Grand Terrace
residents. Review of the Colton General Plan offers Grand Terrace the opportunity to plan
accordingly and cooperate with Colton to ensure land use compatibility, improve efficiencies in
public services, and mitigate potential environmental impacts generated by future development.
County of Riverside General Plan
The County of Riverside's unincorporated community of Highgrove lies immediately south of
Grand Terrace. This area is projected to experience significant future growth that could
potentially impact Grand Terrace in a similar manner as the City of Colton. Careful review and
monitoring of development within this area will again allow Grand Terrace to plan accordingly
and cooperate with Riverside County to ensure land use compatibility, improve efficiencies in
public services, and mitigate potential environmental impacts generated by future development.
Sphere of Influence
The Sphere of Influence of the City of Grand Terrace encompasses its current City limit
boundaries. It lies adjacent to the City of Colton to the north, east, and west. The County of
Riverside lies immediately to the south. There are no opportunities to annex adjacent
unincorporated San Bernardino County lands.
2.1.3 Relationship to Other Elements
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of all the General Plan's elements. Since it
governs how land is used throughout the City, virtually all issues and policies contained in other
elements relate to the decisions to be made by the Land Use Element.
Examples of these relationships include the need to provide a circulation system to allow
residents and workers to travel between land uses, and to ensure that the street system is
adequate to serve intended lands uses. Residential uses must be protected from incompatible
uses that could generate significant noise, air pollution or other hazards that might impact the
residents. All land uses involving structures must be protected from man-made and natural
hazards such as flooding, fires, and seismic events.

                                                                             Resolution No. 2010-10

2.2     EXISTING CONDITIONS
Grand Terrace is predominantly a residential community. The City was formerly an
unincorporated bedroom community surrounded by the City of Colton. Predominant commercial
and industrial activities focused along regional transportation corridors in other areas of Colton
leaving Grand Terrace to primarily develop as a single family residential community. Since the
majority of the community is located on the west side of Blue Mountain, the terrain offered
scenic views that attracted residents while making large scale development of commercial and
industrial uses more difficult.
The majority of the remaining undeveloped land is located on Blue Mountain, in the Santa Ana
River floodplain, or adjacent to the I-215 Freeway.
Table 2.1 summarizes existing land use categories, by acreage, as noted in the existing City
General Plan. As illustrated, 54 percent of all land within the City limits is designated for
residential uses.

2.4    LAND USE PLAN
2.4.1 Land Use Map
As required by State law, the General Plan must identify land use designations and permitted
development intensities. General plans must also provide a diagram indicating the locations of
each land use type. These components are included in this section of the Land Use Element.
Exhibit 2-2 presents the Land Use Map that identifies the specific land use designation of
individual parcels throughout the City. Table 2.2 provides a general breakdown of acreage by
land use designation and its percentage of total area within the City.

2.4.2 Land Use Designations
Land use designations are provided in order to define the amount, type, and nature of future
development that will be allowed in a given location in the City. The following section defines
each land use designation shown on the Land Use Plan and provides its density range and
general development standards required in accordance with State law.
Each land use designation is typically implemented by a defined set of zoning designations
included in the City's Zoning Code. The Zoning Code contains detailed regulations relating to
permitted and conditional uses allowed within each zone, site development standards, and
performance criteria that serve to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan.
Table 2.3 provides a description of each land use designation of the Land Use Plan.

RESIDENTIAL
Hillside Low Density Residential  The hillside areas of Blue Mountain located at the far eastern edge of
(HLDR)                            the City are considered a natural resource that requires special
Maximum Density – 1 dwelling      consideration to protect the scenic views and environmental
unit per gross acre               resources of the mountain. Any development proposed within the
                                  Hillside designation will require special evaluation of all
                                  environmental issues and must include provisions for the protection
                                  of all natural resources within the area. Properties within the
                                  designated areas must demonstrate that building pads and streets can
                                  be graded with minimal impact to the hillside and views, and that
                                  adequate utilities and public services, including drainage, domestic
                                  water, sanitary sewer, fire protection can be provided. Proposed
                                  developments within this area shall be required to prepare a Specific
                                  Plan. Clustered development that protects sensitive slopes and
                                  natural resources shall be strongly encouraged.
Low Density Residential (LDR)     The Low Density Residential designation limits land uses to single
Density Range - 0 to 5 dwelling   family detached residential units and mobile homes subject to the
units per gross acre              applicable General Plan policies and Zoning Code provisions. This
                                  designation encompasses the majority of property within the City and
                                  is largely associated with existing housing developments throughout
                                  the City.
Medium Density Residential        The Medium Density Residential designation include both single
(MDR)                             family detached and multiple family attached developments.
Density Range – 6 to 12 dwelling  Permitted uses within these areas may include small lot single family
units per gross acre.             developments or attached multi-family developments including
                                  townhomes, condominiums, and apartments. Mobile home
                                  developments are also permitted.
                                  A density bonus may be applied to a project pursuant to the density
                                  bonus provisions of Chapter 4.3 of the California Government Code
Medium High Density               The Medium High Density Residential designation is reserved for
Residential (MHDR)                affordable housing projects. Any project proposed for the MHDR
Maximum Density - 20 dwelling     designation shall be required to submit a Specific Plan that provides
units per gross acre              detailed information regarding the design and benefits of the
                                  proposed project that warrants the density range of the MHDR
                                  designation.
COMMERCIAL
General Commercial (GC)           This designation is primarily located along Barton Road and near the
                                  I-215 Freeway. It provides for general commercial uses to serve the
                                  retail and service needs of the community.
Office Commercial (OC)            Office commercial uses are used as a buffer between residential areas
                                  and general commercial areas. The properties designated for Office
                                  Commercial uses are primarily located along Barton Road east of
                                                  II-12

                              Permitted uses may include office/administrative uses and support
                              retail and service commercial uses
INDUSTRIAL
Light Industrial (LI)         Permitted uses for properties designated as Light Industrial include
                              those uses that can be made compatible with other surrounding uses
                              within the City regarding noise, dust, odors, vibration, glare, air
                              quality, traffic, aesthetics, and hazardous materials. Typical uses
                              may include light manufacturing and assembly, small scale
                              warehousing and distribution, research and development, and
                              administrative and service types of uses.
Floodplain Industrial (FI)    Properties designated with the Floodplain Industrial designation
                              experience the potential for severe flooding resulting from their
                              proximity to the Santa Ana River. Properties within this designation
                              are planned for ultimate development as light industrial, non-
                              polluting uses similar to the Light Industrial designation. Proposed
                              developments must demonstrate that adequate measures can be
                              implemented to ensure that the proposed use is effectively protected
                              from identified flood hazards.
                              Presently, parcels within this area are largely undeveloped or
                              developed as rural residential land uses. It is anticipated that buildout
                              of this area will occur over a long period of time. During this
                              buildout period, existing residential uses shall be permitted and
                              regulated under the requirements of the Low Density Residential land
                              use designation. Light agricultural uses shall be permitted including
                              the keeping of animals with the approval of an Agricultural Overlay
                              zoning designation.
INSTITUTIONAL
Public (P)                    Public uses may include schools, parks, the City Hall, City
                              maintenance facilities and facilities owned and operated by public
                              utilities.
OPEN SPACE
Hillside Open Space (OS)      Properties designated as Hillside Open Space are those that should
                              not be developed as urban land uses due to environmental resources,
                              environmental constraints or scenic resources. These are primarily
                              located along the western and northern slopes of Blue Mountain.
                              Properties designated as Hillside Open Space shall be retained in
                              their natural condition and used as either natural open space or
                              parkland. They may be either publicly or privately owned.

MIXED USE
Mixed Use (MU)                    Properties designated as mixed use are intended to be developed with
                                  multiple uses on a single site. This may include residential,
                                  commercial, business park, open space, and recreational uses.
                                  Compatible uses may be placed horizontally or vertically on the site.
                                  All Mixed Use projects shall be required to submit a Specific Plan or
                                  Planned Development that demonstrates compatibility between the
                                  proposed uses as well as buffering from adjacent properties, if
                                  warranted. Densities may not exceed those of the residential,
                                  commercial and industrial designations of the General Plan and
                                  zoning.
2.4.3 Buildout Analysis
Table 2.4 presents an analysis of residentially designated land and the total number of estimated
dwelling units and population at ultimate buildout. As illustrated, at ultimate development of the
residential component of the Plan, the City population is estimated to be approximately 15,747.
These estimates are based upon the total acreage by land use type, an average probable density in
dwelling units per acre, and the City’s current average population per household. The analysis
also assumes that certain properties with higher density designations that are currently
underutilized would be redeveloped to the average designation’s density.
Non-residential land uses comprise approximately 41 percent of all land within the City and
include employee generating commercial and industrial property as well as open space lands.
Table 2.5 summarizes the build out of non-residential uses and their potential employment
generation. As illustrated, at buildout, a total approximately 11,450 jobs may be available within
the City.

                  1        Current. Action already implemented.
                  2        Urgent. Action should be undertaken within the next
                           fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to
                           the City.
                  3        Important. Action should be taken in the near future.
                           It may be necessary for the completion of other
                           actions.
                  4        Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                           of an existing action or program. It requires no
                           further action to implement.
                  5        Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but
                           does not require short term implementation or may
                           require other actions to be taken first.
                  6        Optional. Action has a relatively low priority, but is
                           desirable. It is not critical to other actions.

3.0 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
3.1     INTRODUCTION
As development occurs within the City of Grand Terrace and in surrounding communities, traffic
on the City’s roadway network will also increase. In order to protect the City’s character and to
ensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods, it is essential to carefully plan the
City’s transportation systems. The Circulation Element is designed to address the current
transportation issues of the City and those anticipated as the City and surrounding communities
continue to grow. The Circulation Element must take into consideration land uses as designated
in the City’s Land Use Element as well as the Land Use Elements of surrounding cities and
counties. The Circulation Element provides overall goals for the City’s transportation system as
well as specific policies and implementation measures designed to maintain the flow of people
and goods within and through the City. California Government Code Section 65302(b) states
that the General Plan shall include the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
thoroughfares, transportation routes terminals, and other public utilities and facilities.
3.1.1 Related Plans and Programs
The local street system is directly connected to those of other cities as well as the regional
highway network. Therefore, there is a strong demand for coordination between Grand Terrace
and surrounding jurisdictions when planning the circulation system. Regional agencies that
directly affect circulation planning for the City of Grand Terrace include the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG), the San Bernardino County Association of Governments
(SANBAG), and the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS). In addition, the
City circulation system is influenced by surrounding communities including the City of Colton,
County of San Bernardino, City of Riverside, and County of Riverside. Transportation planning
must also be coordinated as required in California Government Code Section 65080(a) and in
Section 134, Title 23 of the United States Code,
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has adopted DESTINATION
2030, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for the six-county region of Southern California
including Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County, Riverside County,
Ventura County, and Imperial County. The RTP is a regional plan designed to improve the
balance between current and future land uses and the transportation system serving them. The
RTP must be reviewed and updated on a three year cycle.
DESTINATION 2030 is a comprehensive transportation plan that evaluates all forms of
transportation throughout the region. The Plan provides the basic policy and implementation
program framework for the long term development and maintenance of the regional
transportation system. Any transportation improvement that receives funding from the Federal
or State government must be included in the RTP.

3.1.2 Relationship to Other Elements
The Circulation Element is directly related to the Land Use, Safety, Open Space, and
Conservation, and Noise Elements of the General Plan through the following relationships:
    •    The transportation system of the City is a key determinant in assessing land use
         development patterns. The transportation system must accommodate existing and
         planned land uses that allow the efficient and safe movement of people, goods and
         services to designated land uses. Concurrently, sensitive land uses must be protected
         from potential impacts associated with major travel corridors such as major highways,
         rail lines, and airports. These issues must be addressed in the Land Use Element.
    •    The City’s transportation system must be designed to address community facilities and
         services including police and fire protection, utility providers, and educational facilities.
         These issues must be addressed in the Land Use and Safety Elements.
    •    Transportation systems are a primary generator of air pollution. Traffic congestion due to
         congested arterials or at-grade rail crossings increase vehicle idle times thus generating
         additional emissions. These issues must be addressed in the Open Space and
         Conservation and Safety Elements.
    •    Transportation systems are a major source of mobile noise. Noise contours for arterial
         highways and rail lines shape the goals and policies of the Noise Element.
3.2      EXISTING CONDITIONS
3.2.1 Road System
As illustrated in Exhibit 3-1, there
are approximately 36 miles of City-
maintained public streets within the
City of Grand Terrace. The
majority of these streets are
improved two-lane local streets
serving residential neighborhoods.
These local streets are connected via
designated collector streets to a
backbone network of arterial streets
that move traffic between
neighborhoods, to commercial and
industrial areas, and out of the City
and onto the regional highway
system. The primary east/west
arterial is Barton Road. This four-
                                                   III-2

                                                                              Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                    Circulation Element
lane arterial connects the City’s downtown with I-215, to the west, and Washington Street in the
City of Colton to the east. Barton Road also serves as an alternative route for commuter traffic
from cities east of Grand Terrace who wish to avoid the I-215/I-10 interchange during peak
hours resulting in peak hour congestion.
The primary north/south arterial is Mount Vernon Avenue. This four-lane arterial connects
Riverside County to the south and connects with the I-215 at the Washington Street interchange
to the north. Peak hour congestion due to external commuter traffic is similar to that experienced
on Barton Road.

3.2.2 Bikeways
The City of Grand Terrace maintains a
network of Class 2 and Class 3 bikeways.
Exhibit 3-2 illustrates the existing and
proposed bikeway system. As illustrated,
bikeways are proposed for all arterial
streets and connect residential
neighborhoods to schools, parks, and retail
centers.
3.2.3 Railroads
Although Grand Terrace does not have
direct access to Metrolink or other
passenger rail services, two regional
railroads pass through the City. A main line of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad passes
along the west side of the City. An industrial service line of the Union Pacific Railroad parallels
the Burlington Northern line to the immediate east. Both lines cross Main Street at “at-grade”
crossings. The only other “at-grade crossing is at Pico Street on the Union Pacific line. A
Metrolink line parallels the Burlington Northern main line.
3.2.4 Mass Transit
The City of Grand Terrace supports an efficient public transportation system to serve City
residents. The City participates in the OmniTrans public transit system. OmniTrans operates
public bus service throughout the San Bernardino urban area. Currently, there are no scheduled
bus routes operated by OmniTrans within the City; however, Omnitrans contracts with Riverside
Transit Agency to provide service within the City. The Riverside Transit Authority operates
Route 25, which runs through the City along Michigan Street and Barton Road connecting
downtown Riverside to the Jerry Pettis Veteran’s Hospital in Loma Linda. Bus service within the
City is also provided through a “dial-a-ride” service.
3.2.5 Airports
There are no public or private airports located within the City of Grand Terrace. The closest
airport to the City is the San Bernardino International Airport, formerly Norton Air Force Base.
It is located approximately 6.5 miles northeast of the City within the City of San Bernardino.
The San Bernardino International Airport Authority, a joint powers agency consisting the County
of San Bernardino, City of San Bernardino, City of Loma Linda, City of Highland, and City of
Colton, operates the airport.

3.2.6 Levels of Service
Levels of Service (LOS) is a criteria used to describe the quality of traffic flow. LOS is graded
from A to F. An LOS of A indicates the traffic is free flowing and uncongested. An LOS of F
indicates gridlock. Table 3.1 illustrates specific criteria used for determining a street’s Level of
Service.
The Circulation Element mandates that the Level of Service for all major intersections in the
City should operate at an LOS D or better. Any major intersection that operates at an LOS of E
or F is considered to be deficient. Under such conditions, efforts should be made to improve the
LOS through street widening, striping, or enhanced traffic control systems.

3.4.1 Roadway Classifications
The Circulation Plan identifies five distinct street classifications. These classifications have been
assigned to individual streets based upon their location, adjacent land uses, anticipated traffic
volumes, and their intent. They also correspond with the community design goals of the other
elements of the General Plan. Each classification corresponds to a typical street classification as
illustrated in Exhibit 3-4. While these cross sections represent typical street improvements for
each category, refinement may be required to address special circumstances including right-of-
way issues, intersections turning movements or additional landscape requirements. They may
also be further refined within Specific Plan areas.
Table 3.2 summarizes the five categories of streets and highway designations used by the City of
Grand Terrace. As illustrated, major streets serve as primary corridors to move people and
goods through the City and service commercial and employment centers, while narrower local
streets provide access to residential neighborhoods.

                 4         Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                           of an existing action or program. It requires no
                           further action to implement.
                 5         Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but
                           does not require short term implementation or may
                           require other actions to be taken first.

                           desirable. It is not critical to other actions.

4.0 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
4.1     INTRODUCTION
4.1.1 Purpose and Function
Open space is a valuable commodity to any city. It may be used for the preservation of natural
resources, such as the protection of sensitive habit, the management of production resources,
such as mineral deposits, agriculture or
groundwater recharge, or as recreation and
visual aesthetics. Concurrently, open
space may be used to manage public safety
hazards such as seismic activity, high fire
hazards, and flood hazards.
Open space areas contribute to the overall
form, sense of identity, and general well
being of a community. It may be used to
shape and form the urban environment, to
separate or buffer sensitive land uses or
link various land uses together.
The City of Grand Terrace possesses natural resources that help to identify the City in form and
character. Blue Mountain has become the symbol of the City providing a scenic backdrop for
much of the City. Scenic views are offered to residences nestled on the side of Blue Mountain
including views of the San Bernardino Mountains to the north.
4.1.2 Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The Government Code requires cities and counties to consider public demand for trail-oriented
recreational use in developing specific open space programs, as well as the potential integration
of city and county trails into segments of the California Recreational Trails System.
4.1.3 Relationship to Other Elements
Open space land is defined under Government Code Section 65560b as any parcel or area of land
or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open space. The Code also requires that
certain items must be addressed in the General Plan Open Space Element including the
following:
•       Open space for the preservation of natural resources, such as areas required for the
        preservation of plant and animal life.
                                                 IV-1
Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                           Resolution No. 2010-10

                                               Open Space and Conservation Element
•       Open space used for the managed production of resources, such as areas required for
        groundwater recharge or areas containing major mineral deposits.
•       Open space for outdoor recreation such as areas of outstanding scenic, historic, and
        cultural value; areas suited for park and recreation purposes; and areas which serve as
        links between major recreation and open space areas including utility easements, banks of
        rivers and streams, trails and scenic highway corridors.
•       Open space for public health and safety such as areas that require special management or
        regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake fault zones,
        unstable soil areas, flood plains, and high fire risk zones.
The Open Space and Conservation Elements as required under State planning law have been
combined since the goals and implementation policies for the conversation of resources and
those associated with the use of open space are similar in nature and overlap in many areas. The
combined Open Space and Conservation Element is directly linked to other required elements of
the General Plan. These include the following:
•       Land Use Element: The preservation of open space and natural resources directly
        affect land use designations. The Land Use element includes an ‘Open Space’
        designation and must be consistent with the Open Space and Conservation Element goals
        and policies. The Land Use Element also designates parks and recreation areas, which
        are also discussed in the Open Space and Conservation Element.
•       Safety Element:         One of the requirements of the Open Space and Conversation
        Element is to identify lands that may affect public safety such as seismic areas, high fire
        hazards, and flood hazards and to preserve them as open space that is protected from
        urban intrusion.
•       Public Services and Facilities Element: This Element identifies the providers of
        public services and facilities to the community. Part of the open space and conservation
        system is improved open space areas such as parks. The provision and maintenance of
        parks must be evaluated and planned for as part of the public services and facilities
        planning process.
•       Noise Element: Areas subject to high noise levels due to adjacent land uses such as
        freeways and railroads may be designated as open space to provide a buffer to sensitive
        land uses.
•       Sustainable Development Element:            A key component to sustainability is the
        preservation of open space and the creation of urban and rural recreational resources.
        Open space is also directly connected to the preservation of clean air and water.

4.2      EXISTING CONDITIONS
4.2.1 Improved Recreational Resources
Open space in the City of Grand Terrace comes in many forms. These include the undeveloped
hillside of Blue Mountain, existing public parks and school playgrounds, public utility corridors,
and the Santa Ana River floodplain. Improved open space within the City is primarily limited to
public parks and school sites. The existing facilities are summarized in Table 4.1 and identified
in Exhibit 4-1.

4.2.2 Biological Resources
In addition to improved recreation areas, certain areas remain within the City limits that have not
been impacted by human occupation. This includes the steep hillside areas of Blue Mountain.
Presently, there are approximately 600 acres of undeveloped area within the City. The majority
of this area is located on the west slopes of Blue Mountain, an area that may support a wide
range of plants and animal life. Table 4.2 summarizes potential sensitive species that may
inhabit this hillside area or other undeveloped lands within the City limits.

4.2.3 Cultural Resources
Grand Terrace is located along the border of the territories known to have been occupied by the
Serrano, Gabrielino (Tongva), and Cahuilla Indians, with the Serrano to the north, Gabrielino to
the west, and Cahuilla to the south and east. It is likely that all these groups passed through or
exploited resources within the City limits at different times in prehistory.
Grand Terrace’s roots extend back to Mexican land grants dating from the period between 1830
and 1840. In 1876, there were nine buildings in the Terrace-Colton area. The development of

Grand Terrace, or East Riverside as the Grand Terrace-Highgrove area was then called, was
facilitated by the construction of the Gage Canal, a 22.5-mile canal that brought water to the area
from the Santa Ana River marshlands below. With plenty of water, Grand Terrace rapidly
became an agricultural community with a heavy emphasis on citrus production. However, the
severe freeze of 1913 destroyed many groves. Walnuts, a hardier tree, were planted as
replacements along with peaches as a quick-profit crop.
There are 19 previously recorded sites within the Grand Terrace. One site within the City has
been evaluated as National Register of Historical Place (NRHP) Significant. That site, the Gage
Canal, constructed in the 1880s, was essential to the development of the City and surrounding
areas as it allowed a largely arid region to grow into an agricultural center. The Gage Canal runs
through the City, and is a mostly covered structure, with development along most of it.
Although a number of sites have been recorded as containing resources, there are no known areas
of the City that have been previously identified as places of historical, cultural, or archaeological
significance that should be identified significant and be preserved as open space.
4.2.4 Managed Production of Resources
Lands that are used in the production of resources include those lands used for forestry,
agriculture, rangeland, and mining or those that are classified as economically important to the
production of food and fiber. There are presently no areas within the City limits that are
classified as being used for the managed production of resources that should be designated as
open space or conservation areas.
4.2.5 Public Health and Safety
Open space may be used to protect the health and safety of the general public from natural
hazards including seismic hazards, unstable slopes and soils, flood hazards, and high fire risks.
All of these conditions presently exist within the City of Grand Terrace.
Seismic Hazards:         The City of Grand Terrace is located in Southern California, as area
known for its numerous faults and historic earthquakes. The City is bounded by the San Andreas
and San Jacinto Faults to the north and the Elsinore Fault to the south. Although no known
active faults are located within the City limits, the San Jacinto Alquist-Priolo Zone lies
approximately 2,800 feet northeast
of the City.
Unstable Slopes and Soils: The
undeveloped area of Blue Mountain
exhibits soils that are classified as
unstable and erosive. In addition,
the steep slopes of Blue Mountain
may also result in the landslide

hazard. Development of these slopes could result in a safety hazard. Exhibit 4.-2 depicts areas of
the City with potential geological hazards.
Flood Hazards:          Although nearly all of the City of Grand Terrace is elevated along the base
of Blue Mountain, the northwest portion of the City lies within a designated flood plain of the
Santa Ana River. Levees have been constructed along a portion of the City’s riverfront.
However, a flood hazard continues to exist that could make certain areas unsuitable for habitable
structures. Portions of the City that have the potential to experience flooding are shown in
Exhibit 4-3.
High Fire Risk:         The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE)
has identified a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone within the City. Residential uses have
been constructed along theses areas that back up to an area of natural vegetation that is highly
susceptible to fires. Exhibit 4-4 illustrates the limits of the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone
for the City. Construction in Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone will be required to meet the
requirements of Chapter 7A of the California Building Code relating to fire resistant rated
construction as shown in Exhibit 4-4.
Wildland-urban interface fires may occur in areas where urban land uses abut native areas.
Under these conditions, wildfires may threaten urban uses.
4.2.6 Water Resources
Riverside Highland Water Company (RHWC) is the successor to the Vivienda Water Company,
which was part of the Highest Riverside Mesa Scheme. The Vivienda Water Company was
incorporated in August 1887 and was operated in unison with the North Riverside Land and
Water Company and the Jurupa Land and Water Company, under one management for the
development of water for irrigation of lands on both sides of the Santa Ana River. RHWC was
incorporated and certified as a Mutual Water Company by the California Secretary of State on
February 21, 1898, for the purpose of providing domestic and irrigation water to its shareholders.
The Riverside Highland Water Company provides domestic and irrigation water services to the
City of Grand Terrace, portions of the City of Colton, and portions of the unincorporated areas of
the Counties of San Bernardino and Riverside. The water service is to single and multi-family
residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural users.
The service area of the Riverside Highland Water Company (RHWC) is nearing about 85%
built-out with the developments currently under construction or approved by the planning
departments of the governing agencies. The major service area of the RHWC is the City of
Grand Terrace.

4.3     FUTURE OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION NEEDS
4.3.1 Improved Recreation Facilities
Local park and recreation standards have been
established to determine the appropriate size, type,
and number of recreational facilities required to
adequately serve a given population. The State of
California has established a standard of four acres of
improved park and recreational facilities per 1,000
population. Assuming a buildout population of
17,500, the total required acreage is approximately
70 acres. As indicated in Table 4.1, approximately
100 acres of developed and undeveloped parks and
recreation areas are currently available throughout
the City.
This acreage shall be provided through the following means:
City Parks: The City presently has five designated public parks. The five parks total 41.2
acres and include facilities for baseball, soccer, basketball, jogging, playgrounds, picnicking, and
casual activities. All parks are improved except for Susan Petta Park that is planned as a passive
park and the Wilderness Park that is proposed for hillside open space recreational uses.
Schools:        Local schools play an integral part in providing active recreational facilities to
city residents. The three local schools (two elementary and one middle) provide 19.0 acres of
playgrounds and sports field. In addition, the planned public high school located in the
southwest area of the City will add approximately 40 acres of improved recreation facilities for
use by City residents. The City and the Colton Joint Unified School District maintain joint use
agreements at all schools within the City.
4.3.2 Natural Resources/Public Safety
As previously noted, open space plays a major role in the preservation of natural resources while
protecting residents from natural hazards. The primary area of the City that has been devoted to
natural resources is the steep hillside of Blue Mountain. The City owns approximately 25 acres
of the hillside near the eastern terminus of Pico Street. This area is designated as the Grand
Terrace Wilderness Park and is currently undeveloped. The park may ultimately be developed as
a natural outdoor recreation area for hiking and picnicking upon the availability of funding.
In addition to natural outdoor recreation, Blue Mountain serves as a preserve for plant and
animal life as well as an area that should be preserved to protect local residents from hazards
associated with steep terrain such as fires and landslides. Approximately 310 acres of Blue
Mountain’s north and west sides is currently undeveloped. Prior to any proposed development

                                             Open Space and Conservation Element
within this area, special emphasis should be placed upon the protection of sensitive species and
potential hazards to humans resulting from development as well as the protection of scenic
views. If possible, public and private funding should be sought to acquire much of this area for
use as an open space preserve.
4.3.3 Water Resources
Domestic water for the City of Grand Terrace is provided by the Riverside Highland Water
Company (RHWC). RHWC extracts water from four groundwater basins including:
•       San Bernardino Basin
•       Colton Basin
•       Riverside North Basin
•       Riverside South Basin
RHWC also is a member of the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District that serves as a
distributor of State Project water.
RHWC optimizes its water supply through an integrated resource approach, utilizing available
programs and projects. The RHWC receives its’ water from groundwater; however, non-potable
water is used in place of potable water whenever the possibility arises, conserving potable water.
Additionally, RHWC has developed programs designed to conserve water through the
replacement of older lines, which has decreased unaccounted for water from 39% in 1982 to 1%
in 2008, while educating its customers on methods of conserving water, such as an Adopt-A-
School program that teaches students about water conservation, water conservation displays at
community events, water audits, and tiered rates.
Three local and regional plans have been prepared to address water quality and water availability
in the region. They include:
Riverside Highland Water Company Urban Water Management Plan:                       This plan is
prepared every five years to address changes in the availability of water or the provision of water
services to the Water Company’s customers. The Report discusses historic and future water
demand, existing and planned sources of water, groundwater basin management, water
conservation and education programs, and the reliability of water supplies.
The Urban Water Management Plan analysis of water demand and supply projections for the
RHWC, including expected growth, demonstrates that projected water supplies exceed demand
through the year 2025. These projections consider land use, water development, approved
projects, conversion projects and water conservation. RHWC has additional opportunities to
increase the water supply to meet demands through the use of imported water or developing a
recycled water supply for non-potable water uses. These additional options will enable RHWC to
increase the water supply to exceed demand now and into the future.

4.3.4 Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is a comprehensive process involving all consumers of energy resources
including homeowners and renters, businesses, government agencies, and utility companies. As
the demand for energy resources continues to increase throughout Southern California, the wise
use and conservation of existing resources has taken on new meaning and urgency. Both
government agencies and utility companies have taken the lead on providing information to
consumers on methods and programs to reduce their individual use of energy. The use of energy
may be accomplished through a wide range of practices and programs including:
•       Use of energy efficient appliances and lighting fixtures
•       Adjusting thermostats for space heating and cooling
•       Driving fuel efficient automobiles
•       Participating in waste recycling programs
•       Installation of water efficient landscaping
4.3.5 Air Quality
The City of Grand Terrace lies with in the boundaries of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD serves as the regional air pollution control agency
for most of Southern California. It is responsible for the development and implementation of
plans and programs designed to improve the overall quality of air throughout Southern California
while achieving federal air quality standards. Air quality programs relate to both mobile and
non-mobile sources of air pollutants including vehicle emissions, emissions from businesses and
residences, and emissions resulting from construction activities.
Many programs and strategies designed to reduce air emissions focus upon effective land use
planning. Land use programs that benefit air quality include:
•       Mixed use developments that bring residential, commercial, recreation, and employment
        opportunities together.
•       Local shopping opportunities that require less driving for local residents.

                  1        Current. Action already implemented.
                  2        Urgent. Action should be undertaken within the next
                           fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to
                           the City.
                  3        Important. Action should be taken in the near future.
                           It may be necessary for the completion of other
                           actions.
                  4        Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                           of an existing action or program. It requires no
                           further action to implement.
                  5        Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but
                           does not require short term implementation or may
                           require other actions to be taken first.
                  6        Optional. Action has a relatively low priority, but is
                           desirable. It is not critical to other actions.

5.0 PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
5.1     INTRODUCTION
A primary role for a city is the protection of the people who live and work within its limits as
well as their property. Natural disasters are a common occurrence throughout Southern
California. This has placed an emphasis on cities taking appropriate measures to identify and
protect against these hazards and to provide for the public’s safety. The Public Health and
Safety Element of the General Plan identifies these natural and man-made hazards and provides
goals and policies to protect the general public.
5.1.1 Purpose and Function
The Public Health and Safety Element is used to identify specific natural and man-made hazards
within the City limits. These hazards affect decisions made on land uses and activities that could
be impacted by the identified hazards. Hazards that may affect the health and safety of the
general public include:
•       Geologic conditions (e.g. seismic, landslides and slope stability, liquefaction)
•       Flooding
•       High fire risk
•       Hazardous materials
•       Emergency preparedness
•       Airport land use compatibility
This Element provide for the identification of specific hazards, their specific locations within the
City, and goals and policies designed to minimize the social, economic, and environmental
disruption from hazardous events.
5.1.2 Relationship to Other Elements
The Public Health and Safety Element is directly tied to other elements of the General Plan. The
types and locations of land uses are directly affected by the location and type of natural or man-
made hazards. The placement of elements of the circulation system may be affected by the
presence of hazards while the circulation system also serves as evacuation routes during
hazardous conditions. The location of public services such as schools and hospitals are also
influenced by the location of hazards. Areas of hazardous conditions may also be designated as
open space thereby influencing the Open Space and Conservation Element.
5.1.3 Related Plans and Programs
Federal, state, and local regulations also regulate and influence public health and safety within
the City. These include:

5.2      EXISTING CONDITIONS
5.2.1 Geologic Hazards
Areas throughout Southern California, including the City of Grand Terrace, are subject to
seismic hazards. The City of Grand Terrace is located near three major zones; the San Andreas
Fault Zone, the San Jacinto Fault Zone, and the Elsinore Fault Zone. In addition to the potential
for earthquakes resulting in shaking and ground rupture, seismic activity may result in landslides
on unstable slopes and liquefaction in areas of high groundwater and loose soils. This section
describes the geologic setting of the City of Grand Terrace, the specific geologic hazards that
may affect the City.
Geology
The City of Grand Terrace consists of three distinct topographic regions. The majority of the
city is located on a broad alluvial fan extending east from Blue Mountain. The second area is the
steep slope of Blue Mountain, while a third area in the northwest portion of the City is located
within the Santa Ana River floodplain. Elevations in the City range from 900 above sea level to
2,428 feet at the top of Blue Mountain.
Soils within the City correspond to the three topographic regions. The majority of the City
located on the slope of Blue Mountain is characterized by older undifferentiated alluvial fan
deposits and decomposed clay-rich alluvium from the Pleistocene age. The steep slopes of Blue
Mountain are characterized by gray, medium to coarse-grained quartz diorite of the Cretaceous
age. Finally, the Santa Ana River area is characterized by alluvium consisting of unconsolidated
sand.
Seismicity
There are seven known fault zones located near the City of Grand Terrace that could result in a
seismic hazard to the City. These include:
•        Chino-Elsinore Fault – 20 miles southwest
•        Cucamonga Fault – 13.5 miles north
•        San Andreas Fault – 9 miles north
•        Loma Linda Fault – 2.4 miles north

Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                           Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                Public Health and Safety Element
•        San Jacinto Fault – 0.75 miles north
•        Rialto-Colton Fault – 0.65 miles northeast
•        An unnamed fault – 0.47 miles northeast
There are no known faults within the Grand Terrace City limits. However, the Alquist-Priolo
Special Study Zone for the San Jacinto Fault lies approximately 2,800 feet north east of the City.
Earthquakes along any active fault in Southern California are capable of causing damage within
the City of Grand Terrace. Primary hazards result directly from ground motion including ground
rupture and ground shaking. Secondary hazards result from the interaction of the ground shaking
with existing ground instabilities. These may result in settlement, landslides or liquefaction.
The placement of sensitive land uses in areas where seismic activity or associated secondary
hazards may exist must be considered at all times. Although current California building
requirements place special emphasis on seismic protection, there continue to be risks associated
with land use and seismic hazards. The level of risk in seismic events will vary depending upon
the specific land use. The State of California uses a classification system to determine areas at
risk of seismic hazards. The City of Grand Terrace is located within Classifications IV, V, and
VI. Table 5.1 summarizes acceptable risks by various land use types for each of these
classifications.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a seismically induced form of ground failure resulting from loose, granular
materials at depths of less than 50 feet with a silt and clay content of less than 30 percent that are
saturated by relatively shallow groundwater. The shaking of these soils and mixing with
groundwater may result in ground failure that may cause a subsidence and actual sinking of
structures. However, all three factors must be present for liquefaction to occur. In the City of
Grand Terrace, groundwater is at approximately 140 feet below surface and soils are generally
stable. As indicated in Exhibit 5-1, areas located along the Santa Ana River may be subject to
potential liquefaction hazards. However, these areas are not located within areas considered to
be developable within the City of Grand Terrace. Therefore, liquefaction is not considered a
direct hazard to the City of Grand Terrace.
Slope Stability
Slope stability is determined using a number of factors including:
•       Relative angle of the slope
•       Soil characteristics
•       Geologic formation and bedrock conditions
•       Precipitation
•       Erosion
•       Vegetative cover including damage from wildland fires
•       Alteration by humans such as grading
The majority of the City has been urbanized. With the construction of homes and businesses,
slopes throughout the urban area have been stabilized using modern engineering. However,
undeveloped slopes continue to exist on
the slopes of Blue Mountain. Additional
slopes occur along the Santa Ana River
floodplain.
Landslides
Landslides are defined as the fast
downward movement of earth and rocks.
Landslides may be the result of seismic
activity or the infiltration of water into
unstable soil. As illustrated in Exhibit 5-
1, landslide hazards are present on the
slopes of Blue Mountain.

5.2.2 Flood Hazards
Floodplains
Hazards associated with flooding may result in personal injury and property damage. The
primary flood hazard in Grand Terrace is the Santa Ana River located along the northwest corner
of the City. This floodplain has been mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) which assesses the flooding potential. As indicated in Exhibit 5.2, FEMA has
designated a strip along the Santa Ana River as a 100-year floodplain. This indicates that the
subject area has a potential of a major flood sometime within a span of 100 years. The potential
elevation of floodwaters from the 100-year event is also provided. A secondary area with a
potential for flooding within a 500-year time span is also indicated.
The placement of various land uses within a 100-year floodplain are dependent upon the specific
use. Table 5.2 summarizes the compatibility of specific land uses within a floodplain.
Local Flood Hazards
In addition to flooding from a river, flood hazards may exist due to intense rainfall on steep
slopes. The majority of the City of Grand Terrace is located on the alluvial fan of Blue
Mountain. There is a general grade of approximately 7 percent from the base of Blue Mountain
to the southwest corner of the City. During times of heavy rainfall, the potential for storm runoff
from the slopes of Blue Mountain increases. Urban development of the City has also greatly
increased the amount of impermeable surface (i.e. roof tops and paved streets) that has greatly
increased the amount of run off from the urban areas of the City. These two major sources of run
off combined with steep slopes may result in a potential for flooding within the City.

Dam Inundation
There are no major dams located within the City of Grand Terrace. The only major dam that
could impact the City is the Seven Oaks Dam located northeast of the City of Highland. In the
event that this dam failed, it would eventually enter the Santa Ana River floodplain as it passes
Grand Terrace. This increased water volume could potentially flood the lower elevations of the
northwest corner of the City along the river’s course.

5.2.3 Hazardous Materials
The evaluation of hazardous materials includes activities involved in the manufacture, storage,
transportation, use, and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. The potential
health hazards and environmental damage that may occur from the careless use of these materials
or their accidental release is a cause of great concern to any community.
Hazardous materials are regulated at all levels of government. Agencies directly involved in
their regulation include:
         •      United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
         •      California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA)
         •      California Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC)

The San Bernardino Fire Protection District, Hazardous Materials Division, was granted
authority by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) to become the Certified
Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for San Bernardino County. The CUPA is directly involved
in the inspection, permitting, and enforcement of hazardous materials manufacturers, hazardous
waste generators. USDOT and the CHP regulate the transportation of hazardous materials while
the DTSC is actively involved in the storage of hazardous materials and the cleanup of hazardous
waste sites.
The City of Grand Terrace is actively involved in the regulation of land uses using hazardous
materials. The City may also regulate the transportation of hazardous materials within the City
limits. The City has also adopted a City Hazardous Waste Management Plan in accordance with
State law. The HWMP regulates all businesses that use or generate hazardous materials within
the City and requires them to inventory amounts and types of hazardous materials used by their
business. The CUPA requires businesses meeting requirements pursuant to California Health
and Safety Code, Section 25503.5 to establish and implement a Hazardous Materials Business
Plan in accordance with the section.
5.2.4 Fire Hazards
Fires have a potential to threaten human life, property, natural resources, and wildlife. They may
occur in urban areas, wildland areas or in the
interface of both areas.
Urban fires typically involve structures and
are often caused by sources within the
structures. Urban fires have the highest
potential to impact people due to the high
concentration in urban areas. Property
values are also much higher in urban areas
than in others resulting in the potential for
loss of life and expensive property damage.
The fast response by fire fighting services is
essential in limiting the damage to property
and loss of life. Effective fire protection in
urban areas is based upon the:

•       Age and general condition of structures
•       Efficiency of the local circulation system that allows fire units to quickly reach the fire
•       Availability of adequate water quantities at adequate pressure
•       Staffing
Fire protection services for the City are provided by the San Bernardino County Fire Protection
District. Fire protection services include:
•       Structural Fire Suppression
•       Wildland Fire Suppression including County hand crews, bulldozers, and helicopter
        suppression services
•       Emergency Medical Services including basic life support
•       Technical Rescue Services
•       Hazardous Materials Mitigation
•       Incident Command and Control including Battalion Chiefs, Division Chiefs, and a
        County Incident Management Team
•       Code Enforcement through the California Building Code and California Fire Code
•       Pre-Fire Planning Services
•       Public Education Services
The majority of the City of Grand Terrace is urbanized. The City is primarily single family
residential neighborhoods with urban and industrial centers. The City of Grand Terrace is
staffed by the County of San Bernardino Fire Department and provides fire protection services
for the citizens of the area. Fire Station Number 23, located at 22582 Center City Court is
responsible for providing fire protection to the community of Grand Terrace. Daily staffing
includes one career Fire Captain and one Limited-term firefighter. The daily staffing is
augmented by a force of 20 paid-call firefighters. An additional firefighter augments the daily
staffing during fire season (May-December), however funding for seasonal positions is reviewed
annually and not guaranteed. During major fire emergencies, additional fire protection units may
be called in from other surrounding city and county fire departments via Automatic or Mutual
Aid.
Wildland fires typically occur in large undeveloped areas. They may be caused by natural
sources such as lightning strikes or by humans, either intentionally or unintentionally. They
result in the destruction of grasses, shrubs, and trees and can destroy both vegetation and animal
life. The results can leave barren hillsides that are susceptible to erosion and mudslides. Often,
wildland fires occur on steep hillsides that are difficult to access for fire fighters and are distant
from major water sources that could be used to fight the fires. Seasonal conditions also affect the
potential for wildfires. High summer temperatures, low humidity, and high winds result in dry
brush and atmospheric conditions that can accelerate fires through steep terrain.
Wildland-urban interface fires may occur in areas where urban land uses abut native areas.
Under these conditions, wildfires may threaten urban uses. In the City of Grand Terrace, the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) has identified a Very High

Fire Hazard Severity Zone within the City. Residential uses have been constructed along these
areas that back up to an area of natural vegetation that is highly susceptible to fires. Exhibit 5-3
illustrates the limits of the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone for the City. Construction in the
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone will be required to meet the requirements of Chapter 7A of
the California Building Code relating to fire resistant rated construction.
Peak Water Demand and Supply
The primary source of fire suppression is water. Most structures and wildland fires are
suppressed by the direct application of water. Therefore, an adequate supply of available water
at a high pressure is critical in fighting fires. Water to the City of Grand Terrace is provided by
the Riverside Highland Water Company (RHWC). RHWC maintains a series of wells,
reservoirs, and transmission mains to provide water for domestic and fire fighting purposes.
The San Bernardino County Fire Protection District has established general fire flow
requirements for new development in accordance with the California Fire Code, which takes into
consideration occupancy type and building size.

5.2.5 Emergency Preparedness
In the event of an emergency, all cities are required to be adequately prepared to respond in a
timely manner. Emergency response directly relates to the protection of human health and safety
as well as the welfare of the general public in times of natural or man-made emergency
situations. Emergencies that may require a city response include:
•       Major floods or dam inundation
•       Earthquakes
•       High winds
•       Wildfires
•       Hazardous materials accidents
•       Major transportation accidents
•       Industrial explosions
The City of Grand Terrace maintains an emergency operations center that is staffed by the
Emergency Operations Committee, a team of volunteers and City staff trained to in emergency
response. The City also maintains a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program.
The CERT program provides participants
with "hands-on" practical training that will
enable them to effectively plan for and
respond to an earthquake, or other
emergencies in and around their
neighborhood. CERT. is about readiness,
people helping people, rescuer safety, and
doing the greatest good for the greatest
number. CERT was first established by the
Los Angeles City Fire Department in 1986.
In 1993, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), using
LAFD's model, began promoting
nationwide use of the CERT concept.
Since then, CERT has been established in
all 50 states. The City regularly conducts
CERT training for those volunteers that wish to become CERT certified. In addition, the City
participates in the Statewide Master Mutual Aid Agreement as well as Mutual Aid Agreements
with San Bernardino County and surrounding cities. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) also provides emergency response services at a federal level.
The American Red Cross also provides emergency support services ranging from a single
displaced family at a residential fire to community-wide disaster relief. The Red Cross
designates area disaster team coordinators who can immediately coordinate with local
emergency service agencies and school districts to establish emergency shelters for displaced

families. The Red Cross also assists in evacuations, identifying missing persons, and reuniting
displaced families.
Evacuation Routes
The San Bernardino County General Plan identifies potential evacuation routes in and around the
City of Grand Terrace. These include Interstate 10, Intestate 215, and Interstate 15. Major
evacuation routes within the City of Grand Terrace include Barton Road, La Cadena Avenue,
and Mount Vernon Avenue. Specific evacuation routes depend upon the type of emergency, its
location, and any damage caused to the circulation system.
Airport Land Use Compatibility and Safety
The City of Grand Terrace is not located within a defined airport land use zone. There are no
public or private airports within the City limits. The closet public airports to the City are San
Bernardino International Airport located approximately 6.5 miles northeast of the City and
Ontario International Airport located approximately 15 miles west of the City. Since there are no
airports located within the immediate vicinity of the City, planning for airport compatibility is
not required.
San Bernardino International Airport, which is a distance of approximately 6.5 miles from Grand
Terrace, is governed by two joint power authorities, The San Bernardino International Airport
Authority (SBIAA) and the Inland Valley Development Agency (IVDA). The SBIAA is
comprised of the cities of San Bernardino, Colton, Loma Linda, Highland, as well as the County
of San Bernardino. The IVDA is comprised of the cities of San Bernardino, Colton, Loma Linda,
and the County of San Bernardino.
The IVDA is responsible for redeveloping the non-aviation related portion of the former Norton
Air Force Base, while SBIAA is responsible for redeveloping the airport related portion of the
airport. The goal of both the SBIAA and IVDA is to replace the lost jobs in the communities
where the base closed, improve the infrastructure, landscape and aesthetics of the local and
surrounding areas, and promote economic and aviation related activities to increase the tax base
to the region.
Ontario International Airport is owned and operated by the City of Los Angeles. The City of
Grand Terrace lies beneath one of the primary approach patterns for Ontario Airport.

          Priorities
                  1        Current. Action already implemented.
                  2        Urgent. Action should be undertaken within the next
                           fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to
                           the City.
                  3        Important. Action should be taken in the near future.
                           It may be necessary for the completion of other
                           actions.
                  4        Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                           of an existing action or program. It requires no
                           further action to implement.
                  5        Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but
                           does not require short term implementation or may
                           require other actions to be taken first.

6.0 NOISE ELEMENT
6.1     INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of the General Plan is the basis for achieving and maintaining environmental
noise control. It includes the following components:
•       An overview of noise terminology
•       A description of the potential effects of noise on humans
•       Existing and future noise conditions in the City
•       Goals, objectives, and policies designed to minimize exiting and future noise impacts
The Noise Element is intended to be used as a guide in decision-making for both public and
private developments where noise may be a concern and to provide adequate mitigation
measures for noise-related impacts to existing and planned land uses.
6.1.1 Purpose and Function
The State of California mandates under Government
Code Section 65302(f), that a General Plan contain a
Noise Element that “identifies and appraises noise
problems in the community”. The Government Code
states that the ultimate purpose of the goals and
policies established under the Noise Element is to
“minimize the exposure of community residents to
excessive noise”. The Element is required to
recognize and evaluate noise issues under the
guidelines of the Office of Noise Control of the
California Department of Health Services. The
Element must quantify, to the extent practical, current
and future noise levels from the following sources:
•       Highways and freeways
•       Primary arterials and major local streets
•       Rail operations and ground transit systems
•       Airport operations, aircraft over flights, and all ground maintenance and other activities
        associated with airports
•       Local industrial developments including rail classification yards
•       Other stationary ground sources identified as contributing to the noise environment of the
        community

                                                                           Resolution No. 2010-10

6.1.2 Related Plans and Programs
Grand Terrace Municipal Code
The Grand Terrace Municipal Code establishes the city’s standards, guidelines, and procedures
regarding the regulation of noise within the City limits. The Municipal Code includes Chapter
8.108, which establishes a Noise Ordinance (Ordinance No. 99). The Zoning Code section of the
Municipal Code also establishes development guidelines and review procedures for noise
generating land developments.
State Regulations
The California Department of Health Services (CDHS) has established the Office of Noise
Control which has prepared studies associated with noise levels and their effects on various land
uses. Based upon these studies, the State has established interior and exterior noise standards by
land use category and standards for the compatibility of various land uses and noise levels.
These standards are discussed in subsequent sections of this element.
Federal Regulations
Interstate 215 passes through the west portion of the City. This freeway is part of the Federal
interstate highway system that is regulated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
The FHWA has developed noise standards to be used for federally funded roadway projects or
projects that require federal review.
In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is charged with the regulation of noise
generated from railroad lines and facilities under the federal Noise Control Act. These
regulations are enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration. In addition, the federal
government has established standards associated with airport noise.
6.1.3 Relationship to Other Elements
The Noise Element is closely related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements of the General
Plan. Certain land uses, such as heavy industrial uses are potential sources of high noise levels,
while residential and some institutional land uses such as schools and hospitals are noise
sensitive. When planning for long range land uses, the potential impact of noise on or from
adjacent land uses must be considered. In addition, many sources of high noise levels are
mobile, including automobiles, heavy trucks, and trains. The location of primary transportation
routes may impact sensitive noise receptors located near these routes. Therefore, the Circulation
Element must consider noise-related impacts on adjacent land uses and proper mitigation
measures.

6.1.4 Terminology
The following terms are commonly used when discussing noise:
Acceptable Exterior Noise Exposures: In general, exterior noise exposures at residential
locations should not exceed a CNEL of 65 dB.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recommended a policy stating that an Ldn (or
CNEL) of 55 dB should not be exceeded within exterior living spaces. However, the EPA
emphasizes that this level of exposure may not be economically feasible, or, in many cases, a
practical level to achieve.
Acceptable Interior Noise Exposures: California's noise insulation standards were officially
adopted by the California Commission of Housing and Community Development in 1974 and
became effective on August 22, 1974. On November 14, 1988, the Building Standards
Commission approved revisions to these standards (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of
Regulations). The ruling states that, "Interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall not
exceed 45 dB in any habitable room. The noise metric shall be either … Ldn or … CNEL,
consistent with the noise element of the local general plan." Additionally, the Commission
specifies that residential buildings or structures to be located within exterior CNEL (or Ldn)
contours of 60 dB or greater of an existing or adopted freeway, expressway, parkway, major
street, thoroughfare, rail line, rapid transit line, or industrial noise source shall require an
acoustical analysis showing that the building has been designed to limit intruding noise to an
interior CNEL of 45 dB.
Ambient Noise: The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In this context, the
ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given
location.
Amplitude: A measure of the difference between atmospheric pressure (with no sound
present) and the total pressure (with sound present). Although there are other measures of sound
amplitude, sound pressure is the fundamental measure. The unit of sound pressure is the decibel,
denoted dB.
A-Weighted Sound Pressure Level (dBA): The sound pressure level, in decibels, as
measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting filter network. The A-weighting filter
de-emphasizes the very low and a very high frequency component of the sound in a manner
similar to the response of the human ear and gives good correlation with subjective reactions to
noise.
To establish the A-weighted sound level, the acoustical signal is detected by the microphone and
then filtered to weight those portions of the noise that are most annoying to individuals. This
weighting of sound energy corresponds approximately to the relative annoyance experienced by
humans from noise at various frequencies.
The A-weighted sound level of traffic noise and other long-term noise producing activities
within and around a community varies considerably with time. Measures of this varying noise

                                                                           Noise Element
level are accomplished by obtaining statistical samples. For the purposes of the General Plan, the
following statistical values have been used:
Leq:            The energy equivalent (average) sound level. This value is most representative of
                the long-term annoyance potential as well as other effects of the noise.
Lmax:           The maximum sound level.
Lmin:           The minimum sound level.
Ln:             The sound level exceeded n% of the time (e.g., L25 is the sound level exceeded
                25% of the time).
These measures may be recorded to obtain representative samples of the noise during certain
time periods (e.g., peak traffic period, late evening, early morning, etc.).
Typical A-weighted noise levels are shown in Table 6.1.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): It is recognized that a given level of noise
may be more or less tolerable depending on the duration of exposure and the time of day during
which the noise is experienced. There are several measures of noise exposure that consider not
only the variation of noise level but also include temporal characteristics. Of these, the State
Department of Aeronautics and the California Commission of Housing and Community
Development have adopted the CNEL.
This measure weights the average noise level for the evening hours (from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00
p.m.) by 5 dB, and the late evening and early morning hours (from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) by
10 dB. The un-weighted daytime noise levels are combined with these weighted levels and
averaged to obtain a CNEL value.
Day-Night Sound Level (Ldn): The measure of noise exposure used by the EPA, HUD, FAA
and the Department of Defense. It is the same as CNEL except that the weighting considered (in
CNEL) between the hours from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm is eliminated. Throughout this General
Plan, Ldn and CNEL are assumed to be the same measure. This is consistent with the
recommended practice of the State of California Office of Noise Control.
Decibel (dB): A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to
the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the measured sound to the reference pressure, which is
20 micro Pascals. Because they are logarithmic, decibels are not additive. If two similar noise
sources produce the same amount of noise (e.g., 100 decibels each), the total noise level will be
103 dB, not 200 dB. An increase in noise level of 10 dB is generally perceived as being twice as
loud.
Exterior Living Space:       Open area designed for outdoor living and/or recreation.

Maximum Noise Level: The maximum instantaneous noise level that occurs during a specific
time interval. In acoustics, the maximum sound pressure level is understood to be for single
events unless some other kind of level is specified.
Noise: Is commonly defined as an unwanted sound. A given level of noise may be more, or
less tolerable depending on the sound level, duration of exposure, character of the noise sources,
the time of day during which the noise is experienced, and the activity affected by the noise. For
example, noise that occurs at night tends to be more disturbing than that which occurs during the
day because sleep may be disturbed. Additionally, rest at night is a critical requirement in the
recovery from exposure to high noise levels during the day. In consideration of these factors,
different measures of noise exposure have been developed to quantify the extent of the effects
anticipated from these activities
Noise Barrier:        A structure designed to mitigate the impact generated by a noise source (e.g.
an arterial or rail line) at an adjacent noise-sensitive location. Barriers should be continuous
structures without gaps and should be constructed of a material that is impervious to noise (e.g.,
concrete block, stucco on wood, Y4” tempered glass, earthen berm, or any combination of these
materials.
Noise Contour: A line drawn around a noise source indicating constant levels of noise
exposure. CNEL is the metric utilized herein to describe community exposure to noise.
Noise Impact Area:         A specific area exposed to significant levels of noise.
Noise Reduction: The ability of a material to reduce the noise level from one place to another
or between one room and another. Noise reduction is specified in decibels.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses: Noise-sensitive land uses include, but are not limited to:
residences, schools, libraries, hospitals, churches, offices, hotels, motels, and outdoor
recreational areas. These typify land uses where suitability is restricted by intrusive noises.
Hence, they are termed "noise-sensitive". Noise sensitivity factors include interference with
speech communication, subjective judgment of noise acceptability and relative noisiness, need
for freedom from noise intrusion, and sleep interference criteria. The Land Use Element of the
General Plan provides a description of the residential areas throughout the city and is considered
the source for the inventory of noise-sensitive areas.
Sound: As used herein, sound is a reaction in the ear caused by radiant energy being
transmitted from a source by longitudinal pressure waves in air or some other elastic medium.
Sound Level Meter: A measurement instrument containing a microphone, an amplifier, an
output meter, and one or more frequency weighting networks. It is used for the determination of
sound levels.

6.1.5 Effects of Noise
In general, noise may affect the average individual in the following ways:
•       General Hearing Loss or Damage: Sound levels which exceed 85 dB (A), when
        experienced for long durations during each working day, may result in severe temporary
        or even permanent hearing loss. State and federal safety and health regulations currently
        protect workers at levels of exposure that exceed 90 dB (A) for each 8-hour workday.
•       Interference with Oral Communication: Speech intelligibility is impaired when
        sound levels exceed 60 dB (A). The amount of interference increases with sound level
        and distance between speaker and listener.
•       Sleep Interference: Sound levels that exceed 40 to 45 dB (A) are generally considered
        to be excessive for sleeping areas within a residence.
Noise has a significant effect on the quality of life. An individual’s reaction to a particular noise
depends on many factors such as the source of the noise, its loudness relative to the background
noise level, and the time of day. The reaction to noise can also be highly subjective; the
perceived effect of a particular noise can vary widely among individuals in a community.
Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about 10 dBA greater than the reference
sound to be judged as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dBA change in community noise levels is
perceivable, while 1 to 2 dBA changes generally are not perceived. Although the reaction to
noise may vary, it is clear that noise is a significant component of the environment, and
excessively noisy conditions can affect an individual’s health and well-being. The effects of
noise are often only transitory, but adverse effects can be cumulative with prolonged or repeated
exposure. The effects of noise on a community can be organized into six broad categories: sleep
disturbance; permanent hearing loss; human performance and behavior; social interaction of
communication; extra-auditory health effects; and general annoyance.

6.2     NOISE STANDARDS
Table 6.2 identifies typical interior and exterior noise standards accepted by local, state, and
federal agencies for various land use types. As indicated, interior noise standards for residential
uses are 45 dB while external standards are 65 dB. More intense industrial, commercial, and
recreational uses maintain a higher acceptable noise level.

6.3     EXISTING CONDITIONS
6.3.1 Major Noise Sources
The City of Grand Terrace is characterized as a predominantly urban environment. Much of the
City has been developed with residential, commercial and industrial land uses. Transportation
related noise is the primary noise source in the City. Other noise sources include noise generated
from commercial, residential and recreational activities.
Noise measurements were conducted with the purpose of establishing baseline ambient noise
levels for transportation and non-transportation noise generators throughout the City of Grand
Terrace.
A total of eleven short-term (15-minute) representative measurements were conducted to provide
a basis for understanding the overall existing noise environment of the City. A 15-minute
sample is considered a “snapshot” of the baseline noise environment at a given time; the sound
level may vary depending on time, day or season.

Table 6.4 lists the eleven noise measurement locations with corresponding land uses and 15
minute noise levels. As shown in this table, noise levels of commercial and industrial land uses
near I-215 and the rail lines are the highest (66-69 dBA), with industrial land uses not near I-215,
significantly lower. Ambient noise levels are much lower at public and single and multiple
family residential areas (51-63 dBA). In general, ambient noise levels decrease as distance from
I-215 is gained.

  All noise levels are short-term (15-minute) measurements and are rounded to nearest tenth.
6.3.1.1        Non-Transportation Noise
Commercial/Industrial Noise
Non-transportation related noise generators are commonly called “stationary,” “fixed,” “area,” or
“point” sources of noise. Industrial processing, mechanical equipment, pumping stations, and
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment are examples of fixed location,
non-transportation noise sources. Some non-transportation sources are not stationary but are
typically assessed as point or area sources due to the limited area in which they operate, such as
truck deliveries. Noise generated by industrial and commercial operations, maintenance,
manufacturing, truck traffic (loading docks), and warehousing noise can affect surrounding noise
sensitive land use.
In general, commercial/industrial noise within the City of Grand Terrace is not considered
excessive. However, where residential locations are adjacent to industrial zones or trucking
operations, a significant impact may exist.
                                                             VI-10

Temporary and/or Nuisance Noise
Intermittent or temporary neighborhood noise from amplified music, public address systems,
barking dogs, landscape maintenance, stand-by power generators, and construction activities are
disturbing to residents but are difficult to attenuate and control. These noise sources could result
in a significant impact if they violate the Noise Ordinance contained in the City’s Municipal
Code.
6.3.1.2      Mobile Noise
Traffic noise, including automobiles, trucks, and other motor vehicles is the most pervasive
source of noise in the City Grand Terrace. There are several key factors associated with roadway
or traffic noise, including: traffic volumes; the speed of the traffic; the type or “mix” of vehicles
using a particular roadway; and pavement conditions. The roadway network in the City consists
of a state highway, regional arterials, local public roads, and private roads.
Highways and arterials generally accommodate high speed, high volume traffic, and are designed
to provide for the movement of people and goods between and within communities in the City.
Interstate 215 (I-215) traverses the western portion of the City from north to south. Examples of
roadways within the City that would accommodate either higher speeds or higher traffic volumes
include Barton Road, De Berry Street, La Cadena Drive, Michigan Avenue, and Mount Vernon
Avenue.
Local roads serve lower speed, lower volume traffic and provide access to local residential
neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas in each of the communities throughout the
City. Local roads also feed traffic onto the larger highways and arterials. Private roads are
generally not available to the public and serve a limited number of travelers. Examples of private
roads include private driveways or maintenance roads.
The representative noise measurements
indicate that commercial and industrial
land uses near I-215 and the rail lines are
the highest (66-69 dBA.) and that in
general, ambient noise levels decrease as
distance from I-215 is gained. These levels
are higher than is considered acceptable
and will compromise the welfare of
residents exposed to the noise for a long
period of time. Exhibit 6-2 depicts the
noise level contours from the I-215
Freeway.
Table 6.5 shows modeled existing roadway
noise, modeled General Plan build-out
roadway noise and the projected noise level

increase due to General Plan build-out. It is important to note that modeled roadway noise only
includes vehicular noise and measured existing noise may be much higher due to the contribution
of other noise sources and cumulative noise. As shown, traffic volume increases associated with
General Plan build-out will result in increases in noise levels of up to 16.9 dBA. A noise level
increase is considered substantial if 1) the existing noise levels exceed the objectives presented in
Table 6.3 (65 dBA for residential and noise sensitive areas) and the proposed project would
increase this noise level by 3 dBA CNEL (barely noticeable in an exterior environment) or
more); or 2) the noise level with the implementation of the proposed project would remain within
the objectives shown in Table 6.3, but the project adds 5 dBA CNEL (noticeable to most people)
or more to the pre-project noise levels. General Plan build-out will result in traffic volumes that
result in noise level increases of 5 dB or greater along most Circulation Element roadways.
Where noise level increases are less than 5 dBA but more than 3 dBA, it is likely that the
projected increase will cause ambient noise levels to exceed objective noise levels in Table 6.3.

Air and Rail Line Transportation Noise
Railroads
Three railroad providers operate on two railroad line corridors within the City of Grand Terrace.
The two rail lines are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) and the Union Pacific
(UPRR) Rail Line, and they traverse on the west portion of the City.
The Riverside Industrial Lead (RIL) of the UPRR runs along Taylor Street. There is also an
approximate 900 foot long spur that runs south of Pico Street. The predominant cargo inbound is
lumber, while outbound trains frequently carry recyclable materials. While train operations can
vary, there are on average two trains currently operating each weekday. The trains operate at no
greater than 20 mph.
There are three Amtrack and ten Metrolink passenger trains and up to 65 frieght trains that
operate on the BNSF track. Actual train volumes can vary by day, week, or month. However,
future train activity along the BNSF railroad is anticipated to increase 120 freight trains and 100
passenger trains per day to by the year 2025. Train activity for the UPRR is not expected to
increase in the near future.
There are several at-grade crossings along this rail line within the City of Grand Terrace. To alert
motorists and pedestrians to the presence of an approaching train and to avoid accidents at at-
grade crossings, locomotive engineers are required to sound a train-mounted horn as they
approach the intersection. Locomotive engineers begin sounding the temporal (long-long-short-
long) sequence that characterizes the warning signal approximately ¼ mile prior to reaching an
at-grade crossing. Federal regulations require the train horn to be at least 96 dB, 100 feet in front
of the train in its direction of travel.
Future rail noise was modeled using the Federal Transit Administration General Transit Noise
Assessment. Projected volumes are presented in Exhibit 6-2. Train horns typically generate
maximum noise levels of 85-100 dBA Lmax. This level of noise would result in unintelligible
speech and annoyance. Consequently, outdoor activities near the grade crossings may experience
temporary disruption during train horn events. Interior noise levels would also be affected by
train horn soundings. Building structures typically provide 20-25 dB attenuation from exterior to
interior noise levels with windows closed. With windows open a 12 dB reduction can be
expected. Assuming the maximum noise attenuation (windows closed), noise level intrusions due
to train horns are expected to range between 61-66 dBA at structures near the rail line.
Aircraft Noise from San Bernardino International Airport
Overflights to and from San Bernardino International Airport are audible in the City and vicinity.
The San Bernardino International Airport is operated by the San Bernardino International Airport
Authority, a joint powers authority comprised of the County of San Bernardino and the Cities of
San Bernardino, Colton, Loma Linda and Highland. San Bernardino International has been

converted to a commercial airport from its previous use as Norton Air Force Base and is seeking
to establish itself as an alternative destination for both passenger and cargo carriers.
According to the San Bernardino Airport, the Ultimate 65 dBA CNEL noise contour for the
airport does not encroach into the City of Grand Terrace.
6.3.1.3          Construction Noise
The impact of construction noise that occurs during
the daytime is considered minimal for no more
than two or three months of activity. However, late
night and weekend disturbances caused by
construction noise may create a significant impact
when experienced at nearby residential locations;
however, adherence to the City’s Noise Ordinance
which regulates construction activities will reduce
potential noise impacts.
6.3.1.4          Ground-borne Vibration and
Noise
Vibration consists of waves transmitted through solid material. Ground-borne vibration
propagates from the source through the ground to adjacent buildings by surface waves. Vibration
may be comprised of a single pulse, a series of pulses, or a continuous oscillatory motion. The
frequency of a vibrating object describes how rapidly it is oscillating, measured in Hertz (Hz).
The normal frequency range of most ground-borne vibration that can be felt generally starts from
a low frequency of less than 1 Hz to a high of about 200 Hz. Vibration energy spreads out as it
travels through the ground, causing the vibration amplitude to decrease with distance away from
the source.
Ground-borne vibration can be a concern for nearby neighbors of a transit system route or
maintenance facility by causing buildings to shake and rumbling sounds to be heard. In contrast
to airborne noise, ground-borne vibration is not a common environmental problem. It is unusual
for vibration from sources such as buses and trucks to be perceptible, even in locations close to
major roads. Some common sources of ground-borne vibration are trains, buses on rough roads,
and construction activities such as blasting, pile-driving and the operation of heavy earthmoving
equipment. The rumbling sound caused by the vibration of equipment during construction
building structures is referred to as ground-borne noise.
6.3.2 Noise Sensitive Receptors
In general, the sound levels at noise-sensitive non-residential locations within the City are not
considered excessive. However, the following areas are located within an existing or future 65
dB CNEL contour:

6.3.3 Community Noise Equivalent Contours (CNEL)
In order to establish current noise levels throughout the City, noise measurement readings were
taken at 15 representative locations within the City. Exhibit 6-1 illustrates the existing CNEL
noise contours while Exhibit 6-2 illustrates projected Year 2030 CNEL noise contours. As
indicated, it is projected that noise will continue to increase along City arterial streets, Interstate
215, and the BNSF rail line, all reflective of increased traffic.

                  1        Current. Action already implemented.
                  2        Urgent. Action should be undertaken within the next
                           fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to the
                           City.
                  3        Important. Action should be taken in the near future. It
                           may be necessary for the completion of other actions.
                  4        Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation of an
                           existing action or program. It requires no further action to
                           implement.
                  5        Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but does
                           not require short term implementation or may require
                           other actions to be taken first.
                  6        Optional. Action has a relatively low priority, but is
                           desirable. It is not critical to other actions.

7.0 PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
7.1      INTRODUCTION
The provision of quality public services and facilities is essential to the residents and businesses
of City of Grand Terrace. Public services and facilities help to define the quality of life in a
community and assist in determining its overall health and well-being. Such services are
provided by a combination of public and private agencies including all levels of government, as
well as private utilities and service companies. These services and facilities support both new
and existing development and land uses and must be continually maintained and upgraded to
meet the current and future needs of the community.
7.1.1 Purpose and Function
The Public Services and Facilities Element of the Grand Terrace General Plan identifies the
City’s goals and policies relative to the provision and maintenance of adequate services and
facilities including the following:
•        General City Services
•        Water Facilities
•        Sanitary Sewer/Wastewater Facilities
•        Solid Waste Facilities
•        Private Utilities
•        Law Enforcement Services
•        Fire Protection Services
•        Solid Waste Services and Facilities
•        Educational Facilities
The Element provides information regarding the current
status of these services and facilities, an assessment of
their current and projected levels of service, and their
ability to provide for future needs of the community.
Although this Element is not required under State planning
law, the provision of services is an integral part of the
development and maintenance of the community.
7.1.2 Related Plans and Programs
San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department: The
provision of police protection services to the City are
directly related to the overall operations plan and budget
of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.
Support services and backup deputies are managed on a
                                                  VII-1

                                                                              Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                   Public Services and Facilities Element
County-wide basis. Therefore, the police protection needs of Grand Terrace must be coordinated
with those of the unincorporated County areas and other contracted cities.
San Bernardino County Fire Protection District: Similar to the Sheriff’s Department, fire
services to the City must be coordinated with those of unincorporated County areas and other
contract cities to assure adequate support services and backup units.
San Bernardino County Library System: The City’s library system is part of the County-wide
library system operated under the County budget. Available services and support must be
coordinated throughout the system.
7.1.3 Relationship to Other Elements
The Public Services and Facilities Element is directly related to the following elements:
Land Use:        All urban land uses require the provision of public services. Residential,
commercial, industrial, and public institutional services all require domestic water, sanitary
sewer, power and telephone, and solid waste collection services. They also depend upon police
and fire protection as well as general governmental services and facilities. In addition,
residential development requires educational facilities. When determining proper land uses
within a city, consideration must be given to the location and capacity of these services.
Public Health and Safety Element: The Safety Element focuses upon hazards to humans and
property within the City. These hazards include fires, floods, and seismic activity.
Consideration must be given to the ability of these services, specifically fire and police
protection to respond to these hazards.
Circulation Element:             Critical public services such as fire stations depend upon an
efficient circulation system to provide effective response to emergency situations. Public and
private utilities are also typically located within public street right-of-way.
Open Space and Conservation Element: The Open Space and Conservation Element
includes an analysis of improved recreation facilities. Improved parkland is provided as City
parks or recreational facilities associated with public schools. The ability to construct and
maintain public parklands in accordance with the Open Space and Conservation Element is
directly tied to the provision of public services and facilities by the City and the School District.

                  1        Current. Action already implemented.
                  2        Urgent. Action should be undertaken within the next
                           fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to
                           the City.
                  3        Important. Action should be taken in the near future.
                           It may be necessary for the completion of other
                           actions.
                  4        Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                           of an existing action or program. It requires no
                           further action to implement.
                  5        Desirable. Action would benefit the community, but
                           does not require short term implementation or may
                           require other actions to be taken first.
                  6        Optional. Action has a relatively low priority, but is
                           desirable. It is not critical to other actions.

                         services and facilities necessary to serve the new development.
                         a. Every five years, the City shall conduct a Nexus study to determine whether
                         Development Impacts Fees should be modified. If warranted by the study, City
                                                                                                                  CD               CM, CS, PW                ISF         4

8.0 HOUSING ELEMENT
8.1      INTRODUCTION
8.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the City of Grand Terrace
Housing Element is to provide the residents,
development community and elected and
appointed officials with a clear
understanding of the City’s housing needs.
In order to achieve the ultimate goal of
ensuring that every Grand Terrace resident
secures a safe and decent place to live within
a satisfactory environment, the Housing
Element promotes a close coordination of
housing policies and programs at local, state
and federal levels.
8.1.2 Background
8.1.2.1         Function of the Element
The Housing Element functions as an integral part of the City’s efforts to manage the
development of incorporated lands. The City balances the need to ensure adequate housing for
all current and future residents against the need to provide infrastructure and services. The
Housing Element includes a description of existing housing types, the condition of existing units,
an analysis of overcrowding, overpayment, homelessness, and the demand for affordable housing
in the City. The Element also includes a discussion of the progress made since the drafting of
the last Housing Element, and projections of needs for the next five years.
8.1.2.2         Public Participation
The City is in the process of updating its entire General Plan, and the screen check General Plan,
including the Housing Element was posted on the City’s website. Hard copies were made
available at the public counter for review. The City held a number of workshops and public
hearings in reviewing the General Plan including the Housing Element.
In particular, workshops focusing on the Housing Element were conducted on November 1, 2007
and April 18, 2008. The November 1, 2007 workshop provided an overview of the purpose and
statutory requirements governing Housing Elements, and the April 18th workshop focused on the
contents of the proposed Housing Element. A joint City Council and Planning Commission
workshop was conducted on January 15, 2009.

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

During the November 1, 2007 Workshop, a member of the public commented that affordable
housing should be located in the center of town and that the conversion of existing apartments to
affordable housing would be preferable to new housing. In fact, Program 8.8.1.k encourages the
City to favorably consider affordable housing projects and density bonuses when they are located
in proximity to commercial centers and services. Additionally, the transition of multiple family
units to affordable housing units would be permissible. During the April 18, 2008 workshop
general questions and comments were made by the public; no specific recommendations as to
housing needs or programs were made.
The April 18th draft Housing Element was placed on the City’s website and also made available
to the Senior Center Coordinator, who reviewed the analysis and proposed senior housing
programs and found them satisfactory.
Extensive public outreach was conducted for the January 15, 2009 workshop. In addition to
placing an advertisement in the San Bernardino County Sun and publicly posting the notice, a
notice was placed on the City’s website along with the Draft Housing Element. In addition, 20
notices were sent to various community groups, service organizations and adjacent cities that
might have an interest in the Housing Element, such as the Chamber of Commerce, Lions Club,
local churches, United Way, Catholic Charities, Salvation Army, Frazee Community Center and
the San Bernardino County Housing Authority.
Duly noticed public hearings were held before the Planning Commission and City Council. All
meetings and hearings were fully noticed per State planning law. In addition notices were placed
in the Blue Mountain Outlook, which is mailed to all property owners in the City.
8.2     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS AND PROGRAMS
8.2.1 California Law
California Government Code requires that every City and County prepare a Housing Element as
part of its General Plan. In addition, State law contains specific requirements for the preparation
and content of Housing Elements. According to Article 10.6, Section 65580, the Legislature has
found that:
(1)     The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of
        decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority
        of the highest order.
(2)     The early attainment of this goal requires that cooperative participation of government
        and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and accommodate the
        housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.
(3)     The provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income households requires the
        cooperation of all levels of government.
                                                     VIII-2
Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                        Housing Element
(4)     Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to
        facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for
        the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
(5)     The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government
        also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and
        community goals set forth in the General Plan and to cooperate with other local
        governments, and the state, in addressing regional housing needs.
Section 65581 of the Government Code states that the intent of the Legislature in enacting these
requirements is:
(1)     To ensure that local governments recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
        attainment of the State housing goal.
(2)     To ensure that cities and counties prepare and implement housing elements which, along
        with federal and State programs, will move toward attainment of the State housing goal.
(3)     To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by
        it to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal as well as regional housing
        needs.
(4)     To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments to address
        regional housing needs.
Government Code Section 65583 outlines the required content of all housing elements including
identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs, and a statement of goals,
policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing. Specific requirements include the following:
(1)     An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
        the meeting of these needs. The analysis should include population and employment
        trends; documentation of household characteristics; inventory of land suitable for
        residential development; governmental and other constraints to housing development;
        analysis of any special housing needs and an assessment of existing affordable housing
        developments.
(2)     A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is
        undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the objectives
        of the housing element in order to meet the housing needs of all economic segments of
        the community.
8.2.2 Relationship to Other Plans
The Housing Element is an integral part of the General Plan and holds strong relationships with
other elements. Since residential development is a primary land use in the City, it is directly tied
to the Land Use Element and must be compatible with surrounding existing and proposed land

uses. The siting of housing is also dependent upon the location of streets and transportation
systems to move people from their homes to jobs, shopping, schools, and recreation facilities and
to provide goods and services to the residences (Circulation Element). Homes must also be
located in areas free of hazards (Public Safety Element), and away from major noise generators
(Noise Element). In addition, residents are dependent upon utilities, police, fire and other public
services (Public Services & Facilities Element) and require recreation facilities (Open Space &
Conservation Element).
8.3     REVIEW OF ELEMENT AND PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
State Housing Element guidelines require all jurisdictions to include an evaluation of their
previous Housing Element’s action plans to determine their success. Following is a review of
each action plan of the 2002 City of Grand Terrace Housing Element.
A.      Actions in Support of Housing Availability and Production
Action 1.a: The City’s Community and Economic Development Department and Building &
Safety Department will expedite the processing plans for proposed housing projects that are
affordable to low and moderate income households.
      Response:         The City maintains a project review goal of reviewing all projects and
      presenting them to the City Planning Commission within two months of receipt of a
      complete application package. This does not include those projects that require the
      preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) that must follow CEQA guidelines
      and review schedules.
Action 1.b: The City will implement an amendment to the Barton Road Specific Plan to allow
a mix of commercial and medium/high density residential development.
      Response:         In 2003, the City adopted a revision to the Barton Road Specific Plan that
      included provisions for multi-family housing in the Office/Administrative zone. This
      allows previously approved and/or constructed multi-family residential development in the
      area bounded by Barton Road, Preston Avenue, and Palm Avenue to be removed from the
      “pre-existing non-conforming” category, and allows infill multiple family and mixed use
      development within this zoning district.
Action 1.c: The City will implement Zoning Code provisions to allow for manufactured
housing in all residential zones in accordance with State law.
      Response:         In 1992, the City Zoning Ordinance was amended to allow the
      construction of manufactured housing in all residential zones in the City.
Action 1.d: The City will implement Zoning Code provisions that offer density bonuses in
accordance with the requirements of State density bonus law. The density bonus and incentives
                                                    VIII-4
Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                           Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                      Housing Element
will be made available for any for-sale or rental, single family or multi-family development of
five or more units, when requested by a developer who agrees to restrict affordability of the units
for a minimum of 30 years, as follows:
        20% of the total units affordable to lower income households; or
        10% of the total units affordable to very low income households; or
        50% of the total units affordable to senior citizens.
Additional incentives may include, but are not limited to reduced site development standards or
Zoning Code requirements, direct financial assistance, reduced or deferred fees, approval of
mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing development, or other regulatory incentives
which would result in an identifiable cost avoidance or reduction, or a density bonus of more
than 25%. Allocation of the specific additional incentives will be made on a case-by-case basis,
depending on resources available to the City from which to grant the incentive, and the
particular needs of the development to ensure affordability.
      Response:        The City has not yet amended the Zoning Code to incorporate specific
      density bonus requirements per State density bonus law.
Action 1.e: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will continue to allocate funds, a process,
which began in 1993, for the upgrading and expansion of the mobile home parks within the City.
The City Manager’s office has solicited proposals for an initial project, but has yet to receive
positive response from the mobile home park owners/residents.
      Response:        Although the program remains in effect conceptually, there have been no
      formal proposals from mobile home park owners for funds to upgrade or expand their
      parks. However, in 2002, the Grand Terrace Mobile Home Park, requested and was
      granted approval to add four units to the park. As part of the approval, the Community
      Redevelopment Agency contributed $50,000 toward required offsite street improvements.
Action 1.f: The City Manager’s Office will continue to offer low interest bond financing and
redevelopment tax increment assistance in the form of land write down to qualified developers
for the construction of mixed use senior development, with the expectation that at least 50 – 75
senior units will be provided and a requirement that 30% of the units (at least 20) will be
affordable to the “very low” income.
      Response:        In 2005, the CRA approved an agreement to contribute $9,000,000 toward
      the construction of an affordable senior housing project located adjacent to the City’s
      Senior Center near the corner of Mount Vernon Avenue and Grand Terrace Road. The
      project includes 72 senior housing units for very low income senior, 36 housing units for
      low income seniors, and 12 units for moderate income households.
Action 1.g: The Grand Terrace Redevelopment Agency, in conjunction with the City’s
Community & Economic Development Department and Building & Safety Department will
prepare an annual report describing the results of the past year’s progress in meeting the
                                                    VIII-5
Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                        Housing Element
housing needs of the community. Specific quantifiable data is to be provided showing the
proportion of the units assisted and the number of units constructed, rehabilitated and
conserved.
       Response:         Each year, the Community Redevelopment Agency, through the City’s
       Department of Finance, prepares an “Annual Report to the Legislative Body” as required
       under State Redevelopment Law. The report presents information relative to progress
       made in meeting affordable housing goals and a summary of how low/moderate housing
       funds are spent. The report is submitted to the Community Redevelopment Agency Board
       of Directors at the end of each calendar year.
Action 1.h: The City Manager’s Office will continue to utilize the services of the Inland
Mediation Board, through an existing contract with the County of San Bernardino, for fair
housing, landlord tenant dispute resolution and senior shared housing. Monthly activity reports
will be obtained from the Inland Mediation Board in order to monitor local compliance with fair
housing laws.
       Response:         Although the services of the Inland Mediation Board are available, there
       have not been any landlord/tenant disputes brought before the City for resolution during the
       previous planning period.
Action 1.i:       The City Manager’s Office will continue to utilize the services of the San
Bernardino County Housing Resource Board, through an existing contract with the County of
San Bernardino, to provide outreach and educational information on State and Federal fair
housing laws.
       Response:         Although the services of the County Resource Housing Board are
       available, the City has not had any requests from the general public for information
       regarding State and federal housing laws. In the event that requests are made, the City will
       use the Board’s services.
Action 1.j:       The City Manager’s Office will pursue participation in the San Bernardino
County Mortgage Revenue Bond Financing Programs for the development of single and multi-
family housing, if feasible, and as developer interest warrants.
       Response:         There has been no developer interest in mortgage revenue bonds within
       the City over the past planning period. The program remains available in the event that
       interest is shown by the development community. The City’s Housing Office webpage will
       provide a link to this County program.
Action 1.k: The City’s Community & Economic Development Department will continue to
utilize the City’s General Plan and Zoning Code to provide adequate, suitable sites for the
development of approximately 1,008 new housing units by build out of the community, 321 of
which would be affordable to low and very low income households.

      Response:        As illustrated in Table 8.1, during the planning period of 1998 through
      2005, 93 new residential units were approved and/or constructed within the City of Grand
      Terrace of which 34 were designated as affordable. These included the addition of four
      coach spaces to the Grand Terrace Mobile Home Park and the construction of the Father
      Serra Seminary with rooms for 26 students.

Action 1.l:      Omitted from previous document.
Action 1.m: The City’s Community & Economic Development Department will continue to
create and maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized sites suitable for housing
development. This information will be distributed to developers in order to facilitate housing
production.
      Response:        All developers interested in pursuing housing projects within the City are
      encouraged to meet with the Community Development Director to review potential project
      sites. This information is made available to anyone showing interest in the community.
Action 1.n: The City’s Community & Economic Development Department will initiate an
amendment to the City’s Zoning Code to create a new R3+ zone with a density of 20 units/acre
and with a density bonus to 25 units/acre to be utilized for very low income housing. This new
category will be applied to Site No. 6 or other appropriate sites to meet housing needs of the
City.
      Response:        In 2007, the City Council adopted a new General Plan designation of
      Medium High Density Residential (20 units/acre) and a Zoning Code designation of R3S
      (Multi-Family Residential – Senior) with a density of 20 units/acre in response to a 120
      unit mixed use senior housing proposal.
Action 1.o: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will allocate funds to be committed to the
“Habitat for Humanity” for the development of low-income housing.
      Response:        During the previous planning period, the Habitat for Humanity did not
      propose any projects within the city limits of Grand Terrace. Therefore, no low-moderate
      income housing funds were committed.

low-income households.
      Response:         The City has not issued any mortgage revenue bonds for affordable
      housing projects during the planning period. The City has not been approached by any
      developers requesting the issuance of such bonds during this period.
Action 2.g: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will issue tax exempt mortgage revenue bonds to

      Response:         The City Zoning Ordinance continues to permit the development of
      residential care facilities within the City. However, no proposed residential care projects
      were submitted to the City Community & Economic Development Department for review
      during the planning period.
Action 2.i: The City’s CEDD–Planning Division will continue to participate in and provide staff
support for the various homeless programs operated by the San Bernardino County Homeless
Coalition.
      Response:         The Community & Economic Development Department has made staff
      available, but has not actively participated in County-sponsored homeless programs.
Action 2.j: The City Manager’s Office will offer to open facilities at City Hall and the City Yard
to provide emergency shelter during times of extreme weather or hardship.
      Response:         The City’s Senior Center has been identified as an emergency shelter

      homes were processed through the program. Since 2005, local housing market conditions
      have made the provision of affordable single family units difficult due to high costs and
      unreasonable subsidy requirements. In the event that housing costs return to former levels,
      the program will be reactivated.
Action 2.l: The City Housing Office will seek an available State grant to provide up to $20,000
to a qualified owner/buyer for the purpose of the rehab, replacement or purchase of a mobile

      Department is partially funded by Low/Moderate Housing Funds of the CRA. The
      program includes to issuance of public information and technical assistance to homeowners
      and owners of rental units regarding the maintenance of the current housing stock. In
      addition, the City established a rental inspection program in 2007 to inspect all rental units

      associated permit fees.
Action 3.c: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will continue to publicize and provide financial
assistance for the rehabilitation of residences owned or occupied by low and moderate income
persons. This financial assistance will be made available in the form of below market rate and
deferred payment loans for home rehabilitation, matching grants for the rehabilitation of rental
housing and funds for the Agency to purchase and rehabilitate housing for resale to low and
moderate income households. Approximately $1,500,000 in housing set-aside funds have been
allocated for this purpose. Objectives are to rehabilitate six units and conserve six units per
year.
      Response:         The City has maintained a first time buyers program through the
      rehabilitation and resale of homes to qualified low/moderate income families. This

      includes the provision of “silent second” mortgages to supplement standard mortgage
      programs. The last unit of the program was sold in 2005. Since then, the current housing
      and mortgage markets have prohibited continuation of the program. In the event that the
      market and home prices return to former levels, the program will be reactivated.
Action 3.d: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will allocate funds for payment of required off-
site improvements for affordable housing projects.
      Response:         In 2002, the CRA contributed $50,000 toward offsite improvements
      associated with the addition of four new affordable mobile home spaces at the Grand
      Terrace Mobile Home Park. The CRA is also contributing to offsite improvements as part
      of the Blue Mountain Villas Senior Housing project.
Action 3.e: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will allow for the construction of bedroom
additions with funding from its residential rehabilitation program when needed to eliminate
overcrowding.

      architectural barriers and provide ADA accessible sidewalks to residential areas of the City.
Action 3.h: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will continue to monitor housing conditions
throughout the City in order to establish target areas for rehabilitation efforts.
      Response:         The City continuously monitors the conditions of housing throughout the
      City through its Code Enforcement program.
Action 3.i: The City’s CEDD–Planning Division and BS/PW/H will review all changes in
planned land uses to determine the cumulative impact on community facilities and municipal
services, in order to assure that adequate facilities and service levels are provided to all
residents.

alternatives for households with varying incomes, household sizes and compositions, and
lifestyles. As shown in Table 8.5 below, the tenure of housing in the City of Grand Terrace is
nearly identical to that in the County of San Bernardino.

8.4.1.5         Household Income Characteristics
Household income is a primary factor addressing housing needs in a community because the
ability of a household to afford housing is related to the household’s income. The 2007 median
income for a four-person household within the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) is $59,200. The County median of $59,200 is used to determine the
income category a four-person household falls into, as shown in Table 8.8.

8.4.2.1           Historic Residential Construction Trends
Table 8.12 shows residential construction activity in Grand Terrace for the period from 1998 to
2008. This data is tabulated based on the 2000 Census housing unit count and City Building
permit records since 1998. During the previous planning period 1998-2005 93 units were
constructed, four of which were constructed by the City of Grand Terrace Redevelopment
Agency through their first time homebuyer program. The rapid growth that has occurred in
many San Bernardino County cities during the 1998-2005 planning period did not occur to the
same extent in Grand Terrace. However, during the first three years of the current planning
period, 215 new building permits were issued. The bulk of which were multiple family dwelling
permits, and mainly the Agency subsidized Blue Mountain Senior Villas affordable housing
development.

As illustrated by the 2000 State Department of Finance figures shown in Table 8.13, 66 percent
of Grand Terrace’s housing units are single family; 28 percent are multi-family and 6 percent are
mobile homes. These percentages of single family units relative to multi-family and mobile
homes are fairly comparable to that of adjacent cities, including Colton, Loma Linda and
Redlands. The overall percentage of single family homes in the County is 72%, slightly higher
than Grand Terrace and the adjacent cities.

8.4.2.2          Age of Residential Structures
The age of a structure has a significant effect on its physical condition. However, by itself, age
is not a valid indicator of housing condition, since proper care and continued maintenance will
extend the physical and economic life of a unit. One the other hand, a lack of normal
maintenance coupled with an aging housing stock can lead to the serious deterioration of
individual units and entire neighborhoods.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2,973 units (67.6 percent of the City’s housing
stock) were more than 25 years old. Proper and continued maintenance of older housing is
important in extending the life of a home. It also is important in maintaining the general well-
being of the surrounding neighborhoods.
Although two-thirds of the housing stock is over 25 years old, most residential structures are well
maintained. An exterior windshield housing survey was conducted in March of 2008. This
sample survey was limited to those areas in the City where the housing stock is known to be
older, and included approximately 22% of the City’s housing stock. The windshield survey
categorized the condition of the housing stock into three levels: those needing no rehabilitation;
those needing moderate rehabilitation such as exterior repainting or missing roof shingles; and
those needing substantial rehabilitation, such as sagging roofs or walls.

                                                                               Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                      Housing Element
The sample survey found that approximately 79 units may need moderate rehabilitation and only
two units may need substantial rehabilitation. This suggests that overall the City’s housing stock
is in good condition. This estimate seems reasonable given that the housing market was strong
during the previous housing planning period, and rising property values encouraged homeowners
to make necessary repairs. Also, the City is proactive in ensuring that properties are well
maintained.
8.4.2.3         Overcrowding
The size of residential structures (number of rooms including bathrooms, halls, closets, and
kitchens.) is an important factor in assessing whether the housing stock is adequately
accommodating the community’s population. An average size residential unit has five rooms
(kitchen, dining/family room, living room and two bedrooms), according to the U.S. Census, and
can accommodate a family of up to five without being considered overcrowded. Overcrowding
is said to occur when there is more than one resident per room, excluding bathrooms, and severe
overcrowding exists when there are more than 1.5 residents per room. According to the 2000
Census and as summarized in Table 8.14, only 2 percent of owner-occupied households are
experiencing overcrowding, while 11.8% of renter-occupied housing are experiencing
overcrowding. Of the 11.8%, half are experiencing severe overcrowding conditions. This
demonstrates that overcrowding is more prevalent in renter-occupied housing, and is comparable
to San Bernardino County. However, Grand Terrace maintains a low incidence of severe
overcrowding than the County.

8.4.2.4         Vacancy Rates
The residential vacancy rate, a translation of the number of unoccupied housing units on the
market, is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a community.
When the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate will be low.
Concomitantly, a low vacancy rate drives the cost of housing upward to the disadvantage of
prospective buyers or renters.

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

In a healthy housing market, the vacancy rate would be between 5.0 and 8.0 per cent. These
vacant units should be distributed across a variety of housing types, sizes, price ranges and
locations within the City. This allows adequate selection opportunities for households seeking
new residences.
The 2000 State Department of Finance reports estimate a City-wide vacancy rate for Grand
Terrace of 5.0 percent, suggesting a healthy balance between housing supply and demand. This
rate compares favorably to the County, which was recorded by the State Department of Finance
to have an overall vacancy rate of 14.5%.
8.4.2.5         Housing Affordability
The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) publishes
affordable housing income limits for states and regions. The HUD 2007 income limits for low
and moderate income groups for the Riverside –San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical
Area (MSA) are summarized in Table 8.15. As noted, the 2007 median income for a four-person
household in San Bernardino County is $59,200 per year.

According to State and Federal standards for
housing overpayment, a household should
pay no more than 30 percent of its gross
income on housing. Households paying
greater than 30 percent have limited
remaining income for other necessities such
as food, clothing, and health care. Above-
Moderate households, which are households
earning more than 120% of median income,
are generally capable of paying a larger
proportion of their income for housing;
therefore, estimates of housing overpayment
generally focus on lower income groups.

Based on these guidelines that households should not spend more than 30 percent of their gross
income on housing, Table 8.16 estimates the maximum housing costs affordable to Extremely
Low, Very Low Income, Low Income and Moderate Income households in Grand Terrace. The
rents shown do not include allowance for utilities that may impose additional costs to the renter
of $50 to $100 per month, depending on which utilities the renter is responsible for paying.
Renters may be required to cover water, sewer and trash pickup costs in addition to the usual
electric, gas and phone. The addition of these costs may cause rental of a unit that would
otherwise be affordable to become a condition of overpayment. The maximum purchase price
includes payment on principal and interest, and an assumed 1.25% allocation for taxes and
homeowner insurance. Taxes and insurance may exceed the assumed 1.25% in newer areas
subject to assessments, Mello-Roos districts or high fire hazard. A 10 percent down payment
and a 6 percent interest rate are assumed, reflecting 2007 market conditions.

      HUD Affordability requirements, April 2007.
    Median income: $59,200.00
    Note: Calculation of affordable rent is based on a monthly payment of 30 percent of gross household
    income. Calculation of affordable home sales price based on down payment of 10 percent, annual interest
    rate of 6 percent, 30-year fixed rate mortgage, and monthly payment of 30 percent of gross income.
As shown Table 8.16, the maximum housing costs affordable to an Extremely Low Income four-
person household are $60,000 to purchase a home and $444 a month to rent a home. For a Very
Low Income four-person household are $90,300 to purchase a home and $740 per month to rent
a home. For a Low Income four-person household the maximum affordable housing costs are
$176,200 to purchase a home and $1,183 per month to rent a home. For a Moderate Income four-
person household the maximum affordable housing costs are $270,100 to purchase a home and
$1,776 per month to rent a home.
For comparison purposes, Table 8.17 shows historic single family home sales for the City of
Grand Terrace from 1997 to 2007. This Table shows that the average cost per square foot in
2007 is three times more than the cost was in 1997.

Late 2007 home sales listing in local newspapers indicate that the average sales price for a single
family residence in the City of Grand Terrace is approximately $230 per square foot. Assuming
this average per foot price, a typical three bedroom, two bath home of 1,500 square feet costs
$345,000, approximately 22 percent above the Moderate Income maximum purchase price.
A search of current market housing rental rates on Craigslist.com revealed average monthly rates
of $1,088 for two bedroom homes, and average monthly rates of $1,528 for homes with three or
more bedrooms. This means that two bedroom homes would not be affordable to extremely low
and very low income households, and only higher income households could afford homes with
three bedrooms or more.
8.4.2.6        Overpayment
According to SCAG, and as shown on Table 8.18 below, a significant number of lower income
households in the City of Grand Terrace are overpaying for housing. That is, paying more than
30% of their gross income towards housing costs. Specifically, 67% of all lower income
(extremely low, very low and low ) renter households and 57% of lower income owner
households are overpaying for housing.

* % of County median income
Although the City has a smaller percentage of its total households within the lower income
categories than San Bernardino County, the City has a higher percentage of its lower income
households overpaying for housing than San Bernardino County, and other neighboring cities.
Overall, 62% of the City’s households (both renter and owner occupied households) were
overpaying for housing. In neighboring communities such as the cities of Riverside, Loma
Linda, Colton and San Bernardino, the percentage of lower income households overpaying
ranged from 43% to 55%, with Loma Linda being the highest.
Overpayment disproportionately affects extremely low, -very low and -low-income households
more so than higher income households. Low-income households that are overpaying for
housing, frequently have insufficient resources for other critical essentials including food and
medicine. This is a significant hardship for many workers, families and seniors.
8.5      HOUSING NEEDS
8.5.1 Existing Needs
Although the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) included analysis of each
community’s existing need, the California Department of Housing and Community Development
has indicated that the existing need analysis was to be used as a guide in identifying adequate
sites to accommodate the projected growth, and in identifying and establishing appropriate
programs and policies. The analysis determined that the City should have a total of 1,225
housing units, well below the 4,401 currently occurring in the City.

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

The differences between the projected goals and what was achieved is primarily measured by the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation Model. Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) establishes the RHNA for the City of Grand Terrace. The RHNA identifies the City’s
existing and future housing need broken down into four household income categories:
        “Very Low” - less than 50 percent of the median income
        “Low” - 50 to 80 percent of the median income;
        “Moderate” - 80 to 120 percent of the median income; and
        “Above Moderate” - more than 120 percent of the median.
 The previous planning period (1998-2005), shown in Table 8.19 below, included the following
 RHNA target numbers:
                                             Table 8.19

                       Very Low                                      39
                       Low                                           33
                       Moderate                                      52
                       Above-Moderate                               120
                       Total                                        244
The 2000-2005 Housing Element identified that the City contained adequate residentially zoned
sites to accommodate 244 additional residential units, as required by Housing Element law. As
indicated previously, the City did not experience the significant housing boom within the 200-
2005 cycle that many of the surrounding jurisdictions did due to its geographic limits. Ninety-
three units were constructed during this program cycle, and 34 were affordable units. The City
conserved 111-low income rental units at the Highlands Apartments that were at risk to convert
to market rate units in 1999, through the use of its housing set-aside funds to secure these units
until 2030.
8.5.2 2006-2014 RHNA
In June 2007, SCAG issued new RHNA target numbers for the current planning period. Table
8.20 lists the 2006-2014 allocation for the City of Grand Terrace by income category.

8.5.3 Resource Inventory
8.5.3.1          Land Inventory
State planning law requires that all Housing Elements provide an inventory of available land that
may be used for affordable housing projects. The available properties must include the
following:
•     Vacant residentially zoned sites
•     Vacant non-residentially zoned
      sites that allow residential uses
•     Underutilized residentially zoned
      sites, which are capable of being
      developed at a higher density or
      with greater intensity.
•     Non-residentially zoned sites that
      can be redeveloped for and/or
      rezoned for residential uses.
An inventory of all currently vacant or
underutilized parcels currently zoned
for residential development or that
permits residential development was
prepared. Table 8.21 through Table
8.26 lists all parcels by Assessor’s Parcel Number, current zoning and General Plan designation,
acreage, and realistic development density.

Table 8.21       Single Family Residential Hillside (RH) Zoned Properties
Parcels zoned RH are found along the west side of Blue Mountain. The permitted density within
the RH zone is one dwelling unit per acre. These parcels are characterized as large rural
residential lots on steep hilly terrain and numerous development constraints including steep
slopes, landslide potential, high fire hazards, sensitive habitat, excessive grading requirements,
limited access, and utility constraints. In consideration of the existing topography and other
physical constraints the City requires that development be subject to a specific plan or master
plan to establish site development standards such as setbacks, height limits and density, on a
project by project basis. Although the specific plan would allow flexibility in design and
development standards, these parcels are typically considered too expensive for affordable
housing due to the development constraints. Based on an analysis of the properties, the realistic
capacity within the RH zone is 72 additional single family lots.

Table 8.23       Single Family Residential - 10,000 sq. ft. min. (R1-10) Parcels
R1-10 parcels are characterized as a transition zone between the more rural R1-20 lots and
standard 7,200 square foot single family lots. The minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet and
they are generally located along the foot of Blue Mountain in areas of milder slopes and fewer
constraints than R1-20 and RH lots. Underutilized lots in this zone district consist of large lots
with only one residential unit that could be subdivided. Permissible density within this zone
district is 1-4 dwelling units per acre. Residential development standards for this zone district
are contained in Table 8.33. For single family development, the development standards are
typically not a constraint, and can be met. Realistic density is 3 dwelling units per acres, and the
identified parcels could support a total of 28 additional units.

The R1-7.2 residential zone is the standard zone for typical single family development in the
City. Lots are typically 7,200 square in size and were created in larger subdivisions. Permitted
density in this zone district is 1-5 dwelling units per acre. Residential development standards for
this zone district are contained in
Table 8.33. The development
standards are typical for single
family development and similar to
surrounding jurisdictions. They are
not a constraint to single family
development. Remaining R1-7.2
available lots are generally older
infill lots or residences on larger
lots that could be subdivided to
create additional housing
opportunities. Lots created under
this zone designation can be

Table 8.25       Multi-Family Residential (R2) Parcels
R-2 zoned parcels allow for
standard single family residential
units and lower density multi-family
residential units including duplexes,
triplexes, and fourplexes. These
residential units are permitted by
right. Permitted density in this zone
district is 1-9 dwelling units per
acre. Many of these lots are located
on the west side of the City and are
currently occupied by older rural
residential units. Residential
development standards for this zone
district are contained in Table 8.33. The underutilized sites identified below each contain an
existing residence. Given the sizes of these lots there is adequate underutilized area to be able to
accommodate additional units. Additionally, because of the existing residence it is likely that at
most one or two residential units would be accommodated, as identified in Table 8.26, resulting in
duplexes and/or triplexes. With this small level of development, the existing residential uses are
not a constraint to development on these lots because they can usually be incorporated into the
design of development. It is anticipated that a minimum of 39 multiple family units could be
constructed under the permitted base density. There is the ability for developers to apply for
density bonuses that would allow densities greater than that permitted, and development

                                                uses. Residential development standards for this
                                                zone district are contained in Table 8.33. Almost
                                                all of the underutilized sites identified above
                                                contain an existing residence, and all but one lot
                                                measure at least one half acre in size, which is
                                                adequate underutilized area to be able to
                                                accommodate additional units. Additionally,
                                                because of the existing residence it is likely that at
                                                most one or two residential units would be
                                                accommodated, as identified in Table 8.26,
                                                resulting in duplexes and/or triplexes. With this
                                                small level of development, the existing residential
use is not a significant constraint to development on these lots because one or two additional
units can be incorporated into the design of development. There is the ability for developers to
apply for density bonuses that would allow densities greater than permitted, and development
incentives which would include a relaxing of development standards. Further, it should be noted
that of the three sites that have been identified for re-zoning to accommodate lower income
households, two of the sites, Site A and Site D will be re-zoned to a density of 20 units per acre
to accommodate the City’s remaining affordable housing need of 27 units, in accordance with
state housing law.
Table 8.26 includes the existing mobile home park, over the long term, should it redevelop it
cold generate up to 233 multiple family units. However, for purposes of adequate sites, this
parcel is not included in the final calculations. Therefore, exclusive of the mobile home park, a
total of 46 additional multiple family units could develop within the R-3 zone district.

Exhibit 8-1 depicts the available R-2 and R-3 sites identified in Tables 8.25 and 8.26.
In addition to the parcels identified in the Tables above, a proposed mixed use development
adjacent to I-215 and south of Barton Road could generate an additional 175 multi-family
residential units. As illustrated in Table 8.27 , approximately 447 new units could be constructed
at buildout. Assuming that 20 percent of all units under the R2, R3 BRSP-OP zoning and Mixed
Use project were designated for affordable households, approximately 52 affordable units could
be constructed. Assuming that those developments qualified for a minimum 20 percent density
bonus pursuant to state law for an additional 52 units, a minimum of 104 affordable housing
units could be constructed. It should be noted that this assumption uses minimum thresholds. A
developer would not be precluded from designating more than 20 percent of the development as
affordable housing units, and would in fact be encouraged to do so. The higher the percentage of
designated affordable units, the greater the density bonus that could be granted, based on state
and local housing laws.

         Footnote: 1 A minimum density bonus of 20% assuming minimum affordability
         thresholds are met for very low and low income households. State law allows a
         density bonus of up to 35%.
Generally speaking, the single family residential designations will typically house moderate and
above-moderate household groups. The multiple family residential and mixed use designations
are typically expected to house lower income households because of their density and economies
of scale. Using this presumption, Table 8.27, above, demonstrates that based on the available
sites inventory there is sufficient land for 447 residential units to accommodate the projected
growth allocated in the RHNA, with the potential for at least 104 additional affordable housing
units.

8.5.3.2          Suitability of Non-Vacant Sites
Development Trends: As discussed above the City is relying on its multiple family zone
districts and BRSP-OP zone district, and anticipated mixed use project to generate extremely
low-, very low- and low-income housing. Over the last planning period five multiple family
projects have been constructed in the multiple family zone districts. Table 8.28 below list the
projects and project densities. In addition, during this planning cycle the construction of Blue
Mountain Senior Villas will be completed, and provide 120 affordable housing units at a density
of 20 dwelling units per acre. Approximately $9 million dollars of Low/Moderate Housing Funds
have been committed to this project. Because of the economies of scale associated with
multiple family developments, it is likely that such development will continue to provide
affordable housing during this planning cycle. It is evident that incentives will need to continue
to be provided to encourage higher densities, either in the form of financial assistance and/or
relief from regulatory standards such as maximum densities, setbacks, parking and other
development standards. Programs 8.8.1.d, 8.8.1.j and 8.8.1.k encourage such actions.
A proposed 100-acre specific plan project is proposed adjacent to I-215 and south of Barton
Road. The project area is comprised of vacant and non-vacant land, some owned by the City of
Grand Terrace, and includes the assimilation of multiple parcels and redevelopment of lands.
This project includes a mixed use component and it is anticipated that an additional 175 multiple
family residential units would be generated. Because a specific plan is being proposed for the
project it has the added benefit of creating the development standards that would apply to the
residential component.
Multiple family development in the BRSP-OP zone are allowed a density of 1-12 units per acre
and are subject to the residential standards contained in Chapter 18.10 (RH, R1, R2 and R3
Zones) and shown in Table 8.33. Under the provisions of the Barton Road Specific Plan for
mixed use development, the residential component is not tied to the development standards
shown in Table 8.33. The residential component; however, is restricted to second floor levels of
buildings. Mixed use development would be subject to the standards of the underlying zone
district, including lot coverage, height, parking and setbacks. Densities may not exceed those of
the residential, commercial and industrial designations of the General Plan and zoning; and it is
anticipated that densities will be established through the Mixed-Use process.

Market conditions: Grand Terrace is a small bedroom community located amidst the
employment areas of surrounding jurisdictions, and adjacent to the I-215 Freeway, a major
commuting corridor to jobs in Los Angeles and Orange Counties.
The City incorporated 30 years ago and since then has grown moderately by an average of three
percent per year. The City is striving to create a commercial tax base and develop its industrial
sector to create and retain jobs and increase revenues. In turn, this will assist in balancing jobs
and housing, as we are currently housing rich and jobs poor.
One of the major obstacles to providing housing to meet the needs of all economic segments of
the community is the nature of the housing market itself. The rate at which housing costs
accelerated during the 1990’s and 2000’s created a serious national problem. This problem was
magnified in California as a whole, and particularly in Inland Empire communities such as
Grand Terrace, where housing costs rapidly inflated. As a result of the housing boom of the
early 2000’s, housing in Grand Terrace has become less affordable with the cost of a typical
single family residence increasing an average of 260 percent from 2000 to 2007.
To encourage affordable housing, Programs A1.d, A1.j and A1.k are proposed within the
planning period that promotes providing relief from regulatory standards, including density
limitations, and/or financial relief for projects that create affordable housing. This program is
applicable to any proposed affordable housing projects; include those proposed on identified
underutilized sites.
8.5.3.3             Realistic Capacity
The City evaluated the implementation of its multiple family residential development standards,
including building height, building setbacks, building coverage and parking requirements by
reviewing recent multiple family development projects. These projects are included in the list
provided in Table 8.28 above. These projects are located in the R-3 zone and most of the
projects were constructed at a density of about 11 units per acre which is comparable with the
realistic capacity identified in Table 8.26 R3 Zoned Available Parcels.
                                                                   VIII-39

Two other multiple family projects were built/approved prior to the last planning period. The
556-unit Highlands Apartments were built prior to the City’s incorporation and this 34.76-acre
development yielded a density of 16 units per acre. One hundred and eleven of the units have
affordability covenants governing them. The Preston Condo project, already recorded, has a
permitted density of 15 units per acre, and will require design review of the housing product.
At this time, the density of the residential component of the anticipated mixed use project is now
known. However, it is expected that 175 residential units will be constructed.
8.5.3.4          Zoning for Lower Income Households
Typically, it is difficult to accommodate affordable housing within single family development
without substantial subsidies, such as silent seconds, down payment assistance, etc. In the last
planning cycle Grand Terrace’s Housing Office has purchased and rehabbed single family units
and sold to affordable households; however, with the rise in housing prices the Housing Office
had to suspend the program. It is anticipated that the program will become active again during
this current planning cycle.
Usually, because of the economies of scale, affordable housing projects are generally developed
in zone districts that allow multiple family developments, such as the City’s R-2, R-3 and Barton
Road Specific Plan properties zoned for Infill Residential development. Therefore, the City
anticipates that housing for lower income households will be built on these zone districts.
Grand Terrace is a small bedroom community working towards creating a greater commercial
tax and industrial base to improve the city’s jobs housing balance which is currently housing rich
and jobs poor. As shown in Table 8.28, multiple family units have been approved and/or
developed indicating that the market is accommodating multiple family projects . However, only
the Blue Mountain Senior Villas project contains affordable rental housing units, which received
substantial subsidies from the City’s low-mod housing fund. Even with the opportunities for
financial subsidies, bonuses and development incentives, there is reluctance by developers to
accommodate affordable housing due to the recordation of long-term affordability covenants.
The multiple development projects built or approved over the last 5 years demonstrate that
development is being constructed in accordance with the realistic capacity for the R-3 zone
district. The developments are able to meet the provisions of the development standards for the
R-3 zone. The one affordable project is the Blue Mountain Senior Villas which is built at a
density of 20 units per acre. A specific plan was also developed as part of this project, which
allows the developer to establish their own development standards in relation to the site and
project characteristics. This in turn provides a tremendous amount of flexibility in development.
It should be noted that the Senior Villas project at a density of 20 units per acres was built which
stricter provisions in lot coverage and building height than that permitted in the Zoning Code, but
at a lesser standard for parking (0.75 parking spaces per unit as opposed to 2 spaces per unit.

                                                                             Resolution No. 2010-10

Density does influence the financial feasibility of projects; however the constraint to affordable
housing in Grand Terrace has not necessarily been density but rather an interest by developers to
construct affordable units.
Based on the analysis contained in Table 8.37, which takes into consideration, approved and
constructed projects, the City will still need to accommodate 27 units for lower income
households during the planning period. Five sites have been identified that could accommodate
multiple family development at densities of 20 units per acre. The locations of the five sites have
been identified in Tables 8.25 and 8.26. Because the five sites would accommodate more than
27 units; the City is proposing to only re-zone, at this time, Sites A and D at a density of 20 units
per acre to accommodate the remaining housing need for the remaining 27 units affordable to
lower income households.
Program 8.8.1.s identifies that Sites A and D will be re-zoned at a density of 20 units per acre to
accommodate the remaining housing need of 27 units affordable to lower-income households. In
accordance with the California Government Code, the re-zoned sites allow exclusively multiple
family and senior residential uses, and permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential
uses by-right.
8.5.3.5         Financial Inventory
In order to assist in the provision of affordable housing, California State law provides for a “set
aside” of a minimum of 20 percent of all tax increment revenues collected by City
Redevelopment Agencies for low-and moderate-income housing. The City of Grand Terrace
Community Redevelopment Agency has established a Low/Moderate Housing Fund for the
disposition of this tax increment. The fund is used to rehabilitate the existing housing stock and
convert units to affordable housing, control blight through funding the City’s Code Enforcement
Program, and assist developers in the provision of new affordable housing projects. Presently,
the majority of available Low/Moderate Housing Funds have been committed to the Blue
Mountain Villas Senior Housing project which will provide 120 senior housing units ranging
from the very low to moderate rent structure. Approximately $9 million of Low/Moderate
Housing Funds are committed to the project. It is estimated that at the end of Fiscal Year 07/08,
approximately $500,000 remained available for new and rehabilitated housing projects. An
additional $300,000 to $350,000 in new Low/Moderate Housing Funds will be generated
annually for use in new affordable housing projects, depending upon fluctuations in property tax
valuations in the City.

8.5.4 Special Housing Needs
There are households with identifiable special needs, as defined by California law for which the
City must plan. Such groups have a greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due
to special circumstances, which may be related to employment, income, family characteristics,
disability or other conditions. As a result, some residents may experience a higher prevalence of
overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems. These groups include the disabled, the
elderly, large households, female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless. Each
special needs category is discussed in greater detail below.

Disabled persons have special housing needs. Depending on the disability their needs may be
proximity to public transit, services, and the workplace. Housing needs may include ramps,
lowered countertops, and widened doorways. As shown in Table 8.29, almost 18% of the City’s
working population (ages between 16-64 years) has a disability, with 63% having an
employment disability. For those aged 65 years and older, 43% have a disability. Included
within these disabilities are persons with disabilities that limit their ability to leave the home
(37% of the working population and 45% of the senior population, respectively). These statistics
are similar to San Bernardino County.
8.5.4.2         The Elderly
As reported in the 2000 Census 1,245 persons, or approximately 10.7 percent of the population
of Grand Terrace were over 65 years of age. Table 8.30 breaks down the age groups within this
population even further. The percentage of the elderly population is expected to increase during
the next decade due to two factors:
1)      The U.S. population nationwide is aging as the baby boom population (born between
        1946 and 1964) approaches their senior years; and
2)      Many long time residents chose to stay in the City.
Affordability can be an issue of special concern to the elderly, who are often on fixed retirement
incomes. In addition, the elderly may require assistance with housekeeping, maintenance, and
repairs to remain in their own homes as long as possible. Special design features that may be
needed include elimination of barriers such as steps and the provision of recreational and social
amenities for the elderly.

8.5.4.3         Large Family Households
Large households are an indicator of need for large units. Large households are generally
defined as households with 5 or more persons. According to the 2000 Census, Grand Terrace
has 500 households consisting of five or more persons. Table 8.31 shows that the City’s total
number of occupied housing units is made up predominately of 1 and 2-person households.
Approximately 12% of occupied housing units are occupied by large households. This suggests
that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected to be significantly less than
the need for smaller units.

8.5.4.4         Female Headed Households
As reported by the 2000 Census, of the 4,221 occupied households in Grand Terrace, 1,210, or
28% are headed by females. These families often have special housing needs, including a strong
demand for affordable housing because of the income limitations of single earner households.
8.5.4.5         Farmworker Housing
Based on the 2000 Census, there are 5,917 employed residents over the age of 16 years. Of
those workers, only 13 (0.2%) persons are employed as farm workers. Because the number of
existing employees in Grand Terrace are identified as being farm workers is so small, it is
anticipated that that their housing needs will be met through programs designed for lower income
households.
8.5.4.6         Homeless
Amendments to Housing Element Law require local governments to plan for the provision of
shelters and transitional housing for homeless persons and families and the identification of
adequate sites. A person is homeless if he or she lacks a fixed regular and adequate nighttime

residence and has a primary nighttime residence that is either a public or private shelter, an
institution that provided temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized, or a
public or private location that was not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
accommodation for human beings. A need is said to exist if one person in a locality is without
shelter or if the type of shelter available is inappropriate.
Homelessness is often cited as one of the most prominent indicators of our nation’s social and
economic condition. Even during the unprecedented economic boom of the late 1990’s, the
rising tide of the economy did not lift all boats. As income inequality increased, the economic
security of low-income families decreased. In 2003, the San Bernardino County 2003 Homeless
Census and Survey was conducted for the Community Action Partnership of San Bernardino
County. The estimated point in time (daily) number of homeless residents in San Bernardino
County ranged between a minimum of 5,270 persons to as many as 8,351 persons. In this
regard, the City is very fortunate in that the survey found that there are six homeless individual
persons (no families) in Grand Terrace.
It should be noted that there is a difference between emergency shelter and transitional housing.
A shelter provides an immediate short-term solution to the homeless, whereas transitional
housing attempts to remove the basis for homelessness (i.e., lack of sufficient income for self
support). Transitional housing can last as long as 18 months and generally includes integration
with other social services and counseling programs to assist in the transition to self-sufficiency
through the acquisition of a permanent income and housing.
At present, there are two agencies that provide emergency shelter and/or short-term transitional
housing for homeless persons originating from Grand Terrace. These agencies are the
Frazee/Highland Community Center and the Salvation Army. The Frazee/Highland Community
Center currently operates three facilities: a main office located at 1140 West Mills Street, City of
San Bernardino; a senior shelter located at 913 Delaware, City of Redlands; and a single-person
and families shelter located at 7178 Palm Avenue, City of Highland.
At present, the Frazee/Highland Community Center provides shelter, clothing and food boxes to
eligible applicants. The total bed capacity is 64 and the facility is currently operating at or near
capacity. A center representative stated that a person in need is never turned away. A person is
either served at the center or referred to the San Bernardino County Department of Public and
Social Services (DPSS).
The Salvation Army operates the Hospitality House located at 845 W. Kingman Street, City of
San Bernardino. This facility has a capacity of 70 beds. This new facility operates at, or near,
capacity. The Facility provides 3-day shelter housing and up to 90-day transitional housing for
individuals seeking employment. Over-flow is referred to the Frazee/Highland Community
Shelter and/or the County of San Bernardino Department of Public Social Services.
Most importantly, there are currently 13 residential care facilities located within the City of
Grand Terrace. The City has permitted these facilities to be established within its corporate
boundaries in accordance with Section 1566.3 of the Health and Safety Code. According to
                                                     VIII-45

HCD, these facilities meet the requirement for the provision of transitional housing as set forth in
Section 65583 of the Government Code. Therefore, based on occupancy of six persons per
facility, these facilities are providing important transitional housing for 78 persons.
Although there is currently no identified need for additional emergency shelter or transitional
housing in Grand Terrace, both the City and its Redevelopment Agency are taking steps to meet
the needs of large families needing shelter as discussed in the Housing Program section of this
element. These steps include the designation of municipal buildings for emergency shelter. The
City Manager’s Office has indicated that, should the need arise, existing public facilities,
including City Hall and the City Yard, would be made available to provide emergency shelter.
The City also will continue to coordinate with and support the efforts of the Frazee/Highland
Community Center and the Salvation Army in order to ensure that the needs of any homeless
persons in the Grand Terrace area are met to the extent possible.
Program 8.8.1.m has been added to the Action Plan requiring an amendment to the City’s Zoning
Code to permit emergency shelters in the Industrial zone district without a conditional use
permit, and subject to the same development and management standards that apply to the
residential or commercial uses within the same zone district. This amendment will occur within
one year of the adoption of the Housing Element. There are approximately 237 acres of
Industrially zoned land within the City limits; and most of the land is built upon. However, there
are two locations in particular, that have existing vacant buildings that could be occupied
reducing the need for new construction. There is also vacant Industrially-zoned land on the north
side of Vivienda Avenue. Further, as part of the stated Zoning Code amendment, the City will
identify additional zone districts that would principally or conditionally permit emergency
shelters.
In addition, as the need requires, the City will:
    •    Amend the Zoning Code to identify a zone district where emergency shelters are
         permitted.
    •    Coordinate with local financial and real estate institutions to develop creative financing
         investments in the community with respect to affordable housing (e.g. redevelopment
         funding, private donation matching city donation, etc.). Participate in special programs,
         such as the Inland Harvest pickup and distribution of leftover foods from local
         restaurants, schools and social functions.

8.5.4.7         At Risk Housing
As required by Government Code Section 65583, the City must analyze the extent to which low-
income, multi-family rental units are at risk of becoming market rate housing and, if necessary,
develop programs to preserve or replace these assisted housing units. The multiple assistance
programs include state or local mortgage revenue bonds, redevelopment tax increments, in lieu
fees or an inclusionary housing ordinance, or density bonuses. Low income multi-family housing
is considered to be at risk if it is eligible to convert to non-low income housing due to: 1) the
termination of a rental subsidy contract; 2) mortgage prepayment or 3) the expiration of
affordability restrictions. The time period that is to be considered in making this determination is
the ten year period following the last mandated updating of the Housing Element, which in the
case of Grand Terrace is 2000-2006.
Based on the information contained in the “Inventory of Federally Subsidized Low Income,
Rental Units at Risk of Conversion,” compiled by the California Housing Partnership
Corporation, there are no federally assisted (HCD or FmHA), low income rental units within the
City. Likewise, there are no low income rental units within the City that have been developed
with the use of CDBG funds or as a result of an inclusionary housing ordinance.
However, there are 111 low income rental units that were constructed using a combination of
density bonuses and local multi-family revenue bond financing. These units are located in the
Highlands Apartments, constructed by Forest City Development at 11750 Mount Vernon
Avenue. These units are a good example of at risk housing because information provided by
HCD in its April 30, 1998 letter to the City, indicated that these units were to convert to market
rate in 1999. However, as previously indicated, the City used its housing set-aside funds to
secure these units until 2030.
8.5.4.8         California Housing and Urban Development Income Limits
The 2007 median income for the Riverside –San Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical
Area (MSA) for a four-person household in San Bernardino County is $59,200 per year. This is
used to calculate very low (50% of median) and low (80% of median) incomes for use in State
and federal subsidized housing programs.
8.5.4.9         Preservation of Mobile Home Parks as an Affordable Housing
                Opportunity
Traditionally, mobile home parks have provided an affordable housing opportunity, particularly
for senior citizens. Mobile home parks will have a positive impact on the City’s lower-income
residents, and their ability to find affordable housing. There are a total of 247 mobile homes
existing within the City.

8.5.4.10        Apartment Rental Rates
The monthly rental rate for Grand Terrace was $777 in 2000. Based on the 30% gross household
income standard, a monthly income of $2,590, or annual income of $31,080, was needed to
afford a rent of $777 per month.
8.5.4.11        Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
•    Second Dwelling Units: In 2002, the City adopted Chapter 18.69 Second Family Units of
     Zoning Code to ensure that second units could be constructed on any single family
     residentially zoned property. Chapter 18.69 provides for the administrative review of
     attached second family units. Detached second units require a conditional use permit.
     However, recent State law requires that second units be permitted as an administrative
     matter without Planning Commission hearings, and all requests for second units are
     processed administratively. Program 8.8.1.o will ensure that Chapter 18.69 will be
     amended to provide for the administrative review of detached second units and to amend the
     table of permitted uses contained in Chapter 18.10 (RH, R1, R2 and R-3 Zones) to reflect
     administrative review of second units.
•    Manufactured Homes: The City of Grand Terrace Zoning Code, Chapter 18.66
     Manufactured Units addresses manufactured housing. In 1998, the City revised this section
     of the Zoning Code to permit manufactured housing in all residential zones. However, as
     stated in Program 8.8.1.c the table of permitted uses in Chapter 18.10 (RH, R1, R2 and R3
     Residential Districts) will be amended for consistency with Chapter 18.66. Further, the
     permitting process for manufactured housing will be the same as for conventional housing:
     Site and Architectural Review by the Site and Architectural Review Board. The scope of
     the Board’s review of single family residences is generally limited to the architecture of the
     residences, including design, materials, and landscaping. The process from submittal to
     issuance of building permits is approximately 6 weeks.
•    Residential care facilities: Residential care facilities refer to a residence consisting of
     supervision of persons, such as a group home, or rehabilitation facility that provide non-
     medical care to persons in need of personal services, assistance, guidance, protection or
     training for daily living. Residential care facilities serving 6 or fewer persons are permitted
     by right in all residential zones. Facilities serving 7 or more persons are conditionally
     permitted in all residential zone districts, requiring review and approval by the Planning
     Commission at a public hearing. Residential care facilities include homes for the disabled
     and transitional housing facilities.
•    Transitional housing: Transitional housing facilities fall under the definition of residential
     care facilities and are principally permitted in all residential zones if serving 6 or less
     persons, and conditionally permitted in all residential zones if serving 7 or more persons.
•    Single-room occupancy units provide another form of affordable housing for low-income

      persons. The City’s Zoning Code does not include zone districts in which SRO’s are
      permitted. Program 8.8.1.p will require the City to amend its Zoning Code by the end of
      2009 for the purpose of permitting SRO’s in accordance with state law.
•     Emegency shelters: Senate Bill 2 adopted in 2007 amended housing element law regarding
      the planing for emergency shelters to require at least one zone district where emergency
      shelters are permitted without discretionary action, and subject to the same development
      and management standards that apply to the residential or commercial uses within the same
      zone district. Currently, the City’s Zoning Code does not identify where emergency
      shelters would be permitted. Program 8.8.1.m requires the City to amend it’s Zoning Code
      to address this issue within one year of adoption of the Housing Element.
8.6      CONSTRAINTS
The ability of the private and public sectors to provide adequate housing to meet the needs of all
economic segments of the community is constrained by various interrelated factors. For ease of
discussion, these factors have been divided into three categories: 1) physical constraints; 2)
market constraints; and 3) governmental constraints. The extent to which these constraints are
affecting the supply and affordability of housing in the City of Grand Terrace is discussed below.
8.6.1 Physical and Environmental Constraints
Physical constraints to the development of
affordable housing within the City of Grand
Terrace focus upon the physical characteristics of
the majority of the remaining undeveloped land
within the City limits. The identified sites within
the Hillside Residential (RH) and R1-20 zone
districts are primarily located on the steep slopes of
Blue Mountain. Environmental constraints include
the potential for land and rock slides, high fire
hazards and flooding. Although it is possible to
mitigate the environmental constraints, the
development constraints associated with
developing on steep slopes and the provision of
streets and utilities to hillside areas along with the
environmental issues of landslides, high fire hazards and drainage issues substantially increases
development costs and therefore make these areas unsuitable for affordable housing.
The sites identified in the R1-10 are generally located along the foot of Blue Mountain and have
milder slopes and few constraints than in the RH and R1-20 zone districts. The identified sites
locates in the R1-7.2 zone district are located in areas with gradual slopes, if any. There are no
known environmental constraints in these areas that could impede development.

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

Identified sites within the R-2 and R-3 zone districts are located on the relatively flatter portions
of the City. The identified sites located at the northwest portion of the City are located in
proximity to Interstate 215 and an industrial line of the Union Pacific Railroad line. The
Interstate and railroad line are potential environmental areas of concern relating to noise. Noise
impacts can generally be mitigated through enhanced construction measures such as sound
attenuation walls and would not be considered a significant environmental impact. There are no
other known environmental constraints that could impede development on identified sites located
in the R-2 and R-3 zone districts.
Approximately 9 additional vacant and non-vacant sites have been identified within the
Administrative Professional designation of the Barton Road Specific Plan area, which
conditionally permits multiple family uses. These parcels are relatively free of significant
topographical constraints; utilities are readily available; and are free of any known environmental
constraints. The proposed mixed use project is located just east of the I-215 project, and is part
of a larger 100-acre project. Within the 100 acres there is an area identified as jurisdictional to
the Department of Fish and Game and Army Corps of Engineers. However, these jurisdictional
areas can typically be mitigated, so as not to preclude development. No other significant impacts
exists within this project area.
A second large area of undeveloped acreage is located in the northwest corner of the City. The
majority of this area lies within a designated flood hazard zone of the Santa Ana River. In
addition, this area possesses limited access and is constrained by rail lines on both the east and
west sides. The area is also designated on the General Plan as “Industrial” and remains one of
the few undeveloped industrial areas in the City. Residential development is not proposed in this
area.
8.6.2 Market Constraints
8.6.2.1         Market Forces
One of the major obstacles to providing housing to meet the need of all economic segments of
the community is the nature of the housing market itself. The rate at which housing costs
accelerated during the 1990’s and early 2000’s created a serious national problem. This problem
was magnified in California as a whole, and particularly in Inland Empire communities such as
Grand Terrace, where housing costs rapidly inflated. The primary factor driving market forces is
location, and the setting and nature of Grand Terrace are not conducive to the provision of
affordable housing.
Grand Terrace is a rather small community of approximately 3.4 square miles, with no sphere of
influence. The City is located on a topographic plateau, at a higher elevation than most of the
surrounding cities, and enjoys a full panoramic view of the San Bernardino Mountains.
Grand Terrace is located amidst the employment areas of the Cities of Riverside, Colton and San
Bernardino and adjacent to the I-215 Freeway, a major commuting corridor to jobs in Los
Angeles and Orange Counties. Regionally, the Ontario area and Los Angeles to the west contain

the bulk of industry and blue collar jobs. Grand Terrace is a bedroom community. Year 2000
estimates by SCAG indicate there are 2,653 jobs currently within the City.
Grand Terrace was incorporated approximately 30 years ago and since then has grown
moderately by an average of three percent per year. Other cities in the area, like Moreno Valley,
Banning, and Fontana have experienced exponential growth during the past ten years.
The City is striving to create a commercial tax base and develop its industrial sector. County
fees are increasing and property tax revenues are down as people default on loans in the
recessionary economy of 2008-2009. The City needs more revenue. Job creation and retention
will increase in priority in coming years, particularly as the surrounding job markets mature.
As a result of the housing boom of the early 2000’s, housing in Grand Terrace became less
affordable with the cost of a typical single family residence increasing an average of 260 percent
from 2000 to 2007. However, a decline in real estate values began in 2008 and may continue for
an additional year.
8.6.2.2          Cost Factors
8.6.2.2.1 Construction Cost
The single largest cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building materials,
comprising between 40 to 50 percent of the sales price of a home. According to construction
industry indicators, overall construction costs rose over 30 percent during the past decade, with
rising energy costs a significant contributor. Typical residential construction costs range from
approximately $80 to $100 per square foot3.
Lower housing costs can be achieved with the
following factors: a) reduction in amenities and
quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate
performance); b) availability of skilled
construction crews who will work for less than
union wages; and c) use of manufactured
housing (including both mobile home and
modular housing).
An additional factor related to construction
costs is the number of units built at the same
time. As the number of units developed
increases, construction costs over the entire
development are generally reduced based on

economies of scale. This reduction in costs is of particular benefit when density bonuses are
utilized for the provision of affordable housing.
8.6.2.2.2 Land Costs
In Grand Terrace, residential land cost varies depending on the cost of grading and infrastructure
associated with proposed development on the site. According to information provided by local
developers (December 2007), single-family zoned land ranges from $9 to $11 per square foot,
and multi-family zoned land averages about $6 to $9 per square foot.
8.6.2.2.3 Financing
During the past few years, sgnificant changes have occurred in the mortgage lending industry.
Home mortgage interest rates of the late 1990’s and early 2000’s were very low with 30-year
fixed rates as low as 5%. However, problems within the industry and increases in the federal
lending rate have gradully raised mortgage rates and made them more difficult. A fixed rate 30-
year loan for a new home currently carries interest rates from 6%. Lower initial rates are
available with Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs),
Interest Only Mortgages, and Buy-Down Mortgages. However, ARM’s of a few years ago have
exerienced significant increases that have drastically increased monthly mortgage payments thus
jeopardizing homeowners and creating a high percentage of foreclosures.
Therefore, lower income households will have difficlty qualifying for standard mortagages even
as home prices drop to reasonable levels. Financing for both construction and long-term
mortgages is generally available in Grand Terrace subject to normal underwriting standards.
However, a more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the
housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements.
Typically, conventional home loans will require 10 to 20 percent of the sale price as a down
payment, which is the largest constraint to first time homebuyers. The City’s first time
homebuyer program is directed at this problem and, to date, by providing more favorable down
payment and financing terms, has assisted 38 low to moderate income households purchase
homes in the City, with 29 of these homes purchased during the 98-2005 RHNA cycle.
8.6.2.3         Vacancy Rate
A market constraint that can affect the affordability as well as the availability of housing types,
sizes, price ranges and locations is the housing market vacancy rate. As previously discussed in
Section 8.4.2.4, the City’s overall vacancy rate was reported by the State Department of Finance
to be 5.0 percent, a rate that suggests a demand to reside in the City of Grand Terrace.

8.6.3 GOVERNMENT COSTRAINTS
8.6.3.1          Land Use Controls
8.6.3.1.1        Density
The Grand Terrace General Plan sets forth the City’s policies for guiding local development.
These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of
land to be allocated for various uses throughout the City.
Residential development in the City of Grand Terrace is permitted under the land use categories
shown in Table 8.32 and in accordance with the Land Use Element of the General Plan:
                                              Table 8.32

          Land Use Category                 Allowable Zones              Gross Allowable Density
   Hillside Residential              R-1 (20)                          0 – 1 Du/Net Ac
   Low Density Residential           R-1 (7.2), R-1 (10), R-1 (20)     1 – 5 Du/Net Ac
   Medium Density Residential        R-2, R-3                          1 – 12 Du/Net Ac

   Residential
Pursuant to City Zoning Code Section 18.10.040, as amended in 1989, a density bonus of up to
twenty percent (20%) may be approved in the R-3 zone with a conditional use permit or specific
plan if various off-site improvements which benefit the general public are included in the project.
In addition, a density bonus of at least twenty-five percent (25%) shall be approved if the
proposed project meets the requirements of Chapter 4.3 of the California Government Code
regarding dwelling units for low-and moderate-income households. These provisions will need
to be updated to conform to Chapter 4.3 of the Government Code which allows greater density
bonuses depending upon the amount of affordable units proposed. Therefore, actual densities
allowed will be greater than the allowable density; however, the number of units per acre where
the topography, size and shape of lots will permit.
Program 8.8.1.d adds a program for the amendment of the City’s Development Code regarding
density bonuses.
While the amount of vacant land remaining within the City is minimal and is located in hillside
areas, land with potential for redevelopment and infill housing is primarily found in the relatively
flat areas of the City, where increased densities are feasible, thus providing adequate sites for the
construction of affordable housing.

The City will implement Zoning Code provisions that offer density bonuses in accordance with
the requirements of State density bonus law. The density bonuses and incentives will be made
available for any for-sale or rental, single family or multifamily development of five or more
units, when requested by a developer who agrees to reserve units exclusively for families of low-
to moderate-income.
8.6.3.1.2         Development Standards
The City’s development standards are consistent with the parameters and policies established in
the General Plan and reflect an attempt to balance housing needs with infrastructure capacities
and environmental considerations. Table 8.33 presents the development standards of each
residential zone. Standards regulating development within the City are similar to those being
used by other surrounding communities.
Taken together with the size of the lot, development standards are not considered especially
constraining. The City’s Zoning Code does, however, limit the definition of multiple family
residential developments to one- and two-bedroom units and places minimum size requirements
on them. These regulations could pose a constraint to multiple family developments as it does
not address studio, three- and four-bedroom multiple family units, and their related parking
demands, or housing for large families. To remove this constraint Program 8.8.1.q has been
added to amend the Zoning Code to update the definition of multiple family residential to
remove the bedroom limitations, and to revisit the parking requirements for smaller units.

                                                                             Resolution No. 2010-10

  Footnotes:      a.   A specific plan shall be required for all proposed projects (including tentative parcel or tract
                       maps) that includes any property located within this district. Such a specific plan shall
                       establish site development standards on a project-by-project basis in consideration of the
                       existing topography and other physical constraints.
                       The specific plan shall not create a density greater than one (1) dwelling unit per gross acre
                       and shall be consistent with the City's General Plan. The specific plan may consider a
                       clustered development concept in order to preserve large areas open space and minimize the
                       project's impact on the physical environment.
                  b.   The following exceptions apply to front, rear and side yard requirements as noted:
                       1) The minimum side and rear yard setback for a patio cover shall be five (5) feet.
                       2) The minimum rear yard setback for an accessory structure shall be ten (10) feet.
                       3) Slopes exceeding five percent (5%) shall be permitted no closer to a residential structure
                            than a distance equal to the required side and rear yard setbacks. In the R1-10 District and
                            the R1-20 District, the 35 foot rear yard setback may include 10 feet of slope that is
                            greater than 5%.
                       4) In the case of a parcel or tract map, the twenty-five (25) foot front yard setback
                            requirement may range from twenty-two (22) feet to twenty-eight (28) feet, with an
                            average of twenty-five (25) feet for all proposed lots.
                       5) In the case where an existing legal non-conforming structure is located within a required
                            setback area, the legal non-conforming structure may be enlarged within the required
                            setback area subject to the following conditions:
                            a) The proposed addition does not further reduce the depth of the existing setback area;
                                 and
                            b) The proposed addition is located no closer than 5' from any property line.
                  c.   Density bonuses shall be permitted under the following guidelines:
                       1) A density bonus of up to twenty percent (20%) may be approved with a conditional use
                            permit or specific plan if various off-site improvements which benefit the general public
                            are included in the project.
                       2) A density bonus of at least twenty-five percent (25%) shall be approved if the proposed
                            project meets the requirements of Chapter 4.3 of the California Government Code
                            regarding "Lower" and "Low or Moderate Income Households” dwelling units.
                  d.   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
                       •    "Living area" shall be defined as the enclosed area of a residential dwelling unit,
                            excluding porches, patios, carports, garages, storage areas, or auxiliary rooms.
                       •    "Multiple Family" shall be defined as one (1) or two (2) bedroom units only.
                  e.   Accessory structures shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height,
                  f.   Not more than the permitted percent of the total parcel may be devoted to main and accessory
                       structures, parking areas, driveways and covered patios. The remaining percent of the total
                       parcel shall be devoted to open areas such as landscaping, lawn, outdoor recreational facilities
                       incidental to residential development, including swimming pools, tennis courts, putting
                       greens, uncovered patios and walkways. Said open areas shall consist of not less than two
                       hundred (200) square feet of open space per dwelling unit.
The Tables above illustrate that the development standards in the City do not represent an over
restrictive condition, and are not a constraint to development of affordable housing.

Projects including new residential construction are normally required to install all necessary on
and off-site improvements, including a half-width of the paved width of the street, concrete
curbs, sidewalks, water connections and sewer connections. Roadway standards for local or
neighborhood streets that allow parking on both sides of the street have paved width between 36
to 44 feet. Infrastructure improvements are in place in most locations within the City limits.

Table 8.34 demonstrates that the City’s current Zoning Code needs to be updated to bring it into
compliance with housing statutes; and in fact several programs are proposed to achieve
compliance. Program 8.8.1.m will result in an amendment to the City’s Zoning Code to permit
emergency shelters in the Industrial zone district without a conditional use permit, pursuant to
SB 2 to regulate emergency shelters; Program 8.8.1.o will result in the elimination for a
conditional use permit for detached second units, and to reflect administrative review of second
units, in accordance with state law, and Program 8.8.1.p relates to the permitting of transitional
and supportive housing, and single room occupancy units.
8.6.3.1.3        Parking Standards
Parking standards are currently similar to those used in other cities: a two-car garage required for
each single family dwelling and 2 spaces required per unit for multiple family dwellings where
one space shall be in a garage. Guest spaces are required in a ratio of one guest parking space
per four multi-family dwelling units. It does not appear that these standards have constrained
affordable housing development in the past. However, in order to provide greater incentives for
the construction of affordable housing, more flexible parking standards are now being considered
for senior citizen and smaller affordable units.

Grand Terrace General Plan                                                   Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                       Housing Element
8.6.3.1.4       Open Space Requirements
Open space exactions/setback requirements in Grand Terrace are also very similar to those used
in other cities where the maximum lot coverage allowed varies from 40 to 60 percent of the lot,
thereby providing: 1) sufficient usable open space, especially in backyards; 2) enough space for a
car to park in the front driveway approach to the garage; and 3) enough separation between
residences to ensure protection of privacy. In the case of multiple family housing, 40 percent
open space is required to provide common social or recreational amenities/facilities for children,
adults and elderly on-site. Our experience indicates that this standard has not been a deterrent to
past affordable housing projects.
8.6.3.1.5       Design Review Standards
The City does not have design standards or guidelines that constrain development in its
residential districts. Single-and multi-family units are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for high
quality construction and compatibility with existing surrounding architecture. The basic
philosophy of the City’s design review process is to arrive at a product that meets the City’s
goals and is financially feasible for the developer.
The responsibility of the Site and Architectural Review Board is to provide comprehensive site
plan and architectural review of projects. The scope of the Site and Architectural Review
Board’s (Planning Commission) review is to consider the site plan in relation to the property and
development standards (i.e. setbacks, lot coverage, building height, parking, etc.), placement of
structures, vehicle and pedestrian access, landscaping, police and fire services, grading and
drainage, traffic, relationship to existing and planned uses of adjoining and surrounding
properties, and relationship to nearby properties and structures and surrounding natural
topography. It is also to consider the proposed architecture of buildings in terms of style and
design, materials and colors, and size and bulk in relation to the surrounding properties. Chapter
18.63 of the Zoning Code specifies the review authority of the Board with regard to site and
building design. However, this Chapter of the Zoning Code can be expanded upon to clearly
identify the Board’s authority (Program 8.8.1.r).
Given the smaller scale of development of a single-family residence in comparison to a multiple
family development project, the scope of the Board’s review of single-family residences is
generally more focused on architecture of the residences and site layout.
Review of multiple family development projects typically involves a greater level of review in
regard to site development. In addition to ensuring adherence to setbacks, height requirements,
lot coverage, parking and other applicable development standards, the Board will also consider
the compatibility of the project’s site design with surrounding land uses, such as screening and
security.
Unlike larger cities, the City of Grand Terrace has only one board (i.e., its Planning
Commission) that performs various review functions. Therefore, the design review process is
shorter than in other cities in the area. However, smaller projects such as individual single
                                                    VIII-57

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                        Housing Element
family units require Planning Commission approval, through a Site and Architectural Review.
The City has eliminated the public hearing requirement for very small projects, such as room
additions, accessory structures, etc. City staff processes these projects administratively requiring
only the Director’s review and approval. Other improvements that have been or are currently
being made to streamline the design review/permit process are:
•     Implementation of one-step review process whereby the applicant comes to one counter to
      receive information about the entire process. The Community and Economic Development
      Department (CEDD) routes the plans to other reviewing agencies and the case planner
      reports to the applicant within 30 days.
•     Implementation of an applicant-friendly approach whereby staff provides significant
      attention to applicants, up front, to explain and inform them to the process and basically
      serve as an expediter instead of a regulator, while City standards are being enforced. These
      include preliminary design review meetings with City staff to work through design issues
      prior to formal application submittal.
•     When staff determines that an applicant does not have sufficient funds to comply with City
      codes in constructing proposed improvements, staff assists the applicant in identifying
      alternative means through rehabilitation loans or other mechanisms.
•     Implementation of a project management approach, whereby a case planner
      follows/monitors a project from initial sketches to issuance of a certificate of occupancy
      through all departments and agencies. This allows applicants to have more certainty about
      the status of their projects and to plan and acquire financing while a project is under review.
      The case planner is responsible for knowing the status of a project within the process at any
      point in time. This also assists the City in ensuring implementation of conditions of
      approval
•     Implementation of easy to read “How to Do” lists for all requirements for planning and
      building plan check, thereby facilitating submission of complete applications and
      minimizing additional trips to the City.
In summary, any constraints posed by the design review/permit process in the past have been
eliminated.
8.6.3.2          Building Codes
In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the cost of housing. Grand
Terrace has adopted the Uniform Building Code that establishes minimum construction
standards. These minimum standards cannot be revised to be less stringent without sacrificing
basic safety considerations and amenities. No major reductions in construction costs are
anticipated through revisions to local building codes. However, working within the framework
of the existing codes, the City will continue to implement planning and development techniques
that lower costs and facilitate new construction to the extent possible.

8.6.3.3        Development Filing Fees
The City’s development filing fees are still low when compared with surrounding areas. A
summary of development filing fees for the City is provided in Table 8.35. The fees that are
charged by the City are a reflection of the time and effort that must be expended by City staff in
order to properly review development plans. The City will continue to conduct periodic surveys
(both formal and informal) of other cities in the Grand Terrace area to ensure that local
processing costs do not become a constraint on housing production.

8.6.3.4         Development Impact and Building Permit Fees
As shown in Table 8.36 the total fees, including building permit and development impact fees
for a 2,000 square foot residential unit are approximately $40,000, and approximately $27,000
for a 1,200 square foot multiple residential home. While the majority of the costs is attributable
to development impact fees, the City assess a lesser impact fee for multiple family development.
It should also be noted that a significant portion of the impact fees, water connection and school
impact fees, are assessed by entities separate from the City, of which the City has little control
of.

Numbers are rounded.
The per unit cost of housing, including construction and land cost is approximately $89 a square
foot. Using Table 8.36 above, that would equate to a per unit cost of $218,639 for a single
family unit and $134,541 for a multiple family housing unit. The total building and development
impact fees are about 18% and 20%, respectively, of the total per unit cost. The costs of the
impact fees could be offset through the use of housing set aside funds, and a program is proposed
in the Housing Action Plan that allows the Redevelopment Agency to consider such an offset for
affordable housing projects.
8.6.3.5           Permit Processing
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is often cited
as a prime contributor to the high cost of housing. Additional time may be necessary for
environmental review, depending on the location and nature of a project. Unnecessary delays
will add to the cost of construction by increasing land holding costs, interest payments and
inflation. Although these review processes may take a substantial amount of time, they are
necessary to integrate a new development into the local urban environment.
In response to State law, California cities have been working to improve the efficiency of permit
and review processes by providing one-stop processing, thereby eliminating duplication of effort.
The passage of Assembly Bill 884, which took effect on January 1, 1978, has also helped to
reduce government delays by:
        1) limiting processing time in most cases to one year; and
        2) eliminating some “red tape” by requiring agencies to specify the information required
        to complete an acceptable application.

                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

In Grand Terrace, the average processing time for most development applications is two to three
months with very small projects taking less than 30 days. The City of Grand Terrace has fully
implemented the provisions of AB 884, as well as more recent legislation requiring the
establishment of “one-stop” permit coordination. Moreover, the City has established a Site and
Architectural Review Board that doubles as the Planning Commission. This board is scheduled
to meet twice per month to review all new construction proposals. Based on periodic surveys
conducted by the City, local processing times are shorter than those experienced in surrounding
communities.
The following summarizes applications that are utilized by the City for various residential
projects and average processing times:
        Land Use Application: This application is used for small ground floor room additions
        which are less than 500 square feet in size. The average processing time is 2 to 4 weeks
        from filing to issuance of building permit.
        Administrative Site and Architectural Review: The Administrative Site and Architectural
        Review application is used for larger room additions which are 500 square feet in size or
        larger but less than 65% of the floor area of the existing house. This application does not
        require a public hearing and can be approved by the Community Development Director.
        The average processing time is typically 6 weeks from filing to issuance of building
        permit. The Administrative Site and Architectural Review process is also used for the
        review and approval of second dwelling units, which greatly expedites the processing of
        these second units and is in conformance with State law.
        Site and Architectural Review: This application requires a fully noticed public hearing
        before the Planning Commission. This involves the additional requirement to submit a
        radius map and ownership list of property owners within 300 feet of the subject site. The
        Site and Architectural review process is required for new single family residences and for
        multiple family developments. The average processing time for a single family residence
        is 6-12 weeks from filing to issuance of a building permit, and about 12 to 16 weeks from
        filing to issuance of building permit for multiple family developments. If an
        environmental initial study is required to be prepared than the processing time would be
        extended by at least 8 additional weeks. To expedite the review process the City offers
        concurrent review of the construction drawings prior to the Planning Commission’s
        public hearing, subject to a hold harmless agreement should the Commission impose
        major changes in the project at the public hearing. This procedure highlights the City’s
        efforts to expedite the review process to facilitate new housing development.
        Conditional Use Permit: This application is employed for density bonuses. This
        application is heard concurrently with the Site and Architectural Review application. As
        these applications are heard concurrently with the Site and Architectural Review
        application in order to speed up the process, the processing time is the same as that for
        the Site and Architectural Review application.

        Tentative Parcel Map: This application is used to divide a site into four or fewer new
        parcels. This would allow for the infilling of larger parcels or an intensification of
        existing sites. The application is heard by both the Planning Commission and the City
        Council, as required by the City’s Subdivision Ordinance. The processing time from
        tentative parcel map filing to City Council approval is approximately 3 to 4 months.
        Tentative Tract Map: This application is used to divide or subdivide a site into more than
        four lots. This allows for the infilling of large parcels or an intensification of larger
        existing sites in the City. Tentative Tract Maps are heard by both the Planning
        Commission and the City Council. The processing time from the tentative map filing to
        the recording of the final map is 4 to 6 months.
The City’s filing fees, shown on Table 8.34, are some of the lowest in the San Bernardino and
Riverside regions. Generally, the City has no backlog of residential projects that are waiting for
processing by staff or for a public hearing by the Planning Commission or City Council. The
average processing times for residential projects are much less than those for other jurisdictions
in the area.
8.6.3.6         Service and Facility Infrastructure
Before a development permit is granted, it must be determined that public services and facility
systems are adequate to accommodate any increased demand generated by a proposed project.
At present, all vacant residentially designated land within the City is in close proximity to the
infrastructure systems (i.e., utilities and streets necessary to provide service). While construction
of local interior street and minor utility extensions would be required in some cases, the overall
extent would not be great; the location of streets and utility lines as illustrated in the General
Plan Circulation Element. No street extensions or major service system improvements would be
necessary for development of multi-family designated areas directly adjacent to Mt. Vernon
Avenue or single-family designated areas in the western portion of the City, west of the AT & SF
railroad tracks. Service systems are adequate to provide for the higher densities expected to be
associated with low- and moderate-income developments.
Water service is provided by the Riverside Highland Water Company (Company). The
Company is a private water company owned by its shareholders. The Company maintains water
main transmission lines, wells, reservoirs, and service laterals throughout the City and is directly
responsible for maintenance. The water supply for the Company is from five separate
groundwater basins. The 2005 Urban Water Management Plan prepared for the Company
indicates that there is sufficient water supply to accommodate development within the City.
Sanitary sewer service is provided by the City of Grand Terrace, and the City maintains all
collections lines within its city-limits. The City contracts with the City of Colton for wastewater
treatment.

8.6.3.7         Utilization of State and Federal Assistance Programs
The degree to which the City of Grand Terrace may participate in State and Federal housing
programs is constrained by the nature of those programs, eligibility requirements and funding
limitations. The relatively high cost of housing in the City is somewhat of a deterrent to the use
of certain programs, i.e., Section 8 Existing and Moderate Rehabilitation, CHFA Direct Lending,
etc., by private developers/property owners. This is due to the relatively low housing costs
(purchase price or rent) permitted under these programs. Recent and further proposed reductions
in funding levels also represent an impediment to the utilization of these programs.
8.6.3.8         Jobs/Housing Balance
In response to the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act, the State of California has
formulated a State Implementation Plan (SIP) that sets forth the measures that are necessary to
ensure the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (
NAAQS) contained in the Act. As a means of carrying out the SIP and ensuring that the
NAAQS are attained in the South Coast Air Basin, in which the City of Grand Terrace is located,
the Southern California Association of Governments and the South Coast Air Quality
Management District have adopted a Regional Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The
AQMP, in turn, requires all jurisdictions within the South Coast Air Basin to revise their general
plans to be consistent with the SIP. A local general plan is consistent with the SIP if the
development allowed thereunder is consistent with the jobs/housing balance ratios in the SIP.
In responding to the requirements of the SIP, SCAG has formulated regional plans that address
future job and housing growth within the region, by promoting the concept of balancing job
growth and housing production with the various subregions of Southern California as a means of
addressing serious air quality and transportation issues. The “Jobs/Housing Balance” concept
forwards the idea that if people can live and work within the same community, the Southern
California region as a whole will benefit from reduced traffic congestion and improved air
quality.
As defined by SCAG, a balanced subregion or community is one having an employment to
housing ratio of 1.2 jobs per dwelling unit. Recent SCAG data estimated that there are
approximately 2,653 combined public and private sector jobs within the City of Grand Terrace.
By comparison, there are currently 4,458 dwelling units within the City. This translates into an
employment to housing ratio of 0.60 jobs per dwelling unit, and indicates that the City is “jobs
poor” and “housing rich.” Therefore, adherence to the jobs/housing balance ratios in the SIP
represents an actual constraint on the expansion of housing opportunities within the City since
the City is “jobs poor” and needs to stress the development of jobs, rather than housing.

8.6.3.9         Constraints on Persons with Disabilities
Zoning and Permitting Requirements: The City’s definition of family includes individuals related
by blood, marriage or adoption, groups of not more than six persons who are not related by
blood, marriage or adoption, and one or more persons living as a single household.
The City ensures adherence to Title 24 of the California Building Code and federal regulations
on accessibility in both multiple family housing developments and commercial developments.
The City’s parking standards requires that at least one disabled parking space be provided for
each new project or two (2%) percent whichever is greater. The design standards of the parking
ordinance require that the disabled parking spaces be striped and individually identified in
accordance with the Uniform Building Code and the California Vehicle Code.
Group homes are permitted by right in the City’s residential zones as permitted uses if the
number of residents is 6 or less. The only permits that would be required would be the normal
building permits to construct the structure.
Group homes with more than 6 residents are permitted with a conditional use permit. There is
nothing in the City’s General Plan or Zoning Code that regulates the siting of special needs
housing in relationship to one another. There is no minimum distance required between two (or
more) special needs housing. The City has no standard conditions or requirements for group
homes of more than 6 persons, other than the requirement for a conditional use permit. This
includes no particular conditions for group homes that will be providing services on-site. The
requirement for a conditional use permit has had no demonstrated negative impact on the
development of group homes in the City. There has been no record of such a request being
denied by the City’s Planning Commission. The pubic hearing for a conditional use permit for a
group home is exactly the same for any other conditional use permit with the same noticing
requirements and agency notification.
Building Codes to Assist Disabled Access: The City has adopted the 1997 Uniform Building
Code. There have been no amendments that might have diminished the ability to accommodate
persons with disabilities. The City has not adopted any universal design elements in the City’s
building code with respect to persons with disabilities; however, any property owner wishing to
install such elements would not be precluded from doing so.
The Building and Safety Department strictly follows the guidelines set by CALDAG for their
ADA regulations on new and rehab commercial construction. There have been several new
developments in the City that have been required by law to be disabled accessible. In regard to
housing development, the City’s Housing Department has a policy of installing facilities
providing for disabled accessibility for new or rehabbed homes if requested by the new buyer. In
accordance with state law, multiple family developments are required to incorporate adaptable
units into the project design, in addition to ensuring an accessible path of travel from the street.

Grand Terrace General Plan                                                    Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

The City has also retrofitted several intersections in the City with disabled curb access, disabled
drinking fountains and/or disabled buttons at the signalized intersections. In addition reasonable
accommodations have been provided at City Hall including disabled access to the City Hall and
the Building Department including a disabled ramp and a disabled emergency access bell for
access to the main City Hall building and a disabled ramp to the Building Department which is in
a separate building.
Reasonable Accommodations: The City has not adopted a reasonable accommodations
ordinance. In processing a request to retrofit a home for accessibility an assessment would be
made to see if a building permit would be required to do the work (install access ramps, etc.). If
no building permit is required, the applicant would be advised that they could proceed with the
retrofit. However, Program 8.8.3.l is proposed to establish a reasonable accommodation
procedure to clarify the City’s process.
8.7      HOUSING GOALS AND POLICIES
This section of the Housing Element sets forth the City’s goals, objectives and policies relative to
previously identified needs, recognizing the constraints that limit the City in its ability to affect
local housing needs.
Housing goals are statements of the aspirations of the community, and represent the ends to
which housing efforts and resources are directed. Statements of objectives are more specific and
provide guidelines for actions and later evaluation. Statements of policy are more specific still,
and provide well-defined guidelines for decision-making.
The proper basis for any plan of action is a well-integrated set of goals. Such policy statements
provide guidance to local decision makers in dealing with housing related issues and express the
desires and aspirations of the community. The following goals are intended to give direction to
the City’s housing program:
•    Provide and encourage a supply of housing suitable to the needs and sufficient in number to
     serve existing and projected residents of Grand Terrace.
•    Promote and encourage housing opportunities, accessible to employment centers and
     quality community services for all economic segments of the community.
•    Promote and encourage housing opportunities regardless of age, sex, ethnic background,
     marital status, physical handicap or family size.
•    Promote and encourage the rehabilitation of deteriorated dwelling units, and the
     conservation of the currently sound housing stock.

 8.8      THE HOUSING PROGRAM
 During the past few years, the City has experienced significant revenue shortfalls, causing each
 City department to cut costs and staff. Because of a reduction in the City Community and
 Economic Development (CEDD)–Planning Division staff, the City has progressed more slowly
 than anticipated in realizing certain goals and objectives of the Housing Element. However, the
 City is committed to implementing its Housing Element and will continue to allocate available
 staff resources to housing programs and policies.
 In preparing this Housing Element Update, the City re-examined the goals and policies that give
 direction to the City’s housing programs, as well as the progress that has been made toward their
 attainment. The housing goals that were adopted as part of the City’s existing certified Housing
 Element are responsive to the State housing goals and continue to reflect the desires and
 aspirations of the community. This updated element refines those goals and reaffirms the City’s
 commitment to these State and local housing goals.
 This Housing Program sets forth a multi-year schedule of Programs for Grand Terrace to
 implement housing policies and to achieve the City’s housing goals and objectives. The
 anticipated impact, responsible agency, potential funding, and timetable for each Program is
 discussed. The area of impact, i.e., City-wide or certain census tracts, has also been identified.
 The anticipated accomplishments have been quantified where possible. These estimates were
 generated on the basis of past performance as well as the resources that are available to the City
                                                     VIII-71
 Grand Terrace General Plan                                                  Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                            Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                        Housing Element
for addressing local housing needs. In this respect, the anticipated accomplishments are realistic.
A summary of quantifiable housing objectives is presented below.
Upon implementation, the housing program presented in this document is intended to eliminate
all identified existing housing needs in the City of Grand Terrace through City build-out, and all
regional housing requirements for the City for the planning period 2006-2014. Major
components of this housing program are as follows:
•     The City has residentially zoned sites that could yield up to 598 additional housing units. Of
      these units, at least 144 units could be affordable to low-and moderate-income households .
•     The City expects at least 72 very low-income units, 36 low-income units, and 12 moderate-
      income units to be provided by construction of the approved Blue Mountain Villas Senior
      Housing project. The Agency has used its Low-Mod funds to assist in the construction of
      this project. As such, the developer, Corporation for Better Housing, is required to rent the
      units to low income households in accordance with affordability covenants placed on the
      project. Upon completion of the project and occupancy of the units, the developer will be
      required to demonstrate that the affordability covenants have been met.
•     The City has established a Housing Office for the administration and monitoring of low-
      and moderate-income housing opportunities. The City plans to continue operation of this
      Housing Office of the Public Works Department through the planning period.
•     The City Housing Office has continued operation of its first-time homebuyer purchase
      program that has resulted in the rehabilitation of substandard single family units, and their
      resale to low- and moderate-income homeowners. To date, 41 homes have been
      rehabilitated and sold to qualified low-and moderate-income households, 29 of which
      occurred during this planning period. The City plans to continue and expand this program
      during the planning period as needed to meet the community’s low and moderate income
      housing needs, as described in this Housing Element.
•     The City Housing Office has utilized redevelopment tax increment funds to initiate a
      rehabilitation loan program to provide financial assistance to homeowners needing to repair
      and maintain their homes. To date, the City rehab loan program has assisted 133
      households, consisting of 105 moderate-income households, 22 low-income households and
      6 very low-income households, four of which occurred during the 1998-2005 planning
      period. The City plans to continue and expand this program during the planning period as
      needed to meet the community’s low and moderate income housing needs, as described in
      this Housing Element.
•     In 2003, the City adopted an amendment the Barton Road Specific Plan to include mixed
      use development in the downtown. This amendment allows mixed use development
      consisting of both medium/high density residential and commercial in the Administrative
      Professional zone. The City has allocated redevelopment tax increment funds and will offer
      bond financing to qualified developers interested in undertaking a mixed use residential
      development with an affordable housing component that meets the requirements of State
                                                     VIII-72

      housing law.
•     In 2007, the City rezoned the site of the Blue Mountain Villas Senior Housing project to
      R3S with a density of 20 units/acre for the provision of very low-, low-, and moderate-
      income senior housing. If only the 3.4 acre portion of the site that encompasses residential
      units were considered, project density would be 35 units/acre.
•     The City will provide up to $250,000 of housing set-aside funds to be committed to the
      “Habitat for Humanity” or similar organization for the development of low-income housing
      within the City limits.
This housing program represents a continuing and meaningful effort on the part of the City of
Grand Terrace to expand the local supply and affordability of housing.
8.8.1 Programs In Support Of Housing Availability and Production
Program 8.8.1.a: The City’s Community and Economic Development Department (CEDD) and
Building and Safety/Public Works/Housing Department (BS/PW/H) will continue to expedite the
processing of plans for proposed housing projects that are affordable to low- and moderate-
income households.
    Responsible Agency:        CEDD and B&S
    Objective:                 Streamline production of affordable housing
    Timing:                    Ongoing
    Funding sources:           General Fund
Program 8.8.1.b: The City’s Community and Economic Development Department (CEDD) and
Redevelopment Agency will implement the amendment the Barton Road Specific Plan that
allows a mix of commercial and medium/high density residential development in the
Administrative Professional (AP) zone.
The Agency will consider incentives such as, but not limited to, reduced site development
standards or zoning code requirements, direct financial assistance, reduced, or deferred fees, or
other regulatory incentives which would result in identifiable cost avoidance or reduction, or a
density bonus in accordance with the provisions of state law. Allocation of the specific additional
incentives will be made on a case-by-case- basis, depending on resources available to the City
from which to grant the incentive, and the particular needs of the development to ensure
affordability. However, prioritization of funding and incentives will be given to those projects
that include affordable housing for extremely low income households.
    Responsible Agency:        CEDD and Redevelopment Agency
    Objective:                 Support housing availability and production
    Timing:                    Ongoing; Inform all developers of multiple family developments

restrictions.
Additional incentives may include, but not be limited to, reduced site development standards or
zoning code requirements, direct financial assistance, reduced, or deferred fees, approval of
mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing development, or other regulatory incentive

8.8.4 Anticipated Accomplishments
          Focusing on the current planning period (2006 - 2014), Table 8.37 shows a total of 472
          additional units could be constructed. At least 120 of these units could be affordable to
          very low, low and moderate income households. These estimates meet or exceed the
          housing needs identified in SCAG’s RHNA.

low income, 36 low income, and 12 moderate income senior households. The Redevelopment
Agency has committed low-mod housing funds towards this project, and in accordance with
Redevelopment Law, the units will remain affordable pursuant to affordability covenants. The
Blue Mountain Senior Housing Villas are currently under construction and are expected to open
by January 2009.
City priority plans to provide units affordable to the very low income through density increases
and senior citizen housing subsidies will result in the construction of additional units beyond the
472 noted above.

In addition to new construction accomplishments, the City of Grand Terrace expects to continue
and expand its rehabilitation and conservation efforts (Table 8.38) as needed to meet the
community’s low- and moderate-income housing needs, as described in this Housing Element.
Focusing on the current planning period (2006 - 2014), the City expects that a total of 30 single
family units will be rehabilitated. This estimate is based on previous planning period activity
and projected activity of the City’s first time home-buyer purchase assistance program and
housing rehabilitation program with influences from the current housing market conditions.
Rehabilitation of existing units will also be achieved through the City’s efforts to link property
owners with other financial assistance programs available through the County of San Bernardino.
In addition, the City expects that a total of 678 single and multifamily units, representing
approximately 15% of its existing housing stock, will be conserved through the continuing
efforts of its code enforcement programs.

8.8.5            Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan
The Grand Terrace Redevelopment Agency adopted Resolution No. CRA 2009-11 adopting the
2010-2014 Five Year Implementation Plan for the Grand Terrace Redevelopment Project Area.
The Five Year Implementation Plan included a Housing Program, which identified certain
projects.
Canal Street Rental Housing: This program proposes to utilize an Agency owned parcel for the
construction of a 23-unit rental housing complex. All units are proposed to be restricted to
affordable households. Program 8.8.1.l is in keeping with this program; however, under Program
8.8.1.l, the intent would be to have all units restricted to affordable households.
Purchase/Rehab/Resale Program: This is a continuing program that involves the acquisition,
rehabilitation and resale of dilapidated units throughout the community. Once acquired and
rehabbed the units are sold to eligible low to moderate income households. Program 8.8.2.h
retains this program.

Home Improvement Loan Program: This program provides eligible low to moderate income
households loans at low interest rates for minor rehabilitation projects. This is a continuing
program and is retained with Program 8.8.3.c
8.8.6           Priorities
As previously indicated, the ability of the City of Grand Terrace to affect local housing needs is
limited by the resources available for this purpose. These resources include land, enabling
legislation, and funding. Local governments in particular are constrained by the availability of
funding for housing-related activities.
 To ensure available resources are used most effectively in an effort to maximize benefits, a
prioritization of local housing needs is essential as a guide in distributing those resources.
Therefore, where conflict may arise in the implementation of this housing program, the City shall
allocate its limited resources on the basis of the following priorities:
Priority 1      Expansion of the local housing supply in terms of both market-rate and affordable
                housing through mixed-use development.
Priority 2      Provide opportunities for rental subsidies, density bonuses and mortgage revenue
                bond financing at new multi-family developments to assist very low income
                households.
Priority 3      Maintenance and improvement of the existing housing stock through continuance
                and expansion of the City’s housing rehabilitation and code enforcement
                programs.
Priority 4      Preservation of existing affordable housing opportunities through the continuance
                and expansion of the City’s first time home buyer purchase assistance program.
8.9      OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY
As non-renewable energy resources have been progressively depleted and energy costs continue
to rise, homeowners have become increasingly aware of energy conserving measures primarily
as a means to offset and control the rising costs of fuel. While the use of alternative energy
sources is most advantageous in developing new housing, there are numerous energy conserving
measures which can be retrofitted into existing and older housing which conserve the use of non-
renewable fuels and save money.

Grand Terrace General Plan                                                    Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                             Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                         Housing Element
8.9.1 Insulation and Weatherproofing
Older homes were built during times when there was little concern for the use of oil and natural
gas for heating purposes. Additionally, the window and door opening fixtures were intended
primarily for passage of light into the home. While many of these fixtures were designed to meet
these basic requirements, minimal effort was expended to ensure air-tight closures when both
exterior doors and windows were closed. To conserve the heat generated by gas or oil fired
heating units and minimize the heat loss ratio, older homes can be insulated in the attic space and
exterior walls. Windows and exterior doors can also be fitted with airtight devices, caulking, or
other means to maximize heating and cooling efforts.
8.9.2 Natural Lighting
Daytime interior lighting costs can be significantly reduced or eliminated with the use of
properly designed and located skylights. Skylights can be easily installed at reasonable expense
in existing houses, thereby substantially reducing electricity costs and energy consumption.
8.9.3 Solar Energy
Solar energy is a practical, cost effective,
and environmentally sound way to heat and
cool a home. In California, with its plentiful
year-round sunshine, the potential uses of
solar energy are numerous. With proper
building designs, this resource provides for
cooling in the summer and heating in the
winter; it can also heat water for domestic
use and swimming pools and generate
electricity.
                                               Unlike oil or natural gas, solar energy is an
                                               unlimited resource, which will always be available.
                                               Once a solar system is installed, the only additional
                                               costs are for the maintenance or replacement of the
                                               system itself. The user is not subject to
                                               unpredictable fuel price increases. Moreover, solar
                                               energy can be utilized without any serious safety or
                                               environmental concerns.
                                               Solar heating and cooling systems are of three
                                               general types: passive, active, or a combination
                                               thereof. In passive solar systems, the building
                                               structure itself is designed to collect the sun’s
energy, then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a green house. Passive buildings are
typically designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure, and constructed with
                                                    VIII-87
Grand Terrace General Plan                                                     Adopted April 27, 2010
                                                                              Resolution No. 2010-10

                                                                        Housing Element
dense materials such as concrete or adobe to better absorb the heat. Properly placed windows
and overhanging eaves also contribute to keeping a house cool.
Active systems collect and store solar energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house. This
type of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated
water can flow directly into a home’s hot water system.
Although passive systems generally maximize use of the sun’s energy and are less costly to
install, active systems have greater potential application to both cool and heat the house and
provide hot water. This may mean lower energy costs for Grand Terrace residents presently
dependent on conventional fuels. The City encourages the use of passive solar systems in new
residential construction to improve energy efficiency for its citizens.
8.9.4 Water Conservation
Simple water conservation techniques can save a
family thousands of gallons of water per year, plus
many dollars in water and associated energy
consumption costs. Many plumbing products are now
available which eliminates unnecessary water waste
by restricting the volume of water flow from faucets,
shower heads, and toilets. The use of plant materials
in residential landscaping that are well adapted to the
climate in the Grand Terrace area can also measurably
contribute to water conservation by reducing the need
for irrigation, much of which is often lost though
evaporation.
A family can also save water by simply fixing dripping faucets and using water more
conservatively. In addition, such conservation practices save on gas and electricity needed to
heat water and the sewage system facilities needed to treat it. By encouraging residents to
conserve water and retrofit existing plumbing fixtures with water saving devices, the City can
greatly reduce its water consumption needs and expenses.
8.9.5 Energy Audits
The Southern California Edison Company provides energy audits to local residents on request.
Many citizens are not aware of this program. The City will aid in expanding this program by
supplying the public with pertinent information regarding the process including the appropriate
contacts on the City’s website. The Southern California Gas Company also provides self-guided
surveys for its customers on its website. The City will also link the Gas Company’s webpage to
the City website . Energy audits are extremely valuable in pinpointing specific areas in
residences, which are responsible for energy losses. The inspections also result in specific
recommendations to remedy energy inefficiency.

8.9.6 New Construction
The City of Grand Terrace will continue to require the incorporation of energy conserving
appliances, fixtures, and other devices into the design of new residential units. The City will also
continue to review new subdivisions to ensure that each lot optimizes proper solar access and
orientation to the extent possible. Additionally, the City will consider enacting an ordinance that
prohibits property owners from obstructing the solar access of their neighbors. Two State laws
enacted in 1978 (the Solar Rights Act and the Solar Shade Control Act) offer a variety of
methods to preserve solar access.
8.10 FINANCING RESOURCES
In addition to the housing set aside funds pursuant to Community Redevelopment Law, there are
a variety of potential funding sources available to support affordable housing in the City of
Grand Terrace. They include the following:
8.10.1 Home Funds
The Home Investment Partnership (HOME) Program is a federal program, created as a result of
the National Housing Affordability Act of 1990. Under HOME, HUD awards funds to localities
on the basis of a formula, which takes into account tightness of the local housing market,
inadequate housing, poverty and housing production costs. Localities must match HOME funds
with 25% of funds from non-federal sources.
HOME funding is provided to jurisdictions to assist either rental housing or home ownership
through acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and/or rehabilitation of affordable housing.
Also possible is tenant-based rental assistance, property acquisition, site improvements, and
other expenses related to the provision of affordable housing and for projects that serve a group
identified as having a special need related to housing.
8.10.2 Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
Through the federal CDBG program, HUD provides funds to local governments for funding a
range of community development activities. CDBG grants are awarded to the City on a formula
basis for housing activities, including acquisition, rehabilitation, homebuyer assistance,
economic development, homeless services and public services. CDBG funds are subject to
certain restrictions and cannot be used for new construction of housing. CDBG grants benefit
primarily persons/households with incomes not exceeding 80 percent of the County Median
Family Income.
8.10.3 Section 108 Program
Section 108 is the loan guarantee provision of the CDBG program. This provision provides
communities with a source of financing for a variety of housing and economic development

                                                                             Resolution No. 2010-10
                                                                           Housing Element
activities. All rules and requirements of the CDBG program apply, and therefore all projects and
activities must principally benefit low and moderate income persons, aid in the elimination or
prevention of blight, or meet urgent needs of the community.
Monies received per the Section 108 loan guarantee program are limited to not more than 5 times
the applicant’s most recently approved CDBG amount, less prior Section 108 commitments.
Activities eligible for these funds include: economic development activities eligible under
CDBG; acquisition of real property; rehabilitation of publicly owned property; housing
rehabilitation eligible under CDBG; construction, reconstruction or installation of public
facilities; related relocation, clearance or installation of public facilities; payment of interest on
the guaranteed loan and issuance costs of public offerings; debt service reserves; and public
works and site improvements.
Section 108 loans are secured and repaid by pledges of future and current CDBG funds.
Additional security requirements may also be imposed on a case-by-case basis.
8.10.4 Section 8 Rental Assistance Payments/Housing Certificates
The Federal Section 8 program provides rental assistance to low- and moderate-income families,
elderly, and disabled persons who spend more than 50 percent of their monthly income on rent.
The subsidy represents the difference between the excess of 50 percent of the recipients' monthly
income and the federally approved fair market rents (FMR). In general, the FMR for an area is
the amount that would be needed to rent privately owned, decent, safe and sanitary rental
housing. Section 8 assistance is available in the following forms:
    •    Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate Program. Under the certificate program, the
         landowner enters into a contract with the San Bernardino County Housing Authority,
         which establishes limits for the rent which will be subsidized for the Very Low income
         unit to the Fair Market Rent. Eligible tenants must pay the highest of either 30 percent of
         adjusted income, 10 percent of gross income, or the portion of welfare assistance
         designated for housing. Housing subsidized through this program must meet standards of
         safety and sanitation established by HUD.
    •    Section 8 Existing Housing Voucher Program - This program is similar to the Certificate
         Program, however, rent for the units are not restricted. The tenant instead must pay the
         difference between the Fair Market Rent standard and the actual rent.
8.10.5 Section 202/811 Housing for Elderly for Handicapped Housing
Under this federally administered program, direct loans are made to eligible, private nonprofit
organization and consumer operative sponsors to finance development of rental or cooperative
housing facilities for occupancy by elderly or handicapped persons. The interest rates on such
loans are determined annually. Section 8 funds are made available for all of the Section 202
units for the elderly. Rental assistance for 100 percent of the units for handicapped persons has

                                                                       Housing Element
also recently been made available. Section 811 can be used to develop group homes,
independent living facilities, and intermediate care facilities.
Private, nonprofit sponsors may qualify for Section 202 no interest capital financing loans.
Households of one or more persons, the head of which is at least 62 years old or is a qualified
non-elderly handicapped person between the ages of 18 and 62, are eligible to live in these units.
There are currently no Section 202 projects in the City. The City of Grand Terrace should
encourage non-profit sponsors to make application for HUD Section 202 allocations for
construction of rental housing for seniors and the handicapped and take all actions necessary to
expedite processing and approval of such projects
8.10.6 California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
CHFA is a state of California administered program that provides below market interest rate
mortgage capital through the sale of tax-exempt notes and bonds. CHFA sells tax-exempt
Mortgage Revenue Bonds to provide below market rate financing through approved private
lenders to first-time homebuyers for the purchase of new or existing homes. The program
operates through participating lenders who originate loans for CHFA purchase.
CHFA assists nonprofit housing development corporations that acquire land, provide building
plans, and package loans for self-help housing. Families, under the supervision of nonprofit
corporations, provide the majority of the construction labor. CHFA makes commitments to self-
help corporations for low-interest mortgages and provides credit enhancements to lenders who
provide construction financing and preferential interest rates.
CHFA also operates a Multifamily Rental Housing Mortgage Loan Program. This program
finances the construction or substantial rehabilitation of projects containing 20 or more units. 20
percent of the units in a project must be set aside for low income tenants at affordable rents for
the greater of 15 years or as long as the mortgage is outstanding.
A new program of CHFA is the HELP Program. This program provides low interest loan
assistance to local governments to assist in the provision of affordable housing. Terms of the
low interest loans are 3 percent simple interest per annum for up to ten years, with a maximum
loan amount of $2,000,000 per project.
8.10.7 Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program
This State program provides for federal tax credits for private developers and investors, which
agree to set aside all or a portion of their units for low income households and the elderly for no
less than 15 years. A minimum of 20 percent of the units must be made available to families
whose income is less than 50 percent of the County median income or 40 percent of the units
must be made available to families whose income is up to 80 percent of the median.
Developers and investors must apply for an allocation of housing units from the State Allocation

Committee, administered by the Tax Credit Allocation Committee. While the program is
beneficial in adding low income housing units to the local housing stock, the statewide
allocations are limited under this program and the application process is expensive for the
developer. In addition, single resident and elderly rental projects are not competitive based on
the State's selection criteria. The Redevelopment Agency will remain informed about this
program and will make the benefits of this program known to developers and investors upon
inquiry, potentially for multifamily projects that cater to larger families.
8.10.8 Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bonds
Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bonds, as discussed above, are used to finance construction and
mortgage loans, as well as capital improvements for multifamily housing. Federal law requires
20 percent of the units in an assisted project to be reserved for lower income households, whose
income does not exceed 80 percent of the median household income for the County. Additional
state requirements regarding housing set-aside units are imposed on the project. Funding for this
program is administered by the California Debt Limit allocation committee and has been
extended indefinitely.
8.10.9 Housing Action Trust Fund
Housing Action Resource Trust (HART) is a California 501 (c) (3) nonprofit housing
development corporation that provides assistance to prospective homebuyers, including pre-
purchase education and counseling, assistance in obtaining first mortgage financing, training in
home repairs, and down payment assistance in the form of a grant to first time low- and
moderate-income homebuyers.
8.10.10 Senior Home Repair
This program is administered through the County of San Bernardino and is available for
residents of San Bernardino County and cooperating cities. The purpose of the program is to
provide eligible senior homeowners with a one-time grant in the form of labor and material to
correct code violations and/or health and safety problems.

9.0 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
9.1      INTRODUCTION
According to U.S. Department of Energy's Center for Sustainable Development, buildings
constructed using conventional methods account for:
•        65% of all electrical energy consumption,
•        30% of all green gas generation,
•        30% of all raw material use,
•        30% of all landfilled waste,
•        12% of al potable water consumption.
In an effort to reduce the impacts of building construction and occupation on the current and
future environment, the concept of “Sustainable Development” has become popular in
discussions of new development.
Sustainable Development is defined as:
         “A balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Sustainable
         development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
         generations to meet their own needs.”
The concept of sustainable development first became recognized in 1980 when the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature published the World Conservation Strategy. Since then,
the term has become commonplace with its general use occurring with the publication of a 1987
report from the United Nations Bruntland Commission.
Sustainable development is a combination of three specific concepts. These are:
•        Environmental Sustainability,
•        Economic Sustainability, and
•        Social-Political Sustainability.
Environmental sustainability is defined as the ability of the environment to continue to properly
function indefinitely. This is accomplished through programs designed to meet the current needs
of society without compromising the welfare of future generations. Its goal is to minimize
environmental degradation and to stop and ultimately reverse the practices that have led to it.
For environmental sustainability, humans must only use natural resources at a rate at which they
can be replenished naturally. Primary natural resources that are the focus of sustainable practices
include those raw materials needed to produce consumable products, energy resources, water,
and air.

While environmental sustainability is a primary goal of sustainable development, sustainable
development programs must also be economically feasible and must be acceptable to society.
Programs that have excessive costs to the population or that would drastically alter normal
lifestyles are prone to failure.
In response, the United Nations established the 2005 Urban Environmental Accords which
outline specific goals for jurisdiction to consider. These include goals for sustainability in the
following areas:

In 1999, the LEED Green Building Rating System for New Construction was established to
assist the building industry in improving the quality of buildings and reduce their impact on the
environment. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is one of several
programs designed to quantitatively rate buildings by the impact on the current and future
environment. The program evaluates numerous aspects of building programs including the

9.2     GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called
“greenhouse gases”, which could cause global
climate changes. Global climate change could
affect the average weather on earth that can be
measured by wind patterns, storms, precipitation
and temperature. Although there has been
disagreement as to the speed of global warming
and the extent of the impacts attributable to human
activities, most agree that there is a direct link
between increased emission of greenhouse gases
and long-term global temperature. What
greenhouse gases have in common is that they
allow sunlight to enter the atmosphere, but trap a
portion of the outward-bound infrared radiation and
warm up the air. The process is similar to the
effect greenhouses have in raising the internal
temperature, hence the name greenhouse gases.
Both natural processed and human activities emit
greenhouse gases. The accumulation of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can increase
the earth’s temperature, while emissions from
human activities such as electricity generation and motor vehicles operations can elevate the
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The principal greenhouse gases are carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), perflourocarbons
(PFCs), hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), and water vapor (H2O). Carbon dioxide is the reference gas
for climate change because it is the predominant greenhouse gas emitted. To account for the
varying warming potential of the different greenhouse gases, greenhouse gas emissions are often
                                                   IX-3

quantified and reported as CO2 equivalents (eCO2). Large emission sources are reported in
million metric tons of CO2E (MMTeCO2).
In 2005, in recognition of California’s effects on climate change, Governor Schwarzenegger
established Executive Order S-3-05, which set forth a series of target dates by which statewide
emissions of greenhouse gases could be progressively reduced, as follows:
•        By 2010, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels,
•        By 2020, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels,
•        By 2050, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels.
In 2006, California passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Assembly Bill
No. 32; California Health and Safety Code Division 25.5, Sections 38500, et. seq., or AB32),
which required the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to design and implement emissions
limits, regulations, and other measures, such that feasible and cost-effective statewide
greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020 (representing an
approximate 25 percent reduction in emissions). In 2007, CARB directed staff to pursue 37
early actions for reducing greenhouse gases under the California Global Warming Act of 2006
(AB32). Several strategies were considered including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard; regulations
for refrigerants with high global warming potential; guidance and protocols for local
governments to facilitate greenhouse gas reductions and green ports.
In addition to approving the 37 greenhouse gas reduction strategies, CARB directed staff to
further evaluate early action recommendations made at the June 2007 meeting, and to report
back to CARB within six months. Since then, CARB staff published the Draft List of Early
Actions Measures To Reduce Greenhouse Gases In California Recommended For Board
Consideration in September 2007, which recommended 44 measures to help reduce greenhouse
gases by Year 2012. These measures included the following:

Presently, neither SCAQMD, CARB, nor any Federal agency has implemented emission rate
criteria for CO2 emissions for quantifying a significant contribution to global climate change.
Furthermore, there are no rules or regulations established by the CARB, SCAQMD, State
Clearinghouse or other resource agency applicable to proposed development projects that define
what a “significant” source of greenhouse gas emissions could be. There are also no applicable
facility-specific greenhouse gas emission limits or caps. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97, the

                                                     Sustainable Development Element
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) is in the process of developing CEQA
guidelines “for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions or the effects of greenhouse gas
emissions.” OPR is required to “prepare, develop, and transmit” the guidelines to the Resources
Agency on of before July 1, 2009. The Resources Agency must certify and adopt the guidelines
on or before January 1, 2010. Upon adoption the City will be required to adhere to the
guidelines.
Utilizing sustainable development practices and principles can help to achieve energy efficiency,
occupant health and safety, materials efficiency, water efficiency, landscape efficiency, and
efficiency in project design.
9.2.1 Relationship to Other Elements
The Sustainable Development Element is interconnected with all other elements of the General
Plan. The goals and policies of the Sustainable Development Element are directly tied to the
implementation of all other elements including the following:
Land Use Element: Sustainable development emphasizes urban design and land use planning
to efficiently use available land while reducing the demand on natural resources. The reuse of
brownfield sites and redevelopment of older urban areas reduces urban sprawl and the
unnecessary use of natural resources. Proper building location to effectively use passive solar
heating and the use of drought tolerant landscaping in new developments further assist in saving
resources.
Circulation Element: Sustainable development promotes the use on alternative transportation
systems such as mass transit, pedestrian and bicycle modes of transportation, while promoting
transit-oriented development designed to take advantage of mass transit systems.
Open Space & Conservation Element: Sustainable development promotes the conservation
of basic resources such as clean air and water. It promotes open space and the provision of urban
parks and recreation facilities. It also promotes urban forestry designed to improve the living
environment and air quality, as well as waste reduction designed to reduce landfill demand and
the use of raw materials.
Public Health and Safety Element:          Sustainable development promotes the reduction in the
use of toxic materials.
Public Services & Facilities Element: Sustainable development promotes the conservation of
clean water, the control of storm water contamination through NPDES programs, and the
preservation of energy sources such as electricity and natural gas. Conservation of these
resources can avoid costly infrastructure improvements by utility purveyors.

                              fiscal year. It is either required by law or is critical to
                              the City.
                    3         Important. Action should be taken in the near future.
                              It may be necessary for the completion of other
                              actions.
                    4         Ongoing. Action is continuous or is the continuation
                              of an existing action or program. It requires no
                              further action to implement.
