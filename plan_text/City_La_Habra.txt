Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION
A. Preamble: Vision for La Habra
       2035
The Vision Statement for the La Habra General Plan 2035 is the framework that
expresses the community’s shared outcomes for the City’s future. It defines
expectations for what La Habra will be 25 to 30 years in the future as defined by
its role in the region; physical character; quality of life; variety of businesses;
and housing, economy, environment, safety, and comparable indicators. These
expectations are based on La Habra’s residents’ values about the characteristics
and qualities of life important today and which should be retained in the future,
as well as how the community should evolve and change in response to critical
issues challenging these values.
The Vision Statement is intended to confirm the overall direction of the General
Plan Update. As such, it is more complex and longer than generalized “mission
statements” or “mottos” used by communities and businesses. It is organized
according to six broad topics that address the breadth of issues for which La
Habra must develop goals and policies in the seven state-mandated elements,
as well as the City’s optional or permissive General Plan elements. The
outcomes expressed through the Vision Statement serve as the foundation for
the update process and facilitate the development of the goals, policies, and
implementing programs for the 2035 General Plan.
Vision Statement
The vision for the City of La Habra over the next 25 years is to assure the
retention of the community character that has developed over the past decades
(i.e., a caring community, population diversity, historic heritage, and secure
neighborhoods), while placing significant focus and prioritization on the future
reinvestment and revitalization of our commercial corridors, community facilities
and parks, infrastructure, residential neighborhoods, and schools.
1.        WHO WE ARE: OUR COMMUNITY
   a. La Habra is a community where we know and care for our neighbors,
        actively participate in events, shop at our local businesses, have a built
        environment of low rise buildings, and walk to our parks, schools, and
        business districts.
   b. We distinguish La Habra as a special place apart from the undifferentiated
        sprawl of Southern California by this character.
   c. We celebrate the history and culture that uniquely define La Habra.

                                           d. We support the energy, enthusiasm, and activities of our residents
                                              reaching out to help our neighbors.
                                           e. We value our natural environmental setting as a community set in a
                                              valley framed by hillsides and distinguished by extensive tree canopies
                                              and landscaping.
                                           f. Our community provides a diversity of uses, lifestyle choices, and
                                              amenities that provide an environment attractive and supportive for
                                              lifelong living for all residents.
         La Habra is distinguished as a
        special place due to its people,
      culture, services, and businesses
       that support community needs
                                          2.     HOW WE WILL GROW AND DEVELOP
                                           a. We will encourage the development of new housing and businesses that
                                              is compatible with and maintains the character and identity of La Habra.
                                           b. We strive to establish development patterns consistent with the existing
                                              community character, provide multiple modes of transportation, and
                                              construct infrastructure that is more sustainable and environmentally
                                              friendly through improvements that achieve reduction of such elements
                                              as energy use, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
                                           c. Our community is balanced with places for living, working, shopping,
                                              recreation, entertainment, cultural enrichment, education, and enjoying
                                              nature.
    Yes, La Habra will grow, but it will
   be sensitive integrated to retaining
      the characteristics and qualities
    that distinguish the City and it will
             be more environmentally,
             economically, and socially
                            sustainable

 B. Background
City Context
The City of La Habra is located in the northwest corner of Orange County
situated within the La Habra Basin between the Puente Hills on the north and
the Coyote Hills on the south. The City borders the Orange-Los Angeles County
line and is immediately adjacent to the Los Angeles County cities of Whittier, La
Habra Heights, and La Mirada on the west and north; and the Orange County
cities of Brea and Fullerton on the east and south. La Habra’s regional location is
reflected on Figure1-1 (Regional Location).
                                                                                    View of the La Habra valley,
                                                                                    looking north from Vista del Valle
                                                                                    Park
The topography of La Habra is characterized as a valley, with gentle rolling
terrain and hillsides in the northern and southern portions of the City. "La
Habra," which in Spanish means "pass through the hills," refers to the Spanish
Portola' Expedition of 1769, the La Habra Valley was known for its natural pass
to the San Gabriel Mission near present day Fullerton Road. The most direct
route between the San Gabriel Valley and La Habra became known as El Camino
Real. At the time of Spanish contact, the area was home to the ethnographic
Chumash, Gabrielino (Tongva), Luiseño, Juaneño, and Kumeyaay. La Habra,
located approximately 25 miles east from the Pacific Coast in the interior of
Orange County, is most closely associated with the Gabrielino. The community
was officially named “La Habra” in 1896, following the establishment of the
City of La Habra General Plan                                                                                          1-5

United State Post Office at a corner store, called the Coy Store. The Coy
Store/Post Office was named Historical Site No. 21 by the Orange County
Historical Commission in 1976.
Historically, La Habra is compared to a Mediterranean landscape and climate. Its
valley setting gives residents and visitors panoramic views of the surrounding
hillsides and plays a significant role in determining the shape, location, and
types of compatible land uses within the community. Two major determinants
of development and growth patterns include the valley, which influence the
City’s gridded streets, and the hillsides, which grant the City the opportunity to
incorporate the natural environment and terrain.
La Mirada Creek, Imperial Channel, and Coyote Creek are the major drainage
channels that collect surface water and convey it through the City. The general
pattern of drainage flow is from the north to the south until reaching the
drainage channels that transport the water in a west and southwest direction.
The City of La Habra is served by various transportation facilities including three
state highways—State Route (SR) 39 (north/south and east/west), SR 72
(east/west), and SR 90 (east/west)—and arterial streets.
In its earliest days, La Habra was primarily agricultural in nature, boasting citrus
orchards, walnut trees and avocado farms. In 1908, the Pacific Electric Railway
extended service to La Habra leading to an increase in agricultural production
and the introduction of the oil industry in 1912. The oil industry not only
brought industrial infrastructure to the area, but it also led to a postwar boom
from the 1950’s to the 1970’s, during which La Habra experienced some of its
most rapid urbanization and increases in residential housing stock. Today, much
of La Habra housing stock and other structures are reminiscent of this time
period.
In 2010, approximately 51 percent of La Habra’s land area was developed with
residential; nine percent commercial; six percent each for industrial, public uses,
and open space and parklands; and 22 percent for public rights-of-way and
other miscellaneous land uses. The City’s residential neighborhoods contained
20,624 housing units, of which approximately 62 percent were single-family
units, 35 percent were multi-family, and three percent were mobile homes. The
unincorporated County islands areas within the planning area (refer to Planning
Area Context below) are predominantly developed for single-family residential.
A small area is developed for general commercial uses, located in the
northwestern portion of the City within the Macy/Randall County Island along
Whittier Boulevard. Nearly all of the more than 14,300 individual parcels within
the City of La Habra have been developed with buildings, equipment, parking,
and related property improvements. As a result, the opportunity to build on
previously undeveloped property within the City is very limited.

                                                  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
    In 2010, La Habra was home to more than 61,000 residents, 19,924 households,
    over 4,600 businesses, and it had a median household income of $63,356. The
    2010 Census reported City’s racial demographics was composed of 57.2%
    Hispanic/Latino, 30.2% Caucasian, 9.1% Asian, 1.4% Black or African American,
    0.2% Native American/Alaskan, 1.6% Multi-racial, and 0.1% of other descent.
    The median age was 33.6 years.
    Planning Issues and Strategic Opportunities
    Research conducted for the preparation of the General Plan 2035 identified a
    number of important issues and opportunities for the future of La Habra. These
    are discussed at length in the General Plan Technical Background Report. Some
    of the most important include the following:
        ■ The distribution and densities of land use necessitate automobile access
           and inhibit pedestrian activity and transit use, resulting in high rates of
           vehicle trips, energy consumption, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions,
           and noise and degradation of public health.
        ■ La Habra lacks a clearly definable downtown that serves as the symbolic
           and functional “heart” of the City, providing a sense of community
           identity and activity
        ■ Existing residential neighborhoods are an asset of the City of La Habra,
           many of which are aging and necessitate long-term maintenance and re-
           investment to maintain their character quality.
        ■ Older residential neighborhoods, particularly those north of the
           downtown core and Civic Center, contain potential historic resources that
           could be threatened by infill and intensified development.
1-8                                              City of La Habra General Plan

   ■ With little or no vacant property, the development of new housing, retail,
     and businesses offering employment opportunities for La Habra’s
     residents will necessitate the re-use, infill, and intensification of existing
     developed properties. Properties developed with under-performing uses
     in the marketplace, improvement to land value ratios of less than one,
     and expansive surface parking with minimal building coverage offer the
     greatest opportunities for transformation and new economic investment.
   ■ Infill and intensified development poses a risk to La Habra’s historic
     character unless it incorporates uses that are appropriately scaled and
     designed to assure compatibility and adequate transitions with adjoining
     residential neighborhoods, districts, and open spaces.
   ■ The City contains a discontinuous network of greenways and open spaces
     linking neighborhoods and districts.
   ■ Many parcels located along the City’s arterials have insufficient depth and
     lot area to accommodate the type and scale of development with
     adequate parking and amenities that is demanded by the marketplace.
     Viable development of these parcels necessitates aggregation of multiple
     lots into larger development units.
   ■ Many vacant retail buildings demonstrate a surplus of lands designated
     for commercial uses by the 2020 General Plan and the La Habra Municipal
     Code (Title 18 [Zoning]).
   ■ Development proposals have been submitted to the City requesting land
     use densities and intensities that exceed those permitted by the General
     Plan and zoning ordinance.
   ■ One example where such re-examination has occurred involves the City’s
     2008-2014 Housing Element update, which stipulated amendment of the
     General Plan and Zoning Ordinance to increase the maximum residential
     density from 23 to at least 30 dwellings units per acre in the R-4 zone and
     the La Habra Boulevard Specific Plan area.
   ■ The Union Pacific Railroad Company has been reluctant in allowing a
     change of land use along the railroad right-of-way to uses such as
     parkland or for trails.
   ■ A citywide transformation is not realistic or necessary for La Habra to
     grow. Rather, it is likely that growth and change will occur in the City
     within potential areas of change where conditions such as vacant parcels,
     underutilized buildings, large open parking lots, parcel consolidation, and
     economic obsolescence lend transformational qualities, but also include
     locational opportunities and challenges.
   ■ La Habra does not exist in isolation and is part of a much larger economic
     region destined to experience substantial economic growth. According to
     the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the total
     population of the five-county Southern California region is projected to
     increase by more than 4.6 million residents over the next 25 years (from
     roughly 20.0 million residents in 2010 to more than 24.0 million by 2035).
City of La Habra General Plan                                                       1-9

                                                    CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
         ■ Employment throughout the region is projected to increase by more than
            1.6 million workers (from more than 6.0 million in 2010 to more than 7.7
            million in 2035). Due to the relatively limited supply of undeveloped
            property in many Orange County communities such as La Habra, SCAG
            projections suggest Orange County will account for a limited share of
            total population growth (7.3 percent); however, the average size of
            households in Orange County is expected to increase from approximately
            3.19 persons per household (2010) to 3.27 persons per household (2035)
            due to constraints on the supply of housing that can be built.
         ■ Orange County is a jobs-rich economic region. Business and industry
            activity throughout Orange County currently hosts enough jobs to
            support the equivalent of 1.69 workers (including self-employed, family
            enterprise, and payroll workers) per Orange County household, compared
            to 1.37 workers per household in all of Southern California. The Orange
            County job base is projected to increase over the next 25 years to a ratio
            of 1.77 jobs per household despite a limited increase in new housing. The
            rise in jobs without a corresponding increase in housing indicates Orange
            County will experience a greater incidence of doubling up and inter-
            generational sharing of household living, as well as an increase in
            commuter congestion along freeways and arterial corridors.
     Planning Area Context
     California state law requires that every city and county adopt a comprehensive,
     long-term general plan that addresses the broad range of issues associated with
     a local jurisdiction’s planning area (Government Code Section 65300). When
     establishing its planning area, cities often consider using the sphere of influence
     as a starting point. A sphere of influence is a local jurisdiction’s plan for the
     probable physical boundaries and service area of the community (Government
     Code Section 56076).
     The City of La Habra’s sphere of influence was originally adopted in 1974 by the
     Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), the agency
     responsible for establishing the sphere of influence for incorporated cities in
     Orange County. La Habra’s planning area is defined as the City’s sphere of
     influence (Figure 1-2) and includes all properties located within the City limits of
     La Habra and the six Orange County island areas (Macy/Randall Island,
     Citrus/Entrada      Island,    Citrus/Idaho     Island,    Cypress/Terry     Island,
     Cypress/Turndell Island, and Palm/Shadycrest Island).
     The total planning area covers approximately 7.6 square miles (4,844 acres)—
     7.4 square miles (4,718 acres) within the City limits and 0.2 square miles
     (126 acres) of County islands. The 7.6-square-mile area represents the ultimate
     external borders of La Habra, as the corporate boundaries of the adjacent
     jurisdictions preclude additional expansion by the City.

                                      official statement of La Habra regarding the extent and types of development
                                      needed to achieve the community’s physical, economic, social, and
                                      environmental goals. It addresses a wide variety of subject areas including
                                      housing, traffic, natural resources, land use, economic development, noise, and
                                      public safety. All specific plans, subdivisions, public works projects, and zoning
                                      decisions must be consistent with the City’s General Plan.

                                                Plan 2035

                                      grow and evolve and much of the data, analyses, and policies in the 2020
                                      General Plan are now outdated. In addition, a number of key state legislative
                                      mandates have been enacted since the current General Plan’s adoption that
                                      must also be addressed. These include legislation related to climate change,
                                      transportation, housing, and public safety issues as follows:
                                           1. Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act
                                                (2006), requires California to reduce statewide greenhouse gas
                                                emissions (GHG) to 1990 levels by 2020. The California Air
                                                Resources Board (ARB) approved the Climate Change Scoping
                                                Plan defining the primary strategies to achieve this goal
                                                statewide. As described in the La Habra Climate Action Plan, a
                                                companion to the La Habra General Plan 2035, transportation
                                                and urban development are the two primary sources of GHG
                                                emissions in the City. Based on the State Attorney General’s
                                                interpretation of AB 32, local GHG reduction targets and
                                                strategies to achieve these must be addressed by the General
                                                Plan.
                                           2. Executive Order S-3-05 aligns regional transportation planning
                                                efforts, regional GHG reduction targets, and affordable housing
                                                allocations. In compliance, the Southern California Association of
                                                Governments (SCAG) has adopted a Sustainable Communities
                                                Strategy, which allocates land uses in its Regional Plan. These

         allocations are considered in drafting the General Plan’s Land Use
         and Housing Elements.
     3. Senate Bill 97 (2007) acknowledges that climate change is a
         prominent environmental issue that requires analysis under the
         California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
     4. Complete Streets Act of 2008 revised requirements for general
         plan circulation elements to plan for a balanced, multimodal
         transportation network that meets the needs of all users of
         streets, roads, and highways including bicyclists, children, persons
         with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods,
         pedestrians, users of public transportation, and seniors.
     5. Senate Bill 812 (2010) requires the analysis of the disabled to
         include an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons
         with developmental disabilities. This analysis asks jurisdictions to
         include an estimate of the number of persons with
         developmental disabilities, an assessment of the housing need,
         and a discussion of potential resources.
The process of updating the General Plan includes many events that seek the
participation of the community and takes the Plan from vision, to creation, to
adoption by the La Habra City Council. The update process included the
following seven major steps.
Step 1: Document Existing Conditions and Community Attitudes
The first step in updating a General Plan is to understand the existing conditions
and current issues relative to the community’s growth and development. This
information was compiled into a Technical Background Report (TBR), published
in May 2012, which was used as the basis for the formulation of the updated
General Plan, Climate Action Plan (CAP), and preparation of the Program
Environmental Impact Report (PEIR).
Concurrently in 2011, a survey of community residents was conducted to
receive input reception of various land use, circulation, public service, and other
community issues. Feedback from the survey helped to formulate the Vision
Statement and further guide the General Plan Update process.
Step 2: Develop the Vision Statement
A Vision Statement was developed to express community values and aspirations
for the future of La Habra—its character, development form and uses, quality of
life and livability, environmental sustainability, public health, safety, and other
factors. The Vision establishes the framework by which all Plan goals, policies,
and implementing programs were developed. It was prepared with input from a
public workshop and the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC), then
approved by the City Council on July 18, 2011 with the support of the Planning
Commission.

                                                   CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
     Step 3: Develop the Land Use Plan Diagram
     Based on the information from the TBR, Community Survey, Visioning, and input
     from public workshops and the GPAC, an updated draft Land Use Plan Diagram
     was prepared depicting the locations, types, and densities for future
     development in La Habra. The process of developing the plan diagram involved
     four key steps: (1) identifying areas of the City likely to accommodate growth
     due to the their underutilization or economic opportunities; (2) identifying land
     use and density options for these areas; (3) evaluating the options according to
     their comparative traffic, service, and other impacts; and (4) selection of a
     preferred growth and development scenario based on public review and
     direction from the Planning Commission and City Council.
     Step 4: Develop Goals and Policies
     The City’s General Plan goals and policies were prepared to comprehensively
     address the areas of community development, mobility/circulation,
     infrastructure, community services, conservation and natural resources, and
     community safety. The 2035 goals and policies were developed with input from
     a public workshop and GPAC, building upon those contained in the La Habra
     General Plan 2020, with significant additions to reflect current community
     conditions and issues, legislative changes, and best practices.
     Step 5: Prepare the Draft General Plan 2035
     Goals, policies, and implementation programs developed in the preceding steps
     were integrated into a draft comprehensive General Plan document published
     for public review and comment in September 2013. The CAP companion
     document was also prepared to address state climate change legislative
     requirements related to GHG emission reduction.
     Step 6: Prepare the General Plan 2035 Program Environmental Impact Report
     A draft PEIR was prepared in compliance with the procedural and substantive
     requirements of CEQA. It addresses the potential impacts of growth allowed
     under the updated General Plan 2035 and the goals and policies on affected
     resources. These include, but are not limited to, traffic, air quality, GHG
     emissions, water quality, noise, parks, schools, and open space. For those
     resources that will be negatively impacted, the PEIR recommends actions to
     reduce or eliminate the impacts.
     Step 7: Public Hearings for General Plan Adoption and PEIR Certification
     The Planning Commission and City Council conducted public hearings for the
     General Plan’s approval and Program EIR’s certification. The Commission’s
     authority is to make recommendations to the Council, while the Council has sole
     approval authority.

environmental scoping meeting, and public hearings. In addition, a 12-member
General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) was formed enabling residents,
business persons, and other interested parties to provide input in regularly-
scheduled meetings in a more intimate setting.

                                     targeted. These options were analyzed for potential impacts on La Habra’s
                                     economy, traffic, environment, and quality of life and workshop participants
                                     helped select the preferred land use strategies for the City’s future.

                                                                                     CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
                                       Community Telephone Survey
       A broad sample of community     The City of La Habra commissioned a survey of residents to assist in the
       residents were polled for their identification of community strengths, issues, and opportunities as a framework
thoughts about the strengths of La
 Habra and ideas for improvement       in updating the goals, policies, and implementation programs of the General
                      and the future   Plan. Telephone interviews were conducted in English and Spanish from March
                                       2, 2011 to March 9, 2011 with a statistically valid sample of 400 residents.
                                       Questions were asked regarding four basic topics: quality of life in La Habra,
                                       priorities for the future, shopping in La Habra, and revitalization of La Habra and
                                       Whittier Boulevards. The survey found that:
                                           ■ La Habra residents are highly satisfied with the overall quality of life in the
                                              city and share an optimistic outlook toward the future.
                                           ■ Residents have a relatively positive opinion of traffic conditions in La
                                              Habra. Additionally, while a majority indicated they never use alternative
                                              transportation, many would be encouraged to use alternative
                                              transportation more often if access were improved.
                                           ■ Residents ascribed high importance to a number of issues in planning for
                                              the future of La Habra, most notably issues related to public safety,
                                              emergency services, and revitalization projects.
                                           ■ A majority of residents would support and use a walking and biking path
                                              across the central section of La Habra; however, this issue is relatively less
                                              important than other issues in planning for the future.
                                           ■ A majority of residents attend community events in La Habra, and an
                                              overwhelming majority are supportive of using City resources to hold
                                              these events.
                                           ■ Overall, residents were more likely to report they purchase their less
                                              expensive consumer products in La Habra, though providing a wider
                                              variety of stores would encourage them to do more of their shopping
                                              locally.
                                           ■ Only a small proportion of residents rely on La Habra and Whittier
                                              Boulevards for their household shopping needs; however, most residents
                                              reported a wider variety of stores would encourage them to shop along
                                              these streets more often.
                                           ■ Residents largely share the City’s vision to improve and revitalize
                                              development along La Habra and Whittier Boulevards, and residents were
                                              most likely to support commercial development.

                                       Certification of the PEIR
                                       The City of La Habra City Council held a public hearing for the purpose of
                                       receiving public comment on the Draft General Plan 2035 and PEIR. After
                                       considering all public testimony, the staff report, General Plan 2035 and PEIR,
                                       the Council adopted the 2035 General Plan and certified the PEIR.
The 2035 General Plan is organized
            to facilitate the public’s
                                       E. General Plan Organization
              understanding and its
  implementation by City staff, the    California law requires each local government to adopt a General Plan which
     Planning Commission, and City     must contain seven mandatory “elements” or chapters—land use, circulation,
                             Council.
                                       housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. These elements include a
                                       series of goals, policies, and implementation programs designed to achieve the
                                       community’s vision, described as follows:
1-20                                                                               City of La Habra General Plan

   ■ Goals describe ideal future conditions and are an expression of La Habra’s
      values. Goals tend to be very general and broad and may be abstract in
      nature. Goals are also not quantifiable or time-dependent.
   ■ Policies provide guidance to assist the City as it makes decisions relating
      to each goal. Some policies include guidelines or standards against which
      decisions can be evaluated and commit the City to a particular course of
      action.
   ■ Implementation programs identify a specific step, action, procedure, or
      technique to be taken by the City to implement the policies. They may
      include revisions of current codes and ordinances, plans and capital
      improvements, programs, financing, and other measures that should be
      assigned to different City departments after the General Plan is adopted.
A General Plan may also include optional or permissive elements that address
specific topics of local concern. Once adopted, these “optional” elements are as
legally binding as a mandatory element.
While the state statutes refer to required General Plan content as “Elements,”
the La Habra General Plan 2035 refers to these as “Chapters” and “Sections.” It
reorganizes mandated and optional content by common topics. This is a
permitted and common practice to avoid the redundancy inherent in state
legislation that repeats content due to the varying time frames for its
enactment.
The first chapter (Introduction) of the City’s 2035 General Plan provides the
context for the remainder of the document. The following six chapters
constitute the Plan’s goals and policies organized by major topic groupings:
Community Development, Mobility/Circulation, Infrastructure, Community
Services, Conservation/Natural Resources, and Community Safety. The final
chapter describes the action-oriented programs that implement the Plan’s
policies.
A list of the chapters and sections and the associated relationships to the seven
mandatory and optional elements are provided in Table 1.1 (Elements of the
General Plan).

Developing a Sustainable Future
Sustainability was first defined as development that “meets the needs of
current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.” Over time, definitions of sustainability have evolved.
Today, we think of sustainability as a three-legged-stool. Each leg represents

Maintaining a Healthy Community
The California Planning Roundtable 1 defines “A healthy community as one that
meets the basic needs of all residents, ensures a safe and sustainable
environment, provides for economic and social vitality, fosters efficient
development patterns and includes a systematic approach with robust public
engagement. Vibrant, livable communities provide opportunities to thrive
economically, environmentally and culturally, but must begin with health.”
Recognized contributing factors to maintaining a healthy community include:
    ■ Basic Needs for All
        > Affordable, accessible and nutritious foods and safe drinking water
        > Affordable, accessible, high quality health care
        > Affordable, safe, integrated, and location efficient housing
        > Safe, sustainable, accessible and affordable transportation options
        > Safe, clean environment
        > Access to quality schools
        > Access to affordable, safe opportunities for physical exercise and

Residents, Businesses, Developers, and Decision
Makers
For La Habra residents, the General Plan indicates the general types of uses that
are permitted around housing, the long-range plans and changes that may
affect neighborhoods, and the policies the City will use to evaluate development
applications. The General Plan indicates how the City will attract businesses that
provide goods and services to meet daily needs and new jobs that are closely
matched to educational skills and that lessen the need to commute. The
General Plan informs residents how the City plans to improve transportation
infrastructure, continue to provide adequate public services, and protect valued
open spaces and environmental resources. Cumulatively, the General Plan
identifies the actions the City will take to ensure that the city and its
neighborhoods remain great places to live.
For La Habra’s businesses, the General Plan outlines the measures the City will
take to protect investments and encourage future success. Expectations for the
city’s business areas are spelled out, while policies ensure that business
operations will be compatible with other businesses and nearby residential
areas.
For developers within the City, or those moving homes or businesses to the City,
the General Plan introduces the community, provides background information,
and outlines development regulations. It is important to review all maps and
policies throughout this General Plan, its appendices, the CAP, TBR, adopted
specific plans, and the La Habra Municipal Code to get a complete perspective
on how and where development may take place.
The General Plan is a tool to help City staff, the Planning Commission, and City
Council make land use and public investment decisions. Future development
must be consistent with the 2035 General Plan.
Finally, the Plan is also intended to help other public agencies, from Caltrans, to
SCAG, to local school districts as they contemplate future actions in and around
La Habra.
Goals and Policies Readers’ Guide
Each Chapter and Section contains goals and policies that will be used by the
City to guide future land use, development, and environmental protection
decisions. A goal is a statement that describes in general terms a desired future
condition or “end” state for a particular topic and tends to be very general and
broad. A policy is a clear and unambiguous statement that guides a specific
course of action for decision-makers to achieve a desired goal.
The City’s 2035 goals and policies are found in Chapters 2 through 7. The below
readers’ guide illustration is a page capture to better communicate how to
reference La Habra’s goals and policies.

                                        As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program
                                        Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) has been prepared for the General Plan
                                        2035. The PEIR is also a separate document and describes environmental
                                        conditions within the City and planning area, assesses the possible effects on
                                        the environment of implementation of the General Plan, identifies actions that
                                        will be undertaken to reduce these impacts, and evaluates the comparative
                                        impacts of alternatives to the General Plan. Most of the PEIR’s mitigation
                                        measures have been incorporated as policy into the General Plan and,
                                        consequently, the Plan is generally considered to be “self-mitigating.” The
                                        document is called a “program level” EIR, meaning that it examines the general
                                        nature of impacts at a citywide and planning area wide scale. The findings of the
                                        PEIR help determine the appropriate level of environmental review that should
                                        be performed when subsequent projects consistent with the Plan are proposed.
                                        Although the PEIR will be certified by the City Council, it is not adopted as a
                                        policy document.
                                        Lastly, a Climate Action Plan (CAP) has been prepared, and is included as an
                                        appendix to the PEIR, that responds to state legislation addressing climate
                                        change, including Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the California Global Warming Solutions
                                        Act of 2006, and Senate Bill (SB) 375 (Chapter 728, Steinberg, Statutes of 2008).

I. Implementing and Amending
      the General Plan
Following the adoption of the General Plan, the Plan will be implemented
through a variety of ordinances, programs, and activities. These specific
implementation actions are described in Chapter 8 and are referenced by
applicable policies for each “Chapter” and “Section.” A priority will be to review
La Habra’s land use regulations and procedures to ensure that they are
consistent with the General Plan 2035. The zoning map will require revisions for
consistency with the General Plan Land Use Plan Diagram and the Zoning Code
will be revised to reflect the 2035 land use classification system and
density/intensity and design and development policies.
The General Plan is intended to be a dynamic document and must be
periodically updated to respond to changing community needs. An annual
review of the Plan is required to ensure that it remains relevant. Moreover, the
Plan may be amended up to four times annually. Requests for amendments may
be submitted by individuals or initiated by the City itself. Most amendments
propose a change in the land use designation for a particular property. Policy
and text amendments also may occur. Any proposed amendment will be
reviewed to ensure that the change is in the public interest and would not be
detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare. Environmental review is
required for all General Plan amendments.

Chapter 2 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
Inherently, human settlements and communities are the physical, economic,
and social manifestations of the development of places for people to live, work,
shop, eat, entertain, and socialize. The quality of life for residents is dependent
on how these uses have been distributed, fit together, and cumulatively create
an urban form that communicates a sense of place and well-being; how they
respect and sustain natural resources; how they use economic resources
efficiently and to the benefit of the community; and how they recognize the
culture and history that defines the community’s development over time. The
Community Development chapter includes goals and policies that structure and
guide land use development, create jobs and revenue supporting community
services, provide housing for every resident, conserve historic and cultural
resources, celebrate La Habra’s unique identity, and manage growth to avoid
adverse costs and impacts.
As La Habra’s lands have been largely developed with few remaining vacant
parcels, growth and new development will occur as infill, replacement, and
intensification of existing uses. Consistent with the Vision Statement,
Community Development goals and policies strategically target and shape future
growth and development to protect existing residential neighborhoods,
economically successful business districts, and parks and open spaces. Change
will occur on lands that are underutilized containing expansive asphalt parking
lots and businesses that are closed or marginally surviving, and in areas where
additional development affords the opportunity to invigorate civic activity,
business prosperity, and expand job opportunities for residents.
The core of Community Development goals and policies will help the City evolve
from its largely undifferentiated strip arterial commercial development with
isolated shopping centers, to a pattern of distinct, pedestrian-active centers
surrounded by and serving its residential neighborhoods. The mixing and
densities of use will promote reduced automobile travel and more walking,
contributing to a smaller carbon footprint and healthier lifestyles for La Habra’s
residents.
The policies build on the seeds of an historic downtown that never has
effectively functioned as such and adds higher intensity commercial and office
uses with new housing that offers a critical mass of residents in proximity and

    walking distance of these businesses and the center of civic governance and
    administration. Street frontages will be animated with outdoor cafes,
    landscaping, and amenities that make them attractive places to walk and sit and
    enjoy the outdoors. They will function as an “outdoor living” room that
    becomes the centerpiece of community events and celebrations.
    At several arterial intersections, lands will be redeveloped as high activity
    centers that integrate a mix of retail and housing into active, pedestrian-
    oriented “urban villages.” As the downtown develops, residents will be able to
    walk to businesses while visitors leave their cars in parking lots and structures.
    They will shop at a diversity of businesses, dine in outdoor cafes, and socialize
    and participate in neighborhood events with their neighbors in plazas and mini-
    parks.
    New businesses and job opportunities will be developed in La Habra’s industrial
    districts. An aggressive program of economic development will attract new
    businesses providing job opportunities for residents. These will be
    complemented by job training and skill development offered by the businesses
    and local educational institutions.
    A diversity of new housing choices will be developed for all income levels. Most
    will be multi-family units as there are no remaining large vacant lands suitable
    for new single family housing construction. A variety of plan densities will
    accommodate townhomes, low- and mid- rise apartments, and housing
    developed in mixed-use buildings above ground-level retail.

Tying the districts and neighborhoods together will be a citywide greenways
network. Its backbone would be a redeveloped Union Pacific Railroad corridor.
With cooperation of the Railroad and possible acquisition by the City, it initially
would be heavily landscaped and developed with pedestrian paths and
bikeways. In the longer term, small passive and active parks and possible transit
uses could be added. Extending outward from the corridor, street frontages
would be developed with additional landscape and amenities to provide
connectivity to surrounding neighborhoods, business districts, and parks. New
mini-parks and open spaces would be integrated into the downtown and in
larger scale mixed-use centers.

                                               can result in buildings of very different character. The City’s Municipal Code
                                               specifies other regulations that will affect a buildings form and character within
                                               the context of the permitted FAR (e.g., building height limits, setbacks, and open

                                             CHAPTER 2: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
     Citywide Land Use Goals and Policies
     Policies in this section provide for strategic growth and change that preserve
     existing neighborhoods and target new development to infill areas that are
     vacant or underutilized, and are scaled to complement adjoining uses. Changes
     focus on enhancing the quality of life with a reduced need for automobile trips,
     increased walkability, improved connectivity among neighborhoods and
     districts, and the completion of cohesive and well-defined districts.
     GROWTH
     Goal LU1
     Growth and Change. Sustainable growth and change through
     orderly and well-planned development that provides for the
     needs of existing and future residents and businesses, ensures the
     effective provision of public services, makes efficient use of land
     and infrastructure, and promotes the health of the community.
     Policies
     LU 1.1           Redirect Growth. Redirect growth away from residential
                      neighborhoods onto underutilized parcels along La Habra’s arterial
                      corridors, industrial districts, and in the historic civic
                      center/downtown core.
     LU 1.2           Development Capacity. Accommodate the type and density of land
                      uses depicted on the Land Use Diagram to a cumulative (existing and
                      new) maximum of 24,850 housing units and 12,525,000 square feet
                      of commercial and industrial development citywide. These represent
                      increases of 4,213 units and 4.1 million square feet respectively
                      above January 2011 existing development.
     LU 1.3           Growth Exceeding Development Capacities. 1 Allow for increments of
                      development exceeding these limits provided their cumulative
                      environmental impacts do not result in impacts greater than the
                      levels of significance or change the findings described by the certified
                      General Plan Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
     LU 1.4           Subsequent Environmental Review. Require that a Program EIR
                      addressing cumulative citywide impacts be prepared when
                      increments of development exceeding these capacities result in
                      impacts greater than the levels of significance or change the findings
                      described by the certified General Plan Program Environmental
                      Impact Report (EIR).
     1
       It is anticipated that the development limits specified by Policy 1 and addressed in the General Plan 2035
     Program EIR would not be exceeded prior to the next normal updating of the General Plan, for which a new
     EIR would be prepared in accordance with CEQA.

         adequate public facilities are available at the time of occupancy.
LU 1.6   Development Costs. Require new development to contribute its
         share of the cost of providing necessary public services and facilities
         through equitable fees and exactions.
LAND USE MIX
Goal LU 2
Land Use Diversity and Choices for Residents. A mix of land
uses that meets the diverse needs of La Habra’s residents, offers a
variety of employment opportunities, and allows for the capture
of regional population.
Policies
LU 2.1   Places to Live. Provide opportunities for a full range of housing types,
         locations, and densities to address the community's fair share of
         regional housing needs and to provide market support to
         economically sustain commercial land uses in La Habra. The mix,
         density, size, and location of housing shall be determined based on
         the projected needs specified in the Housing Element, as amended
         periodically.
LU 2.2   Places to Shop. Provide for, and encourage, the development of a
         broad range of uses in La Habra’s commercial centers and corridors
         that reduce the need to travel to adjoining communities, and which
         subsequently capture a greater share of local spending.
LU 2.3   Places to Work. Provide for a broad spectrum of land uses that offer
         job opportunities for La Habra’s residents, including commercial,
         office, industrial, and business parks.
LU 2.4   Balancing Jobs and Housing. Designate sufficient land and densities
         that afford opportunities for the development of businesses offering
         jobs matched to the education and skills of La Habra’s residents and
         housing affordable to employees of local businesses, thereby
         reducing commutes to and from outside of the community.
LU 2.5   Places Supporting the Quality of Life. Provide a diversity of uses and
         services supporting La Habra’s residents such as facilities for civic
         governance and administration, public safety (police and fire), seniors
         and youth, community gatherings, and comparable activities. Work
         with external agencies and non-profit organizations to encourage the
         provision of services and facilities not under the City’s jurisdiction,
         such as public schools, parks and recreation, fire protection, and
         quasi-public infrastructure.

     B. Economic Development (ED)
     A principal objective of economic development is to foster a healthy
     environment where residents and businesses can flourish and provide revenue
     support for public services demanded in the community. A healthy economic
     environment describes a geographic setting where independent but
     interconnected business and lifestyle objectives can be realized such as earning
     a good living, running a successful business, hiring qualified workers, and
     prospering in relative safety. Economic development also depends on the
     utilization of property for housing, schools, retail shops, offices, factories, parks,
     roadways, and utilities needed to support the diverse economic objectives of
     residents and businesses. The ability to make effective use of available property
     resources influences the inherent capacity for continued economic growth in
     the community.
     Within La Habra, the available supply of vacant property is very limited and
     numerous existing properties have not been improved to their full potential. By
     comparison, the surrounding region is projected to experience significant
     economic growth in the future. To benefit from future growth that is
     anticipated, this economic development element identifies goals and policies to

                                     Housing and its production are critical to the economic and social well-being
                                     and vitality of the community and its residents. Increasingly, the State of
                                     California has recognized this situation and has legislated requirements for local
                                     jurisdictions to plan for their fair share of future housing by identifying and
                                     analyzing existing and projected housing needs and preparing goals, policies,
                                     and programs addressing those needs. The Housing Element is the only General

                                     certification by the State of California.

   focuses on new housing for those
            with the greatest needs
                                     Because of the shorter update cycle and requirements for technical analyses of

                                     bound in a separate volume. Its goals and policies are presented below and
                                     implementation programs incorporated into the comprehensive program of

D. Historic/Cultural Resources
       (CR)
Policies in this section recognize the history of La Habra as one of earliest
developing communities in southern California. With the arrival of the Southern
Pacific Railroad to the region, settlers began to buy parcels of land in the 1890’s.
The community was formally founded and named “La Habra” in 1896 with the
establishment of a local United States Post Office. By 1916, the community had
grown with stores, restaurants, hotels, commercial uses, and housing
supporting a thriving citrus production and oil industry. In 1925, La Habra was
incorporated with a population of 3,000 residents. Sites and buildings, primarily
residential and near the Civic Center core, remind us of the City’s rich and
diverse history.
The goals and policies provide for the protection of historic and cultural
resources in La Habra and ensure that City, State, and Federal historic
preservation laws, regulations, and codes are implemented. Policies support the
City pursuing the identification and maintenance of historic and cultural
resources, including consultation with appropriate organizations and individuals

                                       E. Community Identity (CI)
                                       The Community Identity Element of the General Plan provides the framework of
                                       goals and polices to enhance La Habra’s character and identity as a distinct
                                       community, distinguishing it from the sprawl of anonymous communities that,
                                       for many, characterize the Southern California region. These demonstrate the
                                       historical commitment of the City to its community members and address
                                       important characteristics that a resident, business person, or visitor can
                                       enthusiastically describe as reasons that La Habra is a special place to live, work,
                                       shop, visit, and play. They start with the assets that have been historic and
                                       cultural underpinnings of La Habra’s quality of life and add to these new
                                       opportunities emerging from visions expressed by the General Plan for its
                                       future.
                                       Factors contributing to and strengthening La Habra’s community identity fall
                                       into four categories. First, new development described in the Land Use Element
                                       offers opportunities to transform homogenous and indistinct corridors and
                                       centers into well-defined pedestrian-oriented activity areas and complete
                                       neighborhoods. These places are differentiated from the surrounding suburban
                                       fabric by their uses, physical form and scale, and community life. The aesthetic
                                       quality and character of the built environment and natural open spaces are
                                       important contributors to the sense of place and identity. Well-landscaped
                                       streets, parks, and plazas provide places for active pedestrian use and public
                                       gatherings and celebrations. Signage, landscape, public art, and other
2-50                                                                                 City of La Habra General Plan

improvements at the City’s boundaries along arterial highways provide the
sense of “entry” from adjoining communities. Finally, contributing to a positive
quality of life and health of residents are the City’s extraordinary diversity of
social, recreational, and health services.

                                      An Attractive and Aesthetically Pleasing City. A city distinguished
                                      by the high quality of its building, public streetscapes, and open
                                      spaces contributing to its desirability as a place to live, work, and
                                      shop.
                                      Policies
                                      CI 2.1     Unique Sense of Place. Promote quality site, architectural, and
                                                 landscape design that incorporates qualities and characteristics that
                                                 make La Habra desirable and memorable including varied
                                                 architectural styles, tree-lined streets, distinctive parks and open
                                                 spaces, and walkable blocks.

                                      The entirety of La Habra’s General Plan 2035 is written to manage growth and
                                      resource conservation to achieve objectives for environmental, economic, and
                                      human sustainability. Throughout the City’s General Plan, goals, policies, and
                                      implementation programs are defined that manage the location, densities,
                                      urban form, and timing of development and correlate with the provision of
                                      adequate supporting infrastructure and services.
                                      As the 2035 Plan provides a comprehensive approach to managing growth, the
                                      tradition of a separate growth management element would be redundant.
                                      However, as a city in Orange County, La Habra is eligible for a portion of monies
                                      received under Measure M and the Renewed Measure M Transportation

                                      management element. The corresponding Countywide Traffic Improvement and
                                      Growth Management Program identifies items to be covered in preparing local
                                      qualifying elements that address the following five principal topic areas:

     Traffic Improvement Programs
     Public Facility Plans
In addition, four implementing programs are required and include, growth
management areas, facility implementation plans (FIPs), countywide

improvement/public facility development agreements. These implementing
programs are described in the La Habra General Plan 2035 Implementation

Chapter 3 MOBILITY/CIRCULATION
The Mobility/Circulation Chapter sets the vision for how La Habra will meet the
future mobility needs of its residents, workers, and visitors while supporting the
goals and policies of the Community Development Element (Chapter 2) Land
Use section. The latter establishes policies for growth and land use
development, while the Mobility/Circulation Element identifies proposed
transportation strategies designed to meet the future transportation needs of
these uses. Complete streets provide for an interconnected street system for all
modes of travel between neighborhoods, commercial areas, schools, parks, and
other focal points of the City. They are designed to enable safe and convenient
access for all users.
Consistent with State legislation, the Mobility/Circulation Chapter defines the
locations and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
transportation routes, and terminals. Policies for other local public utilities and
facilities are presented in Chapter 4, Infrastructure.
A complete and balanced multi-modal transportation system is critical to
meeting the needs of all users of the city’s streets, roads, and highways. This
concept, outlined in Assembly Bill 1358 (The California Complete Streets Act)
and known as “complete streets,” is an integral part of the Mobility/Circulation
Element. The complete streets concept ensures that the needs of motorists,
commercial goods users, bicyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and the disabled
are met by accommodating all roadway users with a range of transportation
choices.
To meet the mobility needs of all users, the General Plan outlines four key
principles:
   ■    Mobility—Getting where we want to go
   ■    Livability—Creating positive communities
   ■    Prosperity—Long-term health for the region
   ■    Sustainability—Promoting efficient use of natural resources
To meet these goals while providing for the needs of the community, a set of
interrelated land use and transportation policies consistent with the Orange
County Sustainable Communities Strategy (OC SCS) are defined by this Plan.
These are intended to meet mandated targets for the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions for compliance with Assembly Bill (AB) 32. The policies are
grounded by a multi-modal approach that minimizes impacts on the
environment and neighborhoods, supports increased land use density, and
promotes efficient use of right-of-way throughout the City.
Further guiding the Mobility/Circulation Chapter’s goals and policies are major
state and federal regulatory legislation, laws, and programs. These include the
State Congestion Management Program (CMP), the State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP), Assembly Bill 1358 (The California Complete
City of La Habra General Plan                                                       3-1

                                                                        CHAPTER 3: MOBILITY/CIRCULATION
                                     Streets Act), the Federal Transportation Conformity Regulation, and the Federal
                                     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Requirements of regional agencies,
                                     including the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the
                                     Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) and the City’s Municipal Code
                                     also play key roles in shaping the Mobility/Circulation Element.
                                     A. Regional and Local Roadway
                                             Networks/Facilities (RN)
                                     The City’s local roadway networks, together with regional roadway facilities, are
                                     critical components of the transportation infrastructure and provide a network
                                     capable of responding to local and regional growth projections. They are
                                     complemented by a roadway classification system, defined set of critical
                                     intersections, appropriate controls, and standards for acceptable operating
                                     conditions, all of which are designed to ensure the efficient movement of
                                     people and goods throughout the City.
                                     The City’s roadway network is planned in consideration of complete streets
                                     principles for streets to be designed to enable safe and convenient travel by all
                                     users. A complete street typically includes sidewalks, bike lanes, comfortable
                                     transit stops, and frequent pedestrian crossing opportunities. It may also have
                                     median islands, pedestrian signals, curb extensions, lighting, and other
                                     amenities. Incorporation of the complete street concept will result in a balanced
                                     circulation system coordinated with land uses to ensure the safe, efficient, and
                                     environmentally sound movement of people and goods freely in the
                                     community. A sample cross-section of a complete street is shown on Figure 3-1
                                     (Complete Street Cross-Section).

                                     CITY ROADWAY CLASSIFICATIONS
                                     The City roadway network is comprised of seven major classes of streets, as
                                     shown on Figure 3-2 (2035 General Plan Functional Roadway Classification
                                     Map). Along with local streets and alleys, the major classes of streets provide for
                                     regional traffic movement and local access. These functional classifications
                                     include the following:
                                         ■ Augmented Arterial Highway (Smart Street)
                                         ■ Major Arterial Highway

The Augmented Arterial Highway (Smart Street), Major Arterial Highway,
Modified Major Arterial, Primary Arterial Highway, and Modified Primary
Arterial classifications primarily serve through traffic. Secondary Arterial
Highways and Commuter Arterials function as collectors funneling traffic from
local streets to Primary Arterials, Major Arterials, and Augmented Arterials.
Local Streets serve abutting property, both residential and commercial. Alleys
serve a public convenience and necessity for local traffic as part of the City’s
Street and Roadway System. Each functional roadway classification is described
in detail below. Figure 3-3 (Typical Roadway Cross Sections) illustrates typical
cross-sections of these facilities.
AUGMENTED ARTERIAL HIGHWAY (SMART
STREET)
All Augmented Arterials (Smart Streets) are “Principal Arterials” (Arterial Class
1), and are designated as six- to eight-lane divided roadways with improved
roadway traffic capacity and smooth traffic flow achieved through measures
such as traffic signal synchronization, bus turnouts, intersection improvements
such as added turn lanes and the addition of travel lanes achieved by removing
on-street parking and consolidating driveways. The typical right-of-way width of
a six-lane Augmented Arterial Highway is 120 feet, with a roadway width from
curb-to-curb of 104 feet. An eight-lane Augmented Arterial Highway has a
typical right-of way width of 144 feet, with a roadway width from curb-to-curb
of 128 feet.
MAJOR ARTERIAL HIGHWAY
A Major Arterial Highway is designated as a six-lane divided roadway, with a
typical right-of-way width of 120 feet and a roadway width from curb-to-curb of
104 feet. In La Habra, Beach Boulevard north of Imperial Highway is classified as
a Major Arterial Highway due to its 6-lane divided configuration, although it has
a right-of-way width of 142 feet and a curb-to-curb width of 114 feet.
MODIFIED MAJOR ARTERIAL
A Modified Major Arterial is designed to accommodate traffic volumes when a
Major Arterial Highway is warranted in already developed areas, but a full 120
feet of right-of-way is not feasible due to existing structures or topography. A
Modified Major Arterial is developed as a six-lane facility within a 100-foot right-

of-way and a roadway width from curb-to-curb of 84 feet. A Modified Major
Arterial will always require removal of all on-street parking.
PRIMARY ARTERIAL HIGHWAY
A Primary Arterial Highway is designated as a four-lane divided roadway, with a
typical right-of-way width of 100 feet and a roadway width from curb-to-curb of
84 feet. A Primary Arterial Highway’s function is to service non-local through
traffic and provide limited local access.
MODIFIED PRIMARY ARTERIAL
A Modified Primary Arterial is designed to accommodate traffic volumes when a
Primary Arterial is warranted in already developed areas, but a full 100 feet of
right-of-way is not feasible due to existing structures or topography. A Modified
Primary Arterial is developed as a four-lane facility within an 80-foot right-of-
way and a roadway width from curb-to-curb of 64 feet. This generally requires
removal of on-street parking, restriping for left-turn channelization, and
prohibition of left-turns during peak hours if there is insufficient right-of-way for
channelization.
SECONDARY ARTERIAL HIGHWAY
A Secondary Arterial Highway is designated as a four-lane undivided roadway,
with a typical right-of-way width of 80 feet and a roadway width from curb-to-
curb of 64 feet. A Secondary Arterial Highway serves as a collector, distributing
traffic between local streets and Major and Primary Arterials. Although some
Secondary Arterial Highways serve as through routes, most provide more direct
access from surrounding land uses than do Major or Primary Arterials.
COMMUTER ARTERIAL
A Commuter Arterial is designated as a two-lane undivided, unrestricted access
roadway, with a typical right-of-way width of 60 feet and a roadway width from
curb-to-curb of 40 feet.
LOCAL STREET
A Local Street is designated as a non-arterial street with two-lanes and on-street
parking. Local Streets generally have direct residential or commercial frontage,
and are intended to serve adjacent land uses only. These streets are not
intended to serve through traffic traveling from one street to another. The
typical right-of-way width of Local Streets varies, but is generally 60 feet. Curb-
to-curb width also varies, but is generally 40 feet.
ALLEY
An Alley is designated as a two-lane undivided, restricted access roadway, with
a typical right-of-way width of 20 feet. Alleys generally provide access to private

    garages, parking facilities, loading docks, and other business and residential
    access.
    INTERSECTION SERVICE LEVEL OBJECTIVES
    The City circulation system’s ability to handle traffic loads is generally described
    in terms of level of service (LOS). Level of service is a report-card scale used to
    indicate the quality of traffic flow. Levels of service range from LOS A (free flow,
    little congestion) to LOS F (forced flow, extreme congestion). The City of La
    Habra has established LOS D as its criterion for an acceptable level of service at
    City jurisdiction intersections. LOS E is considered acceptable for State Highway
    intersections and Congestion Management Plan (CMP) intersections.
    Brief definitions of intersection level of service are described in Table 3-1
    (Intersection Level of Service Thresholds and Definitions). Table 3-1 also
    presents the relationship between level of service and intersection capacity
    utilization for signalized intersections and level of service and control delay for
    unsignalized intersections.

FUTURE CONDITIONS
The La Habra 2035 General Plan uses the OCTA regional traffic analysis model
(OCTAM) as the basis for the future traffic volume and level of service forecasts.
The OCTA model is described and results of the analysis of potential traffic
volumes and impacts on the level of service on local and state highways
resulting from the development capacities established by Community
Development Land Use Policy LU 1.2 and its distribution depicted on the Land
Use Diagram (Figure 2-1) are presented in the Draft General Plan 2035 PEIR.
Results of the OCTAM model indicate that all of the City’s roadway segments
and intersections are expected to operate at acceptable conditions (LOS D).
However, there are expected to be two State Highway intersections that will
operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS F) during the PM peak hour:
    ■ Beach Boulevard at Imperial Highway
    ■ Walnut Street at Imperial Highway
Using the HCM methodology 1 one of these two State Highway intersection is
projected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS F) during the PM
peak hour:
    ■ Walnut Street at Imperial Highway
ROADWAY AND INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS
Roadway Segments
Roadway segment level of service is generally used for screening purposes to
determine if more detailed evaluation of intersections is necessary. The General
Plan traffic forecast indicates that operating conditions along the following
three roadway segments could decline to below acceptable levels; however,
detailed level of service analysis of these roadway segments indicates that
roadway capacity improvements will not be required:
    ■ Lambert Road, Beach Boulevard to Idaho Street
    ■ Lambert Road, Cypress Street to Harbor Boulevard
    ■ Harbor Boulevard, North City Limits to Whittier Boulevard
Intersections
As described above, the intersections which are expected to have unacceptable
level of service conditions are as follows:
    ■ Beach Boulevard at Imperial Highway
    ■ Walnut Street at Imperial Highway

                                       CHAPTER 3: MOBILITY/CIRCULATION
     Proposed measures to improve operating conditions at these two intersections
     are expected to mitigate the negative effects of increased traffic through
     incorporation of various intersection capacity improvements and traffic control
     measures. The proposed intersection improvements are summarized below.
     Beach Boulevard at Imperial Highway
     Expected traffic volume increases on Imperial Highway and Beach Boulevard
     due primarily to regional traffic growth will require capacity improvements to
     maintain acceptable operating conditions. Figure 3-4 (Conceptual Design,
     Imperial Highway/Beach Boulevard) presents a conceptual drawing for the
     recommended intersection improvements:
         ■ Construct a Fourth Northbound Through Lane
         ■ Construct a Fourth Southbound Through Lane
     The fourth northbound lane will require roadway widening south of the
     intersection. This will affect the sidewalk and property landscaping on the
     southeast corner. North of the intersection the addition of the fourth
     northbound lane can be accomplished through restriping alone. In the
     southbound direction, the change to four through lanes can also be made
     through restriping alone.
     Walnut Street at Imperial Highway
     Level of service at this intersection will be below acceptable levels due to a
     combination of southbound left-turn traffic from Walnut Street, eastbound left-
     turn traffic from Imperial Highway, and east-west through traffic on Imperial
     Highway. Conditions for east-west through traffic on Imperial Highway are
     expected to be acceptable, however long delays are expected for southbound
     left and eastbound left-turning traffic. The following improvement is
     recommended:
         ■ Install a Traffic Signal
     Four additional City jurisdiction intersections are expected to have marginal
     levels of service under 2035 General Plan conditions. A change in traffic patterns
     may result in unacceptable operating conditions at one or more of these
     intersections:
         ■ Idaho Street at Whittier Boulevard
         ■ Harbor Boulevard at Whittier Boulevard

         ■ Cypress Street at Lambert Road
         ■ Palm Street at Lambert Road
     Proposed measures to improve potentially deficient future operating conditions
     at these four intersections are presented below.
     Idaho Street at Whittier Boulevard
         ■ Capacity improvements at Idaho Street and Whittier Boulevard due to
            possible traffic volume increases are recommended to maintain
            acceptable operating conditions. The following improvements are
            recommended Construct a Third Westbound Through Lane
         ■ Construct a Third Eastbound Through Lane
     The improvements may affect the sidewalk on the west leg of the intersection
     and would require restriping of the east leg. The improvements are not
     anticipated to affect the adjacent properties.
     Harbor Boulevard at Whittier Boulevard
     Capacity improvements at Harbor Boulevard and Whittier Boulevard due to
     possible regional and local traffic volume increases are recommended to
     maintain acceptable operating conditions. The following improvements are
     recommended:
         ■ Construct a Third Northbound Through Lane
         ■ Construct a Third Southbound Through Lane
     The improvements may affect the sidewalk on the north leg of the intersection
     but are not anticipated to affect the adjacent properties. On the south leg,
     widening would be required which would affect the sidewalk and landscaping
     on the southwest corner and the property on the southeast corner. It is not
     anticipated that any structures would be affected.
     Cypress Street at Lambert Road
     Possible traffic volume increases at Cypress Street and Lambert Road may result
     in a marginal level of service at this intersection under 2035 General Plan
     conditions. The following capacity improvements are recommended to maintain
     acceptable operating conditions:
         ■ Construct a Westbound Right-Turn Lane
     Widening of the east leg of the intersection would be required for this
     improvement, which would affect the property on the northeast corner, the
     sidewalk, and the landscaping, but is not anticipated to affect any structures or
     parking. The improvement would not affect the west leg of the intersection.
     Palm Street at Lambert Road
     Forecast traffic increases along Lambert Road may result in a marginal level of
     service at Palm Street and Lambert Road under 2035 General Plan conditions.
     The following capacity improvements are recommended to maintain acceptable
     operating conditions:
3-12                                             City of La Habra General Plan

   ■ Construct a Third Eastbound Through Lane
   ■ Construct a Third Westbound Through Lane
These improvements are not anticipated to affect the adjacent properties but
would require restriping of both the west leg and east leg of the intersection.
FRAMEWORK FOR MOBILITY/CIRCULATION
GOALS AND POLICIES
The Mobility/Circulation Chapter’s goals and policies are written to comply with
County, Regional, and State circulation plans and legislation. This includes the
requirements of the Orange County Congestion Management Plan (CMP) and
the Orange County Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH), State Congestion
Management Program (CMP), the State Transportation Improvement Program
(STIP), Assembly Bill 1358 (The California Complete Streets Act), the Federal
Transportation Conformity Regulation, the Federal Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), as well as the City’s own Municipal Code.
Regional traffic problems are a major issue facing the City. These problems call
for both regional and local solutions to mitigate the effects of through traffic.
The correlation between the City’s local circulation system and its land use
policies may therefore no longer be the primary basis for determining the
structure of its future transportation network.
Finally, the existing infrastructure and land use development patterns of the City
are major constraints on how its transportation system will look in the future.
Many of the City’s arterial streets are already built-out to their maximum width,
with limited intersection improvements possible. Some streets do not have
sufficient right-of-way to add bike lanes or transit turn-outs. Funding of these
improvements may also be an issue.
City Circulation System
The following goal and policies are intended to support the City’s circulation
system objectives while helping reduce traffic congestion and achieve
greenhouse gas reduction goals.
Goal RN 1
Circulation System. Balanced circulation system coordinated
with land uses to ensure the safe, efficient, and sustainable
movement of people and goods in the community.

B. Non-Motor/Alternative
       Transportation System (AT)
Non-motorized transportation options are becoming increasingly important in
meeting the mobility needs of residents, workers, and visitors in La Habra. As
conventional transportation modes become more congested and with the
increasing need to reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality, the potential
for future growth is becoming more dependent on the development of safe and
convenient non-motorized and alternative transportation options, including
bikeway, pedestrian, and transit networks. These options reduce the use of
single-occupant vehicles and associated traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse
gas emissions and air pollution, and improve the performance of the
transportation system in general.
City of La Habra General Plan                                                      3-15
                                       CHAPTER 3: MOBILITY/CIRCULATION
     Fundamental to the move toward non-motorized and alternative transportation
     options is California Assembly Bill 1358 (AB 1358), the Complete Streets Act,
     which requires cities and counties, when updating the circulation element of
     their general plan, to ensure that those plans account for the needs of all
     roadway users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, children, older
     individuals, and individuals with disabilities. The complete streets concept aims
     to provide more transportation choices by supporting existing communities
     through transit-oriented, mixed-use development and investing in healthy, safe,
     and walkable neighborhoods.
     By implementing Complete Streets policies a community can increase the
     number of trips made by these alternative modes, correspondingly reducing the
     number of vehicle trips and associated greenhouse gas emissions. An increase in
     transit trips, bicycling, and walking will thus help the City meet the
     transportation needs of all residents and visitors while reducing traffic
     congestion and helping meet the greenhouse gas reduction goals of Assembly
     Bill 32, The Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), and SB 375, which requires
     regional transportation agencies to develop a Sustainable Community Strategy
     (SCS).
     Transit is an important component of the complete streets strategy, as it
     provides mobility for those who have little or no access to automobiles. This
     includes the elderly, working poor, students, disabled, minors, and others. The
     importance of some form of transportation for these persons is a fundamental
     need which must be accommodated in the planning process. The ability to move
     from housing areas to commercial and employment areas by transit is a
     necessary and vital contribution to the reduction of urban congestion and
     improvement in air quality.
     As the principal non-motorized transportation modes, bicycling and pedestrian
     options in conjunction with improved transit availability and flexibility are cost-
     effective ways of reducing congestion, improving air quality, and achieving
     mobility goals. The City of La Habra plans to develop a Bikeway Master Plan
     which will encourage the development of a safe and convenient bikeway
     system. The Bikeways Master Plan will be consistent with the OCTA Commuter
     Bikeways Strategic Plan, focusing on strategies to make bicycle transportation a
     viable option to the private automobile.
     The City is also committed to ensuring that adequate pedestrian circulation is
     provided in future growth areas. Planning for complete streets pays close
     attention to the needs of pedestrians in the planning for new and redeveloped
     areas. Pedestrian circulation planned as an overall system is important for
     assuring the safety of pedestrians and separating whenever possible pedestrians
     from automobile traffic in and around commercial areas and residential
     neighborhoods. The reduction of pedestrian/vehicle conflict is one of the most
     important goals of the complete streets concept.
     Improvements to the City’s transit, bikeway, and pedestrian facilities will thus
     help meet the needs of residents and visitors for non-motorized and alternative
3-16                                               City of La Habra General Plan

transportation options by providing alternative facilities and programs which
will contribute toward reaching the City’s transportation goals.

     C. Goods Movement (G)
     Goods movement is the fastest growing segment of Orange County’s
     transportation sector, and is critical to the La Habra economy. Goods are moved
     primarily by truck, with some freight traffic serving larger industrial customers
     moved by rail. The impacts on the City’s streets associated with goods
     movement have become increasingly more important, particularly with respect
     to traffic congestion and neighborhood traffic impacts. While the increasing
     levels of freight traffic are indicative of the City’s economic growth and
     competitiveness, the mitigation of the noise, traffic and health effects of this
     traffic is also critical to maintaining the quality of life in the City.
     Generally, the City’s truck traffic is directed to designated truck routes, which
     are posted with signage to advise truckers of the proper routes through the City.
     The purpose of designating specific truck routes is to guide truck traffic away
     from residential neighborhoods and light-duty streets. These designated truck
     routes are intended to reduce impacts on noise-sensitive areas and residential
     neighborhoods, and are important contributors to neighborhood quality of life
     and reduction of street damage from heavy trucks. These regulations limit the
     movement of heavy trucks exceeding 5 tons, restricting them to major and
     primary streets in the City.
     The City of La Habra’s designated truck routes include the following streets, as
     shown on Figure 3-7:
        ■    Whittier Boulevard west of Harbor Boulevard
        ■    Imperial Highway
        ■    Beach Boulevard
        ■    Harbor Boulevard south of Whittier Boulevard
     Designated Truck Routes
     The following goal and policies are intended to support the City’s goods
     movement objectives of serving the needs of its industrial and commercial users
     while protecting neighborhoods and reducing impacts to the City’s residents,
     workers, and visitors. The City’s truck routes are shown on Figure 3-7 (Truck
     Routes).
     Goal G 1
     Efficient Truck Movement. Designated routes for efficient truck
     movement that protect and reduce impacts to residential
     neighborhoods.
     Policies

D. Transportation Demand
       Management (TDM)
Transportation Demand Management, or TDM, is the management of
transportation modes, resources, technologies, and activities designed to
enhance the capacities and efficiencies of the City’s transportation
infrastructure. These measures are essentially operational modifications to the
movement of people and goods, rather than the construction or enlargement of
new facilities. Typical TDM tools may include such measures as staggered work
hours, flex time, carpooling, vanpools, transit, bicycling, preferential parking,
and alternative technologies designed to reduce traffic congestion, fuel
consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Successful implementation of TDM measures is critical to achieving La Habra’s
transportation goals of providing an efficient and reliable transportation
network while reducing congestion on the City’s roadways and reducing the
impact of the City’s transportation system on climate change. On a nationwide
basis, the increase in transportation emissions now represents 48 percent of the
increase in total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. It is therefore critical
to take measures to reduce the contribution of this sector to GHG emissions
through innovative trip reduction, technological, and land use development
strategies.
Transportation Alternatives
The following goals and policies are intended to reduce reliance on the private
automobile while maintaining mobility. This can be done through encouraging
alternative modes of transportation, more efficient usage of available resources,
and by changes in land use and transportation policy.
Goal TDM 1
Reduced Vehicle Emissions and Congestion. Conserved energy
and improved air quality as appropriate and beneficial to the
public welfare of the City and adjacent communities based on a
transportation and growth management plan.
Policies
TDM 1.1 Sustainable Communities Strategy. Support consistency with the
            Orange County Sustainable Communities Strategy (OC SCS) and SCAG
            RTP/SCS by providing an integrated land use and transportation plan
            to meet mandated emissions reduction targets consistent with SB
            375.

               much more effective than any single measure.
     E. Neighborhood Traffic
           Management Program
           (NTMP)
     The City of La Habra created a Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
     (NTMP) as a City-wide initiative to improve quality of life in residential
     neighborhoods by addressing such traffic calming issues as cut-through traffic
     and speeding. The need for the program stemmed from the City’s desire for a
     systematic approach to handling neighborhood traffic requests. The main goal
     of the NTMP program is to improve livability by reducing the impact of traffic,
     which promotes safe and pleasant conditions for all street users. The City’s
     NTMP program has five principal objectives:
        ■  Improving conditions for non-motorized street users
        ■  Improving the environment and livability of neighborhood streets
        ■  Reducing vehicle speeds and cut-through traffic volumes
        ■  Changing driver behavior
        ■  Increasing pedestrian and bicyclist safety
     These objectives can be accomplished through a combination of measures
     designed to reduce the impacts of motor vehicles on residential neighborhoods,
     pedestrian-oriented commercial areas, and other areas where excessive vehicle
     speed or volume can present safety concerns. Typical traffic calming measures
     may include roundabouts, diverters, median islands, bulbouts, chicanes,
     chokers, and speed lumps.
     Neighborhood traffic management plans were developed as a result of resident
     input through community meetings and correspondence, and City staff
     coordination with planning and engineering consultants. Through
     implementation of these plans residential streets in the plan areas have been
     made more livable by reducing traffic speed and volumes.

                 active pedestrian areas, such as the downtown core and mixed-use
                 centers that create conflict points between pedestrians and vehicles.
     F. Intelligent Transportation
             Systems (ITS)
     Intelligent Transportations Systems (ITS) are a combination of computer and
     communication technologies which generally make existing transportation
     systems such as streets and transit lines operate more efficiently and safely. In
     La Habra, ITS systems are comprised of traffic signals, computers, and traffic
     monitoring devices such as loop detectors and closed circuit video (CCTV)
     equipment. This equipment is controlled from the City’s Traffic Management
     Center (TMC) through fiber-optic and copper cable, and wireless communication
     devices.
     Intelligent Transportation Systems can provide traffic engineers and technicians,
     motorists, transit operators, and emergency responders with real-time
     information about traffic conditions through laptop computers, handheld
     internet devices, electronic messaging signs or other means. This information
     can then be used to manage, monitor and control traffic with the goal of
     improving traffic flow in the City.
     Transportation Communications and Control
     The following goal and policies are intended to make the City’s transportation
     system more efficient through the use of advanced computer and
     communication technology and dissemination of real-time information.
     Goal ITS 1
     Enhanced System Performance. Safer and more efficient
     transportation          system       through        real-time      information
     communication and control.
     Policies
     ITS 1.1 Traffic Operations Center. Maintain and improve the Traffic Operations
              Center and a citywide interconnected network to convert key
              intersections and roadways into a coordinated traffic management
              system.
     ITS 1.2 Signal Coordination. Coordinate signal timing on all major arterials with
              a local signal synchronization program consistent with the Orange
              County Traffic Signal Synchronization Master Plan (TSSMP).

         City’s multimodal corridors to enhance overall system performance.
ITS 1.5 Traffic Signal Optimization. Reoptimize traffic signal timing periodically
       as needed to reduce travel time and delay, and improve traffic flow and
       air quality.
G. Parking (P)
Parking resources in the City of La Habra can be generally divided into three
categories: on-street public parking, off-street public lots and structures, and
off-street private parking (including shopping centers, apartment complexes,
etc.). The City’s zoning code ensures that adequate off-street parking is
provided for all land uses. City lots generally have no restrictions for most
spaces, while private lots may be managed through such means as tenant
restrictions, time limits, pay parking, or permits. On-street parking may be
unrestricted, or may have time limits to control turnover in some commercial
areas.
The City’s parking supply is generally adequate for the existing demand,
managed in some cases by implementation of time limits or fees. However
during times of peak demand the need for parking spaces may be greater than
the supply, particularly on-street parking. During these times, parking
management can be used to control and allocate parking resources, with the
goal of optimizing performance and utilization of those facilities, while reducing
demand through the implementation of various policies such as pay parking or
time limits.
Parking Alternatives
The following goal and policies will help the City of La Habra achieve its parking
goals through the efficient management of the existing parking supply,
allocation of scarce parking resources for new and existing facilities, and
reduction of overall parking demand.
Goal P 1
Parking Resource Management. Efficient parking management
system that allocates scarce parking resources and reduces overall
parking demand.
Policies
P 1.1       On-Street Parking. Regulate on-street parking demand through
            implementation of time limits such as 2-hours in retail/restaurant

Chapter 4 INFRASTRUCTURE
The City of La Habra recognizes that utilities are necessary for commerce and a
high quality of life for the community including infrastructure that distributes
water and energy; drains stormwater, treats sewage, recycles, and collects solid
waste; and provides telecommunications services to residents and businesses.
This chapter addresses infrastructure systems in La Habra and provides direction
to maintain and enhance these key assets and services to keep pace with new
development, population, and employment growth.
A. Water System (WS)
The City of La Habra manages and operates its domestic water system within
the 7.6 square-mile planning area, which includes the City limits boundaries and
Orange County island areas. The City obtains its domestic water supply from
groundwater and imported water sources. Roughly 43 percent of the City’s
potable water comes from three City groundwater wells pumped from the La
Habra Groundwater Basin (La Bonita Park Well, Portola Park Well, and the Idaho
Street Well). Imported water accounts for the remaining total water deliveries
and comes from two sources; through interties with the California Domestic
Water Company (CDWC) (47 percent), which the City owns water rights to, and
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) via the Municipal
Water District of Orange County (MWDOC) (10 percent).
As part of its water system, the City maintains 140 miles of pipelines within its
service area, six booster pump stations, and fifty-six pressure-regulating
stations. The pressure regulating stations divide the distribution system into
twenty-one different pressure zones. In addition, the City maintains emergency
interconnections with Suburban Water Systems (SWS) and the cities of Fullerton
and Brea. La Habra also has rights to a portion of the emergency supply in the
Orange County Reservoir.

                                      B. Sewer System (SS)
                                      The City of La Habra sewer service area is located at the northern end of the
                                      Orange County Sanitation District’s (OCSD) Revenue District 3. The OCSD sewer
                                      system collects wastewater through an extensive system of gravity flow sewers,
                                      pump stations, and force mains.
                                      The City’s sewer collection system is made up of a network of gravity sewers.
                                      The gravity system consists of approximately 125 miles of pipe and 2,680
                                      manholes and cleanouts. There are approximately 13,505 laterals connected to
                                      the system. The general direction of flow is from north to south and east to
                                      west. The majority of the local sewers tie into one of two OCSD trunk sewers:
                                      the Imperial Relief Interceptor in Imperial Highway, or the Miller Holder Trunk
                                      Sewer in Beach Boulevard. The sewage is then transported out of the City to the
                                      southwest. The City currently does not have the infrastructure or capacity to
                                      utilize recycled water from the sewer collection system.

C. Storm Drain System (SD)
The general pattern of drainage flow in the City of La Habra is from the north
and south towards the center of the City until it reaches the channels and
creeks, which then collect and transport the surface water flows in westerly and
southwesterly directions through La Habra to the Los Angeles County line. The
Orange County Public Works (OCPW) is responsible for the design, construction,
operation, and maintenance (e.g., debris and vegetation removal) of regional
flood control facilities. La Mirada Creek and Coyote Creek are the two largest

D. Water Quality (WQ)
The City of La Habra overlies the small un-adjudicated La Habra Groundwater
Basin and is entirely within the Coyote Creek Watershed (CCW), a tributary to
the San Gabriel River. The CCW drains approximately 165 square miles of
densely populated urbanized areas of residential, commercial, and industrial
development as well as some areas of open space and natural land primarily
within Orange and Los Angeles counties and a small portion in San Bernardino
County. Generally, the northern and eastern portions of the Watershed, where
La Habra is located, are characterized by permeable aquifer materials and
therefore accept groundwater recharge. The geologic structure of the La Habra
Groundwater Basin area is bounded on the north by the Puente Hills and on the
south by the Coyote Hills and consists of bearing zones or aquifer units
associated with the Alluvium, La Habra, Coyote Hills, and San Pedro formations.

    E. Energy (E)
    Electricity in La Habra is provided by Southern California Edison Company (SCE).
    SCE has three electrical facility substations that serve the City. The majority of
    its utility infrastructure is located above ground in the form of overhead power
    lines. The City is working to convert the overhead utility lines to underground as
    the best way to provide higher quality and more reliable electrical service.
    Natural gas service in La Habra is provided by Southern California Gas Company
    (SCGC). SCGC maintains medium pressure facilities in nearly every street of the
    City, and gas transmission lines are located throughout La Habra, with a high-
    pressure gas main in the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way, which generally
    traverses the City in an east-west direction.

G. Solid Waste Management
and Recycling (WR)
The City of La Habra’s contracted waste hauler is Waste Management of Orange
County (WMOC). The WMOC provides weekly residential, commercial, and
industrial waste and mixed recycling collection services. The City’s Refuse and
Recycling Division oversees the waste collection services and varied recycling
programs offered by La Habra.
WMOC operates two transfer stations, one in the City of Irvine and the other in
the City of Orange. Each day these facilities handle and sort trash, recyclables,
construction and demolition materials, and green waste. Sorted solid waste is
disposed of either at the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill near Irvine, the Olinda
Alpha Landfill near Brea, or the Prima Deshecha Landfill in San Juan Capistrano.
The City has had significant success in implementing its many recycling
programs. The National Resource Defense Council (NRDC) listed the City of La
Habra as a “Smarter City” in 2009 for its recycling efforts. Of those cities with
populations between 50,000 and 99,000, La Habra ranks 28th overall in the
Country and 2nd overall in the greater Los Angeles area for sustainability and
livability, and 11th in the nation for its results in recycling based on the City’s
recycling programs, items recycled, and the availability of pick and recycling bins
in public places.
Solid Waste Services
The following goal and policies encourage existing and future generations to
adopt an integrated solid waste management of facilities, services, and

The City of La Habra contracts with the Los Angeles County Fire Department
(LACoFD) for fire suppression and emergency medical services. The LACoFD is a
full service fire department that provides fire protection, emergency medical
services, hazardous materials response, and other life safety services. The
LACoFD service area includes 58 District cities and all unincorporated county
areas, excluding the City of Los Angeles. The City of La Habra is located in
Division IV, Battalion 21 of the LACoFD, which covers the cities of La Habra, La
Mirada, Whittier, Cerritos, and Norwalk. There are four stations that provide
first-in jurisdictional coverage to the City of La Habra. Three of these stations—
Stations 191, 192, and 193—are located within the City limits, while Station 194
is located in the City of La Mirada, immediately southwest of La Habra along
Beach Boulevard on property owned by the City of La Habra. Although the first-
in jurisdictional coverage is provided by these four stations, the LACoFD
operates under a regional concept in its approach to providing fire protection
and emergency medical services. Emergency response units are dispatched as
needed to an incident anywhere in the District’s service territory based on
distance and availability without regard to jurisdictional or municipal
boundaries.

Chapter 6 CONSERVATION/NATURAL
                                 RESOURCES
Natural resources help shape communities and La Habra’s gentle rolling
terrain, hillsides, and creek corridors inspire residents and visitors alike. The City
of La Habra values its natural resources and is committed to the conservation
and protection of its biological resources and habitats, water, air, scenic
amenities, and minerals. Preserving the quality of these resources is not only
beneficial to current residents, but is crucial to the sustainability of future
generations.
A. Biological Resources/Habitat
       (BR)
As La Habra is largely urbanized with few remaining natural open spaces, its
landscapes primarily consist of nonnative ornamental species that have been
planted around commercial, residential, and industrial buildings, in parking lots,
along streets, and in the open space areas of the City’s parks and schools.
Various tree species provide suitable nesting and roosting habitat for resident
and migratory bird species. Wildlife in La Habra is limited to species that are
adapted to highly urbanized areas such as birds and small mammal species
including raccoons, skunks, opossum, ground squirrels, and small rodents.
Few areas of the City support sensitive biological resources and are primarily
mitigation areas of protected plant species within the Westridge Golf Course.
Mitigation areas were formed as a requirement of the La Habra Hills Specific
Plan development, which provide for the protection of Mulefat scrub, Southern
willow scrub, Freshwater marsh, Coastal sage scrub, and Coastal oak woodland
plant species. The protected areas within the Westridge Golf Course also
support sensitive bird species including the coastal California gnatcatcher, which
depend on nesting and foraging habitat provided by vegetation found within
Coastal sage scrub.
Sustainable Ecosystems
The following goal and policies support the conservation, protection, and
enhancement of biological resources and wildlife habitat as an essential
component of a sustainable ecosystem.
Goal BR 1
Biological Resources and Habitat. Conserve, protect, and
enhance varied biological resources and wildlife habitat.

B. Water/Watershed/
       Groundwater Recharge (W)
The City overlies the La Habra Groundwater Basin. The geologic structure of the
basin area is dominated by the northwest trending U-shaped down-fold known
as the La Habra Syncline that is bounded on the north by the Puente Hills and on
City of La Habra General Plan                                                                                       6-3

    the south by the Coyote Hills. The La Habra Syncline is a naturally occurring
    trough where significant quantities of groundwater have accumulated over the
    past 150,000 years. The City of La Habra is located entirely within the Coyote
    Creek Watershed (CCW), which is a tributary to the San Gabriel River and
    comprises an area that drains approximately 165 square miles of densely
    populated urbanized areas as well as some areas of open space.
    Because La Habra is predominantly urbanized and developed with impervious
    surfaces (i.e., asphalt and concrete paving), the groundwater recharge that
    occurs within the City is limited. Percolation occurs in the natural creek courses
    of Coyote and La Mirada creeks, parks, other open space areas such as school
    playfields, and the Westridge Golf Course. The general pattern of drainage flow
    in La Habra is from the north and south towards the center of the City until it
    reaches the channels and creeks which collect and transport the surface water
    flows in westerly and southwesterly directions through La Habra to the Los
    Angeles County line.
    Water Resources
    The following goal and policies protect watershed, surface water, and
    groundwater resources from the degradation of runoff and pollution.

                                     C. Air Quality and Climate (AQ)
                                     The City of La Habra is located within the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB), named
                                     so because its geographical formation is that of a basin, with the surrounding
                                     mountains trapping the air and its pollutants in the valleys or basins below. This
                                     area includes all of Orange County and the nondesert portions of Los Angeles,
                                     San Bernardino, and Riverside counties. The regional climate within the SCAB is
                                     considered semi-arid and is characterized by warm summers, mild winters,
                                     infrequent seasonal rainfall, moderate daytime onshore breezes, and moderate
                                     humidity. The air quality within the SCAB is influenced by a wide range of
                                     emissions sources such as dense population centers, heavy vehicular traffic, and
                                     industry, as well as meteorology.
                                     Air quality management throughout the SCAB is the responsibility of the South
                                     Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD divides the SCAB
                                     into forty Source Receptor Areas (SRAs) in which thirty-six monitoring stations
                                     operate to monitor the various concentrations of air pollutants in the region.
                                     The City of La Habra is located within SRA 16, which covers the northern Orange
                                     County area. SCAB is known to have some of the highest concentrations of air
                                     pollutants in the nation and has been classified by the U.S. Environmental
                                     Protection Agency (USEPA) as a federal-level extreme nonattainment area for
6-6                                                                               City of La Habra General Plan
ozone and a serious nonattainment area for carbon monoxide (CO) and fine
particulate matter (PM10). It has also been classified as a nonattainment area for
these same pollutants by the California Air Resources Board (ARB).
Off-highway and highway motor vehicles are the primary source of air
pollutants in La Habra. Traffic-congested roadways and intersections have the
potential to generate localized high levels of CO. Other local emission sources
include stationary activities such as space and water heating, landscape
maintenance from leaf blowers and lawn mowers, consumer products, and
mobile sources.

B. Emergency Preparedness (EP)
Emergency preparedness is essential in establishing a sense of well-being in the
community. The City’s emergency service provider is responsible for monitoring
and coordination of all tactical, medical, and rescue operations including
response to situations such as collapsed structures, earthquakes, hazardous
materials, multi-casualties, terrorism, and wildland fires. The City of La Habra
supports an appropriate and effective response to emergencies and disasters,
which includes implementation of the City’s Emergency Response Plan (ERP)
and Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP). The ERP determines the actions to be taken
by the City to prevent disasters, where possible; reduces the vulnerability of
residents to any disasters that cannot be prevented; establishes capabilities for
protecting citizens from the effects of disasters; responds effectively to the
actual occurrence of disasters; and provides for recovery in the aftermath of an
emergency involving extensive damage to the community. The La Habra Hazard
Mitigation Plan (HMP) is a FEMA-approved strategic planning tool that provides
mitigation strategies for the reduction or prevention of injury to people and
damage to property from hazards. Hazard mitigation is effective and decreases
the demand for emergency response resources, reduces the principal causes of
injuries and deaths, enables a quicker lifesaving response and economic
recovery, and reduces societal impacts. The City’s participation in automatic and
mutual aid agreements ensures adequate resources, facilities, and other
support services necessary during and after disasters and emergencies.

C. Noise (N)
The urban environment contains a variety of land uses—residential,
commercial, institutional, industrial, and recreational—that can be sources of
noise and affect the way people live and work. In general, the greatest source of
noise throughout La Habra is vehicle roadway noise generated along the City’s
arterial roadways such as Beach Boulevard, Imperial Highway, Whittier
Boulevard, and Harbor Boulevard in addition to roadways within residential
areas. Other sources of noise in La Habra include freight trains passing though
the City on the rail line and various stationary sources such as commercial
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units and park facilities with
active sports fields.
Noise Reduction
The following goals and policies are designed to maintain compatible land uses
with acceptable environmental noise levels to protect La Habra’s residents and
workforce from excessive noise.
Goal N 1
Noise Environment. Ambient noise levels that are compatible
with La Habra’s small town character and are not disruptive to the
residents’ quality of life.
Policies
N 1.1     Land Use Compatibility. Restrict the development of noise-sensitive
          land uses (i.e., schools, medical centers and hospitals, senior centers,
          and residences) in areas with noise levels that exceed those
          considered clearly incompatible with the use, as shown in Figure 7-2
          and Table 7-1(Land Use Compatibility with Community Noise
          Environments), unless measures can be implemented to reduce noise
          to acceptable levels.

              and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan) (October 2003).
 INTERPRETATION:
 Zone A Clearly Compatible: Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal
 conventional construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
 Zone B Compatible with Mitigation: New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise
 reduction requirements are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional construction, with closed
 windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice. Note that residential uses are prohibited with Airport CNEL
 greater than 65.
 Zone C Normally Incompatible: New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does
 proceed, a detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
 Zone D Clearly Incompatible: New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

     N 1.3     Noise Studies for New Development. Require an acoustical study for
               all new residential developments that lie within the 65 dBA noise
               contour based on projections of future noise conditions resulting
               from the Plan’s traffic increases to ensure indoor levels will not
               exceed City standards. In addition, the City will continue to enforce
               the California Building Code for indoor noise levels.
     N 1.4     Noise Attenuation through Building Design. Require measures that
               attenuate exterior and/or interior noise levels to acceptable levels to
               be incorporated into all development projects where current and/or
               future noise levels may be unacceptable.
     N 1.5     Noise Attenuation through Site Design. Require noise reduction
               features to be used in the site planning process for new projects
               where current and/or future noise levels may be unacceptable. The
               focus of these efforts will be site design techniques. Techniques
               include:
                   ■ Designing landscaped building setbacks to serve as a buffer
                       between the noise source and receptor.
                   ■ Placing noise-tolerant land uses such as parking lots,
                       maintenance facilities, and utility areas between the noise
                       source and receptor.
                   ■ Orienting buildings to shield noise-sensitive outdoor spaces
                       from a noise source.
                   ■ Locating bedrooms or balconies on the sides of buildings facing
                       away from noise sources.
                   ■ Utilizing noise barriers (e.g., fences, walls, or landscaped berms)
                       to reduce adverse noise levels in noise-sensitive outdoor activity
                       areas.
     N 1.6     Noise Between Adjacent and Mixed Uses. Require that mixed-use
               and multi-family residential developments demonstrate adequate
               isolation of noise between adjacent uses through building design and
               location of loading areas, parking lots, driveways, trash enclosures,
               mechanical equipment, and other noise sources away from the
               residential portion of the development.

N 1.7     Interior Vibration Standards. Require construction projects
          anticipated to generate a significant amount of vibration to ensure
          acceptable interior vibration levels at nearby residential and
          commercial uses based on current City or Federal Transit
          Administration (FTA) criteria.
N 1.8    Construction Noise. Require development projects subject to
         discretionary approval to assess potential construction noise impacts
         on nearby sensitive uses and to minimize impacts on these uses, to
         the extent feasible.
Goal N 2
Mobile Noise Sources. Minimized noise impacts of motor vehicle
traffic on sensitive receptors.
Policies
N 2.1     State Motor Vehicle Noise Standards. Encourage the enforcement of
          State motor vehicle noise standards for cars, trucks, and motorcycles
          through coordination with the California Highway Patrol and La Habra
          Police Department.
N 2.2    Municipal Fleet. Purchase municipal vehicles and equipment with low
         noise generation and maintain them to minimize noise.
N 2.3     Roadway Noise Sensitivity Measures. Ensure the implementation of
          noise attenuation measures in the design of roadway improvements
          consistent with funding capability.
N 2.4     Roadway Construction. Minimize transportation noise through street
          and right-of-way design or route coordination including reducing
          speed limits or planting street trees along high-volume arterials.
N 2.5    Train Operations. Work with the railroad company to ensure that
         they mitigate train operations and noise levels to the extent feasible
         as to not adversely impact adjoining residential neighborhoods
         including incorporation of mitigating buffers or other noise abatement
         improvements.
Goal N 3
Stationary Noise Sources. Minimized noise impacts of non-
transportation-related sources on sensitive receptors.
Policies
N 3.1     Protection from Stationary Noise Sources. Continue to enforce
          interior and exterior noise standards to ensure that sensitive noise
          receptors are not exposed to excessive noise levels from stationary
          sources such as machinery, equipment fans, and air conditioning
          equipment.

     N 3.2      High-Noise Generating Uses. Require that bars, clubs, entertainment
                venues, and other uses characterized by high levels of patronage and
                activity be constructed and designed consistent with the City’s noise
                standards to isolate noise to the interiors and limit perceptible
                exterior noise.
     N 3.3      Compatibility with Parks and Recreation Uses. Limit the hours of
                operation for parks and active recreation uses in residential areas to
                minimize disturbances to residents.
     N 3.4      Regulation of Sound-Amplifying Equipment. Continue to regulate the
                use of sound-amplifying equipment to prevent impacts on sensitive
                receptors.
     N 3.5      Construction Activity Hours. Continue to enforce restrictions on the
                hours of construction activity to minimize impacts of noise and
                vibration on adjoining uses from the use of trucks, heavily drilling
                equipment, and other heavy machinery.
     D. Hazardous Waste (HW)
     Hazardous waste or materials are generally considered any substance that due
     to the quantity, concentration, physical or chemical characteristics poses a
     significant present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the
     environment if released, including liquid chemicals, gases, waste oils, and
     solvents utilized in commercial-industrial processes or as cleaning solutions
     and/or paints commonly used in residential homes. Automotive and
     transportation-related businesses, dry cleaners, and industrial facilities are the
     primary sources of hazardous waste or materials in La Habra, in addition to the
     household hazardous waste (e.g., paint, oil, batteries, oil filters, household
     chemicals, and household cleaners) that is generated from residential
     households, which can be harmful if not handled and disposed of properly.
     Hazardous Materials, Conditions, and
     Household Hazardous Waste

Chapter 8 IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL
A. Introduction
This Implementation Manual is a set of measures to achieve the goals and
policies set forth in the La Habra General Plan 2035. There is, in fact, an array of
programs, actions, strategies, and processes that will be undertaken to
implement the General Plan in the performance of day-to-day City operations. If
La Habra’s General Plan is to serve its purpose effectively, it must be reviewed,
maintained, and implemented in a systematic and consistent manner. At a
minimum, the programs and timeframes described in this chapter should be
reviewed and updated at least once every five (5) years to reflect prevailing
fiscal resources, community needs, and priorities. Revisions to these shall not
constitute an amendment of the General Plan provided that they are consistent
with and carry out its goals and policies. As such, they will not necessitate
environmental review to conform to California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) requirements.
This chapter begins with a summary of the most important programs for
implementing the General Plan 2035 to satisfy statutory requirements for
content and consistency. It should be noted that the timeline for the initiation
or completion of a program is only an estimate and is dependent on the
availability of funding resources.
Within these timeframes, the implementing programs/“tools” are organized
according to eleven categories:
     A. General Plan Maintenance and Monitoring
     B. Implementing Policy Documents and Regulatory Codes
     C. Development Review and Entitlement
     D. Master Plans and Public Improvements
     E. Financing and Budgeting
     F. Planning Studies and Reports
     G. City Services and Operations
     H. Intergovernmental Coordination
     I.  Joint Partnerships with the Private Sector
     J.  Special Districts
     K. Public Information
The table on the following page summarizes the Implementation Programs,
identifies their projected time frames, and references the page numbers in
which they are fully described.

B. Near Term Implementation
This section describes programs that have a high priority for implementation to
ensure compliance with legislation for General Plan consistency and should be
implemented within five (5) years of General Plan 2035 adoption.
 A. General Plan Maintenance and Monitoring
    A1                             General Plan Monitoring System
 Establish a comprehensive development tracking system building on existing tools
 and procedures that incorporates reporting metrics to ensure consistency with the
 2035 General Plan’s goals and policies. Tracking new development as it is approved
 will enable the City and utility and service providers to anticipate the impacts of
 growth, plan for improvements and mitigation to address these, and assess
 conformance with economic, environmental and social performance targets. It will
 also provide information to the public and developers regarding the remaining
 development potential allowed by the General Plan. Among the metrics that should
 be incorporated into a comprehensive development tracking system are:
 1.   The number of entitled residential units and non-residential building square feet
      and, when permits are issued, adjustment of the remaining development
      capacity based on the limits specified by Policy LU 1.2. This should include a
      procedure to restore un-built capacity should the permitted project not be
      constructed.
 2.   Development impacts on critical issues such as traffic, air quality, community
      services, and infrastructure and assessment of these for consistency with the
      findings of the 2035 General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
 3.   Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (refer to B. Annual Implementation,
      A3, Annual Climate Change Report below)
 4.   Number and pricing of constructed affordable housing units.
 5.   Balance of jobs and housing.
 6.   Number and types of created jobs and salaries.
 7.   Adequacy of community infrastructure and services (parks, police, fire, and
      other) to meet needs of La Habra’s residents.
 8. Other metrics defined by the Plan’s policies and of importance to the City.
 The City should establish a procedure for adjusting the General Plan’s development
 capacity on achieving 85 percent of the stipulated development capacity, based on
 data provided by the tracking system. At this stage, this may involve (a) conducting a
 study to determine if additional capacity could be accommodated without exceeding
 the thresholds and findings of significance described in the 2035 General Plan EIR
 and, if so, adjusting the capacities accordingly; and/or (b) initiating an update of the
 General Plan reassessing appropriate development capacity. These could be
 undertaken for an individual project, with the applicant assuming the costs, or as a
 GPA amendment funded by the City.

         B1                                      Zoning Ordinance
      On adoption, the City of La Habra shall thoroughly review and amend the Zoning
      Code’s (Municipal Code, Title 18) standards and regulations for consistency with the
      General Plan’s Land Use Plan Diagram and the goals and policies presented in all
      “chapters” and “sections” (or elements). In accordance with state statutes, the
      Zoning Code shall be amended “within a reasonable time” of the adoption of the
      updated General Plan. While a specific time frame is not specified, it is common
      practice for communities to revise their zoning within a 12- to 18-month time period.
      In summary, map and text amendments may be necessary to accomplish the
      following:
      1.   Review and revise land use classifications to reflect the General Plan’s policies for
           permitted uses, densities/intensities, development standards, and design
           guidelines. These need to reflect the new land use categories, including those
           providing for mixed-use and higher density development.
      2.   To facilitate the development of multifamily housing and address the un-
           accommodated need of 77 units for lower income households, the City will
           rezone each Site 4 parcel (see the City’s 2014-2021 Housing Element, Table 28,
           Vacant Developable Land) to meet the statutory requirements of State law and
           permit at least 30 residential dwelling units per acre. The sites rezoned must have
           site capacity of 16 units; permit multifamily residential uses by-right, without a
           conditional use permit, planned unit development permit, or other discretionary
           action; and at least 50 percent of the un-accommodated need must be on sites
           zoned for exclusively residential uses. If the City is unable to rezone sufficient Site
           4 parcels to meet the statutory requirements, the City will identify and rezone
           another suitable site(s) within zone(s) of appropriate densities to address the un-
           accommodated need of 77 units; that has available water and sewer service; and
           that is available for development within the planning period.
      3.   Among the development standards that should be reviewed and may need
           revisions are those addressing 1:
            Transitions and buffers between areas of differing use and/or density
            Compatibility of mixed use development projects
            On-site recreational facilities and other amenities for multi-family residential,
                mixed-use, and larger scale development projects
            Creation of pedestrian districts, regulating use and design
            Parking requirements including possible adjustments for mixed-use
                development projects and those providing preferential parking and/or free
                parking for carpools, vanpools, and alternative fuel vehicles
            In-lieu fees to offset on-site parking requirements for the construction of
                shared parking facilities
            Incorporation of on-site and shared bicycle facilities
            Application of sustainable design standards for land development and
                operation
            Best and contemporary practices for environmental protection addressing
                such issues as wildlife habitat, water quality, scenic vistas, night sky and
                illumination, and mineral resource extraction and remediation
            Parkland requirements for 2.5 acres per 1,000 residents in active and
                recreational use
    1
      This is a generalized and incomplete list and it will be necessary to review all 2035 General
    Plan policies to determine the need to revise Municipal Code sections

 and controls the division of land within the City in accordance with the Subdivision
 Map Act and Government Code §66411. The Subdivision Ordinance regulates the
 design and improvement of subdivisions, requires dedications of public
 improvements, and requires conformity with The City’s General Plan. On adoption of
 the 2035 General Plan, the Subdivision Ordinance shall be reviewed and amended
 where necessary to ensure consistency with its goals and policies. This may
 encompass revisions for consistency with the Plan’s policies pertaining to the
 intermixing of uses; land use compatibility and transitions; site planning and design;
 sustainable landscapes; conservation and protection of wildlife ecosystems, riverine
 corridors, and sensitive habitat areas; low-impact development improvements
 (water); alternative energy systems; undergrounding of utilities; design of public

      Adopt and implement the goals, policies, and implementation programs contained in
      the La Habra Climate Action Plan (CAP). 2 The CAP is designed to address climate
      change and reduce La Habra’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the local level, in
      compliance with Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of
      2006. A target for emission reduction is defined and policies and programs for
      attainment through municipal and private development actions are specified. Largely,
      these focus on land use and mobility actions that reduce automobile trip generation
      and energy and water consumption. These complement and provide greater
      specificity to policies embedded throughout the La Habra 2035 General Plan, as
      summarized in Appendix B, General Plan 2035: Addressing Climate Change.
      The CAP, once adopted following certification of the 2035 General Plan, may be used
      in the cumulative impacts analysis of later projects. An environmental document that
      relies on a greenhouse gas reduction plan for a cumulative impacts analysis must
      identify those requirements specified in the plan that apply to the project, and, if
      those requirements are not otherwise binding and enforceable, incorporate those
      requirements as mitigation measures applicable to the project. If there is substantial
      evidence that the effects of a particular project may be cumulatively considerable,
      notwithstanding the projects compliance with the specified requirements in the plan
      for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, an EIR must be prepared for the
      project.

      occupancy private vehicles), or to redistribute this demand in space or in time.
      Categories of TDM strategies addressed by the 2035 General Plan include: complete
      streets, alternate modes of transportation, expanded transit opportunities, active
      transportation facilities including bike lanes and multi-use trails, compact mixed-use
      development , pedestrian-oriented design and streetscape improvements, reduced
      parking requirements, traveler information systems, incentives for van pools and
      carpools, free or discount transit passes, and flex-time work schedules. The strategies
      should be developed through a planning process engaging local and regional
      transportation agencies, including the Orange County Transportation Authority

 The City shall develop and implement an Economic Development Strategy whose
 objective is to attract and retain quality businesses to the City of La Habra that offer
 job opportunities for local residents, contribute revenue to support City services, and
 creates an environment of robust innovation and economic vitality. Components
 should be based on models successfully implemented by other Orange County and
 California jurisdictions and may include:
  An aggressive marketing and outreach campaign;
  Scheduled events and programs promoting and celebrating the La Habra
     community through a diverse mix of City promotional channels including program
     schedules, water billing notices, cablevision, and other media channels;
  Incentives for business development such as expedited entitlement, fee waivers,
     parking reductions, land acquisition, and other techniques;
  Collaboration with local community colleges, vocational schools, job placement
     agencies, and job fairs offering scheduled job training and placement programs;
  Promotion of language and basic job skills development programs offered in the
     local area by promoting these activities through the City Community Services
     Department and other communications directed to City residents;
  Formulate job information program focused on job announcement and
     application opportunities based on collaboration with area job placement
     agencies/job fairs; and
  Development of collateral materials that provide information and “sell La Habra”
     (location, climate, character, culture, history, demographics, community services,
     and so on) and provide information about development opportunities for new
     businesses, including incubator start-ups. These may be formatted as
     publications, videos, PowerPoint presentations, scripted seminar presentations,
     and posted on the City’s website.
 Economic development strategies should be defined at two levels: for general
 categories of use (e.g., technology-based enterprises, incubators and “start-up”
 companies) and specific locations (e.g., Downtown Core or mixed-use centers).
 Consistent with 2035 General Plan policies, priorities should be placed on the
 marketing of opportunities for the Downtown Core, new development of the City’s
 industrial lands, and redevelopment of underutilized properties along the City’s
 commercial corridors.
 Once adopted, the results of the Economic Development Strategy should be reported
 to the City Council annually. It should be reviewed every five years for its
 effectiveness and amended, as necessary, to reflect prevailing economic conditions
 and markets and enhance its utility based on funding availability.

     information and conduct research through case study examples and other
     experiences from similar cities to develop baseline best practice provisions that
     would require new residential and/or mixed use developments provide affordable
     housing units. Analysis should include documentation of the intent and purpose,
     findings demonstrating the need, key terms and definitions, specific procedures and
     standards (e.g., percentage of units, affordability levels, duration of affordability
     requirements), eligibility for exceptions or alternative(s) to the production of the
     affordable units (e.g., payment of an in-lieu affordable unit fee), and a system for
     enforcing and monitoring compliance. This information will be provided to City
     decision makers to determine the feasibility of developing an inclusionary housing
     ordinance.

     C. Annual Implementation
     Effective implementation of the General Plan requires annual reviews of its
     progress in achieving its goals and policies. Since many of the factors and issues
     that the General Plan addresses change from year to year, an annual review and
     reporting of implementation will help the City in moving forward to achieve the
     Plan’s vision. Findings from the reporting process will enable the City Council to
     establish priorities for budget allocations, programs, capital improvements, and
     other operations of the City.
      A. General Plan Maintenance and Monitoring
         A2                              Annual General Plan Report
      The California Government Code §65400(b)(1) requires all cities and counties to
      submit an annual General Plan Progress Report to their “legislative bodies,” the State
      Office of Planning and Research (OPR), and the State Department of Housing and
      Community Development (HCD). Since many of the factors and issues that the
      General Plan addresses change from year to year, an annual review and reporting of
      implementation will help ensure the City is moving forward to achieve the Plan’s
      vision. This review will report on the status of each specific implementation program
      in the General Plan and take into account the availability of new implementation
      tools, changes in funding sources, and feedback from Plan monitoring activities.
      As required by State Housing Element Law, the City is also required to monitor all
      housing programs and complete a detailed annual Housing Element Implementation
      Report that documents the City’s progress in fulfilling its share of the Regional
      Housing Needs Assessment; the status of the implementation of each of the housing
      programs of the City’s Housing Plan; and reviews actions and programs adopted to
      remove or mitigate governmental constraints on the development of housing for all
      income levels.

      Action’s progress toward achieving the level of GHG emission reduction and require
      amendment if the plan is not achieving specified levels. This is a critical tool for
      responding to the state’s legislative requirements in consideration of a recent (non-
      appellate) court case that successfully overturned an EIR’s significance conclusion for
      GHG emissions because measures were not enforceable and/or the jurisdiction was
      unable to monitor the measures where substantial reductions were identified.

 The City shall annually review and adopt a City Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
 that provides funds for capital facilities including arterial highways, local streets,
 storm drains, park and facility improvements, water and wastewater system
 improvements, and other improvements. It will leverage funding benefit of
 accumulated reserves, take advantage of entitlement/matching fund regulations, and
 capitalize on development related impact fees. Expenditures should be prioritized
 based on needs and funding availability. Legislation requires that the CIP’s public
 works projects must be found to be consistent with the 2035 General Plan.

     upgrade their home exteriors.
     The City will continue the management of the 70-unit La Habra Inn as a senior single
     room occupancy (SRO) facility. The City will annually review and update a list of
     existing motels and hotels in La Habra that are candidates for conversion to SRO and
     make the list available to any interested developers. The City will also annually review
     SRO conversion applications in order to determine whether the SRO development
     standards or processing procedures are overly restrictive.
     The City will annually conduct at-risk housing monitoring program activities and
     maintain contact with owners of at-risk units to prevent any loss of at-risk units as the
     expiration dates approach, as follows:
      Create a list based on at-risk units in the ten-year inventory and analysis for
         possible conversion within the current and next planning period. The City will
         monitor the list on an annual basis after the adoption of the Housing Element.
      Work with owners, tenants, and nonprofit organizations to assist in the nonprofit
         acquisition of at-risk projects to ensure long-term affordability of the
         development. Annually contact property owners, gauge interest and identify
         nonprofit partners and pursue funding and preservation strategies on a project-
         by-project basis.
      Monitor owners of at-risk projects on an ongoing basis, at least every six months
         to one year, in coordination with other public and private entities to determine
         their interest in selling, prepaying, terminating or continuing participation in a
         subsidy program.
      Reduce, waive or subsidize local development fees associated with preservation
         or replacement of at-risk units, on a case by case basis.
      Utilizing lists maintained by the City of non- and for-profit developers who are
         active in the preservation of affordable housing.
      Assist/support potential purchasers in applying for or otherwise securing funding
         for the acquisition of the units.
      Consider the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing single-family and multiple-
         family buildings in order to preserve and improve affordable housing units.
     The City will annually assist 200 households with Fair Housing services through the
     implementation of the Fair Housing Program. The City will continue to contract with
     the Fair Housing Council of Orange County or a similar Fair Housing Agency to provide
     a variety of fair housing services and landlord tenant counseling. The Fair Housing
     Council of Orange County is certified by HUD to provide housing counseling and
     education, and to investigate issues related to evictions, discriminations, and local
     lending practices among others.

      expressed by text, figures, and illustrations. If inconsistent, the project must be
      denied or the General Plan amended in the event that the project is considered by
      the City Council to be of significant economic, environmental, or social benefit to the
      community. Requirements and procedures for permitting and development review
      are specified by the La Habra Municipal Code.
      The City shall review existing entitlement processes and consider modifications to
      expedite approvals of priority development projects that offer significant economic
      benefits to the City such as jobs and revenue, and/or act as a catalyst for desired
      development and revitalization of underutilized properties. This should be structured
      as a coordinated and streamlined process providing quick-initial review of
      business/project proposals, department level feedback to formal application, and
      pre-defined time periods for City Department review. Additionally, the process
      should enable fast-track administrative review for minor improvement projects.
      It is recommended that the City consider establishment of a regulatory compliance
      team comprised of knowledgeable staff members for purpose of meeting
      fundamental objectives of LEED, NPDES, CEQA, and recent sustainability regulations
      while reducing excess cost burden on prospective development projects.

 C. Development Review and Entitlement
    C4               Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act
 The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires governmental agencies to
 consider the environmental consequences of their actions before approving plans
 and committing to a course of action on a project. The process is intended to: (1)
 inform decision-makers and the public about the potential environmental effects of a
 proposed project; (2) identify the ways that environmental damage can be avoided or
 significantly reduced; (3) prevent significant, unavoidable environmental damage by
 requiring changes in projects, either by adoption of alternatives or imposition of
 mitigation measures; and (4) disclose to the public why a project was approved if that
 project would have significant environmental effects.
 On submittal of an application for development, the City will determine whether the
 project qualifies as a “project” or “exempt” subject to CEQA’s criteria. If so, an Initial
 Study must be prepared to identify the environmental impacts of the project and
 determine whether the identified impacts are "significant". Based on its findings of
 "significance", the City prepares one of the following environmental review
 documents:
  Negative Declaration if it finds no "significant" impacts;

 The City will continue to permit second units by right in R-1 zones (Secondary
 Dwelling Units Ordinance, Section 18.12.150, La Habra Municipal Code) pursuant to

 exclusively by lower income persons.
 The City will continue to enforce the Zoning Code, Uniform Housing Code, and the
 International Property Maintenance Code via the City’s Community Preservation
 Program. The Housing Code establishes specific housing code maintenance standards
 that must be met by all residential structures. The purpose of the City’s Community
 Preservation Program is to safeguard the health and safety of the residents, including
 overcrowded conditions, and address structural improvement of the existing housing
 stock. The program is interrelated with neighborhood revitalization activities,
 particularly the programs administered through the City’s Housing Division and
 Neighborhood Housing Service, Inc. (NHS). Enforcement of the Housing Code involves
 an inspection request having been submitted to the City. Conditions of Code Standard
 violations must be corrected if the owner wishes to obtain assistance through one of
 the City’s rehabilitation programs.

     Residential Condominium Conversion through the Condominium conversion
     Ordinance (Chapter 18.64, La Habra Municipal Code) to facilitate the conversion of
     apartments to condominiums and maintain policies, which create affordable housing
     for moderate-income households to purchase, while preserving a percentage of
     rental units.
     The City will continue to permit, by-right, emergency shelters in the City’s Emergency
     Transitional Shelter (ES) Overlay Zone, within the Light Manufacturing (M-1) Zone,
     and transitional and supportive housing in all residential zones. Emergency shelters
     are subject to only those development standards that apply to other uses within the

         E1                                    Fiscal Budgeting
     The General Fund is the portion of La Habra’s operating budget that funds the
     majority of City services. This fund is used to account for fiscal resources that are
     dedicated to the general government operations of the City. Examples of the services
     funded by the General Fund include police and fire services; refuse collection;
     recreation programs; street maintenance; water and sewer service; low and
     moderate income housing funding; Children’s Museum, social service programs (e.g.,
     Head Start); Community Development and Public Works services; as well as the
     general administration of the City. In addition, many Capital Improvements are
     funded by the General Fund.
     Annually the City shall engage in budgeting process that seeks to optimize fiscal
     revenue sources, maximize efficiency of operating expenses, and provide reserves for
     capital improvements. It defines program costs, sources of revenue, and estimates of
     revenues to be received including any necessary changes in fees. As part of the
     budget, the City will adopt a CIP (refer to D. Master Plans and Programs, Capital
     Improvements Program) that provides funds for capital facilities including arterial

 highways; local streets; and storm drains improvements; park and facility
 improvements; water and wastewater system improvements; and planning
 programs. Collected development fees shall be allocated for their committed
 purposes, such as traffic mitigation fees to pay the costs of needed transportation
 improvements.
 As municipal revenues have been impacted by the reallocation of fiscal revenues at
 the state and county levels, the long-term stabilization of these funds for the City is
 important. The City of La Habra should be represented and participate with other
 municipalities, professional associations, and advocacy groups that seek to stabilize
 and strengthen fiscal revenue sources directly benefiting the City.

     throughout the state, as well as approaches to reduce and minimize air pollution and
     GHG emissions. Property maintenance educational materials should be structured as
     informative “how-to” guides, or a “tool kit,” that is easily understood by non-
     professionals and in multiple languages. As many source materials have been
     developed by these organizations and institutions and do not need to be replicated,
     the City may choose to summarize the key issues and strategies and provide
     appropriate references or links to source documents. A diversity of formats and
     media may be used including publications, posters, videos, PowerPoint presentations,
     and posting on the City’s website.

E. Periodic Implementation
A diversity of programs will be implemented at intervals established by
legislation or as necessary in response to changes in community issues and
visions, best practices, new legislative requirements.
  A. General Plan Maintenance and Monitoring
     A4                                   General Plan Updates
  While there are no specific deadlines for updates and revisions of the General Plan,
  state guidelines urge that it be maintained to reflect current conditions, issues, and
  visions. The State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) is required to notify a city
  when its general plan has not been revised within eight years. If the plan has not
  been revised within ten years, OPR must also notify the Attorney General, who will
  notify the City of the legal risks for failure to maintain a legally adequate plan. An
  exception is the Housing Element, which is required to be revised at least every eight
  years (Code §65588) and certified by the State Department of Housing and
  Community Development (HCD).
  While comprehensive revisions occur infrequently in recognition of the long-term
  role of the General Plan, it is important to monitor its relevance and applicability to
  local needs and issues as they evolve over time. At least once every five years the City
  should review the economic markets for commercial, industrial, and housing
  development; identify trends that impact or provide opportunities for the City; assess
  the Plan’s land use diagram, policies, and standards for their effectiveness in
  addressing these; evaluate traffic conditions and their correlation with land use
  development; and amend these where desired and necessary. As many of the
  General Plan’s implementation programs are dependent on available funding and
  evolve over time to reflect changing community needs, they should be reviewed and
  updated at least once each three years to assure their continuing relevancy. This is a
  technical revision that would not necessitate a formal amendment of the General
  Plan, provided that they do not alter its policies, and would best be accomplished as
  an integral component of the Annual General Plan Progress Report (see Imp 1.3).
  Revisions and updates of the General Plan should be made in accordance with the
  General Plan’s Vision Statement, or as modified by future public input. Important
  criteria in updating the Plan should include: targeting growth to underused properties
  and maintaining existing neighborhoods and districts that are valued by the
  community, achieving a land use mix and distribution that contribute to attaining
  targets for greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable development, provision of
  adequate housing to meet regional and local growth forecasts, maintaining a balance
  of jobs and housing, and ensuring that growth is complemented by adequate
  supporting infrastructure and services.

     A5                                 Housing Element Updates
  State law requires that every jurisdiction must review and update the Housing
  Element to ensure it remains up to date on a regular schedule. Enactment of SB 375
  revised the update cycle to eight (8) years for communities that have a regionally
  adopted Sustainable Communities Plan (SCS) and four (4) years without one. As SCAG
City of La Habra General Plan                                                              8-37

     has adopted its SCS, La Habra’s future Housing Elements will be performed on this
     cycle.
     Unlike other General Plan elements, the Housing Element must be submitted to
     California’s Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to ensure
     that it meets the State’s minimum requirements. One requirement for every Housing
     Element is to demonstrate that the local jurisdiction has made adequate provision to
     support the development of housing at various income levels (very low, low,
     moderate, and above moderate) to meet its “fair share” of the existing and projected
     regional housing needs.
     The 2014-2021 Housing Element has been adopted concurrently with the 2035
     General Plan and is appended to and a “Chapter” of this Plan by reference. Future
     updates may be independent of the updates of the comprehensive General Plan or
     elements/chapter thereof.

     B. Implementing Policy Documents and Regulatory Codes
        B2                                   New Specific Plans
     Specific plans are tools for the systematic implementation of the General Plan and
     intended to implement and regulate land use and development within a specific
     project boundary, subject to the substantive and procedural requirements of §65450
     through §65457 of the California Government Code. Specific plans are regulatory
     documents adopted by ordinance and all development standards contained therein
     are enforceable by law.
     La Habra has adopted specific plans for five areas: La Habra Boulevard,
     Lambert/Idaho, Voit, La Habra Hills, and Euclid Street. Of these, the La Habra
     Boulevard Specific Plan will be revised for consistency with the 2035 General Plan as
     previously discussed. New specific plans may be prepared and adopted for
     compliance with policies requiring these for the development of large acreage
     properties designated for mixed-uses and higher densities to assure achievement of
     the intended scale, character, and quality of development. These shall be prepared in
     accordance with state statutes and provide physical plans for land use, mobility, and
     infrastructure, development standards and design guidelines, a financing program,
     and implementation plan. An EIR shall be prepared and future implementing projects
     exempt for additional review in accordance with CEQA.
     The new specific plans shall be prepared based on the following principles expressed
     by 2035 General Plan goals and policies:
      Locate and design ground floor uses and parking to promote a high level of
         pedestrian use in mixed-use and high density projects;
      Establish a distinct identify and cohesive development pattern for each area;
      Development of iconic buildings and landscapes contributing to the project’s and
         City’s identity;
      Provide for a robust and well-designed public plazas and streetscapes;
      Incorporate development of mini transit centers or hubs (i.e., sheltered locations
         where several transit lines meet) in larger scale projects to facilitate convenient
         transfers and connections, which may include bus parking turn-ins, bus shelters
         and benches, signage with guide maps and schedules, vehicle, and bicycle parking
         if appropriate; and

 as contractual agreements between the City and developers to provide assurances to
 each party regarding the uses to be entitled, rules of development, and public
 benefits of the development project. For complex multi-year mixed-use projects, the
 City of La Habra may assess the appropriateness of preparing a development
 agreement to ensure full compliance with the 2035 General Plan’s goals and policies
 and interests of the City are being met.
 An agreement may specify its duration, permitted uses of the property, density or
 intensity of use, maximum height and size of proposed buildings, and provisions for
 reservation or dedication of land for public purposes, if required. As input, the costs
 of development that shall be borne by the developer, fees to be assessed, and
 schedule for payment shall be identified. The agreement may include conditions,
 terms, restrictions, and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions and may
 specify the timing and phasing of construction. The uses and development standards
 specified by a development agreement must be consistent with the 2035 General
 Plan and/or, where appropriate, Specific Plan.

 The City will work with the Orange County Public Libraries (OCPL) and the La Habra
 Branch Library to periodically review and develop plans to meet facility and
 operational needs. These are evolving significantly as libraries are less dependent on
 providing brick-and-mortar facilities with space for hard-copy documents, and
 transforming to electronic and computer technology and the internet to provide
 access and distribute resource materials to La Habra’s residents. The role and physical
 form of libraries have changed and can be anticipated to change further. The City will
 advise OCPL regarding its future plans, ensuring that facilities are conveniently
 accessible to residents by walking, public transit, and other modes of transportation.

      The design and quality of proposed development projects are subject to review by
      the City’s Community Development staff and Planning Commission during the
      development review process. The adopted specific plans incorporate design
      guidelines that can be used as criteria for this review and, as new specific plans are
      prepared for the mixed-use areas specified by the 2035 General Plan’s Land Use
      policies, these will address other areas of the City.
      Numerous 2035 General Plan policies establish design benchmarks and criteria that
      must be considered in entitling development. At a minimum, the La Habra Boulevard
      Specific Plan’s design guidelines will be reviewed and revised to ensure consistency
      with these following adoption of the Plan (refer to Near Term Implementation, B2
      Specific Plan Revisions). In consideration of the scope and importance of the Plan’s
      design-focused policies, the City may elect to prepare additional design guidelines for
      areas not covered by the specific plans. These may address such categories of uses as:
       Multi-family residential
       Mixed-use development projects
       Industrial business parks and industrial-commercial development projects
       Historic residential neighborhoods
      The content of a design guidelines document should be developed to address the
      unique issues and objectives for the use of the targeted specific plan locations and/or
      focused-use categories. They should consider such items as building location,
      relationships to other structures on a property, and public streetscapes and plazas;
      architectural design (height, building bulk and mass, façade treatment and
      fenestration, entry treatment, materials, colors, and so on); landscape; parking

 D. Master Plans and Public Improvements
    D3                            Public Streets Improvement Plans
 The improvement of La Habra’s street frontages and sidewalks is an important
 objective expressed by 2035 General Plan policies to enhance the quality and
 walkability of neighborhoods and districts, while contributing to improved public
 health for all residents. A high priority is placed on citywide connectivity and
 improvements in the key districts of the City identified by the Plan including the
 Downtown Core, higher density mixed-use centers, and residential neighborhoods
 with deteriorated or disconnected sidewalks and poor landscaping.
 In the first two cases, streetscape improvements should be addressed as an integral
 component of updated or newly prepared specific plans for these locations. Their
 costs should be borne primarily by development, as permitted by nexus
 requirements, and/or establishment of Community Services Districts (CSDs) For the
 residential neighborhoods and remaining commercial and industrial areas, the City
 should identify priority locations for improvements in consideration of needs, budget
 availability, and local support for establishment of a CSD. Streetscape improvements
 in these areas would be subject to the development of a master plan by the City that
 identifies improvements, funding sources, and a schedule for implementation.
 The content of streetscape master plans, whether a part of a specific plan or separate
 document, should be developed to address the unique conditions and objectives for
 each area. They should specify such items as sidewalk connectivity within the
 planning area and to external destinations (adjoining uses, parks, schools, and so on),
 street crossings, paving/hardscape materials, design treatments, trees and planted
 landscapes, irrigation, wayfinding signage, lighting, pedestrian amenities (benches,
 trash receptacles, and other street furniture, public art, and drainage. Transit
 shelters, bicycle parking/storage, and amenities should be incorporated in
 appropriate locations. Improvements should be designed in accordance with best
 practices for sustainability including use of permeable hardscapes, native and
 drought-tolerant landscape materials, low-water irrigation, toxic removal drainage
 systems (bioswales), low-energy lighting, recycled materials, and so on. All pedestrian
 circulation systems shall be designed to provide accessibility by persons with
 disabilities consistent with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and State
 requirements.

 Safe Routes to School programs are designed to decrease traffic and pollution and
 increase the health of children and the community. The program promotes safe
 walking and biking to school through education, community engagement, and
 encouragement to increase the appeal of alternative transportation. The program
 also addresses the safety concerns of parents by encouraging greater enforcement of
 traffic laws, educating the public, and exploring ways to create safer routes to school.
 As funding is available, La Habra should develop and implement a Strategic Safe
 Routes to School plan, allowing the City to prioritize actions and methodically address
 making it safer for students to walk and/or bike to school A plan will also enable the
 City to qualify for Safe Routes to School funds, leverage additional resources, and
 achieve regional and state transportation and health goals.

     habitat, sequesters carbon monoxide emissions, is conducive to pedestrian
     activity, and provides shade.
  Establish and administer a plan to manage and care for publicly-owned trees
     located in parks, parkways, and medians.
  Encourage the preservation of trees in existing and new development projects
     that are suitable nesting and roosting habitat for resident and migratory bird
     species.
  Encourage owners of commercial and industrial businesses with expansive surface
     parking to plant additional trees and landscapes and require new development to
     incorporate extensive landscapes providing for wildlife habitat, shade, and
     sequestering of carbon monoxide emissions.
  Encourage landscaping that minimizes the need for herbicides and pesticides and
     that provides food, water, habitat, and nesting sites for birds and other beneficial
     insects that help maintain the environmental resources and restore the larger
     ecosystem.

Appendix A
ADDRESSING CLIMATE
CHANGE
The La Habra General Plan 2035 strives to establish development patterns
consistent with the existing community character, provide multiple modes of
transportation, and construct infrastructure that is sustainable and
environmentally friendly through improvements that achieve reduction of such
elements as energy use, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Based on the State Attorney General’s interpretation of AB 32, local GHG
reduction targets and strategies to achieve these must be addressed by the
General Plan. The Community Development and Mobility/Circulation chapters
of the General Plan 2035 address land use and transportation within the City
that are managed for preferred patterns of growth and development.
Additionally, the Infrastructure and Conservation/Natural Resources chapters of
the 2035 General Plan address a number of different resources within the City
that must be managed properly. These four chapters specifically speak to
energy conservation, air quality improvements, solid waste management and
recycling, water systems and water quality conservation, and the reduction of
GHG emissions in helping to achieve the City’s GHG reduction goals. The
following summarizes the Plan’s goals and policies contributing to these goals.

ADDRESSING HEALTHY
COMMUNITIES
The La Habra General Plan 2035 contains goals and policies throughout its
chapters and sections to establish an environment that promotes physical
activity, reduces air pollution, provides transportation choices, makes healthy
foods accessible, maintains public safety, and access to necessary health
services. The scope of policies contributing to a healthy La Habra are
inextricably related to and overlap many of those addressing sustainability and
climate change objectives presented in the preceding appendices. The following
summarizes the principal objectives for health and identifies the Plan’s goals
and policies contributing to meet these, many of which duplicate those
addressing Climate Change as listed in Appendix A.
  OBJECTIVE
  Increased physical activity as a means to reduce rates of obesity, heart
  disease, diabetes, and other health-related issues
  STRATEGY
  Provide for the development of a land use mix and densities that facilitates
  walking and bicycling in lieu of automobile use

    proposed activity has the potential for a significant adverse environmental
    impact, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be prepared and certified as
    to its adequacy before taking action on the proposed project. General Plans
    usually require the preparation of a “Program EIR.”
    California Green Building Standards Code: The California Green Building
    Standards Code (CALGreen Code) is Part 11 of the California Building Standards
    Code and is the first statewide "green" building code in the US. Its purpose is to
    improve public health, safety and general welfare by enhancing the design and
    construction of buildings through the use of building concepts having a reduced
    negative impact or positive environmental impact and encouraging sustainable
    construction practices in the following categories: (a) planning and design, (b)
    energy efficiency, (c) water efficiency and conservation, (d) material
    conservation and resource efficiency, and (e) environmental quality.
    Capital Improvement Program (CIP): A proposed timetable or schedule of all
    future capital improvements (government acquisition of real property, major
    construction project, or acquisition of long lasting, expensive equipment) to be

C-4                                                 City of La Habra General Plan

City: City, with a capital "C," generally refers to the government or
administration of a city. City, with a lower case "c" may mean any city.
City Council: The governing board of the City. The five-member elected council
is responsible to the electorate for keeping pace with changing community
needs, for establishing the quality of municipal services through the open
conduct of public affairs, and for encouraging constructive citizen participation.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): A grant program administered
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This grant
allots money to cities and counties for housing rehabilitation and community
development activities, including public facilities and economic development.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The average equivalent sound level
during a 24- hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in
the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound
levels in the night after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. See also "A-Weighted
Decibel."
Commuter Arterial: A Commuter Arterial is designated as a two-lane undivided,
unrestricted access roadway, with a typical right-of-way width of 60 feet and a
roadway width from curb-to-curb of 40 feet.
Compatibility: The characteristics of different uses or activities that permit
them to be located near each other in harmony and without conflict. The
designation of permitted and conditionally permitted uses in zoning districts are
intended to achieve compatibility within the district. Some elements affecting
compatibility include: intensity of occupancy as measured by dwelling units per
acre; pedestrian or vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and
such environmental effects as noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, or the
presence of hazardous materials. On the other hand, many aspects of
compatibility are based on personal preference and are much harder to
measure quantitatively, at least for regulatory purposes.
Complete Streets: Streets that comfortably accommodate all users, with
particular emphasis on pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation, as well
as people of all ages and physical abilities. The Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB
1358) requires circulation elements to incorporate multimodal transportation
into the General Plan.

    housekeeping, social activities, counseling, and transportation. There is
    generally a minimum health requirement for acceptance into a congregate
    facility as most do not offer supportive health care services, thus differing from
    a nursing home. Residents usually have their own bedrooms and share common
    areas such as living rooms, dining rooms, and kitchens; bathrooms may or may
    not be shared.

    “penalty” added to noise levels during the hours of 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. to
    account for increased sensitivity that people tend to have to nighttime noise.
    Because of this penalty, the Ldn would always be higher than its corresponding
    24-hour Leq (e.g., a constant 60 dBA noise over 24 hours would have a 60 dBA
    Leq, but a 66.4 dBA Ldn).
    Decibel (dB): A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, as it is heard by the
    human ear. See also “A-Weighted Decibel,” “Community Noise Equivalent
    Level,” and “Day-Night Average Level.”

accommodate additional square footage or additional residential units beyond
the maximum for which the parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the
provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another location.
Developable Land: Land that is suitable as a location for structures and that can
be developed free of hazards to, and without disruption of, or significant impact
on, natural resource areas.
Developer: An individual who or business which prepares raw land for the
construction of buildings or causes to be built physical building space for use
primarily by others.

Development Capacity: The total amount of residential units and retail, office,
and industrial building square footage that may be developed as stipulated by
General Plan policy, which may be equivalent to or less than the maximum
build-out of the Land Use Diagram as determined by multiplying the land area
for each use by the applicable residential density and non-residential floor area
ratio.
Developmental Disability: A disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely,
and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely
physical in nature.

lane facility within an 80-foot right-of-way and a roadway width from curb-to-
curb of 64 feet. This generally requires removal of on-street parking, restriping
for left-turn channelization, and prohibition of left-turns during peak hours if
there is insufficient right-of-way for channelization.
