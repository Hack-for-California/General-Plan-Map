                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
CHAPTER 2 • LAND USE
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element is the most prominent of the seven mandatory elements of the
General Plan. It, more so than the other elements, has the most significant impact on
existing and future Kerman residents. It is the element that determines the general
location of residential, commercial, industrial, public and open space uses. It also
discloses building intensities and population densities for the planning area.
The Kerman Land Use Element contains seven primary components:
1)      existing conditions and projections;
2)      projections;
3)      land use designations and population densities;
4)      land use goals;
5)      the Plan - issues, policies and action programs;
6)      land use designation/ zoning district matrix; and
7)      a land use map.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
In addition to the information contained in this chapter, information on existing
conditions in Kerman is also contained in Part 2 of this document.
Land Use
The original Kerman township was laid out within the area bounded by California
Avenue, "G" Street, First Street and Ninth Street. The township was plotted in the early
                                              2-1

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                      Part I
                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
1900's. Madera Avenue was designed to serve as Kerman's "main street". Originally, it
had a right-of-way that ranged from 100 to 200 feet in width, with 30 x 140-foot
commercial lots fronting onto it. At the southern end of Madera Avenue, a landscaped
plaza (“Plaza Park”) was constructed. In 2004, this park was re-dedicated and
refurbished with a wrought-iron fence to buffer the park from State Route 145 (Madera
Ave.) and a replica of the original “Kerman” sign was installed. In addition, a turn-of-
the-century clock was installed at the north end of the plaza while a gazebo was installed
at the south end, connected by a 10-foot path that meanders through the park between the
two. This historic landmark still exists today and contains a mature grove of palm,
magnolia and cedar trees surrounded by a lawn.
Residential lots, which were located east and west of Madera Avenue, were 50 x 140 feet.
They fronted onto local streets, which had a right-of-way of 60 feet. Separating each
residential block was a 20-foot alley, which bisected each block north and south.
Today, Kerman's urban area is centered roughly at the intersection of Kearney Boulevard
and Madera Avenue. This intersection divides the city into four quadrants.
The urbanized portion of Kerman extends from Church Avenue on the south to north of
Whitesbridge Road, and from east of Goldenrod Avenue to Modoc Avenue on the west.
Commercial and office uses are clustered along Madera Avenue from California Avenue
to north of Whitesbridge, and along Whitesbridge Avenue on both sides of Madera
Avenue. Two large shopping centers are located on the northwest and southwest corners
of Madera Avenue and Whitesbridge Road.
Single family residential neighborhoods are located in all four quadrants of the city.
Multiple family development is also found in all quadrants of the city, however, four
larger complexes are found at California and Vineland Avenue, Whitesbridge and First
Street, Del Norte and California Avenues and on Whitesbridge Road, east of Madera
Avenue. Almost all mobile homes within Kerman are located at the 106-unit Golden
West Mobile home Park on Madera Avenue, south of Whitesbridge.
Industrial uses are primarily located in the southern one-third of the city. Smaller
operations are distributed along California Avenue, adjacent to the Southern Pacific
Railroad tracks. Larger industrial developments are located south of the tracks, within
the Kerman Industrial Park and along Madera Ave. (SR 145).
Public and quasi-public (churches) uses are scattered throughout the community. Public
uses include schools, parks, city hall, county library, and the wastewater treatment plant.
Table 1 and Table 2 provide a breakdown of the land uses in the planning area.

PROJECTIONS
Population Projections
In order to determine the amount of land needed for development in Kerman over the 20-
year planning period, population projections are required. Two population projections -
low and high - for the years 2017 and 2027 are displayed below in Table 3. These
population figures are projections from 2007 to the years 2017 and 2027. The "low"
population projection is based on Kerman's average annual growth rate from 1980 to
1990 (3.61 percent) using U.S. Census figures. The "high" population projection is based
on Kerman's average annual growth rate from 1990 to 2000 (5.7 percent) using U.S.
Census and State Department of Finance figures.

Land Demand Projections
Land demand projections for 2017 and 2027 are based on the population projections
contained in the tables above and factors described below. Table 5 identifies a range of
land demand acreages, based on low and high population projections, required for
development and public uses by the years 2017 and 2027.

Note: Quasi-public uses will most likely be located on lands designated for residential
uses; public uses on lands designated for residential, retail commercial or office uses.
Kerman will need between 1,043 and 1,918 acres for future development and public uses
according to Table 5. The Land Use Element designates more than 5,736 acres for these
uses, including a 125 percent flexibility factor. For example, instead of providing 1,064
acres of land for single family residential purposes, the Element designates 1,330 acres
for single family development (1.25 x 1,064 = 1,330). This flexibility factor for
residential uses insures that the local real estate market does not become overly restricted
thereby artificially inflating land prices and housing costs.
RESIDENTIAL LAND PROJECTIONS
Residential land demand factors
•       The number of persons per residential unit will be 3.57 persons (2000 Census).
•       Seventy-eight percent of the new residential units will be single family dwellings,
        22 percent multi-family units. (2000 Census)

•      Single family developments will have a gross density of 5 units per acre and
       multi-family will have a gross density of development of 15 units per acre.
•      The residential land demand projections for 2017 and 2027 shall be increased by a
       factor of 25 percent so as to insure that the residential real estate market does not
       become overly restricted, thus forcing up land prices, and also to insure that
       residential in-fill is encouraged, thus minimizing urban sprawl and premature
       urbanization of agricultural land.

These residential land demand projections indicate that Kerman will need between 360
and 634 acres of land for residential development by 2017 and between 818 and 1,666
acres by 2027.
RETAIL/COMMERCIAL LAND PROJECTIONS
Retail commercial/office land demand factors
•       Retail commercial /office uses will continue to be intermixed.
•       Retail commercial/office uses will replace service commercial and the limited
        residential uses on Madera Avenue as land values increase.
•       Existing retail commercial/office uses are extremely limited and the community is
        generally underserved in this area. Retail Commercial has significant room for
        growth which would serve a larger number of additional local and regional clients
        and/or shoppers.
•       Retail commercial/office uses will generally be restricted to lands on Madera and
        Whitesbridge Avenues with Neighborhood Commercial mixed in on a one-mile
        grid.

•        Neighborhood commercial uses will be limited to five acres in size and will be
         dispersed evenly throughout the community to serve each neighborhood area.
•        Office uses may be located in residential neighborhoods on a limited basis.
•        Kerman will continue to be a growing regional shopping/office center for western
         Fresno County.
•        There are 102 acres of existing retail commercial/office uses in Kerman in 2007.
Retail commercial/office land demand, high population estimate, 2017.
102 acres of retail/office (2007)/ 12,663 (2007 population) = 1 acre retail/office per 124
persons
1 acre of retail/office per 124 persons x 23,300 (2017 population, high estimate) = 187
acres retail/office needed
187 acres retail/office needed - 102 acres of existing retail/office = 85 acres retail/office
needed
• 85 acres of retail/office needed by 2017
Retail commercial/office land demand, high population estimate, 2027

1 acre of retail/office per 124 persons x 40,561 (2027 estimated population) = 327 acres
retail/office needed
327 acres retail/office needed - 102 acres of existing retail/office = 225 acres
• 225 acres of retail/office needed by 2027
These retail/office land demand projections indicate that Kerman will need about 85 acres
of additional land for retail/office development by 2017 and an additional 225 acres by
2027.

INDUSTRIAL/SERVICE COMMERCIAL LAND PROJECTIONS
Industrial/service commercial land demand factors
•       The service commercial sector (commercial services like automobile repair,
        warehousing, and light manufacturing) of the economy will grow faster than the
        industrial sector (manufacturing uses).
•       Industrial/service commercial uses do not require as high of visibility that retail
        commercial/office uses require.
•       There is a shortage of existing service commercial uses to serve the local and
        regional population. There is a need to serve a significant number of additional
        clients.
•       Service commercial uses will generally be restricted to lands on Whitesbridge
        Avenue, east of Madera, on the south side of California, and in the areas
        immediately south of the railroad tracks.
•       Industrial uses will generally be restricted to lands south of California and north
        of Jensen; the City plans to annex an 117-acre area referred to as the “Southwest
        Annexation” into the city to provide large industrial users with parcels that are
        ready to develop (i.e., one large user could require 100 acres).
•       There are 82 acres of existing industrial/service commercial uses in Kerman in
        2007.
Industrial/service commercial land demand, high population projection, 2017
82 acres of industrial/service commercial lands (2007)/ 12,663 (2007 population) = 1 acre

263 acres of industrial/service commercial uses needed by 2027 - 82 acres
industrial/service commercial uses occupied in 2007 = 181 acres of land needed by 2027
• 167 acres of industrial/service commercial uses needed by 2027.
These land demand projections indicate that Kerman will need about 69 acres of land for
industrial/commercial uses by 2017 and an additional 181 acres by 2027. However, the
city plans to annex 117 acres (referred to as the “Southwest Annexation”) into the City to
provide parcels large enough for large industrial users within the City Limits.
PARK LAND PROJECTIONS
Parkland demand factors
•       The City of Kerman has a standard of providing four acres of parkland for every
        1,000 persons.
       Open space at school sites will not be counted as parkland, unless there is a joint
        use agreement between the City and Kerman Unified School District.
•       Private parks will not be factored into Kerman's standard of four acres of parkland
        for every 1,000 persons.
•       There are 41 acres of existing park land in 2007.
Parkland demand, high population projection, 2017
Four acres of parkland/1000 persons x 23,300 (2017 high population) = 93 acres of
parkland needed
93 acres of parkland needed – 41 acres of parkland in 2007 = 52 acres
• 52 acres of parkland needed by 2017
Parkland demand, high population projection, 2027
Four acres of parkland/1000 persons x 40,561 (2027 estimated population) = 162 acres of
parkland needed
162 acres of parkland needed by 2027 – 41 acres of parkland in 2007 = 121 acres

guide future decisions regarding the specific land use topic. Third, the Plan will list
various action programs that will be required in order to implement the policies.
A. COMMUNITY IMAGE
Image is important to a city because it can influence how residents feel about their
community. A strong sense of community ownership, involvement and stewardship can
result if people feel good about their city. Further, a city that is clean, well-maintained,
safe, visually appealing, and attentive in its arrangement of land uses, can attract outside
investment, which generates employment, taxes, and further investment.
1. POLICY:              Promote a clean, well-maintained community.
    ACTIONS:
                        a. The Planning Department shall periodically review
                        improvement standards contained in the zoning and subdivision
                        ordinances. Standards that should be reviewed include
                        landscaping, parking and signs.
                        b. The City shall actively enforce the city's vehicle abatement
                        program.
                        c. The Building Department shall actively enforce the State
                        Housing Code to insure that unsafe, dilapidated residential
                        structures are rehabilitated or demolished.
                        d. The Planning Department shall increase its enforcement of the
                        sign ordinance by periodically informing persons with illegal signs
                        that these signs must be removed.
                        e The Planning Department shall insure that commercial uses do
                        not operate in residential neighborhoods unless the operator of the
                        commercial use has secured a home occupation permit.
                        f. The City’s Code Enforcement Division shall activity enforce the
                        City’s “Weed & Debris” program and also inspect alleys and
                        businesses for compliance.
                        g. City shall promote the Kerman RDA “PRIDE” program to
                        encourage Madera Avenue businesses to improve building facades,
                        landscaping, signage, parking and general appearance.
                        h. The City shall review all CUP’s for compliance with conditions,
                        annually.

                 existing, new, private and public development.
   ACTIONS:
                 a. Kerman shall apply the development standards located in its
                 zoning ordinance that are specific to design districts and identified
                 on the land use/circulation map.
                 b. Continue the use of the site plan review process to ensure that
                 new or renovated projects conform to the development standards

   ACTIONS:
                 a. Apply specific development standards for the design district
                 that encompasses the historic Kerman townsite, which extends
                 along Madera Avenue from California Avenue to Kearney
                 Boulevard. The standards shall focus on special setback,
                 streetscape, lighting, sign and parking requirements.

                 faire.
5. POLICY:       Preserve and enhance Kerman’s visual appearance and living
                 environment.
   ACTIONS:
                 a. Require that new subdivisions be required to install and
                 maintain landscaping, irrigation, and wall improvements along
                 collector, arterial roadway frontages and entrances.
                 b. Kerman shall continue to expand the construction and
                 maintenance of tree-lined medians on all expressways, arterials
                 and major collectors or any other roadway the City Council may
                 deem appropriate.
6. POLICY:       Develop and maintain a strong community edge - where urban and
                 agricultural uses interface.
   ACTIONS:
                 a. Kerman shall forward a recommendation of denial to Fresno
                 County if large-lot (one acre or larger) ranchette subdivisions are
                 proposed for lands within its sphere of influence.
                 b. Kerman shall not initiate annexations that create peninsulas or
                 islands, or which require inefficient extensions of infrastructure.
                 c. Work with Fresno County and LAFCO to expand the area

B. HISTORIC TOWNSITE
Kerman's original townsite was bounded by Kearney Avenue on the north, California
Avenue on the south, First Street on the west and Ninth Street on the east. Kerman's
original downtown, older neighborhoods, and first park is contained in this area. Most of
Kerman's first commercial buildings were located in this area, along both sides of Madera
Avenue. The original townsite has changed significantly since its formation in the early
1900s. Madera Avenue has been widened from a two lane road to a four lane highway
with parking on both sides; many of the older commercial buildings have been
demolished (Kerman Inn) or altered; and some of the older homes have been replaced
with apartment units.
The policies and actions mentioned below will provide a strategy that will restore the
character and appearance of Kerman's original townsite and will create a focal point for
the community in regards to community events, shopping and recreation.
1. POLICY:            Continue the upkeep and maintenance of the streetscaping,
                      landscaping to enhance the "downtown" image in the historic
                      Kerman townsite by upgrading the overall appearance and utility
                      of the townsite with antique street lighting, public parking, signs,
                      banners and facade improvements.
   ACTIONS:
                      a. Prepare and adopt an historic Kerman townsite design and
                      improvement program.
                      b. Remove graffiti as necessary.
                      c. Provide additional street and parking lot lighting.
                      d. Require and facilitate the undergrounding of existing overhead
                      utilities & install decorative antique street lighting through the site
                      plan review process and Rule 20 funding.
                      e. Install street furniture and landscaping.
                      f. Place decorative trash receptacles and other decorative
                      features along Madera Avenue.
3. POLICY:            The Redevelopment Agency shall encourage the development of
                      special uses in the historic Kerman townsite, including (don’t put
                      in things that are economically impossible), restaurant , offices
                      and specialty retail stores through the use of incentives for
                      businesses willing to conform to the historic townsite theme.

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
   ACTIONS:
                        a. The Redevelopment Agency may consider the following actions
                        to entice the above mentioned uses to locate in the Kerman
                        townsite. These actions could include a:
                        -consider low interest loan for facade renovation, new signage,
                        landscaping or parking
                        -consider local, State or private programs for business loans
                        - condemn buildings that are unsafe / public nuisance
C. GROWTH MANAGEMENT
The management of Kerman's urban growth - direction, rate, density, and arrangement of
land uses- can be beneficial from a fiscal, environmental, and social perspective. A
community that is "well planned" is more likely to be better received by the public than
one that is ill-planned, with numerous land use conflicts, leap-frog development, a non-
viable downtown, poor circulation, is visually unappealing, lacks open space, or has
disenfranchised sections of town.
The cost of providing infrastructure and public services is generally higher for a
community that is sprawling and not compact, lacks contiguous development, and does
not encourage infill or increased residential densities.
1. POLICY:              Land uses in Kerman shall be arranged in a manner that avoids
                        conflicts between the uses.
    ACTIONS:            a. Uses that conflict with each other shall be separated by buffer
                        zones or demarcation lines (streets, railroads, canals, etc. to
                        separate uses of different characteristics).
                        b. This policy will be implemented through the adoption of the
                        Noise Element.
2. POLICY:              Kerman shall promote an urban pattern that is compact, contiguous
                        and concentric to the historical Kerman townsite.
    ACTION:             This policy will be implemented through adoption of the Land Use
                        Element.
3. POLICY:              The Land Use Element should include two growth boundary lines -
                        2017 and 2027.

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                   Part I
                                                       Chapter 2: Land Use Element
   ACTION:       a. The City of Kerman shall establish a “80% Infill Policy”
                 related to the 2017 Growth Boundary Line as detailed below::
                 The City residential areas shall be divided into three (3) Areas
                 defined below and illustrated in Map 7 in Part II of the Kerman
                 General Plan Update:
                 1.) West of Madera Ave., south of Whitesbridge Road, north of
                      California Avenue
                 2.) North of Whitesbridge Road
                 3.) East of Madera Avenue, south of Whitesbridge Road, north of
                      California Avenue
                 Each area shall be judged on its own and not be “subject” to a
                 city-wide infill rule. Therefore, if Area 3 has reached the 80%
                 infill criteria, the City Council may, at that time, consider allowing
                 development beyond the 2017 Growth Boundary Line based upon
                 a consideration of the following factors:
                         Residential housing needs such as affordable hosuing or a
                          desire for a wider and more diverse range of housing
                         Community needs such as open space, recreational
                          facilities, parks, schools, etc.
                         Obstacles to growth such as cost of infrastructure,
                          Williamson Act properties, etc.
                         Economic development needs
                 Therefore, one of the above Areas may be allowed to cross the
                 2017 Growth Boundary Line if:
                 1.) The 80% infill mark has been reached in the Area; and
                 2.) The City Council decides that crossing the Growth Boundary
                     Line fulfills one or more of the above criteria. However, such
                     action will not require a General Plan Amendment.
                 NOTE: In cases, where zoning has not been established, a
                 General Plan Amendment and a Zone Change Amendment will be
                 required.
   ACTION:       b. The City of Kerman shall petition LAFCO (Local Agency
                 Formation Commission) to amend its Sphere of Influence (SOI)
                 based on the land use patterns contained in the General Plan.
4. POLICY:       The Redevelopment Agency shall encourage the infill
                 development of the blighted and underdeveloped areas within the
                 city.

                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
     ACTION:           a. The Redevelopment Agency shall explore the feasibility of
                       financially assisting with the remodeling, reuse, or new
                       construction of downtown-type uses in the historic Kerman
                       townsite. This includes lower Impact Development Fees within the
                       RDA boundaries.
5. POLICY:             Promote a mix of residential dwelling types in all new and
                       redeveloping residential areas.
     ACTIONS:          a. This policy will be implemented through the adoption of the
                       Land Use Element.
                       b. Encourage “Smart Growth Planned Development” and small-
                       scale multiple family development (duplex and triplexes) in
                       existing and new residential developments.
6. POLICY:             New development should be contiguous to existing or approved
                       development.
     ACTIONS:          a. Require the Planning Commission and City Council to make a
                       finding that new development is within 1/8 mile of existing or
                       approved development when approving subdivisions.
7. POLICY:             Promote infill development in order to reduce the rate at which
                       surrounding agricultural land is urbanized and to provide for a
                       more efficient use of existing infrastructure.
     ACTIONS:          Implement an annexation policy that is based on only annexing
                       land for residential development when at least 80 percent of the
                       residentially designated land in the city limits is developed.
8. POLICY:             Encourage a community land use pattern that will accommodate an
                       efficient infrastructure and public service system.
     ACTION:           This policy will be implemented through the adoption of the Land
                       Use Element, as well as conformance to the master water, sewage,
                       and storm drainage plans.
D. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
The "neighborhood" is the fundamental unit of a community. The health and quality of
life of a community is best measured at the neighborhood level. If a community's
neighborhoods are not quiet and free of excessive traffic, are unkempt, contain
                                             2-23

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                       Part I
                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
incompatible uses or are depreciating in value, then the community as a whole is most
likely trending towards a state of deterioration. For the local decision-maker,
preservation of the neighborhood ranks as one of the community's most important
objectives.
A city should provide for a wide range of housing types, styles, and prices. A city with
these characteristics insures that housing opportunities are made available for all socio-
economic levels. Further, certain types of housing - single family dwellings or
apartments - should not be restricted to only certain areas in the community. To do so,
can lead to a stigma being attached to certain parts of town (e.g. "good" side of town
versus "bad" side of town).
1. POLICY:              Single family development shall be well-designed and well-
                        maintained.
    ACTIONS:
                        a. New subdivisions shall form a landscape and lighting district to
                        maintain improvements in these areas.
                        b. To the best extent possible, prohibit residential driveways from
                        entering onto collector and arterial streets from new subdivisions.
                        This policy will be implemented during the subdivision review
                        process.
                        c. Perimeter walls around new subdivisions shall encourage
                        openings in order to facilitate through bike and pedestrian traffic.
                        The Kerman Improvements Manual shall be amended to
                        incorporate a standard for this type of wall opening.
2. POLICY:              Promote a residential living environment that is safe, sanitary and
                        furnishes housing opportunities for all socio-economic levels.
    ACTIONS:
                        a. Abate or rehabilitate dilapidated residential dwellings through
                        the process described in the State Housing Code and the Uniform
                        Code for Abatement of Dangerous Buildings.
                        b. Rehabilitate substandard residential dwelling units.
                        c. Encourage private developers to utilize state and federal
                        housing funds in order to construct low- to moderate- income
                        housing.

                        d. Continue to implement the goals, objectives and policies
                        contained in the Housing Element.
3. POLICY:              Provide for an adequate amount of land for residential uses so that
                        the real estate market does not become overly restrictive thereby
                        causing land values to increase.
    ACTION:             This policy will be achieved through implementation of the Land
                        Use Element and adoption of the Land Use Map.
4. POLICY:              Enhance Kearney's boulevard effect by designating portions of its
                        frontage for very low density residential.
    ACTIONS:            This policy will be achieved through the implementation of the
                        Land Use Element and adoption of the Land Use map.
E. MULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT
Multi-family development, known commonly as apartments, is necessary in all
communities. It provides housing for persons who do not wish to own a single family
dwelling and for persons who can not afford to rent or own one. Improperly located,
designed or maintained multi-family development can have an adverse impact on
surrounding land uses, especially single family dwellings. To protect the health, safety
and welfare of persons living adjacent to multi-family development as well as persons
living in these types of units, the location, design and long-term maintenance of these
types of residential use must be well planned.
1. POLICY:              Multiple family development shall be well-designed, well-
                        maintained, and properly sited.
    ACTIONS:
                        a. New Multiple family development with ten units or more shall
                        be located where two arterial or collector streets intersect. (Except
                        when the project is designated as IN-Fill)
                        b. The number of multiple family units on any given site shall be
                        limited to 40 units (Except with a Conditional Use Permit).
                        c. Review the Zoning Ordinance standards for multiple family
                        development focusing on revisions which will result in higher
                        quality multiple family development, including the following

                       exceed the density of the underlying residential zone district.
F. OFFICE DEVELOPMENT
Office development in a city is almost as important to the economic well-being of a city
as industrial development. Offices support a source of employment, which on average,
has wages that are higher than those of agriculture. For Kerman, whose economy is
primarily based on agriculture, office development provides an excellent opportunity to
diversify its economy.
Four general areas in Kerman are designated for office development by the Land Use
Element. For larger offices, land along Whitesbridge Road, east and west of Madera
Avenue is designated for office development. These office complexes would be required
                                            2-26

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                           Part I

to conform to design district standards proposed for development along Whitesbridge
Road.
The second area that allows office development is Madera Avenue. Although the Land
Use Element designates this area for general commercial uses, the Kerman Zoning
Ordinance lists offices as a permitted use. Land uses constructed along Madera Avenue
would be required to conform to the design standards prescribed for this commercial area.
The third area where offices are encouraged is the parcel of land designated Mixed-Use,
located at the southwest corner of Whitesbridge and Vineland. The Land Use Element
encourages a mix of urban uses at this location - residential, office and commercial.
Land uses constructed at this site would be required to conform to the design standards
prescribed for the original historic townsite area.
The fourth area where offices are encouraged is land immediately east and west of
Madera Avenue between California Street and "E" Street. This is an area where older
homes that back onto commercial uses along Madera Avenue could be converted to
office uses. The rear portion of lots in this area would be used for office parking; access
would be provided from an alley.
1. POLICY:               Provide for the establishment of offices in existing residential
                         structures, adjacent to Madera Avenue in the original historic
                         townsite.
     ACTIONS:
                         a. Adoption of the Land Use Element will implement this policy.
                         b. The City Planner & Building Official will insure that
                         residential structures that are being converted to offices are
                         designed to be compatible with the local residential neighborhood.
                         Parking for these offices shall be provided off the alley.
G. COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
The Kerman Land Use Element provides for four basic types of commercial development
- neighborhood, general, service and regional. Each of these types of commercial uses
are required if the community wishes to provide services and shopping opportunities for
its citizens. Further, in order for a city to have a strong sales tax base, it is imperative that
the city not only retain its own shoppers but also attract shoppers from surrounding cities
and outlying rural areas.
For each type of commercial development to be successful, the use must be properly
located, have adequate access and be designed in a manner which is attractive to clients.
For example, a parcel of land that is designated for regional uses should be located at the
                                               2-27

                             service commercial uses.
     H. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
     Industrial development generally provides the economic foundation for a city in that it is
     a source of employment and it provides a flow of revenue into the city from outside
     sources - other businesses buying raw materials or finished goods from the local industry.
     Industries are typically poor neighbors because they can generate large volumes of truck
     traffic, they can produce noise and odors, and they can be unsightly. For these reasons, it
     is important that they be properly located in the community - away from land uses that
     are sensitive, such as schools, residential development and parks.
     1. POLICY:              New industrial uses shall be located south of California Avenue.
         ACTION:             Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use Map will
                             implement this policy.

2. POLICY:             Discourage industrial uses that are high water users unless the
                       industrial use can mitigate this adverse impact with appropriate
                       fees.
    ACTION:            The City Engineer shall review each industry to ensure that is does
                       not adversely impact Kerman's sewer or water system.
3. POLICY:             Discourage industrial uses that generate high strength waste water
                       unless the industrial use can mitigate this adverse impact with
                       appropriate fees or pretreatment of its waste water.
    ACTION:            The City Engineer shall instruct industries that are generators of
                       high strength waste water to pretreat their effluent prior to
                       discharging into Kerman's waste water system.
4. POLICY:             New industries will be reviewed to ensure that they do not conflict
                       or interfere with surrounding uses or adversely affect the public's
                       health, safety, or welfare.
    ACTIONS:           The City shall revise the Zoning Ordinance to include performance
                       standards to which new industrial uses would be required to
                       comply with. Said standards for consideration include light and
                       glare, vibrations, air quality, noise or odor.
 I. JOBS / HOUSING BALANCE
Economic development is the process by which the opportunity for production,
distribution and consumption of goods and services is created. It is crucial at all levels of
government but especially at the local level – cities and counties. The financial and
economic viability of cities and counties is directly tied to the creation of jobs, an inflow
of taxes and the other benefits associated with an improved local economy – increased
disposable income of residents and improved appearance of the community. Economic
development requires the proper mix of land uses; the availability of infrastructure,
roadways and public services; environmental quality; and a reliable workforce. The land
use element of the general plan can provide for the proper mix of land uses (residential,
commercial, industrial and quasi-public), and the goals, policies and action programs that
will foster economic development. For example, a policy that promotes a balance
between jobs and housing in the community insures that persons living in a community
also have an opportunity to work in that same community; therefore, having a positive
impact on air quality by reducing commuters.
While Kerman is experiencing significant residential growth, commercial and industrial
development significantly lags behind, thereby forcing residents to drive to distant
locations for employment, including Fresno, Madera and the west side, among others.
                                            2-31

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                       Part I
                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
This increasing imbalance between jobs and housing also has negative environmental
impacts, not the least of which is increased air pollution. Kerman is situated within the
middle of the San Joaquin Valley, an air basin that has the potential to experience the
worst air pollution in the nation. The basin has recently undertaken proceedings to be
classified as an “extreme” noncompliance area - the worst designation according to the
Federal Clean Air Act. Only the Los Angeles area shares this designation.
Many people in Kerman must drive long distances (out of town) to work. In addition to
air pollution, other negative impacts include wear and tear on roads as well as increased
fuel consumption. Other effects such as an increased number of latchkey children who
must come home to an empty house (or who, alternately, have a need for after-school
recreation programs) has been observed.
It has long been recognized that the optimal arrangement for cities has been to strike a
balance between jobs and housing - so that the number of persons who live and work in
the same city is maximized. A report by the State of California, Department of Housing
and Community Development offers that the optimal ratio of jobs to housing is 1.5:1 -
that is, there should be 1-1/2 jobs per dwelling unit. Based on data from the State
Employment Development Department about 1,670 jobs existed in the year 2000; in
addition, the Census indicated that there were 2,462 dwelling units in the same year.
Based on these figures, Kerman had a jobs/housing ratio of 0.68:1 - (0.68 jobs per
dwelling unit) compared to the optimum ratio is 1.5 jobs per dwelling unit. The study
does not specify how “close” the jobs should be to the dwelling unit, but given Kerman’s
small size, any jobs created within or in close proximity to City limits would achieve the
objective of reducing air pollution.
1. POLICY:              Improve the “jobs / housing” balance in Kerman by promoting
                        employment opportunities that allow persons to both live and work
                        in town. The Policy goal is to create 1.5 permanent jobs for every
                        single family residential unit and 1.0 jobs for every apartment of
                        duplex.
    ACTION:             Implement a “jobs / housing” development mitigation measures
                        that minimize the environmental impacts associated with a city
                        whose jobs and housing are not in balance. Therefore, new
                        residential subdivisions will be required to “mitigate” their impact
                        on this imbalance”
2. POLICY:              Increase tourism opportunities in Kerman
    ACTION:             a. The City should coordinate with, the Fresno County Farm
                        Bureau, Fresno County Office of Tourism and the Kerman
                        Chamber of Commerce s to attract persons from other cities and

                 meetings in Kerman.
                 b. The Kerman Community/Teen Center should be marketed for
                 various events that would bring people to the community. These
                 events should involve agriculture, Westside affairs, or irrigation
                 technology.
                 c. Kerman’s website should provide a photographic essay of the
                 city’s local agricultural industry and other images of the
                 community. The site should also provide socioeconomic
                 information on the city.
                 d. Provide a section of Kerman’s web page about the
                 opportunities to hold conferences in Kerman, stressing the
                 community center, local hotels and restaurants.
                 e. Market Kerman, using signs, brochures, logos and press
                 releases as the “capital” of the Westside.
                 f. Prepare and distribute a maps that identifies the location of the
                 Kerman Industrial zoned properties and the benefits of locating a
                 facility in this area.
3. POLICY:       Market agriculture as a tourist attraction.
   ACTION:       The City should work with the Fresno County Farm Bureau,
                 Fresno Office of Tourism and the Kerman Chamber of Commerce
                 Bureau to encourage tours, dissemination of agriculturally-related
                 news releases and information regarding agricultural cluster
                 industries in the Kerman area.
4. POLICY:       Attract technologies to the Kerman area that are related to the
                 agricultural economy industry, including plant breeding, nurseries,
                 integrated pest management, and agricultural chemical companies.
   ACTION:       a. The Kerman Chamber of Commerce and City should work with
                 the agricultural community to develop a mailing list containing the
                 types of companies named above.
                 b. The City should work with the EDC (Economic Development
                 Corporation) to develop an information packet detailing the
                 benefits of locating the above types of businesses in Kerman.

5. POLICY:       Assist existing industries to expand their operations and increase
                 employment.
   ACTION:       a The City should contact existing industries periodically to
                 determine if they have plans for expansion and if there are tasks
                 that the city could assist them with.
                 b. The City should work with Fresno County to seek an Enterprise
                 Zone Designation and develop an Existing Company Expansion
                 Program where tax credits could be provided to a company if they
                 hired additional employees. The City will market the Enterprise
                 Zone to local businesses to promote job development and
                 expansion.
                 c. The City should seek industrial infrastructure financing through
                 the State and Federal EDA for industrial park areas .
                 d. Use funds and/or measures generated by the “jobs / housing”
                 mitigation fee program to partially finance infrastructure
                 improvements so as to attract industries to Kerman’s industrial
                 park.
6. POLICY:       Increase the number of businesses operating in Kerman in order to
                 generate more sales, property, business and transient occupancy
                 taxes.
   ACTION:       a. Encourage a portion of Kerman’s industrial park to be used for
                 service commercial uses. This service commercial park should be
                 delineated on the land use map. This area will be zoned to the
                 service commercial district.
                 b. The Kerman planning department should design a development
                 template for service commercial developments that wish to locate
                 in the industrial park. This design template would provide a
                 schematic layout of a potential service commercial use, showing
                 setbacks, landscaping, parking, etc.
7. POLICY:       Promote additional industrial development in Kerman
   ACTION:       a. The City should develop “jobs/housing” mitigation measures in
                 the form of fees and/or actions regarding residential development
                 occurring in Kerman. This fee could be utilized to finance and/or
                 pay interest on the cost of the installation of infrastructure in the
                 industrial park. This “jobs/housing” fee or measures would create
                 jobs in the Kerman area thereby potentially allowing persons to
                                      2-34

                 work in Kerman rather than commuting to surrounding cities or
                 other locations in the county.
                 b. To insure that there is infrastructure available to all properties
                 with Kerman’s industrial park, the City should prepare a 20-year
                 capital improvement program for the park. This document would
                 detail the location, size and financing strategy that would
                 implement this program. In addition to the traditional sources of
                 funds that could finance these improvements, the city could
                 augment these funds with the “jobs / housing” mitigation measures
                 which may include fees to finance and/or pay interest on the cost of
                 infrastructure for the industrial/commercial areas which would
                 .bring jobs.
                 c. The City should coordinate with Fresno County COG and
                 CALTRANS to widen and improve the primary roadways that
                 connect Kerman with State Highway 99, Whitesbridge Road (State
                 Highway 180) and Jensen Ave. The extension of SR 180 from
                 Mendota to 1-5 and the potential 180 truck route “by-pass” north
                 of the current Whitesbridge alignment are integral elements of this
                 transportation plan.
                 d. The City of Kerman should consider either the purchase or
                 control of a large parcel of land in the industrial park. Control of
                 the property could follow the “Commerce Way Model” in which
                 the City installed the infrastructure. This would allow the City to
                 effectively market the property to industries that may wish to
                 “move quickly” in terms of developing a site.
   :             e. The City should apply for state and federal grants or lands to
                 financially assist in the installation of infrastructure improvements
                 throughout the park.
                 f. The City of Kerman should work with the State to create loans
                 or grants which could provide “no interest” loan programs for
                 municipalities wishing to finance infrastructure improvements.
8. POLICY:       Diversify employment base.
   ACTION:       a. Designate an area within the Kerman planning area for an
                 “industrial business park.” This type of land use would emphasize
                 technology, research, or small manufacturing operations.
                 b. Amend the Kerman Zoning Ordinance to provide regulations
                 and development standards for an industrial business park district.

   :             c. Identify on the Kerman Land Use map a site for an industrial
                 business park.
9. POLICY:       Attract industries that are complementary to the existing work
                 force, that do not adversely affect air quality, the city’s waste water
                 treatment plan or the city’s water system and do not have a
                 negative impact on the health and safety of the neighborhood or on
                 the community as a whole.
   ACTION:       a. Seek industries that compliment the local work force, such as
                 Ag Cluster, agricultural equipment repair and manufacturing,
                 nurseries, warehouses and packing houses and trucking and farm
                 management.
                 b. The City Engineer will review each industry that wishes to
                 locate in Kerman to insure that the project will not have an
                 adverse impact on the city’s sewer or water systems. Should the
                 City Engineer make such findings, the city will require a mitigated
                 negative declaration or an environmental impact report to be
                 prepared on the proposed industry.
                 The City Engineer will require industries that generate high
                 strength industrial effluent to mitigate this impact by either pre-
                 treating the effluent or by paying an appropriate wastewater
                 impact fee to defray the city’s cost of treating the effluent.
                 c. New and/or industrial uses will be processed through Kerman’s
                 site plan & CUP review process to insure that they do not conflict
                 with surrounding land uses or adversely impact the health and
                 safety of the community.

J. AIR QUALITY
The San Joaquin Valley is second only to the Los Angeles basin in terms of “severe” air
pollution conditions (Air Quality Guidelines for General Plan, September, 1994, San
Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District). To meet state and federal air
quality standards, the District must rely on local governments to implement strategies to
reduce air emissions. One of the cornerstones of this goal is the implementation of
transportation control measures (TCM). TCMs are defined as any program to reduce
vehicle trips and miles traveled, or to increase average vehicle ridership.
Failure to reduce mobile source emissions will result in numerous health and economic
problems. Poor air quality adversely impacts persons with respiratory problems,
especially young children and senior citizens. Failure to reduce emissions could
discourage economic investment in the Valley as well as causing some existing
businesses to move to other regions in the country where air quality in better.
Encouraging people to drive less, rideshare or seek alternative modes of transportation is
difficult. Even when people understand the consequences of their actions (transportation
choices) on the Valley’s air quality, they still adhere to their travel habits, even when the
price of gasoline has far surpassed two dollars a gallon, however, there are some bright
spots on the horizon. Use of fireplaces has been curtailed, agricultural burning is being
replaced with tilling and shredding, diesel powered pumps are being replaced with
electric engines, and the number of hybrid cars being driven in the Valley is increasing.
The greatest challenge, however, will be to entice people to walk or ride a bike to their
destination or use some form of public transportation. It is important that the above
strategies work for without their implementation, the Valley’s air quality will continue to
deteriorate causing health and economic problems.
To effectively minimize development’s impact on the air environment, the Kerman
General Plan must link land use with the circulation and transportation networks. As an
example, high density residential uses may warrant a bus stop that would be operated by
a transportation company that links Kerman to Fresno with bus service. Another example
would be linking residential development to commercial development with a pedestrian
and bike path system. People might opt to walk or ride to the commercial center rather
than drive their car.
1. POLICY:              The City shall promote all modes of transportation, including mass
                        transit (buses, etc.) bicycle and walking.
    ACTION:             a. Through the 5-year capital budget, the City Council should
                        ensure that gasoline tax and transportation funds are spent on all
                        modes of transportation.
                        b. Bus stops shall be provided in the planning area. These stops
                        should be covered, equally spaced throughout the planning area,
                        and located on a major street that is provided with a turnout.

2. POLICY:          The City shall promote all modes of transportation, including mass
                    transit (buses, etc.) bicycle and walking.
   ACTION:          Through the 5-year capital budget, the City Council should insure
                    that gasoline tax and transportation funds are spent on all modes
                    of transportation.
3. POLICY:          The City shall prepare a bike path design plan which lays out a
                    community-wide bicycle lane network. New subdivisions shall
                    provide for the network.
   ACTION:          The Engineering and Planning Departments will prepare the
                    Bike path design plan. Funds will come from tax increment, gas
                    tax and transportation funds. Bike paths will be required to be
                    installed in new subdivisions where required by the bike path
                    design plan.
4. POLICY: Streets shall serve as transportation networks that are linked with land uses.
   ACTION:          a. Design streets that are “pedestrian-friendly”- wide sidewalks,
                    bulb outs at intersections, narrow to slow traffic speed, well lit and
                    shaded with trees.
:                   b. Design a street network that provides multiple routes to
                    destinations thereby reducing trip length and travel time.
:                   c. Design a bike path network that links all destinations within the
                    planning area thereby promoting the use of bikes.
:                   d. Locate parks and schools in the center of the planning area so
                    that people are encouraged to walk and bike and so that vehicular
                    trip length and travel time are reduced.
                    e. Locate high density residential development near commercial
                    uses and parks and schools.
                    f. Prove for roundabouts so that traffic does not have to stop at
                    intersections.
                    g. Promote slower driving speeds by narrowing roadways,
                    installing bulb-outs and roundabouts, and curving the street where
                    possible.

                        h. Amend the Kerman Zoning Ordinance to provide for live-work
                        units.
                        i. Provide for mixed-use development with a conditional use
                        permit for commercial properties located along Madera Avenue
                        between Whitesbridge Road and California Avenue.
K. AGRICULTURE
Agriculture is the primary industry in the Kerman area. This basic industry employs over
30 percent of Kerman's labor force. Agriculture is a relatively stable industry when
compared to other industrial sectors, like manufacturing, tourism, and the transportation
industries. For this reason, agriculture should be encouraged in the Kerman area.
Further, land use policies that minimize the impacts between urban and agricultural uses
should be promoted.
1. POLICY:              Kerman will ensure that its primary economic base (agriculture) is
                        protected.
    ACTION:             a. Require the Planning Commission and City Council to make a
                        finding when approving new subdivisions that this development is
                        within 1/8 mile of existing urban development.
                        b. Require a Right to Farm ordinance to all parcels proposed for
                        annexations that are not being developed at that time.
2. POLICY:              Encourage Fresno County to apply large-lot agricultural zoning (20
                        acre minimum) to land within Kerman's Sphere of Influence.
    ACTION:             The City of Kerman shall oppose any county development within
                        its Sphere of Influence that creates parcels of less than 20 acres.
                        The City should work with Fresno County to receive notice of any
                        development within 2 miles of the city’s Sphere of Influence.
3. POLICY:              Increase overall residential densities in the City of Kerman so as to
                        require less urbanization of surrounding agricultural lands.
    ACTION:             The Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance provide for
                        increased residential densities within the planning area.
4. POLICY:              Urban uses, to the best extent possible, should be separated from
                        agricultural uses by streets, railroads, canals or similar man-made
                        or natural barriers.

    ACTION:           Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use Map will
                      implement this policy.
5. POLICY             Preserve agricultural land outside the planning area of the General
                      Plan
    ACTION:           a. Implement an agricultural easement program wherein a
                          portion of the city’s development impact fee would pay for such
                         an easement.
                      b. Apply for state and federal funds to assist in the city’s
                           agricultural easement program.
                      c. Apply to non-profit organizations for funds to assist in the
                           city’s agricultural easement program.
                      d. Develop the city’s agricultural easement program by working
                           with the Fresno County Farm Bureau and American Farmland
                           Trust.
K. PUBLIC FACILITIES
Construction of public facilities benefits a city in that the facility provides additional
employment and the location of the facility can be used to renovate a section of the city.
For example, a county facility, such as a court, library or health clinic, built in or near a
downtown brings additional people into the area that will shop and eat, thereby enhancing
the business or commercial operations in the downtown.
1. POLICY:            Future public facilities and expansions of existing public facilities
                      (City Hall) should be encouraged to locate in the historic Kerman
                      townsite.
    ACTION:
                      a. The City/Redevelopment Agency shall work with various public
                      agencies to encourage them to locate their facilities in this area.
                      b. The City should expand City Hall to provide for growth over the
                      next twenty years and consider a two–story building .
2. POLICY:            The City should preclude the intrusion of any land uses that are
                      incompatible with operation of the Kerman Waste Water
                      Treatment Plant.

3. POLICY:              New public facilities (i.e.,: parks, schools, etc.) should be located
                        in areas convenient to all citizens.
    ACTION:             Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use Map will
                        implement this policy.
4. POLICY:              Kerman shall install water, sewer, and storm drainage
                        improvements that correct existing infrastructure deficiencies and
                        meet the demand of future growth.
ACTION:                 a. Kerman's water, sewer, and storm drainage master plans shall
                        be reviewed in order to insure that they can properly and
                        efficiently serve future development provided for by the Land Use
                        Element. The City should research the feasibility to provide
                        Fresno Irrigation District water to common landscapes areas of
                        new development. Also, the use of wells with non-potable water
                        could be considered for this source (Water Delivery through a
                        “Purple Pipe” Secondary Water Supply.
ACTION:                 b. Kerman's water, sewer, and storm drainage development fees
                        shall be reviewed on an annual basis. This review should focus on
                        the relationship between the amount of fees being collected for
                        each system and the future capital needs of each system based on
                        development trends in Kerman.
LAND USE MAP
Exhibit 3 identifies the land use designations applied to the Kerman planning area. The
Land Use Map (Map 6 located in Part III of this document) shows land designated for
urban development that is outside Kerman's current Sphere of Influence (SOI). In order
to fully implement the Land Use Element, Kerman will be required to amend its SOI,
subject to LAFCO approval.
LAND USE DESIGNATION/ZONING DISTRICT MATRIX
Table 6 below details which zone districts are consistent with the land use designations
contained in the Kerman Land Use Element. This matrix will be valuable to the Planning
Department as they begin the rezoning of the community to be consistent with the
adopted Land Use Element.

                                                           Chapter 2: Land Use Element
                                       APPENDIX A
                                   DESIGN GUIDELINES
One of the objectives of the Kerman General Plan is the establishment of a set of
guidelines to coordinate the design of new buildings, remodeling of existing buildings,
and the installation of other outdoor public and private property improvements such as
landscaping, signs, lighting, and parking lots, along the city's two commercial streets,
Madera Avenue and Whitesbridge Avenue.
Three design districts have been established by the guidelines. The delineation of these
districts recognizes the existing conditions that are unique to each. The location of each
district is shown on Exhibit A-1. The districts are:
1. Historic Townsite. This district includes properties primarily fronting Madera
Avenue, from California Avenue to Kearney Boulevard. As its name implies, this district
includes the commercial areas in Kerman's original townsite. A number of the existing
buildings have a unique "old town" design and are located at the sidewalk's edge,
promoting a pedestrian shopping atmosphere that is found nowhere else in Kerman.
2. Madera Avenue north of Kearney Boulevard. This district includes newer commercial
development, including several office complexes. Development in this district is
characterized by landscaped setbacks, "contemporary" architecture, and storefront
parking lots.
3. Whitesbridge Avenue. This district contains the largest shopping centers in Kerman
along with some service-commercial uses. Most of Kerman's vacant commercial parcels
are located along Whitesbridge Avenue.
Six design issues are addressed by the design guidelines including, building scale,
setbacks, parking, landscaping, signs, and lighting. The following pages include
illustrations of the concepts covered by the guidelines. It is the intent of the Kerman City
Council to incorporate these guidelines in the Kerman Zoning Ordinance so that they take
the form of zoning ordinance requirements imposed on projects within each design
district.

                                     Building Scale
      Building scale and proportion shall be compatible with surrounding buildings.
  Diagrams above and below illustrate the concept of proportion, scale, and repetition of
 design elements. New downtown buildings should be designed to complement the scale
   and proportion of existing building. This will facilitate a harmonious and cohesive
                                 downtown appearance.

   rear of the site, if an alley is present. No portion of the parking lot shall be located
                         between the building and front property line.

CHAPTER 3 • CIRCULATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element is second only to the Land Use Element in terms of importance
to a community. It has a significant impact on existing and future residents of Kerman
because it determines the route and mode by which persons are going to travel within the
community and to other destinations outside the community.
Section 65302 (b) of the Government Code indicates that the circulation element must
disclose the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
transportation routes and transportation-related facilities.
The Court has indicated that in addition to indicating that roadway improvements must be
consistent with the General Plan, (Friends of "B" Street. et. al. v. City of Hayward, et. al.,
106 Cal. App. 3d 988 (1980)), there must be a correlation between the circulation and
land use elements, (Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County v. Board of Supervisors of
Calaveras County 166 Cal. App. 3d 90 (1985)). Generally, correlation is dependent upon
the two elements using the same population and land use projections.
The Kerman Circulation Element contains six primary components:
1)      existing conditions;
2)      an evaluation of the existing circulation system;
3)      traffic projections and evaluation;
4)      circulation goals;
5)      the Plan - issues, policies and action programs; and
6)      circulation map.

Roadways
Kerman's circulation system is based on a grid pattern that was established in the early
1900s when the original townsite was formed. The original townsite extended from A
Street (California Avenue) on the south to Kearney Boulevard on the north and from 1st
Street on the east to 9th Street on the west. Each street had a 60-foot right-of-way except
for Madera Avenue and C Street. Madera Avenue has a 200-foot right-of-way on the
south end, which contains Plaza Park, and a 100-foot right-of-way on the north end. C
Street, which was originally proposed as a commercial street has a right-of-way of 80
feet.
Kerman's circulation system contains arterials, major and minor collectors, local
roadways and alleys. A definition of each type of roadway is provided below. In
addition, Kerman's existing arterials and collectors are named and described.
Expressway- Provides for through traffic movement on continuous routes through a city.
It generally connects with arterials, highways, freeways. Also it connects a city with
other cities. Arterials are generally four lane roadways, divided and undivided.
Kerman has two expressways: - State Highways 145 (Madera Avenue) and 180
(Whitesbridge Road). State Highway 145 connects Kerman with Madera and State
Highway 99 to the north and Interstate 5 to the south. Highway 180 connects Kerman
with Fresno and Highway 99 to the east and with Mendota to the west.
Madera Avenue, between Whitesbridge Avenue and Church Street, has four travel lanes,
two parking lanes and a 15-foot median with left-turn pockets. It narrows to two lanes
just north of Whitesbridge and south of Church. Madera Avenue's right-of-way ranges
from 60 to 100 feet.
Whitesbridge, between Siskiyou and Goldenrod avenues, has four travel lanes and two
parking lanes. It narrows to two lanes east of Del Norte and west of Vineland.
Whitesbridge's right-of-way ranges in width from 60 to 100 feet.
Arterial - Provides for traffic movement around or through a city. It generally connects
with a collector or arterial. Arterials are generally two lanes, divided, or four lanes,
undivided. It provides access to Kerman's four quadrants; they are generally spaced
every 1/2 mile.
Kerman has three east/west and three north/south arterials. The east/west arterials are
Church Avenue, from Del Norte to Vineland; California Avenue, from Siskiyou to
Goldenrod; and Kearney Avenue, from Siskiyou to Goldenrod. The north/south arterials
are Siskiyou Avenue, from California to Whitesbridge; Del Norte Avenue, from Church
to Whitesbridge; Vineland Avenue, from Church to Whitesbridge; and Goldenrod
Avenue, from Church to Whitesbridge.

                                                          Chapter 3: Circulation Element
These arterials have geometrics that range from two travel lanes and two parking lanes to
two travel lanes, two parking lanes and a 12-16-foot median with left-turn pockets, 6-8-
foot parkways and 4-5 foot sidewalks. These arterials have rights-of-way that range in
width from 60 feet to 80 feet.
Collector - Provides for traffic movement through a city. It generally connects a local
roadway with another collector or arterial. Collectors are generally two lanes with two
parking lanes. They provide access to major collector roadways from two or more
neighborhoods. They generally are spaced every 1/4 mile.
Kerman has three east/west and three north/south collectors. East/west collectors are C
Street, from 1st to 9th; E Street, from Siskiyou to 8th; and Stanislaus Street, from 1st to
Vineland. North/south collectors are Park Avenue, from Kearney to California; 1st
Street, from Whitesbridge to California; and 8th Street, from Kearney to California.
These collectors have geometrics that range from two travel lanes and two parking lanes
to two travel lanes, two parking lanes, a 12-15-foot center turning median, 6-foot
parkways and 4-5-foot sidewalks. These collectors have rights-of-way that range in
width from 60 feet to 80 feet.
Local - Provides for internal traffic movement within a neighborhood and serves to
provide direct access to abutting property. Local streets generally have only two lanes.
Local roadways provide direct access to Kerman's residential neighborhoods and serve to
direct neighborhood traffic to adjacent major or minor collectors. These roadways have
two travel lanes, two parking lanes, 6-foot parkways and 4-5-sidewalks. Their rights-of-
way range in width from 56 feet for cul-de-sacs to 60 feet for through streets.
Alleys - Provides rear access to residential dwellings and serves as a route by which solid
waste is collected and an area where utilities are installed.
Kerman has an extensive alley system that provides rear access to residential dwellings
and commercial buildings fronting onto Madera Avenue. These alleys are paved and
have a right-of-way width of 20 feet.
Railroads
Kerman is served by a branch line of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Spur lines serve
various plants in Kerman's industrial park. Amtrak provides passenger service from the
depot in Fresno.
Air Service
Kerman is served by the Fresno-Yosemite International Air Terminal, 20 miles to the
east, which provides regularly scheduled freight and passenger service. The Fresno-

Chandler Airport, 10 miles to the east, provides charter passenger service and furnishes
private and company aircraft hangers and tie-downs
Public Transportation
Two public transportation systems are available to residents in Kerman. The Fresno
County Rural Transit Agency provides a bus for dial-a-ride trips within the greater
Kerman area. This system, which averages about 20 persons per day, serves primarily
the senior citizen population in Kerman.
The Fresno County Economic Opportunities Commission (EOC) provides inter-city
transportation through the Westside Corridor bus. This bus provides transportation from
Firebaugh, San Joaquin, Mendota and Kerman into Fresno.
EVALUATION OF EXISTING CIRCULATION SYSTEM
An evaluation of Kerman's existing circulation system is furnished in this chapter and in
Part 2 of this document. This portion of the Circulation Element expands on the
evaluation of roadway and intersection capacities, connectivity, and traffic safety.
Capacity refers to an intersection's or roadway's ability to effectively carry traffic -
without congestion and periodic stops and starts. Connectivity pertains to how well
various sections of the city are connected together with roadways. Is it easy to travel
from one section of the city to another? Traffic safety pertains to how safe a roadway is
for the traveler. For example, does a collector or arterial roadway contain a number of
intersections that potentially create unsafe traffic conditions?
Capacity Evaluation
Roadways
The ability of a roadway to carry traffic is a function of many factors, including street
width, the number of travel lanes, the number of intersecting streets, the presence of
signals, and the existence of medians. A roadway's volume is increased during "peak-
hour" times - 7:00 to 8:30 a.m., 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., and 4:30 to 6:00 p.m. To measure the
traffic capacity of a roadway, a Level of Service (LOS) rating system is used. An LOS of
"A" signifies a roadway that has traffic that is free flowing; a roadway with a LOS of "F"
is very congested. Table 7 provides an interpretation of the various LOS ratings and
Table 8 provides traffic counts for various types of roadways that are operating at a LOS
of "E" - a roadway that is experiencing extreme congestion (grid-lock). Typically, an
LOS of "C" is considered acceptable by the driving public, however, in smaller cities, it
may be too congested for the typical driver.

Connectivity
Kerman is fortunate that its original roadway system provided for a "grid" pattern. This
street pattern insured that all sections of Kerman were interconnected with roadways. In
order to insure that Kerman's future circulation system provides this connectivity, future
neighborhoods should have a minimum of two access roadways, they should be
connected to a minor or major collector, and the collector should be connected to an
arterial.
Presently, the only serious connectivity problem in Kerman occurs at railroad crossings
south of California Avenue at Modoc Avenue, Siskiyou Avenue, Del Norte Avenue,
Vineland Avenue & Sycamore Avenue.
Traffic Safety
A roadway system that is safe and efficient - free of congestion - is a primary circulation
goal of all cities. This goal also promotes a roadway system that is safe for pedestrians
and bicyclists, especially younger children.
The most potentially hazardous roadway in terms of traffic safety is Whitesbridge Road.
Driving, riding or walking across Whitesbridge Road is hazardous because of the volume
and speed of traffic traveling along this roadway.
TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS AND EVALUATION
Projections
The Consultant has projected traffic volumes for both roadway segments and certain
intersections in the Kerman area. These projections are based on the following
assumptions:
1.       Traffic volumes on local and State roadway systems will generally increase at a
         rate similar to population growth rates within the planning area.
2.       Persons in Kerman will continue to use cars as their primary mode of
         transportation.
3.       Uses that generate abnormally high volumes of traffic, such as colleges, major
         manufacturing companies or an office complex, will not locate in the planning
         area during the planning period.
4.       Current traffic flow patterns in the planning area will not change significantly
         (e.g. two way streets will remain two way; streets will not be closed).
5.       Left turn lanes on State Highways 145 and 180 will generally remain unchanged.

                                                        Chapter 3: Circulation Element
Increases in traffic volumes over the planning period for local and State roadways is
going to be generated by the development of the land uses in the Kerman area and by
increases in population and development in surrounding communities.
Two traffic volume projections - low and high - for the years 2017 and 2027 are provided
in this element. The low projection is based on traffic growth rates provided by Caltrans
for various segments of State highways passing through the Kerman area. These annual
growth rates range from a low of 1.5 percent to a high of 3.75 percent. The Consultant
averaged the various annual growth rates and arrived at a figure of 2.9 percent. The high
projection is based on Kerman's annual average population growth rate, which is 3.61
percent.
Projected low and high traffic volumes for years 2017 and 2027 are derived by
multiplying the current average daily traffic counts (2007) by 2.9 and 3.61 percent per
year. These projections are displayed in Tables 11, 12 and 13.

Evaluations
Information contained in Tables 12 and 13 indicate that Kerman's two arterial roadways -
Madera Avenue and Whitesbridge Road - will operate in the D or F LOS by 2027 under
low or high traffic projections. All other roadways will have a projected LOS of B or
better.
CIRCULATION GOALS
Circulation goals express general community values as they relate to travel, traffic safety,
mobility, and funding for maintenance and construction of roadways. Circulation goals
for Kerman are as follows:
                                            3-15
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                           Chapter 3: Circulation Element
1.      INSURE THAT STREETS AND INTERSECTIONS IN KERMAN ARE NOT
        CONGESTED.
2.      PROVIDE EFFICIENT CIRCULATION ACCESS TO ALL PARTS OF
        KERMAN.
3.      ENSURE AMPLE OFF-STREET PARKING FOR NEW AND CHANGING
        USES LOCATING OR EXPANDING IN KERMAN.
4.      DEVELOP STREETS THAT ARE WELL DESIGNED AND VISUALLY
        ATTRACTIVE.
5.      PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WILL
        IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN KERMAN AND
        CONSERVE RESOURCES SUCH AS BICYCLES, BUS USE, THE USE OF
        ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND WALKING.
6.      ESTABLISH TRUCK ROUTES AND FACILITATE TRUCK FACILITIES
        THAT ARE NOT DISRUPTIVE TO RESIDENTS OR BUSINESS IN
        KERMAN.
7.      PROVIDE FOR LONG TERM FINANCING FOR STREET CONSTRUCTION
        AND MAINTENANCE.
A. TRAFFIC
One thing that people who live in cities tend to agree on is that there is too much traffic
on their street. Even if the roadway is operating at a LOS of A, people will still complain
that there is too much traffic passing in front of their home. While it is difficult to
improve on a roadway that has a LOS of A, cities can embrace policies and action
programs that will insure that traffic impacts in the community will be kept to a
minimum.
1. POLICY:              A level of service C will be the desirable minimum service level in
                        Kerman at which highway, arterial and collector segments will
                        operate. A level of service of B will be the desirable minimum
                        service level in Kerman at which intersections and rail crossings
                        will operate.
   ACTION:              a. The City will program into its 5-year capital budget, street
                        improvements that will insure the specified LOS is not exceeded in
                        the city limits. Funds for these street improvement projects will
                        come from gas tax, transportation funds and development impact
                        fees.
                                             3-16
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                           Chapter 3: Circulation Element
                        b. The City, working with Caltrans, will periodically check traffic
                        warrants at the Whitesbridge/Madera and Kearney/Madera
                        intersections in order to plan for proper signalization and turn
                        lanes at these intersections.
2. POLICY:              Roadway segments that are projected to operate at a less-than-
                        satisfactory level of service (as indicated by Tables 12 and 13)
                        shall restrict direct access and prioritize the placement of right turn
                        lanes, left turn lanes and signal controls at these locations..
    ACTION:             a. The Planning Department shall recommend denial of
                        discretionary land use projects to the Planning Commission and
                        City Council that are inconsistent with this policy.
3. POLICY:              In order to insure circulation connectivity in Kerman, where
                        required railroad crossings will be widened and improved. If there
                        is to be a new rail crossing, a grade separation will be constructed.
                        Existing grade crossings may be relocated if called for by the
                        General Plan.
    ACTION:             a. Adoption of the Circulation Map will implement this policy.
                        b. The City will calculate and implement development impact fees
                        for railroad crossings consistent with the Circulation Element
                        map.
B. EXPRESSWAYS, ARTERIALS & COLLECTORS
Arterial roadways carry the greatest amount of traffic in Kerman. Not only are traffic
volumes higher but also the speed of travel. Potentially, these roadways have the greatest
traffic safety problems because of these factors.
Most persons in Kerman will travel on an arterial roadway at least once a day. Travel
efficiency on these roadways is important for two reasons: (1) Stop and start conditions
cause the traveler to be late for their destination. (2) These types of conditions cause
greater amounts of air pollution - already a significant environmental problem in the
Valley. Traffic that moves smoothly minimizes these two problems.
Aside from freeways and arterials, collectors carry the greatest amount of traffic in a city.
Unlike freeways and arterials, collector roadways traverse residential neighborhoods.
These are the streets that drain traffic from the neighborhoods and convey it towards
other collector or arterial roadways.
                                               3-17
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                             Chapter 3: Circulation Element
Because collectors pass through neighborhoods, their effectiveness to channel traffic in a
safe and effective manner can be diminished by land uses in a neighborhood. For
example, a new residential subdivision that allows residential dwellings to front onto a
collector creates a situation where numerous driveways from these dwellings intersect
with the collector. This creates a traffic safety problem for persons backing out onto the
collector as well as for the person traveling along the collector.
Collectors by their nature can have the greatest impact on the residential neighborhoods
of a city. They can generate noise that impacts residents and their appearance can either
enhance or detract from a neighborhood's visual appeal.
1. POLICY:              Driveways that intersect with arterials and collectors should be
                        kept to a minimum and, if possible, should be reduced when
                        redevelopment occurs along an arterial roadway.
    ACTION:             a. Through the site plan review process, the Planning and
                        Engineering Departments shall determine spacing between
                        adjacent driveways along SR 145 and SR 180 based on speed,
                        needed sight distance and size of land use. Spacing shall also be
                        consistent with good engineering practices and include the review
                        of Caltrans requirements.
2. POLICY:              Left turn lanes shall be evenly and consistently to facilitate signal
                        timing and built consistent with Caltrans spacing
                        recommendations; they shall also be constructed on arterials where
                        they intersect with other arterials or collectors and, otherwise,
                        breaks in the median shall be limited to ¼ mile.
    ACTION:             a. The Public Works Department will coordinate with Caltrans to
                        insure that left turn lanes are constructed along State Highways
                        145 and 180.
3. POLICY:              New driveways constructed onto arterial roadways shall meet
                        Caltrans construction specifications.
    ACTION:             a. Through Kerman’s site plan review process, Caltrans will
                        review all new construction projects along State Highways 145
                        and 180.
4. POLICY:              Corner radii should be designed to accommodate the anticipated
                        design vehicle; curbing at the intersections of arterial and collector
                        streets should be painted red or posted “No Stopping at any time”
                        signs at least 50 feet in all directions from the corner curb radius
                        and ramps shall be installed at corners that access sidewalks.
                                              3-18

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                        Part I
                                                          Chapter 3: Circulation Element
    ACTION:            a. The Public Works Department will coordinate with Caltrans to
                       identify which curbs at the aforementioned intersections should be
                       red-curbed.
5. POLICY:             Arterial roadways should have sufficient right-of-way to contain
                       four travel lanes, two parking lanes, and 16-foot median/turn lane,
                       7-foot parkways and 5-foot sidewalks; major collector roadways
                       should have sufficient right-of-way to contain two travel lanes, two
                       bike lanes, two parking lanes, a 14-foot median/turn lane, 6-foot
                       parkways and 5-foot sidewalks.
    ACTION:            a. The Public Works Department will coordinate with Caltrans to
                       insure that sufficient right-of-way will be dedicated when
                       development occurs along State Highways 145 and 180.
                       b. Major and minor collector roadways will be constructed
                       consistent with street cross-section illustrations contained in
                       Appendix A of the Circulation Element.
6. POLICY:             All street improvement projects, including widening, closing, or
                       constructing new roadways, will be reviewed by the Planning and
                       Engineering Departments to confirm that the project is consistent
                       with the Circulation Element.
    ACTION:            a. The Planning and Public Works Departments will review street
                       projects to determine consistency with the Circulation Element.
C. PARKING
The success of commercial businesses is sometimes dependent upon adequate parking.
The parking must be in close proximity to the commercial business, it must be safe, and if
possible, it should exemplify a pleasant parking environment - landscaped, well lit, and
large parking stalls.
For other uses, such as public facilities, churches, apartments, and industries, adequate
on-site parking is important so that surrounding land uses are not negatively impacted by
persons parking on or in front of these properties.
1. POLICY:             On-street parking caused by new uses located along arterial or
                       collector streets should be discouraged.
    ACTION:            a. Through the site plan review process, the Planning and
                       Engineering Departments will insure that the design of the project
                       discourages on-street parking on these types of roadways.

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                        Part I
                                                          Chapter 3: Circulation Element
2. POLICY:             Parking lots for new uses shall contain landscaping, proper lighting
                       and shall be properly designed to insure maneuverability of
                       vehicles.
    ACTION:            a. Through the site plan review process, the Planning and
                       Engineering Departments will insure that the design of new
                       parking lots contain these features.
                       b. The Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to include parking lot
                       design standards, including a requirement for 50 percent shading
                       within a ten-year time frame.
3. POLICY:             New parking lots along Madera Avenue between California
                       Avenue and Kearney Boulevard should be designed so that the
                       parking lot does not occupy the entire frontage of the site.
    ACTION:            a. Through the site plan review process, the Planning Department
                       will insure that the design of new parking lots will be consistent
                       with this policy.
D. SIGNALIZATION
1. POLICY:             The City will adopt a development impact fee that finances the
                       signalization of intersections, including the intersections along SR
                       145 and SR 180.
    ACTIONS:           a. The City will periodically review the levels of service ratings at
                       major intersections in Kerman to determine if signals should be
                       installed.
                       b. The City will calculate and implement development impact fees
                       for signalization that are consistent with the Circulation Element
                       map and Assembly Bill 1600 (legislation that requires a nexus, or
                       connection, between the fee being required and the improvement to
                       be installed).
E. STREET DESIGN
The primary purpose of a street is to convey traffic from one destination to another.
Streets do not have to be a sterile public improvement that detracts from the appearance
of a neighborhood. They can be improvements that enrich the appearance of a
neighborhood and creates a unifying theme of trees, lighting and signage.

1. POLICY:            The City shall have prepared a streetscape design plan, which will
                      establish a 15-year improvement program for the construction of
                      landscaped medians for specific roadways in the community. This
                      Plan should include details for lighting, landscaping and signing.
    ACTION:           a. The Engineering and Planning Departments will prepare the
                      streetscape design plan. Funds will come from tax increment, gas
                      tax, transportation funds and the state grant programs.
2. POLICY:            Proposed landscaping along SR 145 and SR 180 should be
                      approved by the Caltrans District 6 Office of Landscape
                      Architecture and include a maintenance agreement between the
                      State and the City; advertising signs along SR 145 and SR 1880
                      shall also be consistent with State policies.
F. ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION MODES
Alternative modes of transportation are important to different people for different
reasons. For a low-income person or a person on a fixed income, transit service may be
the only means of traveling to the store, doctor, or to visit a friend in another city. For the
person who is concerned about air pollution, riding the bus may be their way of
improving the air environment. For the family who enjoys riding bikes, this form of
transportation becomes a recreational activity.
1. POLICY:            The City shall promote all modes of transportation, including mass
                      transit (buses, etc.) bicycle and walking.
    ACTION:           a. Through the 5-year capital budget, the City Council should
                      insure that gasoline tax and transportation funds are spent on all
                      modes of transportation.
2. POLICY:            The City shall prepare a bikepath design plan which lays out a
                      community-wide bicycle lane network. New subdivisions shall
                      provide for the network.
    ACTION:           a. The Engineering and Planning Departments will prepare the
                      bikepath design plan. Funds will come from tax increment, gas tax
                      and transportation funds. Bikepaths will be required to be
                      installed in new subdivisions where required by the bikepath
                      design plan.

G. TRUCK TRAFFIC
Truck traffic can adversely affect residential neighborhoods because of the noise they
generate. Further, truck traffic can damage local roadways because the road beds are not
designed to carry heavy loads. To repair damaged roadways can be very expensive for
cities.
1. POLICY:             To avoid the adverse impacts associated with truck traffic, truck
                       routes shall be designated on the following streets: Whitesbridge
                       Road, Madera Avenue, and Church Avenue as well as all existing
                       and proposed streets located within the Kerman Industrial Park.
     ACTION:           a. The Public Works Department shall post the above roadways as
                       truck routes.
2. POLICY:             The City of Kerman will insure that transportation and gasoline tax
                       funds and other funds that can be used for roadway projects are
                       properly programmed through the 5-year capital budget to

CHAPTER 4 • CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE, PARKS AND RECREATION
ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Open space, parks, and recreation facilities enhance the quality of life in a community.
The conservation of these types of resources is an integral part of providing for the needs
and welfare of a community. Conservation of open space takes planning for the future.
If these areas are not planned for at this time and set aside for the future, a city runs the
risk of losing them to development. Open space lands are undeveloped areas that provide
a low density perception in an urban area, define the edge of a community, and provide
the sight lines that allow long distance vistas to the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Range,
agriculture fields, or other local view-points. Most people think of open space as park
areas, but a large portion of a city's open space is provided by residential yard areas and
right-of-way along streets.
A park is an open area that provides an assortment of recreation and leisure opportunities
for a community. A park can include school playgrounds, community recreation parks,
community centers, and other publicly-owned outdoor recreation areas. Parks can supply
active as well as passive recreation. Activities can range from family picnics to
organized sporting events.
One of the primary purposes of parks is to contribute to Kerman's quality of life. The
City accomplishes this through the provision of convenient, well-equipped and
maintained sites and facilities, conservation of natural resources, and a comprehensive
and quality program of recreational activities and services for all citizens of the
community.
THE ELEMENT
The open space portion of this Element identifies lands that are appropriate for open
space and parks acquisition as well as the development of recreation programs on these
lands. The Element establishes goals, policies, action programs and standards for the
conservation and treatment of open space.
Government Code Section 65560 et seq. defines open space as land that can be used for
any of the following uses:
                                              4-1

•        Conservation of natural resources.
•        Managed production of resources.
•        Outdoor recreation.
•        Preservation of lands for the purpose of protecting the public's health and safety.
Specific requirements of the conservation portion of the Element are identified in
Government Code Section 65302 (d). This portion of the element includes "the
conservation, development and utilization of natural resources, including water, forests,
soils, rivers and other waters, wildlife, and other natural resources." Items that are
addressed in this category include the conservation of:
•        View opportunities.
•        Soils.
•        Agricultural lands.
•        Mineral resources.
•        Air quality.
•        Wildlife habitat.
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional element of the General Plan. This
Element identifies existing and potential recreational opportunities within the community.
Since it is closely related to the City's open space system, integration of the three
documents into one element makes good planning sense.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The City of Kerman is located in the central San Joaquin Valley on level terrain. The
closest significant topographical feature is the bluffs of the San Joaquin River, about ten
miles north of Kerman. The mountains of the Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada begin
about 35 miles southwest and northeast of Kerman, respectively. The city is entirely
surrounded by agricultural land mixed with farmhouses and small ranches. The
surrounding agricultural land lends the effect of a greenbelt around Kerman.
Discussed below are specific issues relating to the Conservation, Open Space, Parks and
Recreation Element. A more detailed description of these issues can also be found in Part
2 of this document.
Air Quality
Kerman has a moderate climate with warm summers and generally mild winters. The
City is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. The closest California Air
Resources Board (CARB) air monitoring stations are located in Fresno, where all criteria
air pollutant levels are measured. According to CARB, the San Joaquin Valley exceeds
standards for two important pollutant criteria: ozone and particulate matter, and is
                                              4-2

therefore designated as a non-attainment area (meaning the Valley has not attained or
achieved, required air quality standards). There are several factors which cause this to
occur. They are:
1.      The topography of the valley as a basin surrounded by mountains has the effect of
trapping stagnant or polluted air.
2.      The local climate (abundant sunshine and high atmospheric pressure) is favorable
for the formation of smog.
3.      The primary factor is the growth of population in the Valley. With more and
more people moving to the valley, smog is produced by fossil fuel burning and emissions
from factories and other combustion processes.
Water Resources
The City withdraws groundwater from five deep wells. The wells penetrate underlying
aquifers, located at depths from 300 to 900 feet.
The total production capacity of these wells is approximately 5,700 gallons per minute
(gpm). The current static water level in the wells is 85 to 90 feet. According to city staff,
the depth to groundwater in Kerman has remained fairly stable over the past 10 to 15
years. The upper aquifer is contaminated with Uranium. The City recently completed a
major water project to drill three new wells much deeper than the previous wells. The
replenishment of the deeper aquifer is unknown.
The United States Bureau of Reclamation reported in 2000 that the depth to groundwater
in the Kerman area ranged from 80 to 100 feet. The water table is recharged primarily by
water moving downhill from the watersheds of Sierra Nevada streams. Irrigation waters
also help to recharge the water table. Rainfall in the Kerman area provides only a small
amount of groundwater recharge.
There are no natural surface water features such as streams or lakes in the Kerman area.
There are several irrigation canals which traverse the planning area. These could be
given consideration for use as parkways, as development occurs around them.
The City is exploring the possibility of supplementing its groundwater supply with
treated surface water supplied by Fresno Irrigation District (FID). FID supplies irrigation
water to surrounding agricultural users. As the City develops and the agricultural uses
are replaced by urban development, the water that was once used to irrigate crops could
now be used to meet the municipal needs.
One concept which may help the city make better use of its resources is a dual water
system. The primary system would provide potable water for domestic uses from deep
                                            4-3

wells. The secondary system would carry non-potable water for landscaping, industrial
and fire protection from surface water and/or shallow ground-water. The secondary
system would have its own mains, services, pumps, wells and storage tanks.
Agricultural Resources
Kerman is surrounded by thousands of acres of producing cropland. Agricultural lands
have provided a strong economic base for the community as well as a rural landscape and
open space "system" that surrounds the City. As Kerman continues to grow, the
surrounding agricultural lands are taken out of production to accommodate residential,
commercial, and industrial growth.
In 1965, California adopted the Williamson Act to address the loss of agricultural lands
due to urbanization. The Williamson Act provides property owners with a reduction in
their property tax if they agree to maintain their land in agriculture for a ten-year period.
This ensures, at least for the near-future, that agricultural lands will remain undeveloped,
thereby enhancing the sense of open space around Kerman as well as continuing
agricultural production. Map 1 shows properties within the Kerman Planning Area that
have a Williamson Act contract.
Mineral Resources
There are no significant mineral resources within the planning area and no known mining
of mineral resources has occurred in the planning area. The closest significant mineral
resources consist of petroleum deposits in the Raisin City field about five miles south of
the planning area. Oil wells have been extracting petroleum from this field for many
years.
Soil Resources
The soils in the Kerman area are described by the Soil Survey of Eastern Fresno County,
prepared by the Soil Conservation Service, Department of Agriculture (see Map 16). The
general soil map of this Survey shows three major soil groups, the Hanford, Hesperia and
Traver Series, encompassing seven specific soil types in Kerman. The Hanford series
consists of soils that are well-drained, fertile, moderately course textured, and are derived
from recent granitic alluvium. The Hanford soils are generally located on nearly level
alluvial fans. Conservation of soils is an important aspect of maintaining the
development potential of certain areas as well as maintaining viable agricultural lands.
The Hesperia series consists of soils that are well-drained, moderately textured and are
formed from granitic alluvium. Some of the soils in this series are saline-alkaline
affected. They are generally found on alluvial fans.

The Traver series consists of soils that are well-drained that are typically saline-alkali
affected. These soils are deep to moderately deep over compact silt. This series occupies
young alluvial fans of the San Joaquin and Kings Rivers.
Seven specific soils are found within the context of the three major soil groups listed
above. They are Hanford course sandy loam (Ha); Hesperia sandy loam, moderately
deep (Hsm); Hanford sandy loam (Hc); Hesperia sandy loam, moderately deep, saline-
alkaline (Hsn); Traver sandy loam, moderately deep (Ts); Tujunga loamy sand (Tzba);
and Hesperia sandy loam, shallow (Hso).
Hanford course sandy loam (Ha) is a very deep soil that is well drained and is located on
alluvial fans. This soil has a Class II agricultural rating (Class I soils have the fewest
limitations for agriculture; Class VIII have the most limitations for agriculture) and a
Storie Index rating of 80 (A Storie Index rating of 80-100 has the greatest suitability for
intensive agriculture; less than 10 has the least suitability). Limitations for urban
development are moderate foundation support.
Hesperia sandy loam, moderately deep (Hsm) is a moderately deep soil that is well
drained and is located on the central parts of the young fans of the Kings and San Joaquin
Rivers. Under natural conditions these soils were subject to seasonal flooding and a
fluctuating high water table. It has a Class II agricultural rating and a Storie Index of 90.
Limitations for urban development are moderately slow permeability, moderate to severe
foundation support, and moderately slow substratum permeability.
Hanford sandy loam (Hc) is a very deep soil that is well drained and is located on alluvial
fans. This soil has a Class II agricultural rating and a Storie Index rating of 95.
Limitations for urban development are moderate foundation support.
Hesperia sandy loam, moderately deep, saline-alkaline (Hsn) is a moderately deep soil
that is well drained and is located on the central parts of the young fans of the Kings and
San Joaquin Rivers. The underlying material is strongly alkaline and normally is slightly
saline from accumulations of salts. It has a Class III agricultural rating and a Storie
Index of 50 Limitations for urban development are moderately slow permeability,
moderate to severe foundation support, and moderately slow substratum permeability.
Traver sandy loam, moderately deep (Ts) is a well-drained soil that is saline-alkaline
affected. Over long periods of time, sodium salts were accumulated in the soil material.
It has a Class II agricultural rating and a Storie Index of 34. Limitations for urban
development are moderate to severe saline-alkaline affected, high conductivity, and
moderate soil pressure.
Tujunga loamy sand (TzbA) consists of excessively drained loamy sand and sandy soils
that were formed in recent alluvium derived from granitic rocks. These soils normally
occupy flood plains and fans of rivers and smaller streams. The material below the
surface layer is mainly loamy sand to a depth of 5 feet or more, but in many places it is
                                              4-5

stratified with sand, course sand, or loamy course sand. It has a Class III agricultural
rating and a Storie Index of 76. Limitations for urban development are severe for
foundation support and severe for soil pressure.
Hesperia sandy loam, shallow (Hso) consists of well-drained moderately course textured
soils that formed in granitic alluvium. The soil is underlain by a compact, silty layer that
ranges in depth of 2.5 to 3 feet. It has a Class III agricultural rating and a Storie Index of
77. Limitations for urban development are severe for septic tanks and moderate for soil
pressure.
Conservation of soil resources in the planning area is critical in maintaining the
agricultural resources and development potential of differing soils. In most cases, proper
grading techniques can achieve this goal.

Natural Plant and Animal Communities
The Conservation Element is required to discuss the presence of native plants and
animals and in particular, native species regarded as rare, threatened, or endangered. In
addition to inventorying these species, the element must plan for their preservation.
Associations of plant species that grow in assemblages under similar ecological
conditions are called communities. Generally, they are named for the dominant species
found in the association. Definition of natural communities is important, not only
because it identifies the types of plants that are present, but also because it indicates the
habitat types and animal species that may be found in the community. Only two natural
communities were found near the Kerman planning area: Valley Sink Scrub and Non-
Native Grassland. The community descriptions listed below follow Holland's 1986
report for the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the State's Natural
Diversity Data Base.

ELEMENT NAME: Valley Sink Scrub                 ELEMENT CODE: 3621
DESCRIPTION: Low, open to dense succulent shrublands dominated by alkali-tolerant
Chenopodiaceae, especially Allenrolfea occidentalis or several Sueda species.
Understories usually are lacking, though sparse herbaceous cover dominated by Bromus
rubens develop occasionally. The annuals are most active from January to April; the
perennials from March to September.
SITE FACTORS: Heavy, saline and/or alkaline clays of lakebeds or playas. High
ground water supplies provide capillary water for the perennials. Soil surfaces often have
a brilliant white salty crust over dark, sticky clay. Climate is characterized by hot, dry
summers, damp winters with long periods of tule fog.
CHARACTERISTIC SPECIES: Allenrolfea occidentalis, Delphinium recurvatum,
Distichlis spicata, Kochia californica, Lasthenia chrysantha, L. ferrisae, Nitrophilia
occidentalis, Salicornia subterminalis, Sporobolis airoides, Sueda fruiticosa, S. torreyana.
DISTRIBUTION: Formerly surrounded the large San Joaquin Valley lakes (Kern, Buena
Vista, Tulare, Goose) and north along the trough of the San Joaquin Valley through
Merced County to the gooselands of the Sacramento Valley (Solano to Glenn County,
west of the Sacramento River); but now essentially eliminated due to flood control,
agricultural development, and ground water pumping.
ELEMENT NAME: Non-Native Grassland ELEMENT CODE: 42200
DESCRIPTION: A dense to sparse cover of annual grasses with flowering culms .2 to .5
meters high. Often associated with numerous species of showy-flowered, native annual
forbs (wildflowers), especially in years of favorable rainfall. Germination occurs with
the onset of the late fall rains; growth, flowering, and seed-set occur from winter through
spring. With a few exceptions, the plants are dead through the summer-fall dry season,
persisting as seeds.
SITE FACTORS: On fine-textured, usually clay soils, moist or even waterlogged during
the winter rainy season and very dry during the summer and fall. Oak Woodland is often
adjacent on moister, better drained soils.
Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species
On March 1, 1993, the Natural Diversity Database (NDDB) was consulted for a report of
occurrences of any rare, threatened, endangered, or sensitive plants, animals or natural
communities within the Kerman Quad. The NDDB is a computerized inventory available
through the California Department of Fish and Game, Natural Heritage Division.

Two plant species occurrences were reported: one occurrence of Eriastrum hooveri
(Hoover's woolly star) and one occurrence of Cordylanthus palmatus (Palmate-bracted
bird's beak). A brief description of each species and its occurrence record, as well as its
presumed current status within the Kerman planning area, is included below.
Eriastrum hooveri       (Jepson) Mason. "Hoover's eriastrum", "Hoover's woolly star"
Family:                 Polemoniaceae
Status:                 CNPS - List 1B (Rare, Threatened or Endangered in California and
                        Elsewhere) Federal - Threatened. State - None
Flowering period:       April - June
Habitat:                Saltbush scrub, Alkaline playas
Historic Range:         Fresno, Kings, Kern, San Luis Obispo and Tulare Counties
Known Occurrence: 1979; Fresno Co., "4.7 mi. S of Kerman RR Station along Hwy.
                        145 (Madera Ave.)"
Discussion:
This small cyclical, ephemeral annual, of the family Polemoniaceae (Phlox family), was
once fairly widespread throughout the alkaline soils of the San Joaquin Valley. This
plant is often found in openings in Atriplex scrub where cryptogamic crusts have
developed on the soil surface (Stebbins et al., 1992). Much of its native habitat has been
converted to agriculture. It was known to exist at 23 sites throughout the San Joaquin
Valley in 1986 (Taylor and Davilla).
The Fresno County occurrence of Eriastrum hooveri described above, lies approximately
3 3/4 miles south of the Kerman Urban Area Boundary, "on slight hummocks (where less
alkaline) in alkaline plain". The habitat that supported this population of E. hooveri has
probably been eliminated due to agricultural conversion. No habitat capable of
supporting this species is expected to be found within the Kerman General Plan Update
Planning Area, although habitat may exist on the KMJ (radio tower) property (2/3 mile
south of the Sphere of Influence (SOI) boundary).

Status:                CNPS - List 1B (Rare, Threatened or Endangered in California
                       and Elsewhere). Federal – Endangered. State - Endangered
Flowering period:      June - July
Habitat:               Alkaline scrub in seasonally flooded lowlands
Historic Range:        Fresno, Madera, Alameda, Colusa and Yolo Counties
Known Occurrence: 1965; Fresno Co., "6 Mi. S of Kerman (on Madera Ave.)"
Discussion:
Palmate-bracted birds-beak (Cordylanthus palmatus) is a hemiparasitic species in the
family Scrophulariaceae (Figwort family) that has been severely impacted by the
conversion of its native habitat (alkaline playas) to agriculture (Heckard 1977). The
Madera Avenue site south of Kerman was last visited in 1983 and plants were not
observed. It was reported that the habitat was lost due to soil reclamation and the area
was under cultivation.
Suitable habitat may exist for this species on the KMJ property approximately 2/3 mile
south of the Kerman SOI.
Other Species of Concern
Another species, not reported by NDDB, that is likely to occur in the general area is the
San Joaquin Kit Fox (SJKF), a federally endangered species (J. Stebbins, pers. comm.
1993). It is known to occur on the KMJ property within one mile of the Kerman SOI. If
the KMJ property supports SJKF dens, it is likely that San Joaquin Kit Fox could forage
at times within the SOI. This, however, has not been previously documented.
The kit fox is endemic to central California and was once common in the southern San
Joaquin Valley. Their population has declined dramatically due to habitat loss caused by
urbanization and cultivation of their native habitat. The kit fox is listed as "threatened"
by the State of California and "endangered" by the Federal government.
The San Joaquin kit fox is a burrow dweller and is known to occur in both of the natural
communities found within the planning area. It is an opportunistic feeder, eating
whatever prey species are locally abundant. Prey can include insects, birds, rodents and
other small mammals.
Burrowing owl is a state-listed "Species of Special Concern" and is also known to occur
at the KMJ property (J. Stebbins, pers. comm. 1993).

Park and Recreation Resources
The City of Kerman currently has ten developed park sites and one undeveloped park
sites (see Map 9). According to the National Parks and Recreation Service, a four acre
park would be categorized as a neighborhood park, which has a service area of
approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile radius.
Kerckhoff Park (5.75 acres) site is located at the intersection of "G" Street and Third
Street. Kerckhoff is considered a neighborhood park. Facilities at Kerckhoff Park
include a baseball field with bleachers, a skate park, several picnic shelters, a stage,
barbecue pits, picnic tables, booths used for events such as the Harvest Festival
playground equipment, restroom and a meeting/recreational facility known as the Scout
Hut. In 2007, the City has plans to renovate the shelters, stage and the booths. The old
swimming pool dressing and equipment room is being renovated as Teen Center which
will be utilized in conjunction with the park facilities, Community/Teen Center and the
skate park.
Lions Park (18.3 acres) is a neighborhood park as well as a ponding basin. It is located at
the northeast corner of E Street and Park Avenue and includes picnic facilities, a pavilion,
restroom/concession, playground equipment and horseshoe pits. A 6.5-acre addition to
the park was recently completed.
Plaza Park (1.3 acres) is a linear park that forms the median divider for Madera Avenue
between California Avenue and C Street. It contains a number of mature trees, lawn
areas, picnic tables and restrooms. In 2004, the park was renovated to reflect its place as
the historical center of Kerman. A wrought iron fence now surrounds the park and
buffers it from Madera Ave. (SR 145). A 15 ft old-fashioned clock tower was place at
the north end and a replica of the original “Kerman” arch sign was installed at the south
end to welcome people into the City. The renovation also included a large gazebo was
placed at the south end, a 10-foot walking path that meanders through the park and a
central Veterans’ circle with monuments honoring Kerman’s War Veterans.
Wooten Park (1.5 acres) is located at the corner of C Street and Manor Drive. It includes
a playground, and a baseball diamond.
Rotary Park (4.5 acres) includes two lighted baseball fields, bleachers, a
restroom/concession building and playground and is located on the campus of Kerman
Floyd Elementary School. The City and KUSD maintain a “Facilities Use Agreement”
which guides the use of the park..
Soroptomist Park (2.95 acres) is currently being built out at the northeast corner of
Siskiyou and Kearney Boulevard and will include walking paths, a covered picnic area
and universally-accessible playground equipment.

Kiwanis Park (2.12 acres) is a pocket park located within a subdivision at the intersection
of San Joaquin and El Mar Avenues. It includes a ball field back-stop, playground
equipment, benches and a future basketball court.
“B” Street Park (1.75 acres) is located at 16th & “B” Streets. A playground will be
placed on the site in 2007
Sunset Playground (0.35 acres) is a combination park and ponding basin. It is located at
the southeast corner of Sixth Street and Sunset Avenue.
Vineland Playground (0.62 acres) is another park/ponding basin. It is located on
Vineland Avenue, north of California Avenue. Both Sunset and Vineland parks include
playground equipment.
In addition to these existing parks, three (3) additional parks are in the planning stages:
- 1.75 acre neighborhood park adjacent to the east side elementary school which will is
scheduled to open in either August 2007 or ’08. The park will be developed in
conjunction with the 5-6 acres ball fields that the City and School District will develop on
the 20-acre school site.
- 2.6-acre “Gateway Park” will be developed in conjunction with the “Smart Growth”
development at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and the new Gateway Boulevard
just south of Whitesbridge Road (180).
- 3-acre park located at the western city limits is slated for development in 2007-8. It is
located at the intersection of San Joaquin and Kenneth Avenues and is expected to
expand to 6- 7 acres as development proceeds to the west.
The City is also exploring the acquisition of property for a regional park and continues
Maintain park facilities. The City's Parks and Recreation Department supervises and
coordinates a wide variety of programs and activities.
Community Events
The Department helps sponsor family-oriented and special community events throughout
the year, including the Harvest Festival, May Day Festival, Festival of the American
Spirit, community blood drive, ,a Christmas toy and food drive for the needy and many
other local events honoring the history and culture of the community
Sports Programs
The City provides organized men's and women's sports leagues and youth sports leagues
as well as a swimming program. A strong emphasis has been placed on community

participation in the planning, organization and implementation of these programs. As
these programs grow and participation increases, additional fields, personnel and
facilities will be needed.
In 1999, the Kerman Teen Community Center was completed at the corner of Kearney
Blvd. and Madera Avenue, serving as Kerman’s newest recreational facility that also
shares a campus with the city library. The facility hosts numerous private events such as
weddings, quincinieras, birthday and anniversary celebrations as well as fundraising
events. Sports and community programs for both teens and adults are held at this new
facility in additional to local government meetings for the City Council, Planning
Commission and other State and regional public agencies..
The community has shown strong support for programs of the Recreation Department,
including activities such as the adult softball program, the public swimming program, T-
ball, soccer, gymnastics, basketball, volleyball, cheerleading, self-defense dance classes
and other similar activities.
The City also operates a senior citizens program with a number of activities. Daily
lunches are provided for a donation (typically $1.00, although persons who cannot pay
are not turned away). Other programs include bingo, movies, public transportation,
dances, birthday parties, homebound lunches and visitations, and activities at the new
Kearney Palms Senior Citizen apartment complex among others. Many of the daily
activities are conducted at the Seniors Center at 720 South 8th Street..
Joint Use of School Facilities
In addition to City-owned park and recreation facilities, Kerman residents have access to
grounds and playing fields at Kerman Unified School District (KUSD) schools. The City
and the school district have executed a joint use agreement for the use of school district
facilities for city recreation programs and the City manages the facilities at Rotary Park
which is located at the Kerman-Floyd Elementary school campus. Table 15 summarizes
the sports facilities on school grounds.

Other Area Recreation and Open Space Facilities
Portuguese Hall: The Portuguese Hall is a meeting hall with banquet facilities located on
C Street between Madera Avenue and Sixth Street.
Regional Parks Facilities
There are several regional parks that are within driving distance to Kerman. Generally
speaking, at a maximum, most people are willing to travel thirty minutes to get to a
regional park facility, and possibly one hour if there was some type of event scheduled
there, such as a church gathering, family reunion, or school function. Kerman has two
regional parks operated by Fresno County within ten minutes driving time. Kearney Park
is a historic 225-acre park originally developed as the estate of Fresno County pioneer M.
Theo Kearney. This facility is located on Kearney Boulevard about seven miles east of
Kerman. The park contains the former home of Kearney, which is operated as a museum.
It is lavishly landscaped with mature trees and shrubs. The park has picnic facilities,
tennis courts, soccer fields horseshoe pits, two softball fields and four playground areas.

Skaggs Bridge Park is located about seven miles north of Kerman where Madera Avenue
(State Highway 145) crosses the San Joaquin River. The park includes 17 acres on the
bank of the San Joaquin River. It includes a large grassy area suitable for picnicking,
softball and other open-field play. Skaggs Bridge Park has been suggested as the western
anchor of the San Joaquin River parkway.
Roeding Park, operated by the City of Fresno is located about fifteen miles east of
Kerman. This 157-acre regional park includes Chaffee Zoological Gardens, Rotary
Playland (an amusement park with rides), boating and fishing lakes, Storyland (children's
play area with buildings, sculptures and landscaping based on popular fairy tales). There
are also picnic tables, barbeque pits and tennis courts.
The Fresno West Golf Course is an 18-hole course located on Whitesbridge about ten
miles west of Kerman, while a new golf course, Running Horse, is currently under
development that is also located on Whitesbridge about 10 miles west of Kerman. The
Mendota Wildlife Area is a multi-purpose state wildlife area located about eighteen miles
west of Kerman on the south side of Whitesbridge Road. This facility was first
established in 1954 as a habitat area for wildlife - primarily migrating waterfoul. Hunting
is permitted at certain times and some areas are grazed by cattle. Additional land
acquisitions since 1954 have increased Mendota Wildlife Area to over 12,000 acres.
Two state ecological reserves also lie west of Kerman. The Kerman Ecological Reserve
is located seven miles west of Kerman on the north side of Whitesbridge Road and covers
over 1,700 acres. Alkali Sink Ecological Reserve is located 12 miles west of Kerman on
the south side of Whitesbridge Road and covers over 900 acres. These reserves were
established to preserve native habitat - human use is generally not encouraged. However,
the value of these sites in preserving the valley as it once was is significant. Map 10
shows the general location of regional parks, recreation and reserve facilities.
Conservation, Open Space, Parks and Recreation: Future Needs
A primary objective of this Element is the establishment of criteria that will guide the
acquisition and development of future open space areas. These standards should be
realistic and represent the actual amount of area and facilities necessary to meet the needs
and desires of the community. These open spaces can be provided in a variety of ways,
and do not need to be under the control of the City to meet Kerman's needs.
State Government Code Section 66477 (b) requires a minimum of three acres of open
space for every one thousand residents. Each jurisdiction can require that a maximum of
five acres of open space be set aside per one thousand residents if the current land use
exceeds the three acres per thousand standard. Presently, Kerman has a total of 41.1
acres of developed parkland. With a current (2007) estimated population of 12,000
persons, Kerman has approximately 3.4 acres of park land per one thousand residents.
To meet the city’s recently established goal of four acres of parkland per thousand

residents, the acreage of parkland must be increased over time to meet the growing
population.
Projections of a community's open space and park needs involves many factors.
Population, income, education, accessibility, and age must all be considered in
determining the correct amount of open space/parks for a community. In this case more
is not necessarily better. Park acquisition must strike a balance between use and the
maintenance available to sustain the park. Generally speaking, city parks cost
approximately $7,000 to 8,000 acre per year to maintain. A city may have 10 acres of
open space per 1,000 persons; however, if this acreage is not maintained properly, its
value as usable open space will be greatly diminished. As Kerman acquires more
parkland, it must also dedicate the resources to adequately maintain that land.
Americans today are spending more of their time in recreation leisure activities than ever
before. This emphasis has created a much higher demand than ever for quality open
space, parks and recreation facilities. In response to this, cities must designate areas for
such uses, before development occurs.
Parkland
In order to determine the type, location and amount of parkland that will be required by
Kerman within the 20-year planning period, population projections are required. Two
population projections (low and high) are displayed in Table 16. The table shows that as
population increases, so does the need for facilities and programs. Table 16 also shows
the required number of acres of parkland for each of the projections listed.

The ability to forecast population growth allows for the planned acquisition and
development of park sites. While State standards require a minimum of three acres per
one thousand residents, Kerman has recently established a goal of four acres per thousand

residents. To accomplish this, facilities must be planned, developed, and maintained to
ensure adequate recreational facilities for existing and future residents.
Accessibility
Another important factor in the planning of future parks is to insure that parks are
accessible to all citizens of the community. For instance, although a city may currently
meet the standards regarding the amount of parkland required; the existing park sites may
not be easily accessible from all areas of the community.
Map 9 shows the location of existing City-owned parks. Generally, a community park
will have a one-half mile service area, and a neighborhood park has a one-quarter mile
radius service area.
ISSUES, POLICIES AND ACTION PROGRAMS
This portion of the Element incorporates policies into implementing action programs.
These policies are a guide to the future development of parks and recreation facilities as
well as the preservation of Kerman's natural resources.
The first part of the Plan is the identification of issues relating to conservation, open
space, parks and recreation facilities. The second part is the identification of policies that
will guide future decisions regarding these issues. The third part of the Plan is the action
program. These programs will serve to implement the policies. For example, the action
program will provide a framework for the development of future capital improvement
programs and department budgets.
GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND ACTION PROGRAM
The following goals, have been used as a guideline in the preparation of this Element:
1.      CONSERVE, RESTORE, AND ENHANCE SIGNIFICANT NATURAL,

A. AIR QUALITY
The City of Kerman exceeds two important air pollution standards - ozone and particulate
matter. As growth occurs, more smog is produced by fossil fuel burning and emissions
from factories. The City must encourage development that will minimize vehicular
emissions by providing an adequate circulation system.
1. POLICY:            Participate in the regional planning efforts to meet air quality goals
                      by working to improve air quality for the entire planning area.
   ACTION:            The planning and public works departments will send proposed
                      development plans to the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
                      Control District for review of potential air pollution impacts.
2. POLICY:            Consider traffic flow in the planning of residential, commercial
                      and industrial developments.
   ACTION:            The planning and engineering divisions will review all new
                      projects to insure that traffic flow is not unnecessarily impeded,
                      thereby causing increased vehicle-related air emissions.
3. POLICY:            Maintain adequate roadway levels of service (LOS) to avoid
                      congestion which contributes to the air pollution problem.
   ACTION:            The Public Works department will review all proposed
                      development projects to insure that roadway service levels do not
                      fall below Level C for arterials and collectors and Level B for
                      intersections. The department will utilize gas tax and
                      transportation funds to maintain these transportation standards.
4. POLICY:            Develop an organized and efficient circulation system to reduce
                      vehicle trips in the planning area, idling time, intersection delays,
                      and other emissions-producing activities.

                       adopted Circulation Element.
5. POLICY:             The City shall encourage residents to use alternative modes of
                       transportation.
    ACTION:            The City will seek funds to implement the city-wide bikepath
                       system consistent with the Circulation Element map.
B. WATER QUALITY AND CONSERVATION
The City of Kerman obtains its water supply from a vast aquifer underlying the San
Joaquin Valley. The quantity of water appears to be adequate; however, there have been
some quality problems particularly related to uranium content. Certain stratas of the
water table underlying Kerman are unfit for domestic purposes due to the contamination
problem. The City has been required to drill several new wells recently to obtain usable
water. In the future, Kerman must provide for long-range community water needs and
protect water quality and quantity. It must also maximize the efficient use and
conservation of the community's water resources.
1. POLICY:             Promote a community awareness program that will educate the
                       community in water-saving methodologies at the home and the
                       work place.
    ACTION:            The Public Works department will provide the community with
                       information brochures containing water-saving techniques.
                       Further the department should prepare a Water Conservation
                       Ordinance for adoption by the City Council.
2. POLICY:             Require the use of native and drought-tolerant new landscaping in
                       existing and future parks.
    ACTION:            Implementation of the City's Water Conservation Ordinance
                       shall require the use of native and drought-tolerant species.
3. POLICY:             Allow for adequate groundwater recharge by developing storm
                       ponding and retention basins where feasible. In some areas these
                       ponds or basins can be incorporated into a recreational area or used
                       as wildlife habitat area.
    ACTION:            The Engineering Department shall implement the policies of
                       this Element with regard to locations of future park/pond basins.

4. POLICY:              The City should develop a secondary water source system (“purple
                        pipe system”) that can be incorporated into new development in
                        order to use less potable water for the irrigation of parks, schools
                        and public landscaping.
C. HISTORICAL RESOURCES
Although the City of Kerman does not have any structures designated as "historic" by the
Fresno County Historical Society, there are some architecturally significant structures
that enhance Kerman's identity. Several structures along Madera Avenue, between
California Avenue and "G" Street display an interesting architectural character. These
buildings, in contrast to newer commercial development, come right out to the back of
the sidewalk, helping to create a pedestrian shopping atmosphere. Contrast this with
most new commercial development where a parking lot often surrounds the building.
1. POLICY:              Work with developers and architects in creating new buildings and
                        renovating old buildings in a manner that is sensitive to the
                        architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood.
ACTION:                 a. The Planning Department, through the site plan review process
                        shall encourage project design that complements the character of
                        the surrounding neighborhood. The Department shall revise
                        application forms to require applicants to state how their project
                        "fits in" with the character and architecture of the surrounding
                        area.
D. OPEN SPACE RESOURCES
The City of Kerman and its surroundings have locally significant natural resources that
must be preserved. Chief among these natural resources are the surrounding agricultural
lands and the city's outdoor recreation areas. As the city grows, increased pressure to
develop these areas can result in conflicts which may lead to the permanent loss of these
resources. The City will designate some of these areas for open space uses so that these
precious resources can be conserved.
1. POLICY:              Preserve and protect agricultural lands as a means for providing
                        open space and for the managed production of resources.
    ACTION:             a. The City of Kerman should consider the option of using the
                        purchase of agricultural conservation easements on land of at
                        least equal quality and size as partial compensation for the direct
                        loss of agricultural land, as well as for the partial compensation

                 for growth inducing and cumulative impacts on agricultural land.
   :             b. This policy will be implemented through adoption of the Land
                 Use Element and Land Use map.
                 c. The Planning Department shall conduct an annual review of
                 cancelled Williamson Act contracts and development proposals on
                 agricultural land within the City Limits and Sphere of Influence.
2. POLICY:       Develop buffers and transition areas between urban uses and
                 agricultural land to reduce incompatibility issues that are
                 associated with cultivation, pest control and harvesting of crops.
   ACTION:       Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use map will
                 provide the implementation of this policy.
3. POLICY:       Explore with owners of agricultural parcels that are not within the
                 2027 growth boundary of Kerman's Land Use Element the
                 possibility of entering the agricultural preserve program.
   ACTION:       Adoption of the Land Use Element will provide the
                 implementation of this policy.
4. POLICY:       Promote infilling and increase overall residential densities in the
                 City of Kerman to reduce the rate of urbanization of surrounding
                 agricultural lands.
   ACTION:       Adoption of the Land Use Element will provide the
                 implementation of this policy.
5. POLICY:       Establish and maintain "hard edges" around Kerman that define
                 where urbanization stops and agricultural open space begins.
   ACTION:       Where appropriate, the City will discourage zoning requests in
                 the Sphere of Influence and surrounding County areas to permit
                 further parcelization for development of large lot residential
                 purposes i.e.; ranchettes. The City will also implement the
                 annexation policy described in the Land Use Element (Policy C-3).

E. DESIGNATION OF ADEQUATE FACILITIES
The City's General Plan must designate adequate recreational facilities for future
development. The Land Use Element and this Element must provide locations for the
future development of conservation, open space, parks and recreation facilities. If
adequate sites are not designated in advance, the City will continue to grow with no
property set aside for these uses.
1. POLICY:              Maintain compliance with adopted City park standards as the City
                        grows.
    ACTION:             The City shall review and, if necessary, increase its park impact
                        fees in order to insure that it achieves its adopted ratio of 4 acres
                        of parkland per 1,000 people.
2. POLICY:              Acquire and develop adequate park sites to serve future City
                        growth.
    ACTION:             The City shall use park development impact fees towards
                        acquiring and developing new park sites.
3. POLICY:              Provide a variety of park sites and recreational facilities to
                        accommodate the City's diverse population.
    ACTION:             Adoption of this Element will provide implementation of this
                        item.
4. POLICY:              Acquire park sites in the north and east parts of Kerman within the
                        planning area. Also, work with KUSD in order to maximize the
                        joint use of space and facilities
    ACTION:             Adoption of this Element and the Land Use Element will
                        provide implementation of this item.
5. POLICY:              Plan for the acquisition of parks prior to urban growth and
                        development. These lands may be acquired and left vacant until
                        funding for development is available.
    ACTION:             Adoption of this Element and the Land Use Element will
                        provide implementation of this item.
6. POLICY:              Encourage private or commercial development of recreational
                        opportunities such as racquetball courts, golf, commercial softball,
                        etc., that are available to the public.

    ACTION:      The City will encourage the development of private recreation
                 facilities.
7. POLICY:       Work with all levels of government and private sources toward the
                 acquisition and development of a regional park in Kerman. The
                 Regional Park should be within the new Sphere of Influence lines
                 or immediately adjacent and should consist of 35 to 45 acres. The
                 City should examine several locations to judge the most
                 appropriate based upon several factors: cost of property,
                 willingness of property to donate, infrastructure availability, direct
                 access from major collector streets or arterials, access with certain
                 buffer zones and cost to develop. The City should do a study of
                 several sites and present the study to the Planning Commission for
                 a recommendation of three potential sites.
    ACTION:      a. Large recreational parks and regional parks shall be separated
                 from residential uses by solid masonry walls and a buffer zone to
                 prevent conflicts of noise and traffic in residential neighborhoods.
                 b. The City will plan and work towards the funding of a future
                 regional park and recreation facility (35 to 50 acres)
9. POLICY:       Develop an "adopt a park" program throughout the City.
    ACTION:      The parks and recreation department shall implement an "adopt
                 a park" program in which private citizens or organizations (i.e.;
                 service clubs, churches, scouting groups, etc.) help with the
                 development of open space, parks, and recreation facilities. The
                 City should continue its practice of engaging other local funding
                 sources and volunteers in park developments.
10. POLICY:      The City shall continue to seek out donations of land or money
                 towards park facilities. The City may announce these efforts in
                 recreation schedules, publications, plaques or notices at existing
                 parks, etc.
    ACTION:      The City shall develop a policy of public notice of construction
                 of lighted active recreational use lights at all new “Active Parks”
                 of 5 acres or more.
11. POLICY:      Coordinate efforts to acquire and develop park and recreational

                       facilities and programs.
    ACTION:            The City of Kerman shall coordinate the development of
                       recreation facilities with the Kerman Unified School District.
F. PARK LOCATION AND DESIGN
Active park sites and passive open space areas should be accessible to all segments of the
community (for specific locations of future parks see, "Plan Recommendations" on page
67.)
1. POLICY:             Locate future parks in such a way as to be accessible and available
                       to all the citizens of Kerman.
    ACTION:            Adoption of this Element and the Land Use Map and its policies
                       will provide implementation of this policy. The City must observe
                       this policy when considering the location of new parks.
2. POLICY:             Locate park and recreational facilities so that they do not conflict
                       with adjacent land uses.
    ACTION:            Adoption of this Element and its policies will provide
                       implementation of this policy. Factors to consider include streets
                       with high traffic, industrial uses, and noise sensitive uses.
3. POLICY:             Fencing and landscaped buffers shall be used to minimize any
                       negative impacts a park may have on an adjacent residential
                       neighborhood.
    ACTION:            The Planning Department will review all park plans to insure
                       that any negative impacts on surrounding properties are
                       minimized. Additionally, the public hearing required under Policy
                       #1 will give neighboring property owners the opportunity to voice
                       their concerns on this matter.
4. POLICY:             When possible, locate community parks on arterial roadways and
                       neighborhood parks on collector streets to ensure adequate access
                       for the community.
    ACTION:            Adoption of this Element and the Land Use Map will provide
                       implementation of this policy.

    ACTION:            The Building Department shall review plans for proposed
                       facilities for compliance with handicap/accessibility requirements
                       of the Uniform Building Code.
6. POLICY:             Parks and other facilities that may require a significant amount of
                       night lighting, such as ball parks and tennis courts, should be
                       designed in such a way as to minimize the impacts of lighting on
                       the surrounding neighborhood.
    ACTION:            The City Planning, Public Works and Engineering Departments
                       shall review lighting schemes for all projects.
7. POLICY:             Park design shall consider the incorporate the use of berms and
                       small hills where appropriate to provide relief to the otherwise flat
                       terrain of Kerman.
    ACTION: City staff shall review the grading plans of all park sites to
                       consider that areas of bermed landscaping are provided. Earth
                       moved from ponding basins can provide a ready source for berms
                       and hills.
8. POLICY:             Parking lots in new City parks shall be landscaped per current City
                       Zoning Ordinance parking lot landscaping requirements.
                       Furthermore, these parking lots can be used as an example of
                       Zoning Ordinance parking standards for private developers.
    ACTION The Planning Department shall review parking lot design in new
                       parks to insure that they meet Zoning Ordinance requirements.
G. PARK ACQUISITION AND FUNDING
Issues
Adequate funds are the major obstacle in developing and operating park and recreation
facilities. With the competition for state and federal dollars, there is a need to find new
and expanded sources of funds for development. Cities must work to develop more
effective finance mechanisms to meet the growing needs of the community. Kerman's
main source of park funding is the City's "Quimby Act Fee", Park Acquisition Impact
Fees and Park Development Impact Fees) The Quimby and other fees permits the City to
levy a fee against each new dwelling unit. Funds derived from this fee are placed into an
                                            4-24
   2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                      Chapter 4: Conservation, Open Space,
                                                                Parks and Recreation Element
   account used solely for park acquisition. Development Impact Fees are utilized for
   development.
   Other financing mechanisms available for park acquisition and development include: 1)
   Proposition 70 monies, 2) Redevelopment tax increment funds (KUSD/RDA
   Recreational Facilities Increment) and 3) Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 allows
   the creation of assessment districts.
   Passage of Proposition 84, along with earlier park bond propositions (such as Prop 40),
   has made monies available for the construction of park, educational and recreation
   facilities, and acquisition of lands for parks, nature preserves and open space. Some of
   these funds will automatically accrue to the City of Kerman while other funds are
   awarded through a competitive selection process. Redevelopment Law allows cities to
   utilize tax increment revenue to finance land acquisition for public purposes; construction
   of public facilities, such as parks, sewers and streets; and administration.
   The Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 can be used to finance the construction of
   landscaping, lighting and park and recreational improvements, and the maintenance and
   servicing of any of these improvements. The Act provides for the creation of a district
   which can be broken down into zones. A zone can be exempted from the district or
   assessed differently based on the level of benefit to properties within the zone. This
   financing mechanism is an excellent means of maintaining and servicing the common
   open space and recreation improvements in each residential development. Another
   option would be to consider forming a maintenance district which encompasses the entire
   community; however, the funds generated would only apply to the maintenance of public
   improvements as specified by the City.
   1. POLICY:               Kerman shall continue to require developers to pay park impact
                            fees (Quimby fees & Park Development Impact Fees) or dedicate
                            land in lieu thereof. The State of California adopted Section 11546
                            of the Business and Professional Code which allows a jurisdiction
                            to require the dedication of parkland by a subdivision developer, or
                            in lieu of dedication, to pay a fee of equivalent value.
2. POLICY:                  Ensure that the City of Kerman receives its full share of federal
                            and state grant funds including matching and competitive grants.
                            The City shall also seek out available charitable contributions for
                            parks and open space facilities. This could include donations of
                            property in conjunction with new residential development.
   ACTION:                  The City shall annually review its fees for recreational
                            programs, park lands and rentals to insure that they are sufficient to
                            finance future park needs. Areas that could be considered for
                            review include:

                 rallies.
3. POLICY:       Insure that the City of Kerman receives its full share of federal and
                 state grant funds including matching and competitive grants. The
                 City shall also seek out available charitable contributions for parks
                 and open space facilities. This could include donations of property
                 in conjunction with new residential development.
ACTION:          The City shall apply for available state and federal grants as
                 they become available.
                 b. Kerman should explore securing gifts from foundations and
                 individuals to support special interest recreation programs or park
                 projects.
4. POLICY:       Kerman should explore the financing of park and recreational
                 facilities through the use of tax-increment funds, generated by the
                 sale of tax-allocation bonds.
ACTION:          The City shall conduct a feasibility study of financing park and
                 recreation facilities by the sale of tax-allocation bonds.
5. POLICY:       Kerman should explore the opportunities to enter into joint powers
                 agreements or Facilities use agreements with other agencies to
                 share the costs of park and recreation facilities development and
                 maintenance.
ACTION:          a. Park development will include the installation of Secondary
                 Water Supply/Purple Pipe Delivery System.
                 b. The City shall continue to work with KUSD contact the
                 Kerman Unified School District and Fresno County Parks
                 Department to regarding Facilities Use Agreement to discuss a

                        districts to maintain parkways, landscaped medians .
ACTION:                 a. Where appropriate, the City shall require proposed subdivisions
                        to establish landscape and lighting districts to maintain open space
                        areas.
PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Kerman currently is currently exceeding the minimum acreage requirement
standards (3 acres per 1,000 residents) for open space with an average of 3.45 acres of
parkland per thousand residents. The document recommends the goal of preserving four
acres of parkland per thousand residents. To accomplish this, the Element is proposing
several new park locations that would continue the even distribution of open space
throughout the community. Map 9 provides the generalized locations of proposed future
conservation, open space, parks and recreation facilities.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the Conservation, Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element will provide
guidelines for the provision of convenient, well-equipped, and maintained sites and
facilities, conservation of natural resources, and a comprehensive and quality program of
recreational activities and services for all citizens of the community. The implementation
of the Plan's goals and objectives will contribute to and maintain the quality of life that
exists in the City of Kerman.

CHAPTER 5 • SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element is one of seven State-mandated elements of a city's General Plan.
Section 65302(g) of the Government Code requires cities to develop, adopt, and
implement a Safety Element as follows:
        The General Plan shall include a safety element for the protection of the
community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically
induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam
failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence and other
geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and urban fires.
Following accidents and disasters, citizens are sometimes heard to ask, "How did this
happen?" or "How can this be prevented from happening again?" or perhaps most
importantly, "What is the government's policy to prevent or respond to such
emergencies?" The Safety Element in itself can not prevent natural disasters; however, it
can provide standards that may help minimize the impacts of disasters on the human
population and structural improvements in the area. It will also provide additional
standards for planning structures that may be located in areas where there is a higher
probability, or risk, of a disaster occurring.
Safety of the citizens of Kerman must be uppermost in the minds of the local decision-
makers. This Element will provide a guideline towards developing a safer environment
for the community. Local decisions related to zoning, subdivisions, entitlement permits
and the like should be tied to this Element's identification of such hazards.
THE ELEMENT
The Safety Element is the primary vehicle for relating local safety planning to City land
use decisions. The Element's main purpose is to reduce death, injuries, property damage
and the economic and social dislocation resulting from natural hazards. In 1975, the
Legislature adopted SB 271, which made the safety element a mandatory part of the
General Plan. At that time, the element was required to include policies relating to fire
safety, flooding, and geologic hazards.
                                               5-1

2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                       Part I
                                                              Chapter 5: Safety Element
In 1984, the Legislature adopted AB 2038, which requires that the list of mandatory
safety element issues be expanded to include seismic safety. Essentially, the Legislature
took the issues previously considered in the seismic safety element and made them safety
element requirements.
While the focus of the safety element is on fire, flooding, seismic and geologic hazards, it
may also address locally relevant safety issues such as vehicle accidents, crime, power
failures, and hazardous material spills.
SAFETY ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
The Kerman Safety Element contains three primary components:
1) existing conditions;
2) community goals; and
3) issues, policies, and action programs.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Kerman is located on the floor of the central San Joaquin Valley approximately 15 miles
west of Fresno. The mountains of the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada are roughly
equidistant from Kerman, about 35 miles to the southwest and northeast, respectively.
The topography in and around Kerman is very level with a gentle, imperceptible slope to
the southwest. Elevations in the planning area vary from about 210 feet to 225 feet.
There are no natural waterways in the planning area. The largest nearby waterway of
consequence is the San Joaquin River, about ten miles north. However, there are several
irrigation canals that traverse the planning area.
Briefly discussed below are existing conditions pertaining to specific issues relating to
safety in the City of Kerman. These issues include: seismicity, public safety, fire,
flooding, and hazardous land use relationships. A more detailed description of these
issues and additional background information on Kerman is found in Part 2 of this
document.
Seismic Safety
Fresno County is comprised of nine seismic zones, as defined in the Five County Seismic
Safety Element (FCSSE). These zones are differentiated by the level of ground motion
that can reasonably be anticipated from earthquakes on the principal fault systems
affecting the five county area. The generalized location of these zones is shown on Map
                                             5-2
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                          Part I
                                                                 Chapter 5: Safety Element
14. This map shows that Kerman is located within the V1 zone. The FCSSE states that
the V1 zone:
        Includes most of the eastern San Joaquin Valley, and is characterized by a
relatively thin section of sedimentary rock overlying a granitic basement. Amplification
of shaking that would affect low to medium-rise buildings is relatively high, but the
distance to either of the faults that are the expected sources of the shaking is sufficiently
great that the effects should be minimal. The requirements of Zone II of the Uniform
Building Code should be adequate for normal facilities.
This data indicates that Kerman is located in a lower risk area in terms of earthquake
activity. Building standards contained in the Uniform Building Code for Zone II should
be adequate for protection from earthquake events in Kerman.
Earthquakes
Although Fresno County does not have any major faults within its boundaries, Kerman
has been affected by earthquakes in the past. The most notable earthquake in the area
occurred in May, 1983. An earthquake with a measured magnitude of 6.7 on the Richter
scale (Rs) occurred near the City of Coalinga about 45 miles southwest of Kerman. The
earthquake produced a ground motion which caused widespread damage to the City of
Coalinga. Although no damage was reported in Kerman, the quake was strongly felt by
local residents. The Coalinga earthquake and aftershocks were not associated with the
San Andreas Fault as most people believed, but rather, occurred in the deeply buried
Sierran Block Boundary zone, which is thought to be made up of complex thrust fault
systems.
Studies for the Chem Waste Kettleman Hills hazardous waste facility determined that the
thrust fault poses the greatest seismic threat to the region. Maximum credible
earthquakes (MCE's) from this fault have been predicted to range from 6.5 to 7.0 on the
Richter scale. The San Andreas Fault, located further to the west also poses a seismic
risk.
As stated above, the City of Kerman is located in the V1 seismic zone, which is
characterized by a relatively thin section of sedimentary rock overlying a granitic
basement. Ground motion that could result from an earthquake would be high, but the
distance to the faults that are the expected sources of the shaking is sufficiently great that
the effects should be minimal.
Police Protection
Crime prevention has become the number one issue on the minds of the public. The
increases in robbery, gang activity, graffiti, auto-theft, etc. have led the public's request
for more police officers on the street. In 2007, Kerman had eighteen full time police
officers, or about 1.43 officers per 1,000 persons. The City strives to maintain a target
                                               5-3
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                         Part I
                                                               Chapter 5: Safety Element
ratio of 1 officers per 700 residents. In order to maintain this service level for the years
2017 and 2027, Kerman will be required to staff 33 and 58 officers respectively
(estimates use high population projections).
Fire Hazards
The planning area is characterized by both the urbanized portions of Kerman and
surrounding agricultural fields. The City is served by the North Central Fire Protection
District. The District maintains its headquarters on the west side of Kerman. This station
is staffed by two full-time personnel and two medical personnel. In 2005, 75 to 82
percent of calls to the fire district consisted of medical emergencies. The urbanized
portions of Kerman are served by City water lines for fire suppression and domestic
purposes. Water pressure in most areas is about 40-55 pounds per square inch. Further
information regarding fire safety is included in Part 2 of the General Plan.
Flooding
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, a federal agency charged with mapping
flood prone areas throughout the United Sates, identifies no area within Kerman as being
flood prone - subject to floodwaters from a 100-year intensity storm. However, certain
areas within the city are subject to localized flooding and ponding of storm waters.
Furthermore, new development, if not designed properly, can magnify drainage
problems. New development must conform to standards and plans contained in the
Kerman Stormwater Drainage Master Plan. The Plan directs the location of new
stormwater drainage lines, mains, and ponding facilities.
Hazardous Land Use Relationships
Identification of existing hazardous land uses is also important to the safety of the
citizens of Kerman. There are several uses within the City that generate a "risk" factor.
These uses include industrial operations on the south side of the city, the state highways
which carry large volumes of truck traffic, the railroad, and the wastewater treatment
plant. Relationships between land use types must be considered, especially when
locating residential development.
The Land Use Element has eliminated most of the potential land use conflicts associated
with the above uses by insuring that surrounding properties are designated for uses that
will not conflict with the use. For instance, new industrial development will be permitted
only adjacent to, and south of the railroad tracks. This area is downwind of all residential
development in Kerman. The industrial area, in turn, provides a buffer between
Kerman's residential areas and the wastewater treatment plant, further reducing potential
land use conflicts.
A hazardous land use relationship that is more difficult to address involves trucks
carrying hazardous materials along the State highways. Kerman has two State highways
                                               5-4
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                        Part I
                                                                 Chapter 5: Safety Element
(Highways 145 and 180) that carry a large amount of truck traffic. It is difficult to
ascertain the number of trucks carrying hazardous waste. The American Avenue landfill
lies about seven miles southwest of Kerman. Chemical Waste, Inc. operates a hazardous
waste collection facility at Kettleman City, about 55 miles south of Kerman. The Land
Use Element has addressed this issue by directing residential development away from the
state highways.
COMMUNITY GOALS
The following goals have been used as a guideline in the preparation of this Element:
1.      PREVENT THE LOSS OF LIFE AND PERSONAL PROPERTY DUE TO
        NATURAL AND MAN-MADE HAZARDS, INCLUDING EARTHQUAKES,
        FLOODS AND FIRES.
2.      SAFEGUARD THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES OF THE CITY FROM
        LOSSES DUE TO NATURAL AND MAN-MADE HAZARDS, INCLUDING
        EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS AND FIRES.
3.      PROMOTE CITIZEN AWARENESS OF THE IMPLICATION OF NATURAL
        AND MAN-MADE HAZARDS WHICH EXIST IN THE REGION.
4.      SAFEGUARD PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY
        BY EDUCATING AND INVOLVING THE PUBLIC IN ALL TH TENETS OF
        COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND
        THEREBY REDUCING CRIME.
ISSUES, POLICIES, AND ACTION PROGRAMS
This portion of the Element establishes policies and implementing action programs that
will implement the Safety Element's goals - a safe environment for the citizens of
Kerman.
The first part of the Plan identifies issues relating to safety in the City of Kerman. The
second part contains policies that will guide future decisions regarding these issues. The
third part consists of an Action Program. These programs will serve to implement the
policies. For example, hazards related to substandard buildings are an issue. The action
program will provide a program for the targeting of substandard buildings for renovation
or removal.

A. SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC SAFETY
The City of Kerman is located in an area that is seismically active, however, the potential
for dangerous seismic activity is slight. The Five Counties Seismic Safety Element
recommends that new construction conform to standards for Zone 2, as defined by the
Uniform Building Code.
1. POLICY:             The City shall insure that all new and rehabilitated structures are
                       constructed to meet adequate building standards.
   ACTIONS:            a. The City of Kerman shall adopt building code standards for
                       Seismic Zone 2 as described in the Uniform Building Code.
                       b. The City shall continue the abatement/rehabilitation of un-
                       reinforced masonry buildings. The City shall use funding
                       programs contained in the Housing Element to assist qualified low
                       income families in the process of rehabilitating their homes or
                       renting or purchasing a new dwelling.
2. POLICY:             The City shall review the State Mining and Geology Board's
                       publications which define Special Studies Zones for areas along
                       fault lines.
   ACTION:             The Planning Department shall review State Mining and
                       Geology maps as they are updated.
3. POLICY:             The City of Kerman shall continue the abatement/rehabilitation of
                       dangerous buildings as defined by the Uniform Housing Code.
   ACTION:             The building department shall identify dangerous buildings and
                       target them for abatement or rehabilitation, through the process
                       outlined in the Uniform Housing Code.
B. POLICE PROTECTION
Crime prevention and public safety is the most important function of a city to many
citizens. Kerman has aimed to maintain a ratio of one police officer per 700 residents.
The City has fallen slightly behind this goal recently. Concern has been voiced that new
development has not been required to pay its fair share in terms of police services.
1. POLICY:             The City shall actively involve citizens in crime prevention and
                       public safety awareness.
   ACTION:             The City shall continue operation of the Neighborhood Watch,

                       Housing (CFMFH) program, and establish the Special
                       Investigations Division (SID) to attack drug abuse and gang
                       issues.
2. POLICY:             To ensure that the police department has the depth of personnel to
                       operate the necessary programs (listed above), Kerman should
                       maintain a ratio of one officer per 700 citizens.
   ACTION:             The City shall increase its sales tax base in order to fund
                       adequate police personnel and equipment. .
C. FIRE SAFETY
Kerman has established a good record in terms of fire safety. The entire planning area is
generally located within three minutes of the Kerman station of the North Central Fire
District. The City Council recently enacted legislation requiring new or remodeled
structures over 5,000 square feet to install fire sprinklers. The City has established Fire
Development Impact Fees to fund the potential development of an additional Fire Station
and equipment in the Kerman area to address the future impacts of growth.
1. POLICY:             The City of Kerman shall coordinate with the North Central Fire
                       District through Kerman’s site plan review process and the State’s
                       environmental review process to insure that future development
                       does not impose a burden on their services. North Central, with
                       input and review from the City, should establish a 20-year Capital
                       Improvement Plan (CIP) for a fire ladder truck and potential fire
                       station/equipment in the Kerman area. The City should continue to
                       charge Development Impact Fees for new growth to accommodate
                       the CIP.
   ACTION:             The City of Kerman shall coordinate with the North Central
                       Fire District through Kerman's site plan review process and the
                       State's environmental review process to insure that future
                       development does not impose a burden on their services. North
                       Central with input and review from the City should establish a 20-
                       year Capital improvement plan for a fire ladder truck and
                       potential fire station/equipment in the Kerman area.
2. POLICY:             The City of Kerman shall coordinate with North Central Fire
                       District to provide prevention and public education to the residents
                       to reduce the demand for fire protection services.

   ACTION:              The City shall contact the Fire District to initiate a fire
                        prevention education program with the Kerman-Floyd School
                        District.
3. POLICY:              The City shall require that yards and lots be maintained free of
                        weeds and debris.
   ACTION:              The North Central Fire District shall send annual abatement
                        letters to property owners who have properties where weed and
                        debris build-up pose a public safety problem.
4. POLICY:              The City shall work to improve the response capabilities of
                        emergency crews.
   ACTION:              a. During the review of subdivisions, the City shall ensure the new
                        street names are continuations of existing streets for streets that
                        are aligned, and that addresses are logically assigned. The Public
                        Works Department shall periodically check street signs to ensure
                        they are clearly visible and legible.
                        b. During subdivision review the City shall ensure that all
                        subdivisions, except for cul-de-sac streets have a minimum of two
                        egress/ingress points.
                        c. Development impact fees shall be charged on all new
                        development for construction and equipment for a second fire
                        station in the Kerman area to insure a 5 minute response time.
D. HAZARDOUS LAND USE RELATIONSHIPS
Relationships between land use types should also be considered especially when locating
residential development and other sensitive land uses, such as schools, hospitals, and
convalescent homes. There are many hazardous uses that would not be appropriate
adjacent to sensitive land uses. For example, the Land Use Element will ensure that new
residential development is not permitted south of California Avenue. This will prevent
conflicts with the industrial uses and commercial service uses and the Southern Pacific
Railroad. Residential development will also be discouraged along the state highways in
order to reduce exposure to hazardous materials, carried by trucks and excessive noise
levels.
1. POLICY:              Residential development in close proximity to industrial zones and
                        the wastewater treatment plant shall be avoided. Development
                        adjacent to the wastewater treatment plant shall be limited to
                        industrial uses.

   ACTION:             Adoption of the Land Use Element prevents residential
                       development from encroaching too close to industrial zones and
                       limits development adjacent to the wastewater treatment plant to
                       industrial uses.
2. POLICY:             Residential land uses shall be limited adjacent to State Highway
                       145 and State Highway 180.
   ACTION:             Adoption of the Land Use Element and Land Use Map prevents
                       residential development from fronting onto State Highways 180
                       and 145, south of California and north of Whitesbridge Road.
3. POLICY:             Businesses that use, produce, or generate any type of hazardous
                       materials shall be conducted in a safe manner.
   ACTION:             The City shall require that proposals for developments using,
                       producing, or generating hazardous materials, such as cold-
                       storage facilities include an emergency preparedness plan. All
                       new industrial uses shall be required to prepare and file a
                       Business Plan as required by the Fresno County Health
                       Department.
CONCLUSION
There are a variety of hazards that can adversely affect life and property in Kerman,
however, compared to many other communities in California, Kerman is a relatively
"safe" place to live. Occurrences of natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and
floods cannot be controlled by the City, however, Kerman can minimize the impacts of
these events by preparing for them in advance. Implementation of adequate building
standards, appropriate land use designations, adequate fire protection services and
preparation of emergency plans are just a few ways in which the City can provide a safer
environment for its citizens. Implementation of the Safety Element's policies and action
programs will contribute to and maintain the quality of life that exists in the City of
Kerman.

CHAPTER 6 • NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of the General Plan is a planning document which provides a policy
framework for addressing potential noise impacts encountered in the planning process.
The content of a Noise Element and the methods used in its preparation have been
determined by the requirements of Section 65302 (f) of the California Government Code
and by Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of the General Plan
adopted and published by the California Office of Noise Control (ONC) in 1976. The
ONC Guidelines require that major noise sources and areas containing noise-sensitive
land uses be identified and quantified by preparing generalized noise exposure contours
for current and projected conditions.
According to the Government Code requirements, noise exposure information should be
included in a Noise Element for the following major noise sources:
        1.      Highways and freeways
        2.      Primary arterials and major local streets
        3.      Railroad operations
        4.      Aircraft and airport operations
        5.      Local industrial facilities
        6.      Other stationary sources
Noise-sensitive uses identified by the Government Code and by the City of Kerman
include the following:
        1.      Residential development
        2.      Schools
        3.      Hospitals, nursing homes
        4.      Churches
        5.      Libraries
The Noise Element is directed at minimizing future noise conflicts. A noise ordinance,
on the other hand, is directed at resolving existing noise conflicts. A noise ordinance
may be used to address noise levels generated by existing industrial, commercial,
                                             6-1

                                                               Chapter 6: Noise Element
agricultural and residential uses, which are not regulated by federal or state noise level
standards. The regulation of noise sources such as traffic on public roadways, railroad
line operations and aircraft in flight is preempted by existing federal and/or state
regulations, meaning that such sources generally may not be addressed by a noise
ordinance. The Noise Element addresses the prevention of noise conflicts from all of
these sources.
Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
The Noise Element is related to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation and Open Space
Elements of the General Plan. Recognition of the interrelationship of noise and these
four mandated elements is necessary to prepare an integrated general plan and to initiate
changes which will reduce noise exposure to acceptable levels in areas where noise may
presently exceed the levels set forth by the adopted policies of the Noise Element. The
relationship between these elements is briefly discussed below:
1.      Land Use:      An objective of the Noise Element is to provide noise exposure
information for use in the Land Use Element. When integrated with the Noise Element,
the Land Use Element will show acceptable land uses in relation to existing and projected
noise levels.
2.      Housing:       The Housing Element considers the provision of adequate sites for
new housing and standards for housing stock. Since residential land uses are noise-
sensitive, the noise exposure information of the Noise Element must be considered when
planning the locations of new housing. The State Noise Insulation Standards may
influence the locations and construction costs of multi-family dwellings, which should be
considered by the Housing Element.
3.      Circulation: The circulation system, which is a major source of noise, must be
correlated with the Land Use Element. This is especially true for roadways which carry
significant numbers of trucks. Noise exposure will thus be a decisive factor in the
location and design of new transportation facilities, and in the mitigation of noise
produced by existing facilities upon existing and planned land uses.
4.      Open Space: Excessive noise adversely affects the enjoyment of recreational
pursuits in designated open space, particularly in areas where quiet is a valued part of the
recreational experience. Thus, noise exposure should be considered in planning for this
kind of open space use. Conversely, open space can be used to buffer noise-sensitive
uses from noise sources by providing setbacks and visual screening.
Noise And Its Effects On People
Appendix A provides a discussion of the fundamentals of noise assessment, the effects of
noise on people and criteria for acceptable noise exposure, and is a reference for use by

the City during the review of documents or proposals which refer to the measurement and
effects of noise.
Definitions
1.      A-Weighted Sound Level: All sound levels referred to in this policy document
are in A-weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and very high
frequencies of sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most community noise
standards utilize A-weighting, as it provides a high degree of correlation with human
annoyance and health effects.
2.      Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The average equivalent sound level
during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately five decibels to sound
levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and ten decibels to sound levels in the
night before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m.
3.      Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The average equivalent sound level
during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night
after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m.
4.      Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): The sound level containing the same total energy
as a time varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over 1, 8
and 24-hour sample periods.
5.      New Development: Projects requiring land use or building permits, but excluding
remodeling or additions to existing structures.
6. Noise-Sensitive Land Use: Residential land uses, transient lodging, schools, libraries,
churches, hospitals and nursing homes.
7.      Outdoor Activity Areas: Patios, decks, balconies, outdoor eating areas,
swimming pool areas, yards of dwellings and other areas which have been designated for
outdoor activities and recreation.
8.      Stationary Noise Source: Any fixed or mobile source not preempted from local
control by existing federal or state regulations. Examples of such sources include
agricultural, industrial and commercial facilities and vehicle movements on private
property.
9.      Transportation Noise Source: Traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations
and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by existing
federal or state regulations. However, the effects of noise from transportation sources
may be controlled by regulating the location and design of adjacent land uses.

EXISTING AND FUTURE NOISE ENVIRONMENT
Overview of Sources
Based on discussions with City staff, the requirements of the Government Code and field
studies conducted during the preparation of this Noise Element, it was determined that
traffic on local roadways is a potentially significant source of community noise within the
City of Kerman. Roadways of concern include State Routes (SR) 145 (Madera Avenue)
and 180 (Whitesbridge Road). The Westside Branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad
also passes through the City, and there are two stationary sources which have been
identified by the City as potentially-significant sources of noise within the community.
Major noise sources identified for study are indicated on Map 8.
Methods Used to Develop Noise Exposure Information
According to the Government Code and ONC Guidelines, noise exposure contours
should be developed in terms of the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn) or Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) for transportation-related noise sources. Both of these
descriptors represent the weighted energy noise level for a 24-hour day after inclusion of
a 10 dB penalty for noise levels occurring at night between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and
7:00 a.m. The CNEL descriptor also includes a penalty of about 4.8 dB for noise levels
occurring during the evening hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. The CNEL descriptor
was developed for the quantification of aircraft noise, and its use is required when
preparing noise exposure maps for airports within the State of California. The CNEL and
Ldn descriptors are generally considered to be equivalent to each other for most
community noise environments within 1.0 dB. The Ldn descriptor has been used in this
Noise Element to quantify noise from the above-described major noise sources.
Analytical noise modeling techniques were used to develop generalized Ldn contours for
existing and future conditions. Analytical noise modeling techniques generally make use
of source-specific data, including descriptions of noise-generating equipment or
activities, hours of operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from
source operations. Analytical methods have been developed for many environmental
noise sources, including roadways, railroad line operations, railroad yard operations,
industrial plants and aircraft/airport operations. Such methods will produce reliable
results as long as data inputs and assumptions are valid for the sources being studied.
The noise exposure information developed during the preparation of the Noise Element
does not include all conceivable sources of industrial, commercial or agricultural noise
within the City, but rather focuses on the existing sources of noise which have been
identified by the City as being significant. As the policies of this Noise Element are
applied in the future, it is likely that other potentially-significant sources will be
identified.

Roadways
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model
(FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to develop Ldn contours for SR 145 and SR 180. The
FHWA Model is the analytical method currently favored by most state and local
agencies, including Caltrans, for highway traffic noise prediction. The model is based
upon reference energy emission levels for automobiles, medium trucks (2 axles) and
heavy trucks (3 or more axles), with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed,
roadway configuration, distance to the receiver, and the acoustical characteristics of the
site. The FHWA Model was developed to predict hourly Leq values for free-flowing
traffic conditions, and is generally considered to be accurate within + 1.5 dB. The model
assumes a clear view of traffic with no shielding at the receiver location. To predict Ldn
values, it is necessary to determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typical day and
adjust the traffic volume input data to yield an equivalent hourly traffic volume. The
Calveno traffic noise emission curves were used as recommended by Caltrans to more
accurately calculate noise levels generated by California traffic.
For all roadways being studied, existing (1992) and future (2012) annual average daily
traffic (AADT) volumes and percentages of trucks were obtained from Caltrans. The
day/night distribution of traffic was determined from hourly traffic counts performed by
Caltrans near the intersection of SR 180 and SR 145 during the weeks of April 10, 1992
on SR 145 and June 19, 1993 on SR 180. Vehicle speeds assumed during the traffic
noise modeling process were the posted vehicle speeds.
Distances from the center of the roadways to the 60 and 65 dB Ldn contours along with
input data used during the traffic noise modeling process are summarized by Table 17.

Southern Pacific Railroad
The Westside Branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad passes along the southern edge of
the central core of Kerman. According to the S.P.R.R. Trainmaster's office in Fresno,
one train per day typically passes through the City. Future estimates of railroad traffic
through Kerman were not available from the railroad. Noise levels from railroad
operations in Kerman were quantified using the analytical method developed in 1973 by
Wyle Laboratories (Wyle Laboratories Report WCR-73-5). This is the method suggested
by the California Office of Noise Control for Noise Element studies. Additionally, noise
level measurements were conducted at approximately 100 feet from the center of the
tracks near the Madera Avenue grade crossing on June 9, 1993.
The Wyle methodology calculates noise exposure based on reference noise level data for
various types of trains under different operating conditions, distance from the tracks,
speed and the characteristics of the track the trains pass over. According to the Wyle
methodology and the frequency of operation provided by the railroad, the 65 and 60 dB
Ldn contours would be located approximately 29 and 63 feet, respectively, from the
tracks. These distances are generally within the railroad right-of-way. Based on the
single train passby monitored on June 9, 1993, maximum noise levels at about 100 feet
from the tracks were about 88 dB from the warning horn and 75-80 dB from the passing
locomotive and cars. Although noise exposure as defined by the Ldn is not significant
from the railroad, some intermittent interruption of activities due to train noise may affect
persons located near the tracks.
Major Stationary Noise Sources
The production of noise is an inherent part of many industrial, commercial and
agricultural processes, even when the best available noise control technology is applied.
Noise production within an industrial or commercial facility or in close proximity to
many types of agricultural equipment is controlled indirectly by federal and state
employee health and safety regulations (OSHA and Cal-OSHA). However, exterior
noise emissions from such operations have the potential to exceed locally acceptable
standards at nearby noise-sensitive land uses.
Noise control issues focus upon two objectives: to prevent the introduction of new noise-
producing uses in a noise-sensitive area, and to prevent encroachment of noise-sensitive
land uses upon existing noise-generating facilities. The first objective can be achieved by
applying performance standards to proposed new industrial or other noise generating
uses. The second objective can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in
proximity to existing noise sources include receiver-based mitigation measures to ensure
compliance with the same performance standards.
Noise exposure information for the major stationary noise sources selected for study was
developed from operational data obtained from source operators and from noise level

measurements conducted at reference locations around the noise sources. In discussing
future operations with source operators it was apparent that too many variables exist to
allow meaningful projections of future activity or noise levels.
Following are discussions of major stationary noise sources which were identified for
study. The discussions are intended to provide generalized information concerning the
relative noise impacts of each source, and to identify specific noise sources which should
be considered in the review of development proposals where potential noise conflicts
could result. The following discussions do not represent a comprehensive accounting of
all noise sources in the city. It is probable that unidentified industries or other major
noise sources exist which generate significant noise levels and could result in noise-
related land use conflicts.
A.       Helena Chemical Company
The Helena Chemical Company plant is located south of the S.P.R.R. and west of
Vineland Avenue. The plant packages and distributes agricultural chemicals. Typical
operating hours are 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., 5 days per week. According to plant
management, the major source of noise at the plant which could affect off-site locations
is the scrubber used when bulk powder is being unloaded. Powder unloading occurs
intermittently, usually 1-2 times per day for about 30 minutes at a time.
Noise levels measured on June 19, 1993 from the scrubber were 50-52 dB north of the
S.P.R.R. along California Avenue and approximately 50 dB directly east of the plant at
Vineland Avenue. Since there was a row of rail cars parked on a siding between the plant
and the California Avenue monitoring site, it is likely that noise levels could be higher
than measured in this area. The closest existing noise-sensitive land uses to the Helena
Chemical Company plant are single-family homes located along California Avenue to the
north of the plant and a single family home and a church located on the east side of
Vineland Avenue directly east of the plant.

Community Noise Survey
A community noise survey was conducted within the City during June 1993 to document
background noise levels in areas where noise-sensitive land uses are located. Short-term
monitoring was conducted at 4 sites once during rush hour conditions (7:00 a.m. - 9:00
a.m. or 4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.) and once during mid-day conditions (9:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.)
Continuous noise monitoring was conducted at a fifth site to record the variation of noise
levels through a full 24-hour period. The data collected during the survey included the
Leq and observed maximum noise levels. Noise monitoring sites, measured noise levels
and estimated Ldn values at each site are described by Table 18. Hourly variations in

noise levels at the long-term monitoring site are shown in Table 19. Monitoring site
locations are shown on Map 8.
Review of data summarized in Table 18 and depicted by Table 19 indicated that existing
background noise levels within the City of Kerman are relatively quiet. An exception to
this occurred during the 24-hour measurement period at Site 5 between the hours of 5:00
p.m. and 7:00 p.m. However, it is believed that these levels were caused by yard or car
maintenance work in close proximity to the microphone, and that such levels are not
typical of noise-sensitive areas within the community. To preserve quiet conditions,
noise level standards and policies have been adopted to prevent degradation of the
existing noise environment as much as possible.

NOISE ELEMENT GOALS
The goals of the City of Kerman Noise Element are:
1.     TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY FROM THE HARFUL AND
       ANNOYING EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO EXCESSIVE NOISE.
2.     TO PROTECT THE ECONOMIC BASE OF THE CITY BY PREVENTING
       INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES FROM ENCROACHING UPON EXISTING
       OR PLANNED NOISE-PRODUCING USES.
3.     TO PRESERVE THE TRANQUILITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS BY
       PREVENTING NOISE-PRODUCING USES FROM ENCROACHING UPON
       EXISTING OR PLANNED NOISE-SENSITIVE USES.
4.     TO EDUCATE THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY CONCERNING THE EFFECTS
       OF EXPOSURE TO EXCESSIVE NOISE AND THE METHODS AVAILABLE
       FOR MINIMIZING SUCH EXPOSURE.
POLICIES AND ACTION PROGRAMS
The following policies and action plans have been adopted by the City of Kerman to
accomplish the goals of the Noise Element:
Transportation Noise Sources:
1. POLICY:             New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall not be
                       permitted in areas exposed to existing or projected future levels of
                       noise from transportation noise sources which exceed 60 dB Ldn in
                       outdoor activity areas or 45 dB Ldn in interior spaces.
    ACTION:            a. The City shall review new public and private development
                       proposals to determine conformance with the policies of this Noise
                       Element.
                       b. Where the development of a project may result in land uses
                       being exposed to existing or projected future noise levels
                       exceeding the levels specified by the policies of the Noise Element,
                       the City shall require an acoustical analysis early in the review
                       process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project
                       design. For development not subject to environmental review, the
                       requirements for an acoustical analysis shall be implemented prior
                       to the issuance of a building permit. The requirements for the
                       content of an acoustical analysis are given in Appendix B.

2. POLICY:           Noise created by new transportation noise sources, including
                     roadway improvement projects, shall be mitigated so as not to
                     exceed 60 dB Ldn within outdoor activity areas and 45 dB Ldn
                     within interior spaces of existing noise-sensitive land uses.
    ACTION:          a. The City shall develop and employ procedures to ensure that
                     noise mitigation measures required pursuant to an acoustical
                     analysis are implemented in the development review and building
                     permit processes.
                     b. The City shall request the California Highway Patrol, the
                     sheriff's office and the police department to actively enforce the
                     California Vehicle Code sections relating to adequate vehicle
                     mufflers and modified exhaust systems.
Stationary Noise Sources:
1. POLICY:           New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall not be
                     permitted where the noise level from existing stationary noise
                     sources exceeds the noise level standards of Table III.
    ACTION:          a. The City shall not permit projects that exceed allowable decibel
                     levels established by this Element.
                     b. The City shall enforce the State Noise Insulation Standards
                     (California Code of Regulations, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the
                     Uniform Building Code (UBC) concerning interior noise exposure
                     for multi-family housing, hotels and motels.
2. POLICY:           Noise created by new proposed stationary noise sources or existing
                     stationary noise sources which undergo modifications that may
                     increase noise levels shall be mitigated so as not to exceed the
                     noise level standards of Table 20 on lands designated for noise-
                     sensitive uses. This policy does not apply to noise levels
                     associated with agricultural operations.
    ACTION:          a. The City shall develop and employ procedures to monitor
                     compliance with the policies of the Noise Element after completion
                     of projects where noise mitigation measures have been required.
                     b. The City shall periodically review and update the Noise
                     Element to ensure that noise exposure information and specific
                     policies are consistent with changing conditions within the City
                     and with noise control regulations or policies enacted after the
                     adoption of this element.

NOISE AND ITS EFFECTS ON PEOPLE
Fundamentals of Noise Assessment:
Noise is often defined simply as unwanted sound, and thus is a subjective reaction to
characteristics of a physical phenomenon. The descriptors of community noise in current
use are the results of many years of effort to translate objective measurements of sound
into measures of subjective reaction to noise. Before elaborating on these descriptors, it
is useful to discuss some fundamental concepts of sound.
Sound is defined as any pressure variation in air that the human ear can detect. If the
pressure variations occur frequently enough (at least 20 times per second), they can be
heard and hence are called sound. The number of pressure variations per second is called
the frequency of sound, and is expressed as cycles per second, now called Hertz (Hz) by
international agreement.
The speed of sound in air is approximately 770 miles per hour, or 1,130 feet/second.
Knowing the speed and frequency of a sound, one may calculate its wavelength, the
physical distance in air from one compression of the atmosphere to the next. An
understanding of wavelength is useful in evaluating the effectiveness of physical noise
control devices such as mufflers or barriers, which depend upon either absorbing or
blocking sound waves to reduce sound levels.
To measure sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward
range of numbers. To avoid this, the decibel (dB) scale was devised.
The decibel scale uses the hearing threshold as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB.
Other sound pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is
taken to keep the numbers in a practical range. Use of the decibel scale allows a million-
fold increase in pressure to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel
scale is that changes in levels (dB) correspond closely to human perception of relative
loudness.
The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon many factors, including sound
pressure level and frequency content. In the range of usual environmental noise levels,
perception of loudness is relatively predictable, and can be approximated by weighting
the frequency response of a sound level measurement device (called a sound level meter)
by means of the standardized A-weighting network. There is a strong correlation
between A-weighted sound levels and community response to noise. For this reason, the
A-weighted sound level has become the standard tool of environmental noise assessment.
Figure A-1 illustrates typical A-weighted sound levels due to recognizable sources.
It is common to describe community noise in terms of the "ambient" noise level, which is
defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment.
                                             6-13
2007 Kerman General Plan Update                                                       Part I
                                                                Chapter 6: Noise Element
A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or
equivalent, sound level (Leq), which is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state A-
weighted sound level containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a
given time period (usually one hour). The Leq is the foundation of the composite noise
descriptors such as Ldn and CNEL, and shows very good correlation with community
response to noise.
Two composite noise descriptors are in common use today: Ldn and CNEL. The Ldn
(day-night average level) is based upon the average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, with
a +10 decibel weighting applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) Leq values. The
nighttime penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise
exposures as though they were subjectively twice as loud as daytime exposures. The
CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level), like Ldn, is also based upon the weighted
average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, except that an additional 4.77 decibel penalty is
applied to evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) hourly Leq values.
The CNEL was developed for the California Airport Noise Regulations, and is applied
specifically to airport/aircraft noise assessment. The Ldn scale is a simplification of the
CNEL concept, but the two will usually agree, for a given situation, within 1 dB. Like
the Leq, these descriptors are also averages and tend to disguise variations in the noise
environment. Because Ldn and CNEL presume increased evening or nighttime
sensitivity, they are best applied as criteria for land uses where nighttime noise exposures
are critical to the acceptability of the noise environment, such as residential
developments.

Noise in the community has often been cited as being a health problem, not in terms of
actual physiological damage, such as hearing impairment, but in terms of inhibiting
general well-being and contributing to undue stress and annoyance. The health effects of
noise in the community arise from the interference with human activities such as sleep,
speech, recreation, and tasks demanding concentration or coordination. When
community noise interferes with human activities or contributes to stress, public
annoyance with the noise source increases, and the acceptability of the environment for
people decreases. This decrease in acceptability and the threat to public well-being is the
basis for land use planning policies directed towards the prevention of exposure to
excessive community noise levels. There are also economic effects of community noise:
reduction in property values, inefficiency in the workplace and lost hours due to stress.
To control noise from existing fixed sources, many jurisdictions have adopted community
noise control ordinances. Such ordinances are intended to abate noise nuisances and to
control noise from existing sources. They may also be used as planning tools if applied
to the potential creation of a nuisance, or to potential encroachment of sensitive uses
upon noise-producing facilities. Community noise control ordinances are generally
designed to resolve noise problems on a short-term basis (usually by means of hourly
noise level criteria), rather than on the basis of 24-hour or annual cumulative noise
exposures.
Criteria for Acceptable Noise Exposure:
The Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan,
includes recommendations for exterior and interior noise level standards to be used by
local jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation of incompatible land uses due to
noise. The State Guidelines contain a land use compatibility table which describes the
compatibility of different land uses with a range of environmental noise levels in terms of
Ldn or CNEL. An exterior noise environment of 50 to 60 dB Ldn or CNEL is considered
to be "normally acceptable" for residential uses according to those guidelines. The
recommendations in the State Guidelines also note that, under certain conditions, more
restrictive standards may be appropriate. As an example, the standards for quiet
suburban and rural communities may be reduced by 5 to 10 dB to reflect lower existing
outdoor noise levels.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also prepared guidelines for
community noise exposure in the publication Information on the Levels of Environmental
Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety.
These guidelines are based upon assumptions regarding acceptable noise levels which
consider occupational noise exposure as well as noise exposure in the home. The
guidelines recognize an exterior noise level of 55 dB Ldn as a goal to protect the public
from hearing loss, activity interference, sleep disturbance and annoyance. The EPA
notes, however, that this level is not a regulatory goal, but is a level defined by a
negotiated scientific consensus without concern for economic and technological

feasibility or the needs and desires of any particular community. The EPA and other
governmental agencies have adopted suggested land use compatibility guidelines which
indicate that residential noise exposures of 55 to 65 dB Ldn are within acceptable limits.
For control of noise nuisances, a community noise control ordinance is the most
appropriate tool. The State Office of Noise Control has prepared a Model Community
Noise Control Ordinance which contains recommended noise standards in terms of "time-
weighted" sound levels. The time-weighting concept allows discrimination of both short-
and long-term noise exposures, and sets allowable levels for each. The Model
recommends more stringent standards for residential land uses than for commercial and
industrial, with the most stringent standards recommended for "rural suburban"
situations. The primary exterior noise standard for rural residential uses is 50 dB in the
daytime hours (7 a.m. to 10 p.m.), and 40 dB at night. The standard is expressed in terms
of the level exceeded for 30 minutes of an hour, equivalent to the median level, or L50.
This ordinance format is successfully applied in many California cities and counties.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also prepared a Model Community Noise
Control Ordinance using the "Equivalent A-weighted Sound Level" (Leq) as the means of
defining allowable noise level limits. The EPA model contains no specific
recommendations for local noise level standards, but reports a range of Leq values as
adopted by various local jurisdictions. The mean daytime noise standard reported by the
EPA is 56.75 dB (Leq); the mean nighttime noise standard is 51.76 dB (Leq). This
ordinance format has been successfully applied by the City and County of San Diego and
by many other jurisdictions looking for a simplified approach to the enforcement of a
local noise control ordinance.
In addition to the A-weighted noise level, other factors should be considered in
establishing criteria for noise sensitive land uses. For example, sounds with noticeable
tonal content such as whistles, horns, or droning or high-pitched sounds may be more
annoying than the A-weighted sound level alone will suggest. Many noise standards
apply a penalty, or correction, of 5 dB to such sounds. The effects of unusual tonal
content will generally be more of a concern at nighttime, when residents may notice the
sound in contrast to previously-experienced background noise.
Because many rural residential areas experience very low noise levels, residents may
express concern about the loss of "peace and quiet" due to the introduction of a sound
which was not audible previously. In very quiet environments, the introduction of
virtually any change in local activities will cause an increase in noise levels. A change in
noise level and the relative loss of "peace and quiet" is the inevitable result of land use or
activity changes in such areas. Audibility of a new noise source and/or increases in noise
levels within recognized acceptable limits are not usually considered to be significant
noise impacts, but these concerns should be addressed and considered in the planning and
environmental review processes.
Table 22 is commonly used to show expected public reaction to changes in
environmental noise levels. This table was developed on the basis of test subjects'
                                             6-16

reactions to changes in the levels of steady-state pure tones or broad-band noise, or to
changes in levels of a given noise source. It is probably most applicable to noise levels in
the range of 50 to 70 dB, the usual range of voice and interior noise levels. It is probably
not directly applicable to public perception of identifiable intrusive noise sources in very
quiet environments because of the difference in frequency content between background
noise sources and intrusive sounds, as well as the fact that the absolute amount of energy
required to make a given change in sound pressure level is much smaller at low noise
levels than at higher levels. Table 22 should therefore only be applied in a general
manner to show the relationship between changes in sound energy, sound pressure levels
and subjective reaction.
The comparisons of subjective reaction outlined in Table 22 are not applicable to noise
exposures which are very quiet or very loud. For example, a whisper which is increased
by 10 decibels, e.g., from 20 dB to 30 dB, remains a whisper, and would still be
described as quiet. In contrast, an increase in the noise level of a diesel locomotive from
90 dB to 100 dB would be a change from a loud noise to a very loud noise. Thus the
subjective reaction to a 10 dB change in either case may be different, even though the
change in level is the same.

SECTION 2F-1: ACTION PLAN
Regional Collaboration
Program 1: Regional Collaboration on Housing Opportunities
The Multi-Jurisdictional Housing Element provides an opportunity for countywide housing issues and
needs to be more effectively addressed at the regional level rather than just at the local level, and the 13
participating jurisdictions are committed to continuing the regional collaboration in the implementation of
the Housing Element. By working together, the jurisdictions can share best practices, explore opportunities
for further collaboration, and make the best use of limited resources.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        The County of Fresno Public Works and Planning Department, with assistance from the Fresno
         COG, will take the lead in coordinating Committee meetings.
        Continue to participate in the Countywide Housing Element Technical Committee to collaborate
         on housing program implementation and regional issues including, disadvantaged unincorporated
         communities (SB 244), infrastructure challenges, farmworker housing, homelessness, and fair
         housing.
        The Countywide Housing Element Technical Committee will meet at least biannually to evaluate
         successes in implementation of programs and to identify gaps and additional needs.
        The Committee will meet annually with the California Department of Housing and Community
         Development (HCD) to discuss funding opportunities and challenges in implementation of
         programs, and seek technical assistance from HCD and other State agencies in the
         implementation of housing programs and the pursuit of grant funding.
        The Committee will meet periodically with Fair Housing of Central California to discuss fair
         housing issues and opportunities for education.

        The Committee will advocate on behalf of the Fresno region for more grant funding for
         affordable housing and infrastructure improvements.
        Continue to seek partnerships with other jurisdictions in the region and other agencies (such as
         the Housing Authority), housing developers, community stakeholders, and agricultural
         employers/employees to explore viable options for increasing the availability of farmworker
         housing in suitable locations in the region.
        Develop a directory of services and resources for lower-income households available in the
         region, and review and update it annually. Make the directory available on City/County websites
         and at City/County offices.

Program 2: Review Annexation Standards in Memorandum of Understanding
All jurisdictions in Fresno County are subject to the City-County Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
which establishes procedures for annexation of land to cities. The City/County MOU encourages urban
development to take place within cities and unincorporated communities where urban services and facilities
are available or planned to be made available in an effort to preserve agricultural land. The MOU standards
for annexation require that a minimum of 50 percent of annexation areas have an approved tentative
subdivision map or site plan. While cities can take certain steps to “prezone” land in advance of annexation,
the annexation of the land into the city limits is dependent upon private developers to request an annexation.
In cities that are mostly built out within their current city limits, the MOU may limit the cities’ ability to
accommodate future housing needs.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        The County of Fresno and the cities within the County shall work together to review and revise,
         as deemed appropriate by all parties, the standards for annexation contained in the Memorandum
         of Understanding between the County and the cities.

Adequate Sites
Program 3: Rezone and Provision of Adequate Sites
The City of Kerman will provide for a variety of housing types and ensure that adequate sites are available
to meet its total Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 1,332 units. As part of this Housing
Element update, the City has developed a parcel-specific inventory of sites suitable for future residential
development. The suitability of these sites has been determined based on the development standards in
place and their ability to facilitate the development of housing to meet the needs of the City’s current and
future residents. However, the City has a remaining need of 168 lower-income units from the Fourth Cycle
RHNA.
To meet the unaccommodated need for 168 lower-income units, the City will reach out to interested
property owners of commercial, industrial, and/or low density residential sites and rezone at least 8.4 acres
of land. The City is currently considering a rezone application for an affordable housing development on a
commercially-zoned property on the southeast corner of Whitesbridge Avenue and Siskiyou Avenue. The
property is just over 4 acres and may be able to meet a portion of the City’s unaccommodated lower-income
need. The City will look for similar opportunities to meet the remaining unaccommodated need by rezoning
vacant commercial land or upzoning vacant low density residential land within the city limits. The City will
ensure the sites have access to infrastructure and are suitable for residential development. Rezoning to
accommodate the RHNA shortfall for lower-income units must meet the following requirements:
         Sites must be rezoned to permit owner-occupied and rental multi-family housing by right without
          discretionary review of the use or density; and
         Sites must be zoned with a minimum density of 20 units per acre and be large enough to
          accommodate at least 16 units per site.
At least 50 percent of the lower income RHNA shortfall must be permitted on sites designated for exclusively
residential uses.
Timeframe and Objectives:
         Maintain and annually update the inventory of residential land resources;
         Provide the inventory on the City website and make copies available upon request;
         Rezone enough land to cover the unaccommodated need from the Fourth Cycle of 168 lower-
          income units within one year of the Housing Element due date (i.e., December 31, 2016).
         Monitor development and other changes in the inventory to ensure the City has remaining
          capacity consistent with its share of the regional housing need; and
         Actively participate in the development of the next RHNA Plan to better ensure that the
          allocations are reflective of the regional and local land use goals and policies.

Program 4: Monitoring of Residential Capacity (No Net Loss)
The City will monitor the consumption of residential acreage and development on non-residential sites
included in the inventory to ensure an adequate inventory is available to meet the City’s RHNA obligations.
To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained to accommodate the RHNA, the City will develop
and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code
Section 65863. Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential
capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify
and if necessary rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure “no net loss” in capacity to
accommodate the RHNA.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        Develop and implement a formal evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section
         65863 by 2016.
        Monitor and report through the HCD annual report process.
        If rezoning/upzoning is required to replenish the sites inventory for meeting the RHNA shortfall,
         the sites shall be large enough to accommodate at least 16 units per site at a minimum density of
         20 units per acre, and shall be rezoned within two years.

Program 5: Water and Wastewater Service
The development viability of the vacant sites in the inventory is directly linked to the availability and
capacity of public facilities and services. The City continues to work to address water supply issues and
infrastructure capacity limitations.
Additionally, California Government Code Section 65589.7 requires water and sewer providers to establish
specific procedures and grant priority water and sewer service to developments with units affordable to
lower-income households. The statute also requires local governments to immediately deliver the housing
element to water and sewer providers. The City of Kerman is the water and wastewater provider in the city.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        Continue to monitor water and wastewater capacity and make improvements, as appropriate and
         feasible, to better serve existing development and strive to accommodate the RHNA.
        Establish procedures by the end of 2016 for granting priority water and sewer service to
         developments with lower-income units in compliance with California Government Code Section
         65589.7.

Program 6: Affordable Housing Incentives
The City continues to have needs for affordable housing for lower income households, especially for
seniors, disabled (including persons for developmental disabilities), farmworkers, the homeless, and those
at imminent risk of becoming homeless. The City will continue to work with housing developers to expand
affordable housing opportunities in the community.
Timeframe and Objectives:
         Continue to seek partnerships and regularly meet, at least annually, with other agencies (such as
         the Housing Authority), housing developers, community stakeholders, and employers to discuss
         and pursue viable opportunities for providing affordable housing, particularly on underutilized
         sites included in the Housing Element sites inventory.

       Continue to offer incentives such as density bonus and streamlined processing (such as pre-
        application consultation to identify potential issues early on and concurrent processing of required
        permits to the extent feasible) to facilitate the development of affordable housing, with an
        emphasis on housing opportunities for very low and extremely low income households, as well as
        special needs populations, such as the elderly, disabled (including developmentally disabled),
        farmworkers, the homeless, and those at risk of becoming homeless.
       Continue to promote the State density bonus, flexible development standards, and other
        incentives to facilitate affordable housing development, by publicizing the incentives on the City
        website and by conducting pre-application consultation with developers regarding incentives
        available.
       Continue to streamline the environmental review process for housing developments to the extent
        possible, using available state categorical exemptions and federal categorical exclusions, when
        applicable.
       Annually pursue State, Federal and other funding opportunities to increase the supply of safe,
        decent, affordable housing in Kerman for lower income households (including extremely low
        income households), such as seniors, disabled (including persons with developmental
        disabilities), farmworkers, the homeless, and those at risk of homelessness.
       Expand the City’s affordable housing inventory by 226 units over the next eight years – 40
        extremely low income, 80 very low income, and 106 low income units.

Program 8: Preservation of Assisted Housing at Risk of Converting to Market Rate
Preserving the existing affordable housing stock is a cost-effective approach to providing affordable
housing in Kerman. The City must guard against the loss of housing units available to lower income
households. There are 100 publicly assisted housing units at the Vintage Apartments (now called Golden
Meadows) that are considered at risk of conversion to market rate in 2021. The City will strive to preserve
these at-risk units as affordable housing.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        Monitor the status of any HUD receipt/approval of Notices of Intent and Plans of Action filed by
         property owners to convert to market rate units.
        Identify non-profit organizations as potential purchasers/ managers of at-risk housing units.
        Explore funding sources available to purchase affordability covenants on at-risk projects, transfer
         ownership of at-risk projects to public or non-profit agencies, purchase existing buildings to
         replace at-risk units, or construct replacement units.
        Ensure the tenants are properly noticed and informed of their rights and eligibility to obtain
         special Section 8 vouchers reserved for tenants of converted HUD properties.

cooking, eating, sleeping, and full sanitation facilities. Second units can be an important source of
affordable housing given that they typically are smaller and have no associated land costs. The City permits
second units ministerially in all residential zones.
Timeframe and Objectives:
       By 2018, consider fee reductions for second units.
       By 2019, implement a public education program advertising the opportunity for second units
        through the City website and at the planning counter.

         any zone that permits agricultural uses, and employee housing for six or fewer employees are to
         be treated as a single family structure and permitted in the same manner as other dwellings of the
         same type in the same zone.
        Single Room Occupancy: Amend the Zoning Code to address the provision of SRO housing.
        Group Homes: Amend the Zoning Ordinance to clarify provisions for group homes and allow
         group homes for six or fewer residents in all zones allowing single family residential uses.
         Additionally, amend the Zoning Ordinance to include provisions for larger group homes of seven
         or more residents.
        Second Units: Amend the Zoning Ordinance to remove inconsistencies and clarify that second
         units are permitted in all zones allowing single family uses.
        Reasonable Accommodation: Establish a reasonable accommodation procedure to provide
         flexibility in policies, rules, and regulations in order to allow persons with disabilities access to
         housing.
        Density Bonus: Consistent with Government Code, a density bonus up to 35 percent over the
         otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning district will be
         available to developers who provide affordable housing as part of their projects. Developers of
         affordable housing will also be entitled to receive incentives on a sliding scale to a maximum of
         three, where the amount of density bonus and number of incentives vary according to the amount
         of affordable housing units provided.
In addition, parking standards were identified as a potential constraint. The City will consider adopting an
Administrative Modification process to accommodate minor reduction in required parking standards for
senior citizen and other qualified multifamily development projects as an incentive to encourage and allow
non-profit developers to construct more affordable units or deeper affordability.
Additionally, the City will modify its conditional use permit findings to remove the reference to the term
“morals” from the required findings of approval.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        Amend Zoning Code within one year of Housing Element adoption for consistency with State
         law.
        The City Council shall consider amending the Zoning Code within one year of adoption of the
         Housing Element to accommodate a minor reduction in parking standards for senior citizen and
         other qualified multifamily development projects, as described above.
        Annually review the effectiveness and appropriateness of the Zoning Code and process any
         necessary amendments to remove or mitigate potential constraints to the development of housing.

Program 11: Lot Consolidation and Lot Splits
The City’s vacant sites inventory is comprised of parcels of varying sizes, from small lots of less than half
acre or large lots of over 20 acres; either case presents unique challenges to residential development,
especially to multifamily housing development. The City will encourage lot consolidation or lot splitting
to promote the efficient use of land for residential development pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act.
Timeframe and Objectives:
        Assist interested developers/property owners in identifying opportunities for lot consolidation or
         lot splitting.
        Process requests for lot consolidation and lot splitting concurrent with other development
         reviews.
        Offer incentives to developers to promote parcel consolidation, such as priority permit processing
         and deferred development improvements.

Program 13: Monitor CUP Requirement for Multifamily and Mixed Use Developments
The City requires a conditional use permit for mixed-use developments, all multifamily residential
developments larger than 40 units, and all multifamily developments in the MU, OD, GC, and –SD zones.
While this has not been seen as a constraint on development of housing in recent years and several
affordable multifamily projects have been approved, the City will continue to monitor the CUP requirement
to ensure it does not impact mixed-use and multifamily development
Timeframe and Objectives:
       Track the time and cost associated with processing use permits for housing projects to monitor the
        impact of the CUP process.
       Report on the monitoring program annually in the annual report to the City Council and HCD.
       If the CUP is identified as a constraint to housing development, identify ways to streamline the
        approval process within one year.

Program 18: First-Time Homebuyer Resources
Kerman residents have access to a number of homebuyer assistance programs offered by the California
Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA):
      Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC): The MCC Tax Credit is a federal credit which can reduce
       potential federal income tax liability, creating additional net spendable income which borrowers
       may use toward their monthly mortgage payment. This MCC Tax Credit program may enable
       first-time homebuyers to convert a portion of their annual mortgage interest into a direct dollar
       for dollar tax credit on their U.S. individual income tax returns.
      CalPLUS Conventional Program: This is a first mortgage loan insured through private mortgage
       insurance on the conventional market. The interest rate on the CalPLUS Conventional is fixed
       throughout the 30-year term. The CalPLUS Conventional is combined with a CalHFA Zero
       Interest Program (ZIP), which is a deferred-payment junior loan of three percent of the first
       mortgage loan amount, for down payment assistance.
      CalHFA Conventional Program: This is a first mortgage loan insured through private mortgage
       insurance on the conventional market. The interest rate on the CalHFA Conventional is fixed
       throughout the 30-year term.
CalHFA loans are offered through local loan officers approved and trained by CalHFA.

SECTION 2F-2: SITES INVENTORY
AB 1233 was signed into law on October 5, 2005, and applies to housing elements due on or after January
1, 2006. Specifically, the law states that if a jurisdiction fails to provide adequate sites in the prior planning
period, within one year of the new cycle, the jurisdiction must rezone/upzone adequate sites to
accommodate the shortfall. This requirement is in addition to rezoning/upzoning that may be needed to
address the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the new cycle.
This law affects the City of Kerman’s 2015-2023 Housing Element, requiring the City to address its deficit
in sites, if any, for the previous housing element cycle (2008-2015), extended from 2013 by legislation).
The City of Kerman did not submit a fourth cycle (2008-2015) housing element for review and certification
from HCD. Consequently, the fifth cycle housing element must demonstrate the City’s ability in meeting
its prior RHNA, and roll over any shortfall in sites to the new planning period. To determine any potential
penalties, the analysis in this Housing Element uses the following approach outlined by HCD:
         Step 1: Subtracting the number of housing units constructed, under construction, permitted, or
          approved since 2006 to date by income/affordability level; and
         Step 2: Subtracting the number of units that could be accommodated on any appropriately zoned
          sites available in the city during the RHNA cycle.
Units Built or Under Construction
The City can count any building permits issued since January 1, 2006, the start of the fourth cycle RHNA
period. As shown in Table 2F-2, Kerman has issued permits for 640 units since 2006. Only deed-restricted
affordable units that were built since the start of the last RHNA period were inventoried as lower-income.
This includes units in the following affordable housing developments:
         Kearney Palms Senior Apartments: 80 affordable units (2006);
         Kearney Palms Phase II: 20 lower-income units (2009);
         Kerman Acre (Granada Commons) Apartments: 16 lower-income units (2010);
         Kearney Palms Senior Apartments Phase III: 43 lower-income units (2012); and
         Hacienda Heights Apartments: 68 lower-income units (2012).
While all of these units are affordable to lower-income households, the breakdown of units by specific
income categories is unknown. For the purpose of this analysis, the units are assigned to the low-income
category.
Other multifamily and second units were inventoried as moderate-income based on expected rents. All
single family units were inventoried as above moderate-income.

Vacant and Underutilized Land
In assessing if the City would incur any RHNA penalty from the previous planning period, this section
examines the amount of vacant land available in the city with the potential for residential development. The
vacant and underutilized land inventory described below as a part of the sites inventory for the Fifth Cycle
Housing Element can be counted toward the Fourth Cycle RHNA as well, since the zoning for all of these
sites was in place prior to the start of the Fourth Cycle Housing Element planning period (i.e., June 30,
2008). As shown in Table 2F-6 and Figure 2F-1, Kerman has capacity for 1,119 units, including 733 lower-
income units, 36 moderate-income units, and 350 above-moderate-income units.
Kerman can also retroactively count approved projects as vacant sites since the land was vacant during the
previous RHNA cycle. Therefore, Tracts 5928 and 5831 can be treated as vacant sites. Tract 5928 Phase I
and II is made up of 9.20 acres of land zoned SD-R-5 (8.71 units per acre) and 12.01 acres of land zoned
SD-R-4.5 (9.68 units per acre). Using the same assumptions as Table 2F-6, this site has capacity for 120
above moderate-income units. Tract 5831 is made up of 15.49 acres of land zoned SD-R-3.5 (12.44 units
per acre). Using the same assumptions as Table 2F-6, this site has capacity for 148 moderate-income units.
AB 1233 Carry-Over Analysis Summary
Table 2F-3 summarizes the AB 1233 carry-over analysis for Kerman. Based on units constructed and
capacity from vacant and underutilized sites, Kerman meets its Fourth Cycle RHNA in the above moderate-
income category (with a surplus of 37 units), but has 168 units of unaccommodated need in the lower-
income categories and 255 units of unaccommodated need in the moderate-income category. Given the
affordability of market rate housing in the region, it is reasonable to assume that a portion of the market-
rate single family units built between 2006 and 2014 were affordable to moderate-income households.
Therefore the 37-unit surplus in the above moderate-income category can meet a portion of the
unaccommodated need in the moderate-income category, reducing the unaccommodated moderate-income
need to 218 units.

                                                                              APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
Per State law, sites that are zoned to meet the City’s unaccommodated need for the 168 lower-income
households must meet the following criteria:
    1. Allow owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential uses “by-right” (i.e., without any
         discretionary review);
    2. Be large enough to accommodate at least 16 units;
    3. permit a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre; and
    4. at least 50 percent of the low- and very low-income regional housing need must be accommodated
         on sites designated for residential uses for which non-residential uses are not permitted, unless the
         sites designated for mixed-use allow 100 percent residential use and require that residential use
         occupy 50 percent of the total floor area of a mixed-use project.
Since the City does not have any existing zoning that meets these requirements, particularly the 20-unit per
acre minimum density requirement and the by-right requirement, the City must rezone land to accommodate
the 168 lower-income units. Assuming a minimum density of 20 units per acre, 8.4 acres of land will need
to be rezoned to accommodate the 168 units. Program 3 describes the City’s rezone obligation. The City is
currently considering a rezone application for an affordable housing development on a commercially-zoned
property on the southeast corner of Whitesbridge Avenue and Siskiyou Avenue. The property is just over
four acres and may be able to meet a portion of the City’s unaccommodated lower-income need. The City
will look for similar opportunities to meet the remaining unaccommodated need by rezoning vacant
commercial land or upzoning vacant low density residential land within the city limits. The rezone
requirements apply only to the unaccommodated lower-income need, not the unaccommodated moderate-
income need. The unaccommodated 218-unit moderate-income need is carried over and added to the Fifth
Cycle RHNA.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
Fifth Cycle Housing Element RHNA Analysis
For the Fifth Cycle Housing Element update, Kerman has been assigned a RHNA of 909 units, including
238 very low income units, 211 low income units, 202 moderate income units, and 258 above moderate
income units. In addition, the City has a carry-over of 218 moderate-income from the Fourth Cycle RHNA,
for a total of 420 moderate-income. As described above, since the City does not have zoning in place that
meets the State law requirements of adequate sites to meet the 168-unit lower-income unaccommodated
need, the City must rezone to meet this need (see Program 3).
Units Built or Under Construction
Since the Fifth Cycle RHNA projection period runs from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2023, Kerman’s
RHNA can be reduced by the number of units built or under construction since January 1, 2013. Table 2F-
4 and Figure 2F-1 show units built or under construction since January 1, 2013 in Kerman; 12 single family
homes have been built since this date.

       Kerman’s RHNA can also be reduced by the number of new units in projects that are planned or approved,
       but not yet built. Table 2F-5 and Figure 2F-1 show an inventory of all residential projects that are (as of
       January 2015) approved or in the planning process and scheduled to be built by the end of the current
       Housing Element planning period (December 31, 2023). For each project the table shows the name of the
       development, number of units by income category, a description of the units, and the current status of the
       project.
       Tract 5928 is a subdivision split into two separate phases. Phase 1 will contain 19 single family homes,
       while Phase 2 will include 106 single family homes and 25 multifamily units, all of which are inventoried
       as above moderate-income units. Tract 5831 is a 91-unit single family subdivision. All 91 units will be
       market rate single family homes and are inventoried as above moderate-income.

       Vacant and Underutilized Land
       The Kerman Housing Element sites inventory uses the following assumptions:
               Relation of density to income categories. The following assumptions were used to determine the
                income categories according to the allowed densities for each site:
                   Lower-income (LI) Sites. Sites at least 0.5 acres in size that allow at least 20 units per acre
                    were inventoried as feasible for lower-income (low- and very low-income) residential
                    development. This includes sites zoned R-3 M-U, and GC, which allow up to 20 units per acre.
       FRESNO MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL HOUSING ELEMENT | ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2016                                    2F-23

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
          Moderate-Income (MI) Sites. Sites that are zoned R-2 allow for up to 12.44 dwelling units
           per net acre. Sites that are zoned SD-R-3.5 allow 12.44 units per net acre. These areas were
           inventoried as feasible for moderate-income residential development. Typical dwelling units
           include small and medium-sized apartments and other attached units. Sites that are less than
           0.5 acres in size and zoned for R-3 were deemed too small to be inventoried as lower-income
           and were instead inventoried as moderate-income.
          Above Moderate-Income (AMI) Sites. Sites within zones that allow only single family homes
           at lower densities were inventoried as above moderate-income units. This includes sites zoned
           for R-1-7 and R-1-12.
     Development Potential. The inventory assumes build-out of 80 percent of the maximum permitted
      density for all residentially-zoned sites. This estimate is fairly consistent with suburban
      development and the City’s development standards are not considered excessive to preclude
      development at the higher end of the density range. However, The City’s Zoning Code caps
      multifamily residential development at 100 units per parcel. Therefore, in the zones where
      multifamily is permitted (i.e., R-3, M-U, and GC) the sites inventory caps capacity at 100 units per
      parcel.
     Assumptions for Mixed-use Zoning. The Mixed Use zoning district allows for both residential
      and commercial uses. The MU district allows for any use permitted within the R-3 zone and,
      therefore, could allow up to 20 units per acre. Sites zoned MU were inventoried as lower-income
      based on the maximum density of 20 units per acre. The realistic capacity on sites zoned MU is
      assumed to be 75 percent of maximum capacity. This estimate is fairly consistent with suburban
      development and the City’s development standards are not considered excessive to preclude
      development at the higher end of the density range. The General Commercial (GC) district also
      allows R-3 uses with a conditional use permit. Sites in the GC district were inventoried as lower-
      income based on the maximum density of 20 units per acre. The realistic capacity on sites zoned
      GC is assumed to be 60 percent of the maximum capacity to account for the potential for
      nonresidential uses on these parcels.
     Assumptions for Underutilized Sites. The inventory includes three underutilized sites zoned
      either R-3 or MU. These sites have been identified because the City’s 2007 General Plan envisions
      the sites being redeveloped as high density residential and mixed use. For each site, the City has
      evaluated overall site potential, potential for lot consolidation, and the status of existing uses. The
      sites are all mostly vacant with marginal uses, and it is reasonable to assume that if there was
      interest in developing these sites the existing uses would be removed and replaced with higher
      density housing and mixed use. Images of the underutilized sites along with descriptions of the
      existing uses are shown below in the order that they appear in Table 2F-6.

Table 2F-6 identifies vacant and underutilized sites that are presently zoned for residential or mixed uses
and suitable for residential development in Kerman. The locations of these sites are shown in Figure 2F-1.
Based on permitted densities and the assumptions described above, the sites identified in Table 2F-6 can
accommodate an estimated 944 units, including 558 lower-income units, 36 moderate-income units, and
350 above moderate-income units. All of these sites are outside of FEMA 100-year flood zones and do not
have other environmental constraints that could hinder future development.

RHNA Summary
Table 2F-7 provides a summary of Kerman’s ability to meet the 2013-2023 RHNA. After accounting for units built
or under construction, planned and approved projects, and capacity on vacant/underutilized sites, Kerman has a
surplus in the lower- and above moderate-income categories and a remaining need of 384 moderate-income units.
However, the surplus in the lower-income category can meet a portion of the remaining moderate-income need, and
given the affordability of market-rate housing in the region, the surplus in the above moderate-income category can
also meet the remaining moderate-income need. After carrying over the 198-unit surplus from the lower-income
categories and the 345 surplus in the above moderate-income category, there is no remaining moderate-income
need.
As described in the previous section, the City still has an unaccommodated need for 168 lower-income units that
must be met through a rezone program (see Program 3).

       The unaccommodated need of 168 lower-income units from the Fourth Cycle RHNA is addressed in Program 3.

       Remaining Surplus/Need(-) is calculated by subtracting units built, planned projects, and capacity on vacant a
     sites from the total RHNA.
     * The 198-unit surplus in the lower-income category and the 345-unit surplus in the above moderate-income
     category can apply to the moderate-income category to meet all of the remaining need.

Adequacy of Public Facilities
Domestic water in the Kerman area is provided by the City of Kerman. The Public Works Department is responsible
for maintaining the existing wells and distribution system. The water system is operated as a municipal enterprise,
meaning that the revenue generated through user’s fees must be sufficient to meet the operation, maintenance and
capital costs of the system. The City of Kerman and surrounding urban areas draw local groundwater to meet all
domestic, commercial and industrial water demands.
The City’s distribution system consists of a looped water system using mains ranging from four inches to twelve
inches. Growth of the system to serve new development will require continued looping of lines and expansion of
fire flow reserve capacities. The City is in the process of developing a new water well (well # 18), which includes
a test well and site development. The City’s water delivery system has an additional capacity for 1.7 million gallons
per day (GPD) and an average of 201 gallons per capita per day. Based on this information, there is remaining
capacity for an estimated 8,400 housing units, which is more than enough to accommodate the RHNA.
The City of Kerman provides sewer service to the community. The city’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is
located south of Church Avenue on Del Norte Avenue alignment. The existing plant was designed with a hydraulic
capacity of 1.34 million gallons per day (m/gd). The plant can accommodate short-duration “peak” flows of 1.6
m/gp. Treated effluent from the plant is discharged into disposal ponds where it is allowed to evaporate and
percolate.
We have approximately 800,000 MGD additional capacity in our current plant. Current design is 2 million MGD
and we are at 1.2 million MGD. It was designed so that it can be expanded to add another 1 million MGD.
The City recently expanded the WWTP to 2.0 million gallons per day (MGD) in order to accommodate buildout of
the 2025 General Plan. The current plan receives an annual flow of 1.2 million gallons per day (MGD), and
approximately 800,000 MGD in remaining capacity. This is sufficient to accommodate the housing unit growth
anticipated in the RHNA.

      Very Low Density Residential: Maximum 2 dwelling units per acre
      Low Density Residential: Maximum 9 dwelling units per acre
      Medium Density Residential: Maximum 12 dwelling units per acre
      High Density Residential: Maximum 20 dwelling units per acre
The General Plan also contains a Mixed-use designation that allows for a combination of residential, office, and
commercial uses.
Conclusion
The General Plan land use designations offers a range of housing densities in the community.
Recommended Action
None required.
Zoning Ordinance
Analysis
The City’s Zoning Ordinance contains the following residential zoning districts:
      Urban Reserve (UR): The purpose of this district is to preserve land for agriculture; serve as a holding zone
       for future urban development; and, prevent the encroachment of urban uses or incompatible agriculturally-
       related uses.
      Rural Residential (RR, RR-43, RR-100): The purpose of this district is to allow for low-density residential
       development on large lots in order to preserve the rural character of Kerman, allow for agricultural uses,
       and serve as a transition area between urbanizing lands and agriculture. This district provides for three rural
       residential zones: RR, RR-43, and RR-100. The application of each zone will be based on the land use of
       the property, the Kerman general plan, and the availability of infrastructure.

     Single Family (R-1-7, R-1-12): The purpose of this district is to provide for residential areas within Kerman
      which allow a range of densities for single family homes, and uses compatible with the single family district.
      This district is intended to promote an environment which is free of traffic and parking congestion,
      significant noise levels, and uses which are not complementary to residential neighborhoods. This district
      provides for two single family residential zones: R-1-7 and R-1-12. The purpose and intent of each zone is
      based on the policies and objectives outlined in the Kerman general plan. The R-1-7 zone is reserved for
      traditional types of single family development. The R-1-12 zone is intended to create a boulevard effect
      along certain streets in Kerman. This district is generally reserved for streets which serve as major
      entryways to the community.
     Multiple Family Residential (R-2, R-3): The purpose of this district is to provide for a range of multifamily
      residential densities that are designated in a manner which do not conflict with surrounding residential uses
      and do not over burden local streets. This district provides for two multifamily residential base zones: R-2
      and R-3. The purpose and location of the R-2 and R-3 zone districts is based on the policies and objectives
      outlined in the Kerman General Plan. The purpose of the district is to provide for a range of multifamily
      residential housing densities that meet the goals of the Kerman housing element and are designed and
      located so that they do not conflict with adjacent land uses and do not over burden local streets.
     Mobile Home Park (MHP): The purpose of this chapter is to promote housing opportunities for residents
      of the city of Kerman by establishing policies and development standards for mobile home parks. The
      development standards for the mobile home parks will further encourage the creation of stable and attractive
      parks which will benefit the residents of the park and the community as a whole.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
In addition, the City’s Zoning Ordinance allows residential uses in the following nonresidential zones:
        Mixed-Use (MU): The purpose of this district is to implement the objectives of the Kerman general plan
         with respect to properties deemed appropriate for mixed-use development. The district is intended to allow
         for a combination of residential, office, and commercial uses. The district discourages uses of a service or
         industrial nature or those generating high volumes of vehicle traffic. All uses in the M-U zone are processed
         as a conditional use and are required to obtain a conditional use permit prior to establishment of the use.
         All project proponents must also submit a master plan of development as required in Section 17.45.080,
         Master Plan. The master plan is similar to a site plan requirement, but requires a little more detail on the
         design and layout of the development related to building design, yards, landscaping, signs, lighting, walls
         and fences, and parking. This zone allows residential uses as part of commercial mixed-use developers as
         well as standalone residential uses, consistent with the standards in the R3 zone.
        General Commercial (GC): The purpose of this district is to provide sites for a wide range of commercial
         and office uses which are diverse, visually pleasing, convenient in terms of parking and access, attractive
         and used by citizens of Kerman as well as visitors to the area. Multifamily residential is allowed with a
         conditional use permit. This zone allows residential uses as part of commercial mixed-use developers as
         well as standalone residential uses, consistent with the standards in the R3 zone.
        Office Professional (OP): The purpose of this district is to provide areas in the community which are
         appropriate for office development and identify residential sites which, due to their location, are appropriate
         for transition to office use. Single family uses are allowed.
In 2007 the City adopted the Smart Development (SD) Combining District, which provides flexible development
standards within the density standards of the underlying zone district. The intent of the SD District is to permit a
more efficient and aesthetic use of land through the arrangement of buildings not permitted through the strict
application of zoning. Providing such flexibility in development standards can result in lowering the cost of
development. The SD Combining District is described as follows:
        Smart Development (-SD-R-5, -SD-R-4.5, -SD-R-3.5, -SD-R-2.5): The purpose of the district is to promote
         development designs that respond to significant planning-related issues facing the San Joaquin Valley,
         including urbanization of agricultural land, air pollution, housing affordability, traffic, aesthetics, and
         neighborhood deterioration. This new approach to development design has been popularized by the term
         "smart growth" and its purpose is to achieve the average density goals set forth by each district. The smart
         development district is structured to encourage a comprehensive development that is superior to traditional
         development of the recent past by increasing walkability and connectivity while achieving the higher net
         density and preservation of open space goals set forth by the general plan. To the greatest extent possible,
         attention is given to greater design details and the average density set forth by each individual zone district
         will be achieved through a mix of residential housing types and sizes.
Conclusion
The City’s Zoning Ordinance provides for a range of housing options.

 Source: Kerman Zoning Ordinance, 2014.
Parking requirements in the City of Kerman are normal for city of its size: 2 spaces per unit for single family
residential, 1.5 spaces for one bedroom and 2 spaces for two bedroom multifamily dwellings. Parking requirements
for multifamily projects are similar to requirements for single family dwellings. For example, a subdivision of 10
single family homes would require 20 parking spaces. A 10 unit multifamily project (with 4 two bedroom units and
6 three bedroom units) would require 18 resident parking spaces plus 5 guest parking spaces for a total of 23 parking
spaces. These parking requirements do not constrain the development of housing directly.
However, the requirement for 1.5 parking spaces for studio and one bedroom multifamily units may be in excess of
need, particularly projects catering to seniors or lower income households, which may be more transit dependent
than other income groups. The City has included a program in the Housing Element to consider adopting an
Administrative Modification process to accommodate minor reduction in required parking standards for senior
citizen and other qualified multifamily development projects as an incentive to encourage and allow non-profit
developers to construct more affordable units or deeper affordability. Moreover, by allowing such modifications
through an administrative process, the requirement for making variance findings and conducting a public hearing
would be eliminated, thereby reducing the time and cost for project processing.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
Open Space and Park Requirements
As shown in Table 2F-9 above, the City requires open space to be set aside in certain residential zones. For
developments with 10 or more units in the R-2 and R-3 zones, 5 percent of the net area must be set aside as open
space. Within the Smart Development Combining District, the Zoning Ordinance has a minimum yard requirement
ranging from 250 square feet in the SD-R-2.5 to 900 square feet in the SD-R-5.
Conclusion
The development standards are typical for most Central Valley and California communities and do not pose any
potential constraints to the development of affordable housing in Kerman.
Recommended Action
None required.
Growth Management
Analysis
The City of Kerman General Plan land Use Element contains growth management policies that balance infill
development with outward expansion into the Sphere of Influence (SOI). The goal is to promote an urban growth
pattern that is compact, contiguous, and concentric. The General Plan establishes a 2017 Growth Boundary Line
and expansion beyond this line will not be considered unless the City’s “80% Infill Policy” is fulfilled. The General
Plan divided the City’s residential areas into three areas defined below and illustrated in Map 7 in Part II of the
2007 Kerman General Plan:
        West of Madera Ave., south of Whitesbridge Road, north of California Avenue
        North of Whitesbridge Road
        East of Madera Avenue, south of Whitesbridge Road, north of California Avenue
In order to consider growth beyond the 2017 Growth Boundary Line, one of the areas must have
reached the 80 percent infill criteria, meaning 80 percent of the residential area has built out. The
City will not be relying on annexation to meet the unaccommodated need for lower-income units.
Conclusion
Since the City has adequate capacity within current city limits to meet its RHNA, the Growth Boundary Line is not
a constraint to meeting the City’s housing needs.
Recommended Action
None required.

Density Bonus
Analysis
Chapter 17.70 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance contains the Density Bonus provisions for the City of Kerman. The
City grants a 25 percent density bonus over the housing unit density allowed by the existing zoning if the developer
agrees to meet one of the following conditions:
        At least 10 percent of the units are for lower-income households;
        At least 25 percent of the units are for low- or moderate-income households; or
        At least 50 percent of the units are for qualifying residents.
Qualifying residents is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as persons 62 years of age or older or 55 years of age or
older in a senior citizen housing development.
Conclusion
Kerman’s Density Bonus Ordinance is outdated and does not comply with current State law, which requires a
density bonus up to 35 percent with up to three additional incentives. In addition, the Ordinance does not provide a
density bonus for a development with childcare facilities.
Recommended Action
The Housing Element includes a program to update the density bonus ordinance to comply with State law.

     Multifamily
     The City of Kerman Zoning Code expressly permits duplexes and up to 40 multiple-family dwelling units per site
     in the R-2 and R-3 zone districts. Multifamily developments exceeding 40 units up to a maximum of 100 units
     require a Conditional Use Permit in these zones. Multifamily housing is also permitted subject to a conditional use
     permit MU, OP, GC, and –SD Combining District.
     2F-56                                    FRESNO MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL HOUSING ELEMENT | ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2016

                                                                                     APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
The current maximum 100 units per project is based on the city’s experience with past projects. Kerman is a
relatively small community and the typical multi-family project has not exceeded 100 units due to market demand
or project feasibility. The City has approved several recent affordable projects, and none of the projects came close
to the 100 unit maximum. The Kerman Acre (Granada Commons) Apartments, built in 2010, was a small affordable
apartment complex of only 16 units; the Kearney Palms Senior Apartments Phase III, built in 2012, included 44
affordable units; and the Hacienda Heights apartments which included 68 affordable units. The City facilitated the
development of these affordable projects with Redevelopment Agency funds and fee waivers. None of these
affordable projects were impacted by the Zoning Ordinance standard that limits multifamily to 100 units or the
requirement for a conditional use permit for projects exceeding 40 units.
Manufactured Housing
In compliance with State law, the City’s Zoning Ordinance expressly permits manufactured homes in all zones
allowing single family homes.
Farmworker/Employee Housing
The Zoning Ordinance contains provisions that allow for farm employee housing in agricultural zones; however,
the provisions do not fully comply with State law requirements.
Under California Health and Safety Code 17021.5 (Employee Housing Act), farmworker housing up to 12 units or
36 beds must be considered an agricultural use and permitted in any zone that permits agricultural uses. The City
permits agricultural uses in the UR, OPR, and RR zones, but currently only permits farm employee housing in the
UR and OPR zones. The definition of “farm labor camp” is as follows:
         “Any living quarters such as dwellings, boarding houses, bunkhouses, automobile trailers or other housing
         accommodations, permanently maintained in connection with any farm work for the housing of five or more
         farm employees.”
While this definition does not necessarily conflict with State law requirements for farm employee housing, it does
not expressly permit housing up to 12 units or 36 beds.
In addition, the Employee Housing Act requires employee housing for six or fewer employees to be treated as a
single family use and permitted in the same manner as other dwellings of the same type in the same zone. The
Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly allow employee housing in this manner.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
Emergency Shelters
The City recently (May 2015) amended the Zoning Ordinance to comply with State law requirements for emergency
shelters. The Zoning Ordinance defines emergency residential shelter as:
         “Emergency residential shelter” means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons
         that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person, where no individual or household
         may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay; as defined and used in Section 508019 of
         the California Health and Safety Code”
Emergency shelters are allowed by-right in the C-S and M-1 zones subject to development standards that are
allowed per State law. The City had previously limited occupancy in emergency shelters to 6 or fewer, but amended
the ordinance in May 2015 to increase the occupancy limit to 30 beds. Table 2F-11 shows the parcels that are vacant
and zoned C-S and M-1. There are eight parcels totaling over 41 acres that are zoned either C-S or M-1 and could
potentially accommodate an emergency shelter by right. The 2013 Point-in-Time Count estimated that there were
2,799 homeless individuals in Fresno County, with five homeless persons estimated to be from the City of Kerman.
The C-S and M-1 zones provide more than enough capacity to accommodate the City’s need for homeless shelters.
These zones are located primarily along the north and south ends of the city, but given that the city is about one
mile long from north to south, the zones are within walking distance of the downtown where services are available.

Transitional and Supportive Housing
The City also recently (May 2015) amended the Zoning Ordinance to comply with State law requirements for
transitional and supportive housing. The City adopted the following definitions, which ensure compliance with State
law:
         “Transitional housing” Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
         requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the assisted unit to another
         eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six months from
         the beginning of the assistance. Transitional housing units are residential uses allowed in all zones that
         allow residential uses, subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other residential
         uses of the same type in the same zone.
         “Supportive housing” housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population and
         that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing,
         improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
         community. Supportive housing units are residential uses allowed in all zones that allow residential uses,
         subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in
         the same zone.
         “Target populations” persons with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental
         illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services
         provided pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing
         with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other populations, adults,
         emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care
         system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.
The City also added Section 17.92.030 to read: “Transitional housing and supportive housing shall be considered a
residential use of property, and shall be subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of
the same type in the same zone.”
Single Room Occupancy Units
The Zoning Ordinance does not currently contain provisions for SRO housing.
Group Homes
The Zoning Ordinance makes some provisions for group homes, but does not fully comply with State law
requirements. Group homes fall under two defined land uses in the Zoning Ordinance: “community care facility”
and “group home” (or “group housing facility”). The definitions are as follows:
FRESNO MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL HOUSING ELEMENT | ADOPTED APRIL 6, 2016                                                   2F-59

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
         "Community care facility" means any facility, place or building which is maintained and operated to
         provide nonmedical residential care, emergency shelters, adult day care, or home-finding agency services
         for children, adults, or children and adults, including, but not limited to, the physically handicapped,
         mentally impaired, or incompetent persons. "Community care facility" shall include residential facility,
         residential care facility for the elderly, adult day care facility, home finding agency, and social
         rehabilitation facility, as defined in Section 1502 of the Health and Safety Code, and includes the following:
             A. Adult Residential Facility. Provides twenty-four-hour-a-day nonmedical care and supervision to
                 adults who are mentally disordered or otherwise handicapped except elderly persons, who are in
                 need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily
                 living or for the protection of the individual.
             B. Residential Care Facility for the Elderly. A group housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by
                 residents who are at least sixty-two years of age and who are provided varying levels of supportive
                 services of care, as agreed upon at the time of admission, based upon their varying needs.
             C. Rehabilitation Facility. Provides twenty-four-hour-a-day nonmedical care and supervision in a
                 group setting to adults and/or emancipated minors recovering from alcohol and/or drug misuse,
                 who are currently or potentially capable of meeting their life support needs independently; but who
                 temporarily need assistance, guidance, and counseling.
             D. Foster Family Home. Any residential facility providing twenty-four hour care for six or fewer foster
                 children which is owned, leased or rented and is the residence of the foster parent or parents,
                 including their family, in whose care the foster children have been placed. Such placement may be
                 by a public or private child placement agency or by a court order, or by voluntary placement by a
                 parent, parents or guardian.
         "Group home" or "group housing facility" means any building, facility, premises, house, structure, dwelling
         unit, multiple dwelling unit, apartment house, or portion thereof, at which persons reside in a group
         occupancy setting, but not including a hotel, motel, fraternity, sorority, rooming and/or boarding house,
         rest home or family. This facility is generally characterized by the provision of pre-arranged or organized
         household structure or program. Residents of a facility may also receive medical treatment in addition to
         any nonmedical supportive services in a residential or congregate care setting, as opposed to a
         hospital. Group housing facilities, except those located in a single family dwelling with six or fewer persons,
         are subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.12.
While the definition for “group home” implies that group housing facilities with six or fewer persons located in a
single family dwelling are not subject to a conditional use permit, the Zoning Ordinance does not clearly allow them
in all zones allowing single family residential uses. In fact, licensed group care homes are identified specifically as
a conditional use in the RR zone. This is the only reference to licensed group care homes in the Zoning Ordinance.
There are no provisions for group homes of seven or more in any of the zones.

Second Units
The Zoning Ordinance is internally inconsistent in its treatment of second units. Chapter 17.66 (Second Residential
Units) explains that second residential units shall be permitted in all single-family residential districts; however,
second residential units are also listed as conditionally permitted within the UR, OPR, RR, R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones.
Conclusion
In summary, amendments to the City’s Zoning Ordinance are required to address the provision of a variety of
housing types:
       Farmworker/Employee Housing: The Zoning Ordinance does not fully comply with the employee
        housing act in that farm employee housing is not permitted in all zones allowing agricultural uses, and
        employee housing for six or fewer is not expressly permitted in all zones allowing single family uses.
       Single Room Occupancy: Single room occupancy facilities are not defined in the Zoning Ordinance.
       Group Homes: The provisions for group homes should be clarified and amended to fully comply with
        State law.
       Second Units: The Zoning Ordinance should be amended to remove inconsistencies and clarify that second
        units are permitted in all zones allowing single family uses.
Recommended Action
The Housing Element includes an action to amend the Zoning Ordinance to address farmworker and employee
housing, single room occupancy units, group homes, and second units.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
On- Off-Site Improvement Standards
Analysis
The City of Kerman requires that developers complete certain site improvements in conjunction with new housing
development. The following improvements are required for residential subdivisions according to Title 16 of the
Municipal Code:
        Streets and highways must be graded and surfaced prior to the issuance of any building permit. This includes
         the extension of all subdivision streets, highways, or public ways to the intercepting paving line of any
         county road, city street, or State highway.
        All underground utilities, sanitary sewers, and storm drains in streets, service roads, alleys, or highways
         must be constructed prior to the surfacing of such streets.
        Street infrastructure including curb and gutters, sidewalks, streetlights, street signs, and fire hydrants must
         be installed.
Local streets comprise the majority of the residential street network in Kerman, in contrast to major and secondary
arterial and collector streets. The City’s standards for local street right-of-ways is 60 feet, with a curb-to-curb
pavement width of 36 to 40 feet, having two lanes, and on-street parallel parking on both sides of the street.
Residential projects within the Smart Development Combining Zone District may reduce local street right-of-ways
to 50 feet, with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 32 feet. This reduces the cost of street infrastructure and provides
more buildable area in a subdivision. Several existing single family residential project were developed with this
reduced standard and the City has approved several subdivision maps within the SD Zone District.
Conclusion
These off-site standards do not act as an impediment to the production of housing for lower income households.
Installation of these off-site improvements is considered a “cost of doing business.” From the City’s vantage point,
these improvements are necessary to ensure that Kerman is built in a manner that benefits residents of the
subdivision and the city as a whole.
Recommended Action
None required.
Fees and Exactions
Analysis
Various fees and improvements are charged by the City to cover costs of processing permits and providing services
and facilities, such as utilities, parks, and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are charged on a pro-rata share
system, based on the magnitude of the project’s impact or the extent of benefit. Table 2F-12 shows the typical
planning fees for market-rate residential development in Kerman.

In addition to the typical planning fees, several regional fees are also charged for residential development: Regional
Transportation Mitigation and Indirect Source Review. For school fees, the Kerman Unified School District
assesses a school impact fee of $4.47 per square foot on all new residential development. Currently, there
are no exemptions from the school impact fee, however, the school board will review and consider requests
for exemption from the fee.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
The City also charges development impact fees for all new residential projects. Table 2F-13 shows typical planning,
environmental, and development impact fees for two prototypical projects: a 100-unit single family subdivision and
a 40-unit multifamily development. The estimated construction cost for the single family prototype unit before
permit fees is about $200,000. The plan check, permit, and impact fees account for an additional sum of $27,778,
or approximately 7 percent of the estimated construction cost. The multi-family prototype is a 40-unit, two-story
multi-family housing development. The estimated construction cost for the multi-family prototype before permit
and impact fees is roughly $170,000 per unit. In summary, the fees for plan check, permits, and development impact
total $19,686 per unit. This constitutes approximately 9 percent of the estimated construction cost.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
In creating a development fee structure, Kerman carefully balanced the need to offset the cost of public services
with a level of fees that do not inhibit residential development. As a means of reducing the cost impact of paying
these fees upfront, the City allows deferred payment of fees–including Quimby/Park Development and Parking In-
Lieu Fees–at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued for any of the residential units. The City has also provided
fee waivers for several affordable housing developments.
Conclusion
City development impact fees are an estimated 7 to 9 percent of the total development costs for both single family
and multifamily development. These fees are similar to or lower than many other communities in the region. The
City makes every effort to work with developers to offset the cost of fees.
Recommended Action
None required.
Processing and Permit Procedures
Analysis
The development review process in the City of Kerman is governed by three levels of decision-making bodies: the
Planning and Development Services Department, the Planning Commission, and the City Council.
Single family, multifamily, and mixed-use residential projects are reviewed by the Planning and Development
Services Department through the Site Plan Review process using applicable development standards, design
guidelines, and the City’s General Plan. The Planning and Development Services Department reviews development
proposals for land-use applicability, environmental impacts, aesthetic value, architectural style, and landscape to
ensure a quality physical and environmental design. Any required environmental assessment is conducted
concurrent with the planning analysis.
State law requires that a jurisdiction’s legislative body make project decisions. In the City of Kerman this body is
the City Council. The City Council can adopt ordinances to delegate authority to other review bodies such as the
Planning Commission. Approval of minor land use permits was delegated to the Planning Director (e.g., Site Plan
Permits). A Site Plan Permit is approved by the Planning Director at an administrative level. A hearing before the
Planning Commission will only occur when a hearing is requested by the applicant or other interested persons. If
no hearing is requested, the decision of the Planning Director approving the Site Plan Permit is final.
The Planning Commission reviews all discretionary projects that require an entitlement for a General Plan
Amendment, zone change, variance, conditional use permit, subdivision, and/or specific plan. The Commission acts
both as an advisory body to the City Council as well as a final decision-making body. The City Council acts as the
appellant body for any decisions made by the Planning Commission.

                                                                                   APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
The permit requirements for residential uses depend on the type of project and the land use category. In the
Multifamily land use category, projects with 40 or fewer units can be approved with only ministerial review (i.e.,
Site Plan Review). Projects with 41 or more units require a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and are reviewed by the
Planning Commission. The purposes of discretionary review (CUP) are the following:
        To enable design review in accordance to community design plans and guidelines;
        To allow the City to modify development standards for housing development when necessary and
         appropriate,;
        To mitigate potential environmental impacts of development; and
        To ensure that the development will not adversely impact existing water supplies and sewer treatment
         capacity.
The Planning Commission’s approval of a CUP must be based on the following findings:
    1.   That the proposed establishment, maintenance, operations of the use applied for will not be detrimental to
         the public health, safety, welfare, morals of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such
         proposed use, or whether it will be injurious or detrimental to property and improvements in the
         neighborhood or the city;
    2.   That the proposed use is consistent with the Kerman general plan;
    3.   That the environmental document prepared as per the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) has
         been considered prior to a decision;
    4.   That the site for the proposed use is adequate in size, shape and location to accommodate the use as it
         relates to the district for which the use is proposed.
While larger multifamily projects could be constrained by the requirement of a CUP, recent affordable housing
project approvals show that the CUP requirement is not overly burdensome. Two recent affordable multi-family
housing projects were approved by the Planning Commission within 2 to 3 months from the date the application
was deemed complete. These projects include a 44 unit project (Kearney Palms Senior Apartments) and a 68 unit
project (Hacienda Heights Apartments).

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
The discretionary process allows Planning Commissioners to review site layout and design and project features in
accordance with design standards. In 2014 the City adopted Residential Design Guidelines to help streamline and
clarify the review and evaluation of project proposals. The City encourages applicants to contact the Development
Services Department early in the project planning and design process to discuss key issues particular to their specific
site. The City requests that applicants submit a conceptual site plan to Planning Staff prior to submittal of a formal
application to assess the project for conformance with the Guidelines prior to formal consideration by the Planning
Commission and City Council. Decision makers use the guidelines as a framework for evaluating the design of
development proposals. The City provides clear guidance to project applicants. The design review is limited to the
design of the project and not the underlying land use. It is not considered a constraint on development.
Permit processing times vary depending on whether the project is ministerial (staff approval without a public
hearing) or discretionary (public hearing required). The typical processing time for housing development in 2014
was three months for ministerial projects and six to nine months for conditional use permits. All ministerial and
discretionary residential projects are reviewed by several City departments prior to staff approval or a public
hearing.
The Planning Department reviews projects for compliance with the General Plan and the State Subdivision Map
Act and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Public Works Department reviews the project for
its effect on roads, drainage, and City water and sewer capacity and supply. The North Central Fire Protection
District insures that fire safety standards are met.
Table 2F-14 describes typical permit processing timelines for projects.

Smart Development projects are processed just like tentative subdivision maps and zoning ordinance amendments,
the procedures of which are outlined above. These types of projects are typically processed within a six to seven-
month time period. The processing time is reduced if the property is already inside the city limits. The staff and
Commission review of Smart Development projects usually takes longer because there is more extensive review of
the design details included in the submittal package. However, with the additional review by staff, Commission,
and Council, the community is getting a better-designed residential product. This additional review will benefit the
community in the long-term.

Mixed-Use projects are processed as a conditional use permit. This procedure is also outlined above. As with Smart
Development projects, the staff’s and Commission’s review of mixed-use projects usually takes longer because
there is more extensive review of the design details included in the submittal package. However, with the additional
review by staff, Commission and Council, the community is getting a better-designed development product that
will benefit the community in the long-term.
The above discussion of cost and time necessary to process and approve City discretionary permits shows that the
CUP process is reasonable. However, the Housing Element includes a program to track the time and cost associated
with processing use permits for housing projects to monitor the impact of these processes, and look for ways to
streamline permits for housing. The Housing Element also includes a program to modify the use permit findings to
remove the reference to “morals.”
Conclusion
As a small city with limited development, Kerman does not experience the backlogs in development typical in many
larger jurisdictions. In most cases, even when Planning Commission or City Council review is required, approval
can be obtained in about three to five months. Small projects, such as single family units, may receive over-the-
counter approval with a simple site plan. While larger multifamily projects could be constrained by the requirement
of a CUP, recent affordable housing project approvals show that the CUP requirement is not overly burdensome.
Two recent affordable multifamily housing projects were approved by the Planning Commission within two to three
months from the date the application was deemed complete. These projects include a 44-unit project (Kearney
Palms Senior Apartments in 2010) and a 68-unit project (Hacienda Heights Apartments in 2011). A typical project
requiring only administrative site plan permit incorporating 40 units or less would take approximately the same
amount of time to process (1.5 to 2.5 months) as a CUP project would take.
For example, most of the conditions for a 68-unit multifamily apartment project approved in 2009 consisted mostly
of code requirements such as fire safety (as required by California Fire Code), air quality (as required by the Air
Pollution Control District), landscaping, fencing, and road improvements (as required by Public Works). However,
the discretionary review process also provided the Planning Commission the opportunity to allow three concessions
or incentives related to site design and layout.
Recommended Action
None required.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
Building Codes
Analysis
The City of Kerman has adopted the 2013 California Building Code. The City has not made any local amendments
that impact residential development. The City of Kerman Code Enforcement Officer works with the Police
Department, Fire Department, Planning Department, and Building Department to investigate reported violations of
laws relating to nuisances and zoning. Such investigations typically include illegal home occupations, illegal units,
dangerous structures, fence violations, illegal signs, graffiti, debris, and weeds, as well as inoperable and illegal
vehicles. The code enforcement process is typically initiated in the following three ways: 1) observation by City
staff, 2) as a consequence of an action (i.e. application for permit); or 3) in response to a complaint by an individual.
The City relies on residents to help identify the majority of the code violations, particularly with the budget cuts
and reduced staffing and resources.
Conclusion
The City has not made any local amendments to the Code that would impact the cost of housing.
Recommended Action
None required.
Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Analysis
California Building Code
As previously stated, the City follows the 2013 California Building Code. The code provides the minimum standards
for accessibility. There are currently no amendments to the Building Codes that would diminish the ability to
accommodate persons with disabilities or effect accessibility.
Definition of Family
The Kerman Zoning Ordinance defines family as:
          "Family" means one or more persons occupying a premises and living as a single housekeeping unit as
          distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, fraternity or sorority house. The family shall be deemed
          to include necessary servants.
This definition complies with State law.
Zoning and Land Use Policies
As described above, the provisions for group homes in the Zoning Ordinance should be clarified and amended to
fully comply with State law.

Reasonable Accommodation
The City does not currently have a formal process to grant reasonable accommodation requests. The Zoning
Ordinance must be amended to establish a formal reasonable accommodations process.
Conclusion
Amendments to the City’s Zoning Ordinance are required to address group homes and provide for reasonable
accommodation procedures.
Recommended Action
The Housing Element includes an action to amend the Zoning Ordinance to address group homes and adopt a
reasonable accommodation ordinance.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
SECTION 2F-4: REVIEW OF PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The previous Housing Element covered a planning period of July 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015 (as extended from
June 30, 2013 by SB 375). However, the City of Kerman has not pursued the adoption of a Housing Element since
the 1990s. The last official Housing Element was adopted in June 1993 for the second update cycle. Given the
outdated status of the 1993 Housing Element (more than 20 years old) and many of the programs and policies
contained in that Housing Element have long become obsolete, this evaluation focuses on the City’s current efforts
in the areas of new construction, rehabilitation, and housing assistance in general.
Progress Toward the RHNA
Each jurisdiction in California is responsible for accommodating its share of the region’s housing needs. The process
of determining each jurisdiction’s share of housing needs is called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(RHNA). The RHNA projection period for the previous Housing Element was from January 1, 2006 to June 30,
2013. The City of Kerman was assigned a RHNA of 359 units, divided into four income categories:
         Very Low-Income (less than 50 percent of the Area Median Income): 91 units
         Low-Income (50 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income): 72 units
         Moderate-Income (80 to 120 percent of the Area Median Income): 72 units
         Above Moderate-Income (greater than 120 percent of the Area Median Income): 124 units
Table 2F-15 summarizes the City’s accomplishments in meeting the RHNA during the previous RHNA projection
period. A total of 640 new units have been constructed in Kerman since January 1, 2006. The City more than met
its fair share of the lower-income housing need during the planning period.

Facilitating Affordable Housing
There were several new affordable housing developments have been built in Kerman in the past decade:
        Kearney Palms Senior Apartments: 80 affordable units (2006);
        Kearney Palms Phase II: 20 lower-income units (2009);
        Kerman Acre (Granada Commons) Apartments: 16 lower-income units (2010);
        Kearney Palms Senior Apartments Phase III: 43 lower-income units (2012); and
        Hacienda Heights Apartments: 68 lower-income units (2012).
The City provided assistance to facilitate development of these units. Prior to the dissolution of the Redevelopment
Agency, the Agency provided funding to support these developments. The City also provided fee waivers and fee
deferrals to help make the projects more financially feasible. As shown above, the City exceeded its RHNA for
lower-income households during the planning period.
Housing Rehabilitation
The City of Kerman offers housing rehabilitation assistance to homeowners through the County’s Housing
Assistance Rehabilitation Program (HARP). This program provides loans to eligible homeowners for moderate to
substantial home rehabilitation and/or reconstruction projects. Loan funds are designed to address housing code
deficiencies. City staff also serves as the USDA 504 single family housing home repair loan/grant packager for the
City of Kerman. This grant/loan program assists seniors and low-income eligible families in obtaining grants or low
interest loans to make home repairs. The City processes about 10 loans/grants each year.
Homebuyer Assistance
The City also provides homebuyer assistance to low-income households through the County’s Homebuyer
Assistance Program (HAP).
Conclusion
Even though the City did not have a recent Housing Element in place, the City continued to provide assistance to
facilitate the development of affordable housing, and the development of lower-income housing actually exceeded
the RHNA for lower-income units during the prior planning period. The City provided fee waivers and deferrals to
help make affordable housing projects financially feasible, and contributed Redevelopment Agency funds prior to
the dissolution of the Agency. The City has carried forward programs in the 2015 Housing Element to continue to
provide incentives and funding, as available, to continue to facilitate the development of affordable housing. The
City has also included programs to continue to participate in the County’s housing rehabilitation and homebuyer
assistance programs. The City recognizes that having a certified Housing Element will make them eligible for
additional funding programs, and is being proactive by participating in the Multijurisdictional Housing Element
Update effort.

APPENDIX 2F: CITY OF KERMAN
SECTION 2F-5: AT RISK ANALYSIS
There are 491 assisted affordable units in Kerman and 100 units are at risk of expiring in the next 10 years. These
100 units are in one development, Vintage Apartments, which expires in 2021. There have been several new
affordable developments built in the past few years in Kerman, including the Kerman Arce Apartments, Kearny
Palms Senior Apartments Phase III, and Hacienda Heights. The City assisted in the development of several new
affordable units using former Redevelopment Agency funds and by providing fee waivers.
As previously stated, there are three methods to preserve the at-risk units: acquisition and rehabilitation,
replacement, or a rent subsidy.

Acquisition and Rehabilitation
The estimated total cost to acquire and rehabilitate each unit is $117,225. Roughly, the total cost to acquire and
rehabilitate the 100 at-risk units is $11.7 million.
Replacement
To replace the 100 at-risk units, at $170,370 per unit, would cost an estimated $17 million.
Rent Subsidy
Rent subsidies vary based on a resident’s income. As previously stated, the subsidy needed to preserve a unit at an
affordable rent for extremely low-income households would be an estimated $351 per month, or $4,212 per year.
For 30 years, the subsidy would be about $126,360 for one household. Subsidizing all 100 units at an extremely
low-income rent for 30 years would cost an estimated $12.6 million.
The subsidy needed to preserve a unit at an affordable rent for very low-income households would be an estimated
$176 per month or $2,112 per year. For 30 years, the subsidy would be about $63,360 for one household.
Subsidizing all 100 units at a very low-income rent for 30 years would cost an estimated $6.3 million.
The subsidy needed to preserve a unit at an affordable rent for lower-income households would be an estimated
$293 per month, or $3,516 per year. For 30 years, the subsidy would be about $105,480 for one household.
Subsidizing all 100 units at a low-income rent for 30 years would cost an estimated $10.5 million.
