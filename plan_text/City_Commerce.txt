8.1 Introduction to the Element
This Air Quality Element serves as a guide for
improving air quality within Commerce. This
element addresses a wide range of issues related to
the generation of both stationary and mobile
emissions. The primary objective of the Air Quality
Element is to assist ongoing efforts to improve air
quality within the region through the
implementation of applicable plans and regulations.
Towards this end, the city seeks to accomplish the
following through the element’s implementation:
  •  To reduce the emissions from stationary and
     point sources within the city.
                                                                   The Commerce Waste to Energy Plant has
