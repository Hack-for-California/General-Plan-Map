              INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN
The City of Tustin is located in central Orange County and encompasses an area
of 11.08 square miles. The City is bounded on the south by the cities of Irvine and
Santa Ana, on the north by the unincorporated portions of the County of Orange
and the City of Orange, and on the east by unincorporated County territory and
the City of Irvine. Within the context of the larger Southern California region,
Tustin is located approximately two miles north of Orange County's John Wayne
Airport and is transected by two major regional freeways: the I-5 (Santa Ana)
Freeway, divides the City into north and south; and the SR-55 (Costa Mesa)
Freeway, divides westerly portions of the City. The City continues to be a
discernible entity, characterized physically by its strategic crossroads location,
the former Marine Corps Air Station, Tustin, (closed in July 1999), hillside areas
which offer sweeping panoramic views of the Pacific Coast and Saddleback
Mountains, prime commercial, industrial, and residential development, and one
of the oldest historical "old towns" in Orange County. These significant natural
and man-made characteristics provide a commonly acknowledged basis for a
"sense of place". Together, they act as a foundation for Tustin's Future...a
functional desirable and attractive community to live, work or visit.

                           TUSTIN PLANNING AREA
               The Tustin Planning Area consists of approximately 17.26 square
               miles as shown on Figure I-1. This area includes all of the land
               within the City's incorporated boundaries (11.08 square miles), as
               well as the City of Tustin's existing "sphere of influence" (an
               additional 6.2 square miles of unincorporated county area) located
               immediately adjacent to the City's northerly boundaries and
               approved by the Local Agency Formation Commission as Tustin's
               probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area. Two
               smaller additional areas of approximately 115 acres located
               adjacent to the City of Tustin's southeasterly boundary are also
               included in the Tustin Planning Area. Currently within the
               corporate limits of the City of Irvine, a modification to the City's
               existing "sphere of influence" and a municipal reorganization
               would be necessary to make them a part of the City of Tustin.

CITY OF TUSTIN   INTRODUCTION
GENERAL PLAN   3 OCTOBER 1, 2013
TUSTIN’S PAST
               Tustin very likely first appeared as a name on a map as a result of a
               real estate venture by a Petaluma carriage maker, Columbus Tustin.
               Tustin and Nelson O. Stafford, his partner, purchased 1,359 acres of
               the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana in 1868 when the Spanish land
               grant was being partitioned. Tustin took the eastern 839 acres of the
               total and moved to his property in 1870 to build his dream. He
               divided 100 acres into 300 square blocks, laid out streets, and
               provided lots for sale - later giving lots to anyone who would build.
               However, Tustin experienced slow growth in the 1870s, hampered
               by Santa Ana's successful bid for the terminus of the Southern
               Pacific Railroad. Columbus Tustin died in 1883, bitterly
               disappointed at the minimal success of his dream city.
               The land boom of the 1880s brought a second life to Tustin. The
               Tustin Improvement Association established a bank and a large
               hotel. From 1886 to 1895, horse-drawn streetcars ("horse car") ran
               between the Hotel Tustin and Santa Ana. By 1888, the Southern
               Pacific Railroad had established a station in Tustin and started
               running two trains daily to Los Angeles.
               Several prominent pioneers, David Hewes and Sherman Stevens
               among them, came to town in this period, building Victorian
               houses which are still showpieces in town. Sherman Stevens,
               together with C. E. Utt and James Irvine, developed the first
               agricultural acreage on the Irvine Ranch and established the San
               Joaquin Fruit Company. Utt established one of the City's earliest
               industries, the Utt Juice Company, and was one of Tustin's major
               developers. Hewes, who made his fortune in San Francisco before
               settling in Tustin, is renowned as the man who conceived the
               ceremony and donated the golden spike used to complete the first
               transcontinental railroad.
               The successes of the 1880s were reversed by the Panic of 1893
               which led to the demise of several businesses in town and closure
               of the bank (1902). With the new century came a gradual rebuilding
               of the economy and the successful additions of the First National
               Bank of Tustin (1911), the Tustin Lumber Company, Tustin Garage,
               Tustin Hardware, Piepers Feed Store, the Utt Juice Company, and
               three large citrus association packing houses.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                         INTRODUCTION
GENERAL PLAN                                4                          OCTOBER 1, 2013

               The City of Tustin incorporated in 1927 as a small agricultural
               community of approximately 200 acres and 900 residents, making
               Tustin the third oldest city in Orange County. Development in the
               community was slow at first due, in part, to the Great Depression
               of the 1930s. Soon after World War II, urban development began to
               increase in Tustin as it did throughout Southern California. In 1942,
               the war brought a new kind of growth to Tustin when the U.S.
               Navy built its Lighter-Than-Air Base on nearby beanfields. By the
               1960s, rising land values and falling grove production induced
               agricultural land owners to sell their land for urban development.
               As a result of new development and annexations, the City's
               population jumped from 2,000 in 1960 to 21,000 in 1970, and has
               continued to grow at a steady pace to reach a 2007 population of
               over 72,500. Growth is expected to continue with the reuse of
               MCAS Tustin for residential, commercial, business, institutional,
               and recreational purposes.
PREVIOUS PLANNING EFFORTS AND NEED FOR A REVISED PLAN
               The City of Tustin adopted its first General Plan in 1966. The Plan
               was prepared as a joint effort between the City of Tustin Planning
               Department and the County of Orange Advanced Planning
               Division. At that time, the Tustin General Plan area consisted of
               20.5 square miles which included the unincorporated area of North
               Tustin. The plan anticipated an optimum or maximum population
               of 100,438 persons within the entire planning area.
               Major changes to State law led to preparation and revisions to
               Tustin's General Plan during the early 1970s. During this period of
               time, General Plan Elements were developed and/or amended
               incrementally. However, the real effectiveness of a City's General
               Plan is contingent upon the practical applicability of the Plan to
               changing priorities and conditions. Monitoring and reevaluating
               the validity of Plan policies and amending the Plan from time to
               time is essential. A comprehensive update of the Plan should be
               undertaken every five years to ensure that the Plan accurately
               reflects City policies, conforms to any changes in State law, reflects
               current court decisions, and provides an integrated and internally
               consistent set of goals and policies designed to reflect the changing
               characteristics and growth of the community. To that end, the
               Tustin City Council authorized a program in February 1991 to
               undertake a comprehensive update of the General Plan which was
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                         INTRODUCTION
GENERAL PLAN                                5                          OCTOBER 1, 2013
               adopted on February 7, 1994. A subsequent General Plan
               amendment was adopted on January 16, 2001, to address changes
               associated with the reuse of MCAS Tustin, which closed in July
               1999.
PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
               California State law requires each City to adopt a comprehensive,
               long-term general plan for its own physical development and any
               land outside its boundaries which bears a relationship to its
               planning activities. In essence, a city's general plan serves as the
               blueprint for future growth and development. As a blueprint for
               the future, the plan must contain policies and programs designed
               to provide decision makers with a solid basis for land use related
               decisions.
               The general plan must address many issues which are directly
               related to and influence land use decisions. In addition to land use,
               State law requires that the plan address circulation, housing, the
               conservation of natural resources, the preservation of open space,
               the noise environment and the protection of public safety (Section
               65302 of the California Government Code). These issues are to be
               discussed to the extent that they apply to a particular jurisdiction.
               The general plan may also cover topics of special or unique interest
               to a city, such as urban design and growth management.
ORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
               The Tustin General Plan has been prepared in accordance with the
               requirements of State law and addresses all issues and topics
               required. The Plan represents a determined effort to examine and
               synthesize trends which make Tustin the city it is today. Even more
               importantly, the Plan is intended to project and direct future
               growth and development.
               The Plan consists of numerous policy maps, diagrams, and text
               which set forth the City's long-range goals and policies, standards,
               and plan programs. The Tustin General Plan is organized into
               seven chapters as follows:

                  Supporting Documentation
                  Several supporting documents were produced during the Tustin
                  General Plan preparation process, including the various Technical
                  Reports and the General Plan Program Environmental Impact
                  Report (Program EIR). These documents provide substantial
                  background information for the General Plan. A joint

                  (EIS/EIR) was prepared for the reuse of MCAS Tustin which also
                  addressed the associated 2001 amendment of the Tustin General
                  Plan.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                                               INTRODUCTION
GENERAL PLAN                                              7                                  OCTOBER 1, 2013

               The preparation of each general plan element was preceded by the
               preparation of a technical report. The technical reports identify
               important background information, issues, and constraints (i.e,
               existing    conditions,   infrastructure     constraints,   funding
               considerations) which were used to guide the formulation of
               General Plan policy.
               The General Plan Program EIR analyzed the potential
               environmental impacts associated with development of the
               planning area guided by the policies and programs contained in the
               General Plan.
               Organization and How to Use the Plan
               Each of the seven General Plan elements follows a similar
               organization:
               o      Introduction
               o      Summary of Issues, Needs, Opportunities and Constraints
               o      Goals and Policies
               o      Element Implementation Program
               The Introduction describes the purpose and focus of the element,
               and also introduces other plans and programs outside of the
               General Plan which may be used to achieve specific General Plan
               goals and the relationship of that element to the other elements of
               the General Plan.
               The Goals and Policies section presents the City's long-term desires
               for the subject area of each element. The goals and policies are
               arranged by issue or subject, and a brief description of philosophy
               or basis behind these objectives precedes each group of goals and
               policies.
               Each element also includes a "plan," to implement General Plan
               policy. For example, the Land Use Element contains a "Land Use
               Plan" which indicates the types and intensities of land use
               permitted city-wide. The "Circulation Plan" in the Circulation
               Element includes a Master Circulation Plan showing streets and
               intersections to be improved and new infrastructure provided to
               meet the circulation needs of City residents and those employed in
               or visiting the City. Wherever possible, each element contains
               maps, diagrams, and tables to illustrate General Plan policy.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                        INTRODUCTION
GENERAL PLAN                             8                            OCTOBER 1, 2013
               A separate implementation section for each element identifies
               programs designed to achieve goals and policies in each General
               Plan element. This Implementation Section should be reviewed and
               updated periodically to help identify specific time frames,
               responsible parties, and specific measures to ensure that General
               Plan policies are implemented.
               The General Plan's organization allows those using the Plan to turn
               to the section that interests them and to quickly obtain a
               perspective on the City's policies on the subject. However, those
               using the Plan should realize that various Plan policies from one
               element to another are interrelated and should be viewed
               comprehensively. Since Plan policies are presented as both written
               statements and policy maps, both text and policy maps must be
               referred to when making planning decisions.
               The General Plan is not a zoning map. The text and policy maps are
               intended to provide general, broad direction for long-range
               planning and should be used as a policy guide only. The Zoning
               Ordinance and Specific Plans, on the other hand, are specific
               implementation mechanisms which must be consistent with the
               goals, policies, and standards contained in the General Plan.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS
               The public plays an important role in both the preparation and
               implementation of the General Plan. Because the Plan reflects
               community goals and objectives, citizen input was essential in
               identifying issues and formulating goals. Public participation in the
               General Plan preparation process occurred through the following
               methods which assisted City decision makers:
               o      Issues identification through a mail survey distributed to
                      25,000 households and businesses in the City. The survey
                      questionnaire was divided into 12 questions to assess
                      general satisfaction with Tustin as a place to live, desires
                      regarding future employment and population growth,
                      quality of life priorities, methods for providing affordable
                      housing, and improving neighborhoods, desires for
                      recreational opportunities, and other issues. Responses
                      generally indicated high satisfaction with the City. Several
                      key areas of concern were identified, including: increased

                    Planning Department);
                o   Two public "Open House" sessions held early in the process
                    to solicit input for issues identification and goal formulation;
                o   Opportunities to publicly address decision makers directly
                    regarding issues, concerns, and desires at Planning
                    Commission and Joint City Council/Planning Commission
                    General Plan Workshops, both prior to preparation and
                    during review of the Preliminary Draft General Plan; and
                o   Public review and comment on the Draft General Plan and
                    its supporting documents during public hearings held before
                    the City's Planning Commission and City Council.
                o   For the 2001 amendment of the General Plan associated with
                    the reuse of MCAS Tustin, a public "Open House" was held
                    to review the Draft Amendment, followed by public
                    hearings held before the City's Planning Commission and
                    City Council.
GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
As amendments to the General Plan are considered and adopted by the City, a
general description of each should be identified and added as an attachment to
the Introduction to the Plan. Amendment of Table 1-2 as an attachment to the
Introduction Chapter below will not require an amendment to the General Plan.

           INTRODUCTION TO THE LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is a guide to the allocation of land use in the City and
provides a framework or context for the issues and subject areas examined in the
other Elements of the General Plan.
PURPOSE OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
               The purpose of the Land Use Element is to describe present and
               planned land use activity, and to address issues concerning the
               relationship between land uses and environmental quality, potential
               hazards, and social and economic objectives. The Element identifies
               the general distribution and location of residential and non-residential
               land uses, as well as quantifiable density and building intensity. The
               Land Use Element constitutes official City policy for the location of
               various land uses, and provides guidance to ensure orderly growth
               and development.
               Goals and policies included in the Land Use Element establish a
               constitutional framework for future land use planning and decision
               making. The Land Use Plan portion of the Element promotes the
               achievement of these goals by establishing logical, organized land use
               patterns and standards for future land use. The Plan accomplishes this
               through the use of descriptive text, tables, charts, and maps.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               The Land Use Element includes the City's goals and policies for the
               long-term growth, development and revitalization of Tustin. The
               Element contains text describing land use goals and policies,
               descriptions of land use types, a Land Use Policy Map, and a
               statistical summary of the City's future land use composition. A
               primary component of this Element is the Land Use Plan Policy Map
               which graphically identifies future planned land uses within the
               planning area. The Land Use Element contains a narrative description
               of the land use designations depicted on the Land Use Plan Policy
               Map.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                       LAND USE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               1                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               The Land Use Element Technical Memorandum, published prior to
               the preparation of the Land Use Element, is a supporting background
               document that contains quantitative information about the
               composition of land use in Tustin in 1991. This technical
               memorandum may be updated periodically to maintain a data base of
               current land use conditions in the planning area.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               There are a number of state, regional, and county plans and programs
               which relate to land use in the City. These plans and programs
               include the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
               Growth Management Plan, the South Coast Air Quality Management
               Plan (SCAQMP), the Orange County Growth Management Plan, and
               the Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) for John Wayne
               Airport. Each of these plans is briefly described below.
               SCAG Growth Management Plan
               The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends ways to redirect
               the region's growth in order to minimize congestion and better protect
               the environment. While SCAG has no authority to mandate
               implementation of its Growth Management Plan, some of the Plan's
               principal goals (such as improved jobs/housing balance) have
               implications for the land use composition of the City and are being
               implemented through the South Coast Air Quality Management Plan
               (SCAQMP) under the implementation authority of the South Coast
               Air Quality Management District.
               South Coast Air Quality Management Plan
               The South Coast AQMP mandates a variety of measures to reduce
               traffic congestion and improve air quality, Air Quality is included as a
               sub-element to the Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Element of
               the Tustin General Plan to fulfill AQMP requirements. The City's
               Land Use Element organizes land uses in relation to the circulation
               system, and present policy promotes commercial and industrial land
               uses with convenient access to transportation.

GENERAL PLAN                              2                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               Orange County Growth Management Plan Element
               The purpose of the Orange County Growth Management Plan
               Element is to ensure that the planning, management and
               implementation of traffic improvements and public facilities are
               adequate to meet the current and projected needs of Orange County.
               The Plan establishes the following five major policies:
               1.     Development Phasing: Development will be phased according
                      to Comprehensive Phasing Plans (CPPs) adapted by the
                      County. Phasing will be linked to roadway and public facility
                      capacities.
               2.     Balanced Community Development: Development will be
                      balanced to encourage employment of local residents and both
                      employment and employee housing, in the County as well as
                      in individual Growth Management Areas (GMAs).
               3.     Traffic Level of Service: Future development creates the need
                      for improvements to major intersections significantly impacted
                      by growth, and a developer fee program is included to pay for
                      improving affected intersection on a pro-rata basis.
               4.     Traffic Improvement Programs: The Plan requires
                      comprehensive traffic improvement program to ensure that all
                      new development provides necessary transportation facilities
                      and intersection improvements as a condition of development
                      approval.
               5.     Public Facility Plans: The Plan requires comprehensive public
                      facility plans for fire, sheriff/police, and library services. New
                      development participates on a pro-rata basis.
               Implementation of the Plan involves the establishment of: (1) Growth
               Management Areas (GMAs) to implement Comprehensive Phasing
               Plans; (2) Facility Implementation Plans to address the financing of
               public facilities for each GMA; (3) county-wide implementation and
               evaluation of compliance with development phasing and
               improvements; and (4) traffic improvement/public facility
               development agreements.

GENERAL PLAN                                 3                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               Land Use Element policy calls for development and public facilities
               provision to be managed and balanced, so that the City receives the
               benefits of growth without experiencing unnecessary negative
               impacts.
               Airport Environs Land Use Plan for Orange County
               The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) for Orange County has
               responsibility under state law for formulating a comprehensive
               airport land use plan (ALUP) for the anticipated growth of each
               public use airport and its surrounding vicinity. General Plans for cities
               affected by an ALUP must be consistent with that plan. The purpose
               of the ALUP is to safeguard the general welfare of the inhabitants
               within the vicinity of airports and to ensure the continued operation
               of the airports. The ALUC for Orange County has adopted the Airport
               Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) governing John Wayne Airport,
               AFRC Los Alamitos Fullerton Airport, and Heliports. Three issues
               areas in the AELUP are addressed in the City's General Plan: noise,
               safety, and building height. The Noise and Safety Elements of the
               General Plan address noise and safety, while the Land Use Element
               addresses building height.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
               The Land Use Element is the key element of any General Plan because
               it has the broadest scope of the mandated elements required in a
               General Plan. The Element must be prepared with the full knowledge
               and consideration of the information/ policies contained in other
               General Plan Elements. Specifically, the Land Use Element relates to
               the Housing Element by defining the extent and density of future
               residential development in the City. The Land Use Element is also
               coordinated with the Open Space/Conservation/ Recreation Element,
               in that open space resources are designated on the Land Use Plan
               Policy Map, and environmental factors are considered in the location
               of land use types. The Land Use Element relates to the Safety and
               Noise Elements by integrating their land use recommendations
               pertaining to public safety and noise constraints into detailed policies
               which apply to specific geographic locations. The Circulation and
               Land Use Elements are interrelated in that specific land use decisions
               depend upon traffic routes and circulation patterns. Finally, the Land

               Use Element defines the amount of development permitted to occur,
               coupled with the Growth Management Element which establishes
               policies and procedures to ensure development occurs at a rate
               consistent with the availability of infrastructure and public services to
               support such development.

      SUMMARY OF ISSUES, NEEDS, OPPORTUNITIES AND
                                CONSTRAINTS
The Land Use Element establishes policy which is reflected in all the other General
Plan elements. The following land use issues, needs, opportunities, and constraints
have been identified in Tustin, and are addressed in the goals and policies which
follow in the next section.
BALANCED DEVELOPMENT IN TUSTIN
               o     There is a lack of commercial services in certain geographic
                     areas, such as the Irvine Business Center, which warrants
                     consideration of additional commercial designations.
               o     Land use patterns encourage Tustin residents to rely on the
                     automobile to commute to work and shopping.
               o     The City has the opportunity to purchase surplus freeway
                     parcels and develop them with uses which capitalize on their
                     freeway accessibility.
               o     The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan/Reuse Plan will continue to
                     guide future development on approximately 1,533 acres in the
                     City of Tustin (Tustin Legacy).
               o     The annexation of certain areas in North Tustin could establish
                     more logical City boundaries.
               o     Hillside areas within the City's sphere of influence may be
                     subject to slope instability. In the event of annexation,
                     significant infrastructure deficiencies, where they exist, shall be
                     mitigated to the extent feasible.
COMPATIBLE AND COMPLEMENTARY DEVELOPMENT
               o     The intermixing of land uses in some areas without adequate
                     buffering has resulted in land use incompatibilities, such as
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                      LAND USE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               6                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
                  those related to physical scale, noise, and traffic. Specific types
                  and examples of incompatible land uses include the following:
                     obtrusive industrial uses adjacent to residential
                      development;
                     commercial uses abutting residential development without
                      adequate buffering;
                     high density residential adjacent to lower residential
                      densities without adequate buffering;
                     noise sensitive uses adjacent to freeways, highways and
                      railroads.
               o  New development, if not regulated, can interfere with public
                  vistas and views of the surrounding hillsides, public
                  monuments, and other important viewsheds.
REVITALIZATION OF OLDER COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND
RESIDENTIAL USES AND PROPERTIES
               o  While most of Tustin's housing stock is in good condition,
                 certain neighborhoods, such as the Southwest area of the City,
                 are in need of concentrated rehabilitation and code enforcement
                 efforts.
               o  Tustin contains numerous historically and architecturally
                 significant structures whose maintenance and preservation is
                 important to the heritage of the community.
               o  Some of the City's older residential areas are impacted by
                 adjacent freeways, commercial and industrial land uses.
               o  Some of the City's older commercial and industrial uses are
                 either in need of upgrading or replacement.
IMPROVED CITY-WIDE URBAN DESIGN
               o  Although Tustin has many individual assets, the City needs to
                  develop an integrated overall image that clearly connects the
                  best parts of the community.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                           7                           NOVEMBER 20, 2012

               o Many of Tustin's strip commercial corridors exhibit a
                 fragmented land use pattern and lack of design continuity.
               o With the exception of several recent commercial centers, the
                 City's commercial districts are in need of reinforced landscape
                 character, stronger design coordination, improved circulation
                 and parking linkages, outdoor pedestrian spaces, and higher
                 quality architecture and signage.
               o Tustin's design standards for multi-family development need
                 to be strengthened to provide for greater private and public
                 open space, and better buffering between adjacent
                 incompatible land uses.
               o The developing and changing industrial/R&D districts are
                 transforming the southern part of Tustin, and are in need of
                 standards to ensure high quality design.
ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND DIVERSIFICATION
               o In order to create a better jobs/housing balance, efficient
                 utilization of commercial and industrial designated properties
                 is crucial.
               o To keep Tustin's retail space competitive, retail development
                 should be focused in "centers" which provide a greater variety
                 of goods and amenities rather than strip commercial
                 developments.
               o The office and hotel markets in Tustin are not competitive with
                 neighboring jurisdictions due to the City's limited supply of
                 these land uses.
DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION WITH PUBLIC FACILITIES AND
SERVICES
               o As new development continues to occur in Tustin and existing
                 uses intensify, adequate public facilities and services - such as
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                          8                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
                 fire and police protection, flood control, educational and
                 recreational opportunities - must be available to accommodate
                 future development.
DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN EAST TUSTIN
               o The opportunity exists in East Tustin to ensure hillside
                 development protects the natural terrain, and that significant
                 open space resources (such as the eucalyptus windrows and
                 stand of redwoods) are preserved.
               o In an area as large as East Tustin, the provision of land uses
                 which support the resident population to minimize travel
                 distances to shopping, recreation and service uses.
               o Important viewsheds in East Tustin, including the Peters
                 Canyon ridgeline, the redwood/cedar grove, the knoll, and
                 major tree stands, should be protected from intrusion.
DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN OLD TOWN/FIRST STREET AREA
               o Old Town Tustin lost its focus as the community's commercial
                 center years ago due to the development of competing
                 commercial corridors outside this district.
               o The unique qualities of Old Town have yet to be fully
                 capitalized on to create a vital commercial district.
               o The integration of residential uses in Old Town could provide
                 increased market support for retail and commercial uses, and
                 could improve the vitality of the district.
               o Much of the First Street corridor exhibits a fragmented pattern
                 of land use, and many of the buildings are in need of facade
                 improvements.

DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN THE PACIFIC CENTER EAST AREA
               o The Pacific Center East Area, including the Warner Business
                 Park to the south, lacks a unified development image.
               o Through the development of office, hotel and business park
                 uses in Pacific Center East, the City has substantial
                 opportunities to expand its economic base.
               o Opportunities exist for freeway-oriented development adjacent
                 to SR-55 and the existing and planned northbound (eastside)
                 ramps to SR-55.
NORTH TUSTIN (UNINCORPORATED AREA)
               o The unincorporated North Tustin area has a well developed
                 low-density semi-rural character which would expand the
                 scope of housing availability and add a valuable housing
                 diversity to the City.
               o To preserve the low density semi-rural character, there is a
                 need to ensure that any infill development is compatible and
                 complimentary to this existing community.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER OF FORMER MCAS TUSTIN
(TUSTIN LEGACY)
               o Given the size and location of the site, there is an opportunity
                 for continued reuse and development to create a distinct area
                 of unique character, to provide uses which meet broad
                 community needs, and to accommodate a mix of uses
                 responsive to market demand which also advance regional
                 goals for jobs/housing balance.
               o There is an opportunity to continue to create immediate
                 interim uses and reuse of many existing buildings and facilities
                 at the site to facilitate conversion of the installation from its
                 former military use to civilian use.

               o There is a constraint on future aviation uses of land due to
                 impacted airspace (i.e. John Wayne Airport) and a community
                 desire to see only limited and interim aviation uses on the site.
               o The opportunity exists to provide open space as visual and
                 recreational amenities on the site.
               o Planned land uses need to continue to be integrated with
                 existing facilities within the site and with surrounding
                 development in adjacent communities.
               o Architectural design of the highest quality is desired for new
                 development.
               o Streetscape design, site planning techniques, and pedestrian
                 and bicycle linkages should continue to reinforce relationships
                 between uses on the site.
               o Communities entries, landscape design along the boundaries
                 of the site, signage and design vistas in and through the site are
                 needed to continue to create a strong visual identify.

             LAND USE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies contained in the Land Use Element provide the framework
for land use planning and decision-making in the City. They are an outgrowth of
issues, needs, opportunities and constraints identified during preparation of the
General Plan including concerns of Tustin residents and selection of the preferred
growth alternative. They reflect the direction and image the City seeks for the
future. The goals and policies of this element are intended to:
o      Achieve balanced development;
o      Ensure that compatible and complementary development occurs;
o      Revitalize older commercial, industrial, and residential development;
o      Improve city-wide urban design;
o      Promote economic expansion and diversification;
o      Coordinate development with the provision of adequate public facilities and
       services;
o      Ensure that the development character of East Tustin is compatible with the
       surrounding man-made and natural environment;
o      Strengthen the development character and mixture of uses in the Old
       Town/First Street area; and
o      Promote an integrated business park character for the Pacific Center East
       area.
o      Continue to implement the reuse plan for MCAS Tustin which maximizes the
       appeal of the site as a mixed-use, master planned development.

               balance between the City's revenue generation needs and service
               provision responsibilities.
               GOAL 1: Provide for a well balanced land use pattern that
               accommodates existing and future needs for housing, commercial
               and industrial land, open space and community facilities and
               services, while maintaining a healthy, diversified economy
               adequate to provide future City services.
               Policy 1.1: Preserve the low-density quality of Tustin's existing

               multi-family development to meet regional housing needs where best
               suited from the standpoint of current development, accessibility,
               transportation and public facilities.
               Policy 1.2: Provide for and encourage the development of
               neighborhood-serving commercial uses in areas of Tustin presently
               underserved by such uses. Encourage the integration of retail or
               service commercial uses on the street level of office projects.
               Policy 1.3: Facilitate the development of vacant and underutilized
               freeway parcels with commercial uses where appropriate and
               compatible with surrounding uses to capitalize on their freeway
               access and visibility.
               Policy 1.4: Consider modification of present City boundaries in
               unincorporated areas within the City of Tustin's sphere where they
               are irregular and create inefficiencies.
               Policy 1.5: Encourage compatible and complementary infill of
               previously by-passed parcels in areas already predominately
               developed.
               Policy 1.6: Ensure an adequate supply of commercial and industrial
               land within the City of Tustin for potential commercial and industrial
               expansion and development.
               Policy 1.7: As part of the City's attraction to business and industry,
               provide adequate sites to house future employees.

               Policy 1.8: Provide incentives to encourage lot consolidation and
               parcel assemblage to provide expanded opportunities for coordinated
               development and redevelopment.
               Policy 1.9: Provide development of light industrial and business park
               uses under strict performance development standards. Encourage

               Policy 1.10: Ensure that the distribution and intensity of land uses are
               consistent with the Land Use Plan and classification system.
               Policy 1.11: Where feasible, increase the amount and network of
               public and private open space and recreational facilities which will be
               adequate in size and location to be useable for active or passive
               recreation as well as for visual relief.
               Policy 1.12: Evaluate all future annexation proposals within the City's
               sphere of influence for their potential financial, social and
               environmental impacts on the City of Tustin. The analysis of financial
               impacts shall include preparation of a fiscal impact report which
               provides an analysis of impacts on operating costs and costs
               associated with needed short and long term capital improvements.
               Policy 1.13: Preserve the existing low density character of North
               Tustin single family zoned neighborhoods.
               GOAL 2: Ensure that future land use decisions are the result of
               sound and comprehensive planning.
               Policy 2.1: Consider all General Plan goals and policies, including

               Policy 2.4: Encourage citizen participation in planning and
               development of land use programs.
               Policy 2.5: Foster inter-governmental cooperation and coordination in
               order to maximize the effectiveness of land use policies.
               Policy 2.6: Maintain consistency with the Airport Environs Land Use
               Plan (AELUP) for John Wayne Airport in terms of maximum
               allowable building height, noise levels, safety areas, and other
               applicable standards.
COMPATIBLE AND COMPLEMENTARY DEVELOPMENT
               Intermixing of different land uses can result in incompatibilities
               attributable to differences in traffic levels, noise levels, physical scale,
               and hours of operation. Incompatibility can also occur when the
               characteristics of a specific land use do not match the physical
               characteristics of available land (such as intensive development in
               hillside areas).
               GOAL 3: Ensure that new development is compatible with
               surrounding land uses in the community, the City's circulation
               network, availability of public facilities, existing development
               constraints and the City's unique characteristics and resources.
               Policy 3.1: Coordinate and monitor the impact and intensity of land
               uses in adjacent jurisdictions on Tustin's transportation and
               circulation systems to provide for the efficient movement of people
               and goods with the least interference.
               Policy 3.2: Locate major commercial uses in areas that are easily
               accessible to major transportation facilities.
               Policy 3.3: Allow development clustering in hillside areas when this
               method will better preserve the natural terrain and open character of
               the City.
               Policy 3.4: In designing hillside development, give particular attention
               to maximizing view opportunities, minimizing dangers of geologic
               and soil hazards, minimizing adverse visual impact on surrounding

               areas, ensuring compatibility with the natural environment, to the
               maximum extent possible, and recognize other General Plan policies.
               Policy 3.5: Hillside development should be designed to follow natural
               contours, where possible, and to minimize the amount of land
               alteration. The location and design of structures and access should
               maximize the natural appearance of the hillside areas. Development
               of isolated areas which can only be reached by going through steep
               terrain should be discouraged.
               Policy 3.6: Regulate development in identifiable hazardous areas or in
               areas that are environmentally sensitive.
               Policy 3.7: Encourage the preservation and enhancement of public
               vistas, particularly those seen from public places.
               Policy 3.8: Encourage consolidation of parking and reciprocal access
               agreements among adjacent businesses.
               GOAL 4: Assure a safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing
               community for residents and businesses.
               Policy 4.1: Mitigate traffic congestion and unacceptable levels of noise,
               odors, dust and light and glare which affect residential areas and
               sensitive receptors.
               Policy 4.2: Ensure a sensitive transition between commercial or
               industrial uses and residential uses by means of such techniques as
               buffering, landscaping and setbacks.
               Policy 4.3: Where mixed uses are permitted, ensure compatible
               integration of adjacent uses to minimize conflicts.
               Policy 4.4: Encourage the elimination of non-conforming uses and
               buildings.
               Policy 4.5: Ensure adequate monitoring of those uses which involve
               hazardous materials to avoid industrial accidents, chemical spills,
               fires and explosions.

               Policy 4.6: Maintain and enhance the quality of healthy residential
               neighborhoods, and safeguard neighborhoods from intrusion by non-
               conforming and disruptive uses.
REVITALIZATION OF OLDER COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND
RESIDENTIAL USES AND PROPERTIES
               Revitalization of older residential and non-residential development
               through rehabilitation, preservation, and redevelopment of the
               existing stock of land, landscaping, buildings and public
               infrastructure is necessary to maintain the quality of an urban
               environment.
               GOAL 5: Revitalize older commercial, industrial and residential
               uses and properties.
               Policy 5.1: Encourage and continue the use of redevelopment
               activities, including the provision of incentives for private
               development, joint public-private partnerships, and public
               improvements, in the area.
               Policy 5.2: Provide development incentives to facilitate the
               consolidation of individual parcels along the City's commercial
               corridors.
               Policy 5.3: Encourage the rehabilitation of existing commercial
               facades and signage.
               Policy 5.4: Continue to provide rehabilitation assistance in targeted
               residential neighborhoods to eliminate code violations and enable the
               upgrading of residential properties.
               Policy 5.5: Encourage the restoration and rehabilitation of properties
               in Tustin eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
               Places according to the rehabilitation guidelines and tax incentives of
               the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
               Policy 5.6: Promote vigorous enforcement of City codes, including
               building, zoning, and health and safety, to promote building and

               property maintenance. Prioritize the Southwest area of the City for
               code enforcement.
               Policy 5.7: Continue, as feasible, operation of a graffiti removal
               program to facilitate prompt removal of graffiti on private property.
               Policy 5.8: Improve edge conditions and buffers between older
               residential neighborhoods and adjacent freeway edges and
               commercial and industrial uses.
IMPROVED CITY-WIDE URBAN DESIGN
               As cities grow and mature, individual neighborhoods and districts
               can become either difficult to distinguish or isolated unless strong
               identifiable physical features are emphasized and access between
               areas is strengthened.
               GOAL 6: Improve urban design in Tustin to ensure development
               that is both architecturally and functionally compatible, and to
               create uniquely identifiable neighborhoods, commercial and
               business park districts.
               Policy 6.1: Develop citywide visual and circulation linkages through
               strengthened landscaping, pedestrian lighting, bicycle trails (where
               feasible) and public identity graphics along major street corridors.
               Policy 6.2: Encourage and promote high quality design and physical
               appearance in all development projects.
               Policy 6.3: Improve the image of major highways through the use of
               pedestrian amenities, landscaping, lighting, graphics and/or other on-
               site and streetscape treatments.
               Policy 6.4: Preserve and enhance the City's special residential
               character and "small town" quality by encouraging and maintaining
               Tustin's low density residential neighborhoods through enforcement
               of existing land use and property development standards and the
               harmonious blending of buildings and landscape.

               Policy 7.6: Promote marketing techniques for the continued
               development of Tustin Legacy (MCAS Tustin) to civilian uses which
               will focus on the goals of the Specific Plan/Reuse Plan for the site,
               creating jobs and attracting viable businesses.
DEVELOPMENT COORDINATED WITH PUBLIC FACILITIES AND
SERVICES
               Adequate public facilities and services are essential components of
               urban development. The City must be able to expand its facilities and
               services to accommodate new development, as well as maintaining or
               improving facility and service levels for existing development.
               Providers of services not controlled by City should be encouraged to
               plan to accommodate new development.
               GOAL 8: Ensure that necessary public facilities and services should
               be available to accommodate development proposed on the Land
               Use Policy Map.

               and recreational opportunities and other governmental and municipal
               services. Senate Bill (SB) 50, adopted in 1998, prohibits the City from
               using the inadequacy of school facilities as a basis for denying or
               conditioning the development of property. SB 50, however, gave
               school districts new authority to raise school impact mitigation fees.
               In addition, the voters passed Proposition 1A in November 1998,
               which provides $9.2 billion dollars in bonds to construct new or
               expand existing schools. In summary, school districts have the
               financial means and legal authority to respond to new development.
               Policy 8.2: Define needs and deficiencies that are within the City, and
               introduce priority projects into the City's budget process.
               Policy 8.3: Coordinate and collaborate with other agencies providing
               public utility service to Tustin to define areawide and regional needs,
               projects and responsibilities.
               Policy 8.4: Coordinate the construction of all public utilities to
               minimize disruption of vehicular traffic and negative impacts on
               roadways.

               control and drainage system.
               Policy 8.6: Encourage planned improvements to electricity, natural
               gas, and communication service systems.
               Policy 8.7: To ensure an orderly extension of essential services and
               facilities, and preservation of a free-flowing circulation system,
               continue to require provision of essential facilities and services at the
               developer's expense where these systems do not exist or are not
               already part of the City's financed capital improvement program.
               Policy 8.8: Maintain and improve, where necessary, the City's
               infrastructure and facilities.

DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN EAST TUSTIN
               East Tustin has provided the majority of new residential development
               within the planning area. The planned community approach for
               development of the area achieved a balance between urban use of
               land and maintenance of the natural environment.
               GOAL 9: Continue to provide for a planned community in East
               Tustin compatible with the land use characteristics of the local area
               and sensitive to the natural environment.
               Policy 9.1: Ensure the compatibility of development in East Tustin
               adjacent to existing developed areas.

               incremental growth that is coordinated with the existing adjacent
               development, infrastructure and market opportunities.
               Policy 9.4: Enforce the East Tustin Hillside District Guidelines to
               preserve the natural terrain of Tustin's undeveloped hillsides.
               Policy 9.5: Require graded slopes to undergo permanent re-vegetation
               in a timely manner to minimize chance of erosion and siltation.
               Encourage the use of drought-tolerant and fire resistant plant
               materials.
               Policy 9.6: Retain natural landscape to the maximum extent possible,
               and incorporate planting in new development areas compatible with
               the character and quality of the natural surrounding environment.
               Policy 9.7: Encourage the clustering of development in hillside areas
               to minimize grading impacts and/or retain natural features and
               vegetation.
               Policy 9.8: Encourage clustering of residential uses to minimize
               impacts from noise, flooding, slope instability and other
               environmental hazards.

               Policy 9.9: Site buildings and align roadways to maximize public
               visual exposure to the north-south Peters Canyon ridgeline, the
               redwood/cedar grove, the knoll and major tree stands.
DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN OLD TOWN/FIRST STREET AREA
               The development character of Old Town and the First Street area can
               be significantly enhanced by greater integration of residential uses
               and thriving commercial uses and physical renovations to existing
               buildings and street frontages which promote a pedestrian
               orientation.
               GOAL 10: Improve and strengthen the Tustin Old Town/First Street
               area with a unique pedestrian environment and diverse mix of
               goods, services, and uses.
               Policy 10.1: Improve the Old Town District's identity as the City's
               historical and architectural focus and its contribution to the City's
               economic base.
               Policy 10.2: Review and consider the possible development of
               residential uses in the Old Town area both as individual residential
               projects, and integrated above ground floor retail and office uses.
               Policy 10.3: Encourage outdoor pedestrian spaces, such as courtyards,
               arcades and open landscaped passages, to be integrated into new
               development. Encourage high-quality pedestrian-oriented building
               frontages which open onto these pedestrian spaces and public
               sidewalks.
               Policy 10.4: Develop and use signage to promote a district parking
               concept that emphasizes shared parking facilities. Promote
               improvements which will upgrade circulation and access in the Old
               Town District.
               Policy 10.5: Study the potential expansion of the Cultural Resources
               Overlay District north of First Street to Irvine Boulevard.

               Policy 10.6: Encourage the integration of retail or service commercial
               uses on the street level of office projects through flexibility in site
               development standards.
               Policy 10.7: Encourage the consolidation of individual parcels/
               consolidated site planning and parking and access along First Street
               and in Old Town through utilization of development incentives such
               as reduced parking, height bonus, lot coverage relaxation, allowance
               for secondary uses, fee waivers, and/or financial assistance in land
               acquisition and/or infrastructure improvements.
               Policy 10.8: Encourage rehabilitation of existing facades and signage

               listed within the City’s official historic survey to be preserved and
               used as a residence, or preserved and used as a commercial use
               consistent with the City’s Cultural District Residential Design
               Guidelines and the Secretary of Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation.
DEVELOPMENT CHARACTER IN THE PACIFIC CENTER EAST AREA
               The future image of the Pacific Center East area will consist of a more
               intensive and integrated business park environment. The area's
               distinct location adjacent to SR 55 creates a significant opportunity to
               capitalize on its freeway orientation to achieve regional recognition.
               GOAL 11: Provide for an integrated business park environment in
               the Pacific Center East Area which both capitalizes on market

               Policy 11.1: Provide a wide range of uses and intensities which meet
               the City's future needs for mixed land uses and for a variety of
               facilities and services in the project area, and which capitalize on
               visibility and access of freeway interchange locations.
               Policy 11.2: Create a cohesive architectural image and attractive
               streetscape through implementation of development standards and
               design guidelines to unify the area.

               development to pedestrian functions.
               Policy 11.4: Integrate existing uses, new development and potential
               future redevelopment uses.
               Policy 11.5: Upgrade the edge conditions between industrial/
               business park uses and residential development through private
               development standards and onsite landscaping of industrial/business
               park uses.
NORTH TUSTIN (UNINCORPORATED AREA)
               The North Tustin unincorporated area has a low density, semi-rural
               character. This desirable character is sensitive and vulnerable.
               GOAL 12: Maintain the semi-rural and low-density character of
               North Tustin.
               Policy 12.1: Ensure that any infill development in North Tustin is
               compatible and complimentary to the existing North Tustin
               community.
               Policy 12.2: Review and consider the possible development and
               adoption of pre-zoning designation for the North Tustin
               unincorporated area as part of any annexation proposal.

               qualities seeking to create results that are very special and worthy
               of the site's present and historical importance.
               Policy 13.1: Promote new uses and design which will peacefully
               coexist with surrounding residences and businesses in Tustin and

               other environmental features wherever possible.
               Policy 13.2: Encourage a development pattern that offers a
               connectedness between buildings and uses, and has a strong sense of
               place through architectural style and creative landscape design.

               community needs but which does not drain City resources. Wherever
               possible, tax revenues generated by uses on the site should offset the
               costs of public services.
               Policy 13.5: Promote high quality architecture, landscaping, signage,

               and which are balanced with development that is compatible with the
               Tustin community.
               Policy 13.9: Ensure that land and water are clean and safe to use and
               that other environmental considerations are taken into account during
               design.
               Policy 13.10: Promote a successful transition from military to civilian
               use that reasonably satisfies the public interests at local, countywide,
               regional, state and federal levels consistent with the need for any
               reuse plan to be fiscally sound and to foster economic development.

                           LAND USE POLICY MAPS
The Land Use Policy Maps reflect the application of General Plan goals and policies
to the distribution and intensity of future land uses in the City of Tustin as well as
areas which are within the City's Sphere of Influence. There are three Land Use
Policy Maps which are a part of this Element. They are the Land Use Plan Policy
Map and two Special Management Areas Policy Maps.
LAND USE PLAN AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS
               Figure LU-1 represents the Land Use Plan for the Tustin Planning
               Area. The plan is also reproduced at a larger scale and is available
               from the Tustin Community Development Department. While the
               Land Use Plan describes the general pattern of land uses at build-out,
               the Plan is not a zoning map and should be interpreted as a
               generalized guide to the type, intensity and relationship of land uses.
               Upon adoption of the General Plan, the City will then begin the
               process of modifying the Zoning Ordinance to ensure its consistency
               with the Land Use Plan.
               Land Use Designations
               Land Use designations indicate the type and nature of development
               that is allowed in a given location. While terms like "residential,"
               "commercial" and "industrial" are generally understood, State General
               Plan law requires a clear and concise description of the land use
               categories shown on the Land Use Plan Policy Map.
               The Land Use Element provides for seven major land use groupings
               divided into 15 categories or designations as listed in Table LU-2. Four
               of these designations are established for residential development,
               ranging from low-density single family to high-density multiple
               family development. Three commercial designations, one industrial,
               and one public/ institutional, are included. A planned community
               designation, which includes residential, commercial/business, and
               public institutional components, is also provided. Additionally, a
               separate specific plan designation is

      (a) Maximum allowable level of development standard for individual parcels of land.
      (b) Assumed overall standard level of development. Since the development which has occurred to date has not reached
          the maximum allowed level of density or intensity, future development is expected to be less than the maximum.
          Therefore, an effective level of density/intensity is used when projecting total future dwelling units/population for
          residential development and future square footage for non-residential development where floor area is used as a
          measurement of building intensity.
      (c) Maximum density in dwelling units per acre is prescribed by individual Planned Community documents. Effective
          dwelling units per acre for low, medium, and high density residential is 4.485, 11.834, and 17.39, respectively.

               provided for the reuse of MCAS Tustin. Major transportation facilities
               are included in a single transportation category.
               Land Use Intensity/Density
               State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element indicate
               the maximum intensities/densities permitted within the Land Use
               Plan. The land use designations contained in this element and shown
               on the Land Use Plan Policy Map are described in this way. Table LU-
               2 lists each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use Plan
               and provides a corresponding indication of maximum
               intensity/density of development on that parcel. Maximum allowable
               development on individual parcels of land is to be governed by these
               measures of intensity or density. The table also includes the expected
               or effective overall levels of development within each land use
               designation within the planning area. These standard levels of
               development represent an anticipated intensity/density and are,
               therefore, less than the absolute maximum allowed for an individual
               parcel of land. For various reasons, many parcels in the City have not
               been developed to their maximum intensity/density and, in the
               future, maximum development as described in this Element can be
               expected to occur only on a limited number of parcels.
               Future development on a city-wide basis is expected to occur at the
               effective level of intensity/density stated in Table LU-2. Development
               at an intensity or density between the effective and maximum levels
               can occur only where projects offer exceptional design quality or
               important public amenities or benefits above the standards required
               by the City's Zoning Ordinance and other regulatory documents. For
               the residential land use designations, projects are expected to build to
               a density at least as high as the lowest density allowed by their
               respective designations. The residential categories also include an
               average number of persons per dwelling unit standard as a basis for
               determining the population density.
               A number of terms are used to define the land use designations or
               categories described in this element. The term "intensity" refers to the
               degree of development based on building characteristics such as
               height, bulk, floor area ratio and/or percent of lot coverage. Intensity
               is most often used to describe non-residential development levels, but,
               in a broader sense, is used to express overall levels of all development
               types. The overall intensity of development within the Tustin

               Planning Area is similar to other urbanized areas of Orange County,
               such as Anaheim, Orange, Irvine and Newport Beach.
               For most non-residential land use categories (commercial, industrial,
               public/institutional facilities), the measure of intensity known as
               "floor area ratio" (FAR) provides the most convenient method of
               describing development levels. Simply stated, the floor area ratio is
               the relationship of total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot to the
               total land area of that lot expressed as a ratio. For example, a 20,000
               square foot building on a 40,000 square foot lot yields an FAR of .50:1
               as illustrated in Figure LU-2. The FAR describes use intensity on a lot,
               but not the actual building height, bulk or coverage.
               As Figure LU-2 shows, the .50:1 FAR can yield a building of one story
               in height covering one half of the lot area, or a taller building which
               covers less of the lot and provides more open space.
               The term "density", in a land use context, is a measure of the
               population and residential development capacity of the land. Density
               is described in terms of dwelling units per net acre (du/net ac); thus,
               the density of a residential development of 100 dwelling units
               occupying 20 net acres of land is 5.0 du/net ac. Differences in
               residential land use types generally produce a corresponding
               difference in the number of persons occupying a given type of unit
               (i.e., single family residential uses generally house more persons than
               multiple family units). For purposes of calculating population
               intensity, an average number of persons per dwelling unit for certain
               residential land use designations is assumed as shown in Table LU-2
               and is described in each land use description beginning on page 33.
               Descriptions of each of the land use designations shown on the Land
               Use Policy Map (Figure LU-1) are provided in the following section to
               delineate the general types of uses allowed and their corresponding
               intensities or densities.
               Residential Designations
               Low Density Residential: The Low Density Residential land use
               designation provides for the development of low density single family
               dwellings and accessory buildings. Uses such as second single family
               structures on large lots, guest rooms, public institutional facilities,
               churches, schools, large family day care homes, and others, which are
               determined to be compatible with, and oriented toward serving the

               needs of low density detached single family neighborhoods may also
               be allowed. This designation allows a maximum of seven single
               family units per net acre of land. Areas within the designation can be
               regulated in a Zoning Ordinance with lower densities to reflect the
               existing character. Development in this land use category should
               maintain a low density character with building heights generally not
               exceeding 30 feet.
               This designation allows a maximum of 7 dwelling units per net acre of
               land. Building heights should generally not exceed 35 feet. The
               average population for this residential designation is approximately
               3.39 persons per dwelling unit which represents a population density
               range for this land use designation of 2 to 24 persons per acre. The
               maximum density of this land use category may be exceeded to
               complement General Plan Housing Element Policy, only as approved
               by the City Council, in accordance with the density bonus provisions
               of Section 65915 of the California Government Code.
               Medium Density Residential: The Medium Density Residential land
               use designation provides for the development of a wide range of
               living accommodations including typical single family units, patio
               homes, multiple family dwellings such as duplexes, apartments,
               condominiums, townhomes, cooperatives, and community
               apartments. Uses such as public/institutional facilities, churches,
               schools, and others, which are determined to be compatible with and
               oriented toward serving the needs of medium density neighborhoods
               may also be allowed.
               This designation allows a maximum of 15 dwelling units per net acre
               of land. Building heights should generally not exceed 35 feet. The
               average population for this residential designation is approximately
               2.85 persons per dwelling unit which represents a population density
               range for this land use designation of 2 to 43 persons per acre. The
               maximum density of this land use category may be exceeded to

               determined to be compatible with and oriented toward serving the
               needs of high density neighborhoods may also be allowed.
               This designation allows a maximum of 25 dwelling units per net acre
               of land. The intent of this land use category is to maintain existing
               developed multiple family areas while also providing opportunities
               for recycling of other neighborhoods where maintenance efforts
               would produce minimal results. Building heights should generally
               not exceed 35 feet. The average population for this residential
               designation is approximately 2.24 persons per dwelling unit which
               represents a population density range of 2 to56 persons per acre. The
               maximum density of this land use category may be exceeded to
               complement General Plan Housing Element Policy, only as approved
               by the City Council, in accordance with the density bonus provisions
               of Section 65915 of the California Government Code.
               Mobile Home Park: The Mobile Home Park land use designation
               provides for the development of mobile home parks subject to certain
               zoning restrictions. This designation allows a maximum of 10
               dwelling units per net acre of land with an average population of
               approximately 2.24 persons per dwelling unit which represents a
               population density range for this land use designation of 2 to 22
               persons per acre.
               Commercial Designations
               Community Commercial: The Community Commercial designation
               is characterized by a variety of miscellaneous retail, professional
               office, and service-oriented business activities, many of which are
               highway oriented and serve a community-wide area and population.
               Community Commercial uses serve local, as well as broad market
               areas and generally include professional and business offices, retail
               and commercial services, child care, restaurants, and public/
               institutional facilities, along with larger-scale indoor commercial uses
               such as department stores, furniture and appliance outlets, theaters
               and entertainment uses. Site development standards for this land use
               category should encourage large projects and provide for adequate
               setbacks, parking, landscaping, buffering from residential land use
               areas and other features which will create well designed, efficient and
               attractive projects. The standard intensity of development is a floor
               area ratio of 0.4:1 and the maximum intensity of development is a
               floor area ratio of 0.5:1.

               Old Town Commercial: The Old Town Commercial designation
               includes retail, professional office, and service-oriented business
               activities which serve Old Town and surrounding areas. Old Town
               Commercial use generally include professional and business offices,
               retail and commercial services, restaurants, and public/institutional
               facilities, along with larger scale indoor uses such as department
               stores, furniture and appliance outlets, theaters and entertainment
               uses. Other uses (such as residential uses) which support this land use
               may be permitted subject to the discretion of the City. The standard
               intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.5:1 and the
               maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 1.0:1. To
               ensure compatibility of land uses permitted within the classification,
               with the character of surrounding development and within a
               development area itself, location, land use type, density and building
               intensity standards will be specifically be governed by Planned
               Community District provisions or adoption of a Specific Plan as
               authorized by the California Government Code. This includes the
               maximum densities for any residential uses determined desirable by
               the Planning Commission or City Council, as applicable. The overall
               population density range for residential use within the Old Town
               Commercial designation is 2 to 54 persons per acre.
               Professional Office: The Professional Office designation provides
               areas of development of primarily professional offices and other
               supporting uses. Permitted uses include professional, legal, medical,
               general financial, administrative, corporate and general offices,
               business support services, financial, insurance and real estate services
               and supportive commercial uses such as restaurants, medical services,
               public service uses, financial institution, cultural and
               public/institutional facilities, and similar uses which together
               constitute concentrations of office employment or community activity.
               Also included are small convenience or service commercial activities
               intended to meet the needs of the on-site employee population. The
               standard intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.4:1 and the

               obnoxious or offensive to persons residing or conducting business in
               the City. Permitted uses would include but not be limited to
               wholesale businesses, light manufacturing and processing,
               distribution and sales, warehousing and storage, research and
               development uses, light industrial business parks and related uses.
               Obnoxious, heavy industrial uses are not permitted in this land use
               category. The standard intensity of development is a floor area ratio of
               0.5:1 and the maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio
               of 0.6:1. Standards incorporated in the Zoning Ordinance control the
               development of environmentally compatible industries within this
               land use category. Special standards including the provision of
               setbacks, screening barriers, berms, generous landscaping and low
               profile buildings should be applied.
               Public Designations
               Public/Institutional: The Public/Institutional designation includes a
               wide range of public and quasi-public uses distributed throughout the
               community such as schools, churches, child care centers,
               transportation facilities, public buildings and facilities, public utilities,
               libraries, museums, art galleries, community theaters, hospitals,
               cultural and recreational activities, community recreational facilities,
               and parks. Certain public institutional uses may be permitted within
               other land use designations when determined appropriate. In
               addition, land uses which support and are specifically related to the
               function of the primary institutional use may also be permitted. These
               support uses may include residential (for purposes of housing
               persons related to an institutional use), retail and service commercial,
               and industrial uses (e.g., warehousing for a city yard facility). The
               standard intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.2:1 and the

               PC Residential: The PC Residential land use designation allows for
               the diversification in the relationships of various densities, building
               and open spaces. The land use designation recognizes that mixed and
               integrated uses can be made to be compatible and provides for the
               development of low, medium and high density residential

               development within a wide range of living accommodations. Single
               family dwellings and multi-family dwellings such as duplexes,
               condominiums, townhomes, apartments, cooperatives, community
               apartments and uses such as such as public/institutional facilities,
               churches, schools, large family day care facilities and others which are
               determined to be compatible with and oriented toward serving the
               needs of residential neighborhoods may also be allowed. The actual
               mechanism for defining location, density range and other building
               intensity standards will specifically be governed by Planned
               Community District provisions or adoption of a Specific Plan as
               authorized by the California Government Code. The average
               population is approximately 3.25 persons per dwelling unit for low
               density development representing a population density range of 2 to
               23 persons per acre; 2.73 persons per dwelling unit for medium
               density development representing a population density range of 2 to
               41 persons per acre; and 2.12 persons per dwelling unit for high
               density development representing a population density range of 2 to
               53 persons per acre.
               PC Commercial/Business: The PC Commercial/Business designation
               provides opportunities for a mixture of all those activities permitted
               within the Community Commercial, Professional Office, and
               Industrial land use designations. To ensure compatibility of land uses
               permitted within the classification, with the character of surrounding
               development and within a development area itself, location, land use
               type, density and building intensity standards will be specifically be
               governed by Planned Community District provisions or adoption of a
               Specific Plan as authorized by the California Government Code. The
               Planned Community Commercial designation may also permit other
               uses (such as residential uses) which support this land use
               designation. The standard intensity of development is a floor area
               ratio of 0.4:1 and the maximum intensity of development is a floor
               area ratio of 1.5:1. The overall population density range for residential
               use within the PC Business/Commercial designation is 2 to 54
               persons per acre.
               PC Public/Institutional: The PC Public/Institutional designation
               includes a wide range of public and quasi-public uses distributed
               throughout the community such as schools, churches, child care

               parklands and indoor and outdoor sports/athletic facilities. To ensure
               compatibility of land uses permitted within the classification, with the
               character of surrounding development and within a development
               area itself, location, land use type, density and building intensity
               standards will be specifically be governed by Planned Community
               District provisions or adoption of a Specific Plan as authorized by the
               California Government Code. The Planned Community
               Public/Institutional designation may also permit other uses (such as
               residential for purposes of housing persons related to an institutional
               use) which support this land use designation. The standard intensity
               of development is a floor area ratio of 0.2:1 and the maximum
               intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.6:l. The overall
               population density range for residential use within the PC
               Public/Institutional designation is 2 to 54 persons per acre.
               MCAS Tustin Specific Plan Designation
               The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan designation is intended to provide a
               framework for the continued conversion of the former military
               installation to civilian uses by providing a mechanism for flexibly
               accommodating a wide range of housing, employment, educational
               and community support uses and opportunities. To ensure
               compatibility of land uses permitted within this classification with the
               character of surrounding development and within the development
               area itself, the specific location of land use types, density and building
               intensity standards is governed by the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan, as
               authorized by the California Government Code. The Specific Plan
               designation, however, allows for a number of the following uses.
               o       Low Density Residential uses at a maximum density of 7
                       dwelling units per acre will provide for development of low
                       density attached and detached dwellings and accessory uses
                       and buildings. A wide range of accommodations including
                       single family units, patio homes, and multiple family dwellings
                       such as condominiums, townhouses, cooperatives and
                       community apartments may be permitted. Uses such as
                       public/institutional facilities, child care facilities and others
                       which are determined to be compatible with, and oriented
                       towards the needs of these neighborhoods may also be
                       allowed. The average population for this permitted land use is
                       approximately 3.25 per dwelling unit which represents a
                       population density range of 3 to 23 persons per acre.

               o Medium Density Residential uses at a density range of 8-15
                 dwelling units per acre will provide for development of
                 medium density attached and detached dwellings and
                 accessory uses and structures. A wide range of
                 accommodations including single family units, patio homes,
                 and multiple family dwellings such as condominiums,
                 townhouses, cooperatives and community apartments may
                 also be permitted. Uses such as public/institutional facilities,
                 child care facilities and others which are determined to be
                 compatible with, and oriented towards the needs of these
                 neighborhoods may also be allowed. The average population
                 for this permitted land use is approximately 2.73 persons per
                 dwelling unit representing a population density range of 22 to
                 41 persons per acre.
               o Medium-High Density Residential uses at a density range of
                 16-25 dwelling units per acre. The designation to provide for
                 development of multiple family dwellings at a higher density
                 may include rental apartments, condominiums, and
                 townhouses. The average population for this permitted land
                 use is approximately 2.12 persons per dwelling unit
                 representing a population density range of 34 to 53 persons per
                 acre.
               o Transitional/Emergency Housing uses are permitted to
                 accommodate the adaptive use of military dormitory type
                 structures for emergency housing, single occupancy housing,
                 or congregate care uses. The maximum population density for
                 this permitted land use would be 32 persons per acre.
               o Commercial and Business uses which provide for the
                 development of a variety of uses including industrial, research
                 and development, professional office, retail, commercial
                 recreation, and specialized employment and merchandising
                 uses would may be permitted. The continuation of limited
                 military uses, recognizing that these uses could be converted to
                 commercial/business uses in the future, may also be
                 permitted. Other uses such as residential and
                 public/institutional uses which support commercial and
                 business uses may also be permitted. The average standard
                 intensity of development for commercial/business uses across
                 the Specific Plan designation is a floor area ratio of.5:1.

                      However, individual planning areas and specific types of
                      commercial business uses may be permitted to have a higher
                      average floor area ratio. In addition, increased intensities may
                      be permitted where development capacity is transferred from
                      one area to another in accordance with the provisions of the
                      Specific Plan, In addition, the floor area ratio may increase up
                      to 2.0 on certain building sites as long as allotted square
                      footage for a Planning Area is not exceeded, as defined in the
                      Specific Plan. Residential density ranges of 15-25 dwelling
                      units per acre may be permitted in certain commercial and
                      business areas within the Specific Plan land use designation at
                      a population density range of 34 to 53 persons per acre.
               o      Institutional/Recreational Uses which provide for a wide
                      range of public and quasi-public uses distributed within the
                      Specific Plan area would be permitted including educational
                      facilities, public and private schools, colleges, neighborhood
                      community and regional parks and support facilities, child
                      care centers, and certain governmental/social service facilities.
                      Other uses (such as residential for purposes of housing persons
                      related to an institutional use) which support institutional and
                      recreational uses may be permitted. Typical intensity of
                      development for all institutional/recreational uses will be a
                      floor area ratio of .38:1 to .59:1, subject to restrictions imposed
                      by the Specific Plan.
               o      Adequate right-of-way for major arterial roadway extensions
                      are also accommodated in the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan
                      designation. Major arterial roadways serving the MCAS
                      Specific Plan include Jamboree Road, Red Hill Avenue,
                      Barranca Parkway, Tustin Ranch Road, Warner Avenue, and
                      Edinger Avenue. Tustin Ranch Road will need to be extended
                      to Von Karman to connect Edinger Avenue to Barranca
                      Parkway. Warner Avenue will need to be connected between
                      Red Hill Avenue and Jamboree Road.
               Transportation Designation
               Transportation Corridor: The Transportation Corridor designation
               applies to the land within the corridors for the Santa Ana Freeway
               (Interstate 5), the Costa Mesa Freeway (State Route 55), the Atchison,
               Topeka and Santa Fe railway, and Circulation Element roadways.

               Lands within these corridors are reserved for transportation purposes
               as the primary use. Secondary uses, such as open space linkages and
               landscaped areas, public and private parking areas, and other
               transportation-related activities and facilities are also allowed.
IMPLICATIONS OF THE LAND USE PLAN
               The implementation of the Land Use Plan contained in this Element
               will permit additional development consistent with other General
               Plan goals and objectives. Table LU-3 summarizes the distribution of
               acreage within each land use designation in the City of Tustin and
               within the City's Sphere of Influence.
               Figure LU-3 delineates the boundaries of seven planning sub-areas
               within the Tustin Planning Area, while Table LU-4 provides a
               summary of land use distribution within each sub-area. Figure LU-3
               delineates the boundaries of these sub-areas.
               A Land Use Plan has definitive implications on the City's capacity to
               support a given number of people. The development capacity
               describes the level of development that could occur within the
               parameters set by the density/intensity standards of the Land Use
               Plan.

           CITY OF TUSTIN                                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
           GENERAL PLAN                                     47                               NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               There are two concepts of development capacity. One is "maximum
               development capacity" which assumes total development of the Plan
               on all parcels of land at the highest permitted densities/intensities.
               This total build-out at the maximum permitted density or intensity
               standard for a land use designation is not expected to occur. Factors
               such as environmental constraints, existing land uses, the choice of a
               builder to build to less than maximum permitted density/ intensity
               all have an impact on the level or intensity of development within a
               particular land use designation. However, a maximum level of
               development may occur on individual parcels of land where minimal
               constraints exist or where a project's exceptional design quality or
               important public amenities/benefits warrant development at
               maximum density/intensity.
               The second concept of development capacity is referred to as
               "effective development capacity" which assumes that under realistic
               circumstances, all development will not be at maximum density or
               intensity based on appraisal of development constraints in the City
               which would restrict development to less than that shown by the
               maximum density/ intensity of the Land Use Plan. For example, in
               some zoning districts, the level of development permitted may be
               based on the size of a lot; smaller lots may only be authorized to
               develop at densities/intensities substantially less than permitted by a
               maximum density/intensity standard.
               Table LU-3 provides a breakdown of land uses within the City and
               total Planning area for purposes of identifying the effective
               development capacity of the Land Use Plan for both dwelling
               units/population and square footage of non-residential uses. In
               arriving at effective development capacity for population growth and
               the number of units possible under build-out conditions, the effective
               permitted units by each specific residential land use designation was
               multiplied by the average household size estimated for each
               residential land use designation.
               For non-residential uses, the effective level of intensity (the average
               floor area factor shown in Table LU-2) was used to determine the level
               of expected future square footage of development.
               The degree to which plan capacity exceeds projected population is
               referred to as "overage". Some overage is desirable to make allowance
               for inevitable small pockets of undevelopable land, to allow for

GENERAL PLAN                               48                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               difficulty in recognizing development trends in completely vacant
               areas, to allow for an unforeseen need for public utilities, and to
               recognize that some owners will maintain their land in an
               undeveloped state beyond the time span of the Plan. The Southern
               California Association of Governments (SCAG) has recommended
               that plan capacity overage not exceed approximately 20 to 25 percent
               of the projected population. The measurement of overage is
               accomplished by dividing the maximum population capacity of the
               plan by the projected population. For the Tustin Planning Area, the
               maximum population capacity of the Plan is 129,655, and the
               projected population is 104,312 resulting in an overage of
               approximately 24 percent.
SPECIAL MANAGEMENT AREAS
               Certain areas within the planning area have special characteristics or
               unique properties which require continuous City management to
               ensure that City policy is implemented and desired results are
               achieved. These "Special Management Areas" (SMAs) are regulated in
               different ways by the City and other public agencies having specific
               responsibilities for methods and timing of land development. For
               these reasons, two Special Management Area Policy Maps have been
               prepared to identify these areas consistent with Land Use Element
               goals and policies and related policies, contained in other General
               Plan elements which impact land use decisions. Special standards for
               development in Special Management Areas are applicable regardless
               of other land use descriptions on a property. Figures LU-4 and LU-5
               delineate the boundaries of Special Management Areas in the Tustin
               planning area.
               Existing Specific Plans
               Specific plans are designed to implement General Plan goals and
               policies by desegregating land uses, densities, developments and
               design standards. Adopted specific plans within the planning area
               include: East Tustin, Pacific Center East, First Street, North Tustin,
               and MCAS Tustin Specific Plan (Tustin Legacy).
               East Tustin Specific Plan: The East Tustin Specific Plan area
               represents a portion of the Irvine Company property which was
               annexed to the City of Tustin incrementally in 1977, 1980, and 1981

GENERAL PLAN                              49                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               and now forms a portion of the City's eastern boundary. The Plan
               encompasses 1,746 acres. The entire Specific Plan area has been
               subdivided, with most of the total acreage currently developed.
               The overall land use concept of the Specific Plan provides for a
               planned community which is compatible with and complementary to
               the land use characteristics of the local area, and is also sensitive to
               environmental resources. A variety of uses are permitted in the
               Specific Plan including residential uses, commercial uses, and public
               uses. All development activities within this area of the City are subject
               to provisions of the East Tustin Specific Plan. A more lengthy
               discussion of the plan can be found in the Land Use Technical
               Memorandum.
               Pacific Center East Specific Plan: The Pacific Center East Specific
               Plan covers a 126 acre currently underutilized commercial/light
               industrial area located in the southern portion of the City immediately
               adjacent the SR-55 freeway corridor. The overall concept for the
               Pacific Center East Plan is intended to provide for a planned business
               park which encourages a variety of office, commercial, light industrial
               and research and development uses. More intensive land uses of up to
               twelve stories in height are to be concentrated at the southwesterly
               portion of the Plan area, with potential development intensity
               decreasing to one and two stories in height towards the north and
               northwesterly portion of the edges of the Plan area in proximity to
               existing residential land uses. All development activities within this
               area of the City are subject to provisions of the Pacific Center East
               Specific Plan. A more lengthy discussion of the plan can be found in
               the Land Use Technical Memorandum.
               First Street Specific Plan: The First Street Specific Plan regulates a
               commercial corridor that extends approximately one mile along the
               First Street commercial corridor from central Tustin at Newport
               Avenue to the SR-55 (Costa Mesa) Freeway. This corridor varies in
               depth on either side of the street from as little as zero feet where it
               abuts the First Street right-of-way to almost a quarter mile along
               Newport Avenue where commercial centers are located on sites of
               several acres. Although the First Street Planning Area is relatively
               small (approximately 84 acres), it is significant in that it continues to
               serve as a major entry into Tustin from the west and provides access
               to the Old Town Tustin historic district and the Civic Center (via
               Centennial Way). All development activities within this area of the
               City are subject to provisions of the First Street Specific Plan.

GENERAL PLAN                                               North Tustin/Other Areas

               North Tustin Specific Plan: The North Tustin Specific Plan applies to
               portions of the unincorporated area of North Tustin in the general
               vicinity of 17th Street and Newport Avenue. All development
               activities within this area of the County are subject to provisions of the
               North Tustin Specific Plan. A more lengthy discussion of the plan can
               be found in the Land Use Technical Memorandum.
               The North Tustin Specific Plan (NTSP) is a County document
               presently controlling development under the County's jurisdiction. It
               was formulated by community consensus in response to a perception
               that this area forms a buffer zone between commercial development
               to the south and west and low density residential to the north and
               east. This General Plan recognizes the continued need for stable
               specific designation for this sensitive area by requiring that
               development regulation in this NTSP be utilized in review of any
               development proposals within this area under the Tustin General
               Plan. Should the subject area or any part of it be annexed to the City of
               Tustin, the NTSP document will be revised to reflect the changed
               jurisdiction and authorities. In the case of ambiguity due to map scale,
               or other special concerns such as topographic or environmental
               constraints, the County of Orange's exhibit maps in conjunction with
               testimony solicited from the surrounding property owners within 300
               feet shall be used as evidence in determining the consistency of a
               proposed development. The notations on the exhibit are not intended
               to redefine the land use or other designations as applied to the area,
               but rather to capture special considerations regarding how they
               should be applied.
               Community Profile Maps show boundary designations that follow
               topographic or manmade features. Variance from these boundaries
               will be based on the following standards:
               1.      The basic character of the area is retained.
               2.      The project is compatible with the uses identified by the
                       Community Profile for the area.
               3.      No significant adverse environmental or public service impacts
                       will be created.
               4.      No precedent is established for development within
                       designated environmentally significant areas.

GENERAL PLAN                                53                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
                       Examples of qualifying considerations include:
                       a. Final project design provides open space equal to or greater
                           than that designated in the Community Profile.
                       b. Detailed study identifies significant environmental features
                           unknown or inaccurately identified during planning
                           studies.
                       c. Significant public facilities such as parks, bikeways and
                           horse trails are provided which serve to define use areas,
                           but are not otherwise required by the Community Profile.
                       d. Expansion or modification of an existing use where impacts
                           are essentially unchanged (e.g., condominium conversion).
               MCAS Tustin Specific Plan: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS)
               Tustin closed in July 1999. Former MCAS Tustin is approximately
               1,602 acres in size, and is located primarily within Tustin with the
               exception of 73 acres located within the City of Irvine. One privately
               owned parcel of approximately 4.1 acres was immediately adjacent to
               the northeasterly boundary of the base and was included in the
               planning for reuse of the base. Following closure, the MCAS Tustin
               property is under the jurisdictional authority of the cities of Tustin
               (approximately 1,533 acres) and Irvine (approximately 73 acres), and
               is subject to requirements of a Specific Plan/Reuse Plan for the former
               military base and the 4.1 acre privately owned site.
               The overall goal of the Specific Plan is to translate community values
               into the most important qualities or characteristics of the future uses
               and overall design and seek to create results that are very special,
               worthy of the site's present and historical importance to the City of
               Tustin and the region. A variety of land uses are permitted by the
               Plan, including residential, commercial/business, and institutional/
               recreational activities. Through the federal disposition process, certain
               portions of the property were made available to federal, state,
               homeless, and local agencies through public benefit conveyances.
               Property was also offered to the Local Reuse Authority (e.g., the City
               of Tustin) in the pursuit of job creation and economic development.
               Property not transferred as a public benefit conveyance or transferred
               to the Local Reuse Authority was sold by the Department of the Navy.

GENERAL PLAN                                54                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               Future Specific Plan Study Areas
               To achieve General Plan goals and objectives, other portions of the
               planning area may be identified as Specific Plan study areas for
               specific plans.
               If specific plans are adopted in these areas, amendment to the Special
               Management Areas Policy Maps is not necessary.
               North Tustin Area (outside of North Tustin Specific Plan)
               The unincorporated portion of the planning area is comprised of the
               North Tustin area. These areas are included in the City's planning
               area because they relate to the long range planning efforts undertaken
               by the City. The North Tustin area lies within the City's Sphere of
               Influence (SOI) and portions or all of this area could potentially be
               annexed to Tustin within the next 20 years.
               Prior to annexing any unincorporated land, a zoning and General Plan
               land use analysis must be conducted to determine whether there is a
               General Plan or Zoning District in Tustin that is consistent with the
               Specific Plan land uses. In the event that there is no similar land use
               designation in Tustin, an appropriate General Plan and Zoning
               modification will be performed. Until such modifications can be
               made, an unclassified designation shall apply against such property
               and provisions of the Zoning Code which apply to the unclassified
               use category shall apply. This process will ensure that only the land
               uses identified in the Specific Plan will be implemented upon
               annexation into the City of Tustin.
               The Community Profiles (Component III of the County of Orange
               Advance Planning Program) will be used to ensure the
               implementation of the General Plan for the unincorporated area of
               North Tustin not regulated by the North Tustin Specific Plan. Each
               community profile as these documents are named, consists of maps,
               statistical information and proposed land uses for unique geographic
               areas in the County. The Profiles will be used as follows:
               o       The Community Profile area is one of the units of analysis
                       which will be used to evaluate infrastructure capabilities as
                       they apply to individual project approvals.

               o       Any agency with land use decision making authority shall
                       evaluate and consider the Community Profiles and
                       compendium of policies in making Planning Decisions.
               o       Prior to approval, project (development) proposals shall be
                       found consistent with the Community Profiles by the decision
                       making authority. In cases where inconsistencies exist, they
                       shall be resolved and the Community Profile amended
                       concurrently with processing of the discretionary approval.
               In the administration and implementation of the Community Profiles
               as amended, the Planning Agency has the responsibility to interpret
               and render findings on consistency of zoning and other land use
               projects in conformance with the requirements of the Government
               Code and the policies and guidelines expressed in the General Plan.
               Planning Area Not Within Sphere of Influence
               The two smaller areas between Myford and Jamboree Road south of
               the I-5 freeway and in the vicinity of former MCAS, Tustin adjacent to
               the City of Tustin's southeasterly boundary, represent areas that are
               presently included in the City of Irvine. The two incorporated areas lie
               either northwest or southwest of the alignment of Jamboree Road The
               roadway creates a traffic corridor that provides a strong potential
               boundary line between the cities of Tustin and Irvine.
CITY-WIDE URBAN DESIGN
               Citywide visual linkages are important in establishing the
               community's identify. Every community with a reputation as a valued
               place to live or visit is known for the quality and character of its
               streets. The pattern of landscape, buildings, sidewalks, lighting and
               graphics create an image which conveys the personality of the city
               and the level of pride its citizens take in the community. A specific
               discussion of the City's present image is included in a separate Urban
               Design Technical Memorandum.

       LAND USE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
Implementation measures for land use policy are organized around the tools
available that bear a direct relationship to the realization of land use goals. These
tools include the Zoning Code, and Subdivision and Grading ordinances, growth
management program, code enforcement, specific plans, and capital improvement
programs.
The overall goals of the Land Use Element are intended to achieve balanced
development of land uses, compatible land use relationships, and a high quality of
development. When implemented, the tools will provide the City with the capability
to guide the development and revitalization of the key areas of the City. The City
Council, by incorporating the Implementation Program into the General Plan,
recognizes the importance of long-range planning considerations in day-to-day
decision-making, subject to funding constraints.
ZONING ORDINANCE
               1. Zoning Ordinance: The principal method by which the City
               implements land use policy as it regulates the location, type of use,
               and development character is the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning
               Ordinance consists of two components: (1) a map which delineates the
               boundaries of zoning districts in which similar uses developed or to
               be developed under similar standards are permitted, and (2) text
               which explains the purpose of the zoning districts, lists permitted and
               conditional uses, and standards for development.
               The City will review and prepare Zoning Ordinance amendments to
               achieve consistency as necessary with the policies and standards
               contained in the General Plan. Adoption of Zoning Ordinance
               amendments and an associated Zoning Map will provide a primary
               implementation tool for the Land Use Element. Revisions to the
               Zoning Ordinance shall include but not be limited to:
               o      Provision of incentives for lot consolidation and parcel
                      assemblage
               o      Review and revision of current development standards in the
                      City's Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts

               o       Provisions which will provide more sensitive transition such as
                       buffering, landscaping, wall and setbacks between divergent
                       land uses;
               o       Provision of incentives to encourage integration of retail uses
                       on street level of office projects;
               o       Provision of incentives to encourage consolidation of parking
                       and driveway accesses between businesses;
               o       Revisions to encourage elimination of non-conforming uses;
               o       Revisions to establish special monitoring controls on those uses
                       which include storage, use or transport of hazardous materials;
               o       Revisions, if necessary, of requirements and standards for
                       multi-family uses;
               o       Establishment of disincentives for future typical strip center
                       development;
               o       Potential expansion of the Cultural Resources Overlay District
                       north of First Street to Irvine Boulevard; and
               o       Consolidation of the City's current commercial districts
                       consistent with the Land Use Plan, and other zoning map and
                       text changes consistent with the Land Use Plan designations
                       contained in the General Plan.

SUBDIVISION AND GRADING REGULATIONS
               2. Subdivision, Grading and Public Improvement: Subdivision
               regulation is an exercise of the police power of a local jurisdiction to
               control the manner in which land is divided, while grading regulation
               controls the safety and aesthetic components of preparing and
               modifying landform to accommodate development. Like the Zoning
               Ordinance, these regulations must be consistent with the General
               Plan. The City's Subdivision, Grading and Public Improvement
               ordinances will be reviewed and where necessary amendments
               recommended to determine if it reflects policy expressed in the Land
               Use Element.

SPECIFIC PLANS
               4. Specific Plans: State law authorizes local jurisdictions to adopt
               specific plans for implementing their general plans in designated
               areas. The specific plan is intended to provide more precise
               descriptions of the types of uses permitted, development standards,
               and public infrastructure improvements for an area. They provide a
               mechanism for development of a unified design plan for public
               and/or private property within the plan area.

               urban design elements on major street corridors. The Urban Design
               Technical Memorandum provides specific guidance for this program
               which includes:
               a.     Establishment of landscaped corridors along major roadways
                      including: 1) primary and secondary street and median tree
                      plantings; 2) enhanced landscaping, entrance markers, identity
                      graphics, and accent lighting at City gateways or entrances
                      (along major roadways and at intersections); and 3) City
                      identity graphics signing to mark the locations of civic
                      buildings,     parks,      recreational   facilities,  schools,
                      walking/biking paths, special areas such as Old Town, and
                      public parking areas;
               b.     Establishment or improvement of circulation linkages among
                      public places including: 1) improvement and completion of
                      walking and biking linkages between public parks and
                      community facilities; 2) use of City identity graphics, street
                      furniture, lighting and other improvements to enhance the
                      walking and biking network; and 3) strengthening existing
                      public places and creating new public places connected by the
                      linkage network.
               c.     Preservation and enhancement of historic resources including:

    INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The availability of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
family has been an ongoing concern to all levels of government. In California, this
concern is addressed by the California Government Code requirement that each
City adopt a Housing Element as a mandatory part of its General Plan.
State Planning Law mandates that jurisdictions within the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) region adopt revisions to their Housing
Elements by October 15, 2013. As a consequence of this due date, a series of time
frames for various aspects of the Housing Element preparation are established.
There are two relevant time periods:
        2006-2014: The previous planning period began in 2006, and ends on June 30,
        2014.
        October 2013 – October 2021: the current Housing Element planning period
        for assessing short-term housing construction needs and implementing
        housing programs.
The planning period for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) as
prepared by SCAG, is from January 1, 2014 to October 1, 2021, a seven and three-
quarter year period.
The source of most of the demographic data in this Housing Element and the
related Housing Element Technical Memorandum is the U.S. Census Bureau,
American Community Survey, 2007-2011 Five-Year Estimates. This was the most
comprehensive and recent source of data available at time this Housing Element
was prepared.
PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is concerned with housing in a spatial context while the
Housing Element identifies housing programs aimed at meeting the identified
housing needs of the City's population. The Tustin Housing Element includes the
identification of strategies and programs that focus on: 1) housing affordability, 2)
rehabilitating substandard housing, 3) meeting the existing demand for new
housing, and 4) conserving the existing affordable housing stock. The Tustin
Housing Technical Memorandum provides background information and
supporting documentation.

SCOPE AND CONTENT OF ELEMENT
The State Legislature recognizes the role of the local general plan, and particularly
the Housing Element, in implementing statewide housing goals. Furthermore, the
Legislature stresses continuing efforts toward providing affordable housing for all
income groups. The Legislature’s major concerns with regard to the preparation of
Housing Elements are:
        Recognition by local governments of their responsibility in contributing to
        the attainment of State housing goals;
        Preparation and implementation of housing elements which coordinate with
        State and Federal efforts in achieving State housing goals;
        Participation by local jurisdictions in determining efforts required to attain
        State housing goals; and
        Cooperation between local governments to address regional housing needs.
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) set forth
specific requirements regarding the scope and content of housing elements.
CONSISTENCY WITH STATE PLANNING LAW
The preparation of the City's Housing Element is guided by and must conform to
Section 65580 et seq. of the California Government Code. In the introduction of
these Government Code sections, the Legislature establishes a policy that the
availability of housing in a suitable environment is of vital statewide importance,
and a priority of the highest order. It further states that local governments are to
address the housing needs of all economic segments, while considering the
economic, environmental and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the
General Plan. The following table cites the required components for the Housing
Element and cites the document and page references for the required components.

GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
While a city must consider housing needs for all economic segments, it must also
maintain internal consistency among other elements of the General Plan as required
by state law. Neither the Housing Element nor any other element may supersede
any other required Tustin General Plan elements.
The Housing Element relates to other elements in a variety of ways. The Land Use
Element directly relates to the Housing Element by designating areas of the City in
which a variety of residential types and densities exist.
The Housing Element's relationship to the Conservation, Open Space, and
Recreation Element is conditioned by the need to serve a growing population's
recreational needs in the areas of the City with the highest density. Also, housing
needs for low cost land must be balanced by the need to conserve natural resources.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT

The Circulation Element attempts to provide an efficient and well-balanced
circulation system. This system must be designed to accommodate allowed land
uses, including residential uses, and the intensity of allowable uses should not
exceed the ultimate capacity to accommodate them.
The Safety Element relates to the Housing Element by designating areas that are
unsafe for development such as Alquist-Priolo Zones, floodplains, etcetera.
Similar to the Safety Element, the Noise Element relates to the Housing Element by
addressing a health related issue area. Techniques for reducing noise often involve
buffers between land uses.
The Growth Management Element overlaps the issues raised in the Housing
Element in its efforts to ensure that the planning, management, and implementation
of traffic improvements and public facilities are adequate to meet the current and
projected needs of Orange County.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other
General Plan elements and policy directions. As parts of the General Plan are
amended in the future, this housing element will be reviewed to ensure that
consistency is maintained.
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The California Government Code requires that local governments make diligent
efforts to solicit public participation from all segments of the community in the
development of the Housing Element. Public participation in the Housing Element
Update process occurred through the following methods:
        A public workshop was conducted on April 23, 2013 to provide an
        opportunity for interested persons to ask questions and offer suggestions on
        the proposed Housing Element. Approximately 24 members of the public
        attended the workshop, and nine (9) individuals provided verbal comments.
        Seven (7) of the speakers expressed concerns and provided comments
        regarding the affordable housing needs of individuals with developmental
        disabilities. These needs and related programs are addressed in the draft
        Housing Element.        The other speakers provided general comments
        regarding senior housing and the need for affordable housing. Notice of this
        workshop was published in the Tustin News, on the City’s website, and was
        also mailed to the City’s list of local housing interest groups. A copy of the
        mailing list is included as Appendix C.
        Specific implementation programs included in the Housing Element Update
        were also discussed at various public hearings in anticipation of the Housing
        Element Update. These hearings include the Federal Community

        Development Block Grant Program public hearings held on March 5, 2013,
        and May 7, 2013.
        Public hearings were held on August 13, 2013, by the Planning Commission
        and on October 1, 2013, by the City Council to provide additional
        opportunities for public review and comment on the Housing Element
        Update and supporting documents. All public meetings were advertised in
        the Tustin News and the City’s website. Special notifications were also sent
        to those on the City’s list of interested parties.
        Draft Housing Element, Technical Memorandum, and relevant documents
        were made available at the City Hall, Library, on City’s website for easy
        access and download, and mailed to requesting parties. Public comments
        received were evaluated and incorporated into the staff report to the
        Planning Commission and the City Council. As appropriate, the Housing
        Element has been revised to address these comments.
        On June 21, 2013, the City sent the draft Housing Element to the Department
        of Housing and Community Development (HCD). On October 1, 2013, the
        City Council adopted the Housing Element Update as required by State
        Law. Following adoption, on October 10, 2013, the City sent the adopted
        Housing Element to HCD for final review. On, _____________ 2013, the City
        received final approval from HCD. The City advertised the availability of
        the Housing Element in English and Spanish in two local newspapers and
        also made the Housing Element available at City Hall, the City’s website,
        and the Tustin Library. The City also sent direct mailings to over 100
        organizations consisting of youth, seniors, veterans, disabled, homeless
        shelters, cultural organizations, housing advocates, religious organizations,
        housing builders, fair housing council, and individuals interested in the
        process. Revised Housing Element and its relevant documents are posted on
        the City website to allow the public and interested organization easy access
        and download.
In addition to public input received at the April 23, 2013, public workshop, the City
received written public comments from several individuals and organizations. The
City received correspondence pertaining to the needs of individuals with
development disabilities. The Housing Element addresses the needs of persons
with development disabilities by first defining the term “developmentally
disabled,” by explaining the specific needs of persons with developmental
disabilities, by describing some of the services available, by providing an estimate of
the number of persons with development disabilities living in Tustin, and by
including a program to work with the Regional Center of Orange County to
implement an outreach program that would inform the public of the services
available to persons with developmental disabilities in Tustin. In addition, the

City’s Housing Authority is committed to working with entities seeking funding to
provide housing for persons with developmental disabilities.
In addition, a letter was received from the Airport Land Commission. Although the
Housing Element update does not propose any new development within the John
Wayne Airport Planning Area, Airport Land Commission staff indicated that their
review is required for the General Plan Amendment and that it would be possible
for their review to occur prior to the City Council hearing. This review is more
procedural in nature, and no issues are anticipated.
Correspondence from the Kennedy Commission commended the City for its efforts
in encouraging and facilitating the development of affordable housing. The
Kennedy Commission included four recommendations in their letter. The first and
third recommendations are already addressed in that the City has continued its
partnership with the Kennedy Commission and the City already has density
bonuses and other incentives available citywide for affordable housing. The second
and fourth recommendations relate to potential funding sources and fee waivers for
affordable housing and therefore, will be considered by the City Council.
Finally, the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provided general comments on
the Draft Housing Element, encouraging efficient land use patterns and more
sustainable communities, and acknowledging that the Housing Element update
does not propose any significant land use changes.

    SUMMARY OF ISSUES, NEEDS, CONSTRAINTS
                         AND OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the Housing Element summarizes Tustin’s current and projected
housing needs to form the basis for establishing program priorities and quantified
objectives in the Housing Element. This section also:
        Estimates the number of households that meet Federal or State criteria for
        special consideration when discussing specialized needs;
        Evaluates assisted units at risk of conversion;
        Describes constraints that may discourage the construction of new housing;
        and
        Examines housing opportunity sites.
SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
A number of factors will influence the degree of demand or "need" for housing in
Tustin. The major "needs" categories considered in this Element include:
        Housing needs resulting from increased population and employment
        growth in the City and the surrounding region;
        Housing needs resulting from household overcrowding;
        Housing needs resulting from the deterioration or demolition of existing
        units;
        Housing needs that result when households are paying more than they can
        afford for housing;
        Housing needs resulting from the presence of "special needs groups" such as
        the elderly, large families, female-headed households, households with a
        disabled person, and the homeless; and
        Housing needs resulting from conversion of the assisted housing stock to
        market rate.
Population Growth
As shown in Table H-2, between 2000 and 2010 the City's population grew from
67,504 to 75,540, an increase of 11.9 percent. Between 2010 and 2012 population
growth slowed significantly, falling 41.2 percent from the yearly average of 1.2
percent between 2000 and 2010 to .7 percent over the past 2 years. The City of
Tustin's growth rate between 2010 and 2012 was slightly slower than the

countywide growth rate but faster than the nearby cities of Garden Grove, Orange,
and Santa Ana. Recent projections released by the Center for Demographic
Research, CSUF (Orange County Projections 2010 Modified, January 26, 2012)
indicate that Tustin’s population will increase by an annual rate of approximately
0.7 percent during this implementation period, bringing the total population to
83,534 by the year 2025. Table H-2 compares the City's growth rate between 2000
and 2012 with other Orange County cities and the County as a whole.
A large percentage of Tustin's population growth can be attributed to annexations
that have occurred since 1980. The remainder can be attributed to a variety of other
factors, including shifts in family structures from smaller to larger families,
redevelopment of existing developed areas, infill development, and residential
construction in East Tustin and Tustin Legacy (former Marine Corps Air Station
[MCAS] Tustin). Substantial population and housing growth will continue during
this planning period with the continued development at Tustin Legacy.

Jobs-Housing Balance
The “jobs-housing balance” test is a general measure of a community’s employment
opportunities with respect to its residents’ needs. A balanced community would
reach equilibrium between employment and housing opportunities so the majority
of the residents could also work within the community.
Table H-5 shows the 2011 jobs-housing balance for the City of Tustin as well as
Orange County and the Southern California region. Tustin had a jobs/housing ratio
of 1.40 in 2011, while Orange County and the region had jobs/housing ratios of 1.38
and 1.23, respectively. This demonstrates that Tustin is a job-rich community when
compared to county and regional averages.

Overcrowding
 From 2007 to 2011 there has been a decrease in unit overcrowding, as fewer
households "double up" to save on housing costs. Overcrowding is often reflective
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                                           HOUSING ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                              12                                OCTOBER 1, 2013

of one of three conditions: 1) a family or household is living in a dwelling that is too
small; 2) a family chooses to house extended family members (i.e., grandparents or
grown children and their families living with parents, termed doubling); or 3) a
family is renting living space to non-family members.
State and Federal Housing Law defines overcrowded housing units as those in
which the ratio of persons-to-rooms exceeds 1.0. The rooms considered in this
equation exclude bathrooms, kitchens, and hallways, but includes other rooms such
as living and dining rooms. The 2007-2011 American Community Survey showed
that 2,508 (10 percent) of households living in overcrowded conditions in Tustin. Of
the households living in such conditions, 78 percent were renters. Renter
households had a significantly higher incidence of overcrowding than owner
households: 7.8 percent of renter and 2.2 percent of owner households were
overcrowded. Table HTM-8 of the Housing Element Technical Memorandum
illustrates the numbers of all Tustin households living in overcrowded conditions.
Substandard Units
By 2020, approximately 62 percent of the City’s housing stock will be over 30 years
old, the age at which housing tends to require significant repairs. This indicates a
potential need for rehabilitation and continued maintenance of over 17,324 dwelling
units1.
Affordability
State and Federal standards for rental housing overpayment are based on an
income-to-housing cost ratio of 30 percent and above. Households paying greater
than this percentage will have less income left over for other necessities, such as
food, clothing and health care. Upper income households are generally capable of
paying a larger proportion of their income for housing, and therefore estimates of
housing overpayment generally focus on lower income groups.
As identified in the 2012 RHNA, 2,458 Tustin households are at or below 30% of the
County Median Household Income (MHI) and considered “Extremely Low
Income.” The 2012 RHNA also shows 11,266 of Tustin households were paying
more than 30 percent (overpaying) of their income on housing needs. Table HTM-12
of the Housing Element Technical Memorandum reflects American Community
Survey estimates for households overpaying for shelter. While most extremely low
income households are currently housed, they are in a precarious position,
particularly those overpaying for housing in light of the current housing market,
and could face the threat of homelessness.

CITY OF TUSTIN                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                           13             OCTOBER 1, 2013

The distinction between renter and owner housing overpayment is important
because, while homeowners may over-extend themselves financially to afford the
option of home purchase, the owner always maintains the option of selling the
home, thereby generally lowering housing costs. In addition, home ownership
affords tax benefits to reduce monthly costs. Renters are limited to the rental
market, and are generally required to pay the rent established in that market.
According to the American Community Survey data, of the total 4,585 lower income
households identified as over-payers, 3,368 were renter households and 1,217 were
owner households. This discrepancy is largely reflective of the disproportionate
number of rental housing units in the City and the tendency of renter households to
have lower incomes than owner households (see Table HTM-11 in the Technical
Memorandum).
Table H-6 summarizes the characteristics of the current apartment inventory in the
City of Tustin as of the first quarter 2013 based on data from REALFACTS. The
data include a total of 28 apartment properties and 5,810 units, with an average of
208 units per property. All properties in the inventory have at least 100 units and
were built between 1957 and 1997. Therefore, the data do not include small
multifamily properties.
The overall rental vacancy rate for Tustin in 2011 was 5.6 percent, up considerably
from 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2007. Generally, a vacancy rate of 5 percent is
considered to reflect a “tight” housing market. Department of Finance data for
Tustin as of January 2013 show a vacancy rate of 4.8 percent for all housing types in
Tustin (single- and multi-family, owner and rental).
The data show that approximately 40 percent of apartment units in the City have
one bedroom, 52 percent have two bedrooms, and 5 percent have three bedrooms.
Average monthly rents are $1,340 for a one-bedroom, one-bath unit. For two-
bedroom units, average monthly rents are $1,448 for units with one bath, $1,412 for
units with one and a half baths, $1,828 for units with two baths, and $1,695 for two-
bedroom townhouse units. The average monthly rent for a three-bedroom unit
with one and a half baths is $1,777 and for a three-bedroom unit with two baths the
average rent is $2,391. The average rent for a three-bedroom townhouse unit is
$1,845.
The weighted average rental rate for the inventory increased 1.9percent over the
past year2. Rents for studios increased the most at 5.1 percent, followed by two-
bedroom one-bath units at 3.5 percent, and one-bedroom one-bath units at 3.1
percent.
2 These weighted average rents weight the average rent by bedroom count by the number of units in that bedroom
count category.

Affordability Gap Analysis
In addition to information related to Housing Constraints provided in the City's
Housing Element Technical Memorandum, a Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy was prepared in 2008. The report contains a detailed affordability gap
analysis to illustrate the "gap" between the cost of developing housing for rent and
ownership and what households at a variety of income levels can afford to pay
toward their housing expenses. A Summary of Renter and Owner Affordability
Gaps for certain prototypical unit types and incomes are provided as Appendix
“B.3”
Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have a more difficult time finding decent,
affordable housing due to special circumstances and may require specific
accommodation or assistance to meet their housing needs. Included as special needs
groups are the elderly, disabled, including persons with developmental disabilities,
female-headed households, large families, and homeless persons. As there are no
known "farmworkers" residing in Tustin this group is not discussed in the Housing
Element.
Elderly: The special needs of many elderly households result from their lower, fixed
incomes, physical disabilities, and need for assistance. As shown in Table HTM-2,

Disabled: Physical and developmental disabilities can hinder access to housing
units of traditional design and potentially limit the ability to earn adequate income.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, a total of 2,192 persons in Tustin between 18 and
65 years of age reported a disability. In addition, 1,745 persons over age 65 reported
a disability in 2011.
Special housing needs of disabled individuals include wheelchair accessibility,
railings, and special construction for interior living spaces. The Housing Element
sets forth policies to encourage the development of disabled-accessible housing (see
policies 1.11, 1.13, 1.15).
Persons with Developmental Disabilities: As defined by federal law,
“developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual
that:
         Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
        and physical impairments;
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;
        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
        areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
        c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living;
        or g) economic self-sufficiency;
        Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
        interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other
        forms of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are
        individually planned and coordinated.
The U.S. Census Bureau does not record developmental disabilities. According to
the U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the
percentage of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5
percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently
within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals
require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most
severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where
medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a
child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four

developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional Center of
Orange County (RCOC) is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides
point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a
private, non-profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a
wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and their
families.
Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated
before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to people with
developmental disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may include:
Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior management
programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant
development programs; information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal
diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy;
transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. RCOC
also coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services
for children under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a
developmental disability. According to the RCOC February 2010 Facts and Statistics
data, the RCOC currently serves approximately 16,728 individuals.
According to the RCOC, there are at least 428 children and adults with
developmental disabilities living within the City of Tustin. There may be others
who have chosen not to receive services from the Regional Center or who are not
aware of or understand the services provided by the Regional Center.
Large Families: A family household containing five or more persons is considered a
large family, as defined by the Census Bureau. Large families are identified as
groups with special housing needs because of the limited availability of adequately
sized, affordable housing units. Large families are often of lower income, frequently
resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and accelerating unit
deterioration.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 3,852 family households, or 15.4 percent of all
households, had five or more persons (see Housing Element Technical
Memorandum Table HTM-14). Of those, approximately 47.6 percent were owner-
households and 52.4 percent were renter households.
Female-Headed Parent Households: The housing needs of female-headed
households with children are generally related to affordability since such
households typically have lower than average incomes. According to the 2007-2011
ACS, the City of Tustin had 1,652 female-headed households with children less than
18 years of age.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                18                       OCTOBER 1, 2013
Single Room Occupancy (SRO): A single room occupancy unit typically is a 250
to 500 square feet residential unit, with a sink and closet, which may require
the occupant to share a communal bathroom, shower, and/or kitchen. SRO
units are allowed within the City’s Multiple Family Residential districts and
Planning Area 3 of the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan. Single room occupancy units
such as rest homes also are allowed within Commercial Districts in the city through
approval of a Conditional Use Permit. Although no specific ordinance is in place to
address SRO units, the City may consider the adoption of single-room occupancy
(SRO) ordinance during the planning period.
The Homeless: Measuring the extent of the homeless population specifically in
Tustin remains a challenge for community leaders. To complicate the challenge of
meeting homeless persons’ needs, the issue of homelessness is considered regional
in nature. Nomadic tendencies of homeless persons make it difficult to assess the
population accurately on a citywide basis; therefore, homelessness should be
addressed on a countywide basis, in conjunction with cities and local non-profit
organizations.
The Orange County Housing and Community Development Department defines
homelessness as not having a permanent address, sleeping in places not meant for
habitation, not having ample food and medical attention or a place to change
clothes or bathe. Per this definition, the County of Orange estimates in 2011 there
were 18,325 homeless in the County.           For those 18,325 homeless, there are only
about 3,357 available beds, including 1,156 emergency shelter beds and 2,201 beds
in transitional housing facilities, according to the Orange County Ten-Year Plan to
End Homelessness 2012.
The homeless population is comprised of subgroups, which include:
    a)  The economic homeless who lack financial resources to pay rent;
    b)  The situational homeless who have suffered economic or personal trauma
        and find themselves in personal disorganization; and,
    c)  The chronic homeless who are unable to care for themselves due to chronic
        illness, disability or debilitating substance abuse.
The City of Tustin’s 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan states that, according to police
reports and windshield surveys performed within the City of Tustin, most homeless
persons migrate through Tustin to other parts of the County rather than stay for
extended periods of time within the City. The City's Police Department estimates
that there are 10-12 homeless persons residing in the City at any given time.
There are numerous factors that contribute to homelessness in Tustin and Orange
County. The known causes of homelessness include unemployment, limited skills,

and a breakdown in the family as a social and economic unit. Additionally, cutbacks
in social service programs and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill during
the 1980s have contributed to the homeless population. A new trend, however, is
emerging as a significant contributing element to homelessness: a fast-growing lack
of affordable housing, which could exacerbate any of the above conditions, but may
increasingly become a standalone cause of homelessness.
Although there are no established areas where unsheltered homeless persons
congregate in the City, there are several homeless services facilities in the City. One
of the shelters in Tustin, the 45-bed Sheepfold shelter provides shelter, food,
clothing, job training, and job-referral services primarily to battered women and
children. Guests are admitted on a first-come, first-served basis. Usually all beds are
fully occupied. The shelter services a large area including many portions of Orange
and San Bernardino Counties.
Within the City of Tustin, there are a variety of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs)
that provide direct housing and related services to homeless persons. These include
Village of Hope, an emergency/transitional home; Sheepfold, a feeding program
affiliated with the United Way; Families Forward, a homeless provider; Olive Crest,
transitional homes and services for abused and neglected children, and Laurel
House, an emergency shelter and transitional housing provider for homeless youth
in the City.
Additional programs have been provided at the Tustin Legacy site. A Homeless
Assistance Plan has been established for MCAS, Tustin that is consistent with the
continuum of care model embodied in the Consolidated Plans for the Cities of
Tustin and neighboring Irvine. The fundamental components of the continuum of
care system implemented with the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan:
         Provide emergency shelter beds and intake assessment
         Offer transitional housing and services
         Provide opportunities for permanent affordable housing by the private
         sector.
In Tustin Legacy, four homeless service providers including the Salvation Army,
Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter, Families Forward, and Human Options currently
are operating 48 family units. The Orange County Rescue Mission operates a 192-
unit transitional/emergency shelter (Village of Hope) and the Orange County Social
Services Agency operates a 90bed facility for abused and neglected children and
their families.
Numerous other agencies provide shelter and other services to the homeless in the
nearby cities of Santa Ana, Irvine, and Orange. Table H-8 is a list of organizations
in Tustin that provide homeless services.

PRESERVATION OF UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
According to the 2012 RHNA, Tustin has one project that contains units at risk of
converting to unrestricted market rate during the 2013-2021 planning period. Tustin
Gardens is a 101-unit Section 223(a) (7)/221(D) (4) project with a Section 8 contract
for 100 units Tustin Gardens is extended on an annual basis. Their current contract
is due to expire on July 13, 2014. Although Tustin Gardens is at risk, there has been
no indication from HUD of terminating the contract or from the project owners of
opting out.
Table H-9 is an inventory of all units assisted under federal, state, and/or local
programs, including HUD programs, state and local bond programs, City
programs, and local in-lieu fee, inclusionary, density bonus, or direct assistance
programs. The inventory includes all units that are eligible to convert to non-lower
income housing uses due to termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment,
or expiring use restrictions.
Various restrictions and incentives affect the likelihood that at risk units will
convert to other uses. Congress passed the Low Income Housing Preservation and
Resident Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA) in 1991. This measure assured residents
that their homes would be preserved for their remaining useful lives while owners
were assured of fair-market compensation. However, modifications to the Act in
1996 restored the owners’ right to prepayment, under the provisions that the owner
would be encouraged to sell the property to resident endorsed or other non-profit
organizations.
Tustin Gardens is the only project based Section 8 subsidized project at-risk of
losing affordability restrictions during the Housing Element planning period.
However, it appears unlikely that the affordability of these units will be threatened
based on the determination that project based Section 8 contracts can be renewed on
an annual basis.
Given the relative weakness of economic conditions and the current housing
market, the city will proceed to negotiate the extension of affordability restrictions
on these units. The amount of assistance provided will be negotiated based on the
specific economics of each development and the potential availability of leverage
financing, such as tax-exempt bonds and 4% tax credits. Funds were previously
allocated to this program in prior planning periods. However, as a result of the
dissolution of Redevelopment, the Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds,
allocated to this program were recaptured by the State and transferred to the

Programs for Preservation of At-Risk Units: The City will make efforts to preserve
units “at risk” at Tustin Gardens. The cost of acquiring and preserving the at-risk
units is less than replacing the units with new construction. The actual amount
required to preserve these units is currently unknown.
The City will also be looking at possible work with nonprofits in the community to
explore acquisition of existing buildings with at risk units by nonprofit
organizations. The specific actions that the City will take to protect (or replace) at-
risk units are identified in the Housing Element Implementation Program.

 SUMMARY OF HOUSING ISSUES
Housing is a fundamental component of land use within a community necessary to
support the resident population. Obtaining affordable housing has been an ongoing
issue for persons of all income groups in California. The following Table H-10
presents an overview of households in the City with special housing needs or issues
with their existing housing, such as overpayment or overcrowded conditions. The
following text highlights the issues relevant to the City of Tustin, which are
addressed by the goals, policies and implementation plans.

           Overpayment. 49 percent of the City's lower income households (households
           which earn less than $75,000 annually) are currently overpaying for housing
           (see Table HTM-12).
           Overcrowding. Household overcrowding has decreased over the past
           decade as fewer individuals and families "double up" to save on housing
           costs. Housing Growth Needs. For the 2014-2021 planning period, SCAG
           identifies a housing growth need of 1,227 dwelling units in Tustin. These
           units are allocated among the following income categories: 525 above-
           moderate income units; 224 moderate-income units; 195 low-income units;
           and 283 very-low income units (see Table H-10).

       Large Families. 15.4 percent of City’s households contain 5 more persons in
       the households. The average household size in the City was 2.97 in 2011, up
       slightly from 2.82 in 2000, largely due to changes in the ethnic composition
       and the economic downturn which had not yet recovered by 2011. This
       indicates a potential need for larger housing units to accommodate these
       families (see Table HTM-14).
       Extremely-Low Income households. In 2009, 2,458 households are at or
       below 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI) and considered “Extremely
       Low Income.” While the extremely low income households are currently
       housed, they are in a precarious position, particularly those overpaying for
       housing in light of the current housing market, and could face the threat of
       homelessness.
       Affordability Gap. Based upon available information on rental rates in the
       City, it is difficult to find rental housing that is large enough and affordable
       for large, low-income families (see Table HTM-24 and Table HTM-25).
       Elderly. As the City’s population ages, the number of elderly persons will
       continue to increase. This underscores an increasing need to address the
       special housing needs of the elderly (see Table HTM-2).
       Disabled, including Developmentally Disabled. Some disabled individuals
       have particular housing needs relating to access and adaptability.
       Female-Headed Parent Households. Female-headed parent households
       made up 9.4 percent of all families with children under 18 in Tustin in 2011.
       Many of these households have incomes below the poverty level and have
       special housing needs such as access to childcare services.
       Homeless. Growing numbers of homeless persons in Southern California
       have created particular housing and social service needs.                   The
       redevelopment of MCAS Tustin for civilian uses has provided an
       opportunity for additional housing supply in the City including
       accommodation of the needs of the homeless and the need for affordable
       housing (see Table HTM-15). In addition, a group housing arrangement
       (with less than six (6) residents) in a single family home is not subject to a
       Conditional Use Permit (consistent with State Law). A group housing
       arrangement of over six (6) residents is classified as a boarding house. The
       R-3 and R-4 zoning districts would allow for boarding houses with a
       Conditional Use Permit (CUP).
       First Time Homebuyers. High housing costs have put home ownership
       beyond the reach of many potential first-time homebuyers.

       Governmental Constraints. Governmental regulations, such as land use
       controls, fees, and processing procedures, can act as constraints to the
       maintenance and production of housing.
       Units at Risk of Conversion to Market Rate. By State law, the City must
       identify and develop programs and policies to address affordable housing
       units that are at risk of converting to market rate housing. During the 2013-
       2021 planning period, the City of Tustin faces the potential conversion of 100
       low-income units (see Table HTM-27).
       Tenure. The City has a high proportion of renter-occupied housing as
       compared to other jurisdictions in Orange County. In 2011, 47.4 percent of
       the City’s units were renter-occupied, compared to 39.7 percent renter
       occupied units countywide. Promotion of home ownership opportunities in
       the City may be necessary to maintain a balanced community (see Table
       HTM-20).
       Housing Stock Condition. According to 2011 ACS data, over 56percent of the
       City’s housing stock is 30 years old or older – the age at which housing
       typically begins to require major repairs. In addition, the lack of adequately
       sized affordable housing can lead to overcrowding and in turn, deteriorated
       housing conditions. Maintenance and improvement of existing housing
       conditions over the long term will require ongoing maintenance of existing
       units, rehabilitation or replacement of substandard housing and programs to
       maintain neighborhood quality (see Table HTM-21).
       Historic Resources. Older neighborhoods in Tustin contain historic
       residences that should be preserved as part of the community’s heritage.
       These historic homes were identified through inventories of historic
       buildings in 1990 and 2002.
       Target Neighborhoods. A large portion of the City’s lower income housing is
       concentrated in the southwest neighborhoods. Targeted programs such as
       graffiti removal, proactive code-enforcement, loan and grant housing
       rehabilitation program, removal of abandoned vehicles, increased police
       presence, removal/trimming overgrown trees in public right-of-way,
       various physical improvements for street widening, and street lighting and
       alley improvements have been and will continue to be implemented.
       Energy Conservation. Due to its mild climate, the City can take advantage of
       solar energy to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy supplies.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Actual or potential constraints on the provision and cost of housing affect the
development of new housing and the maintenance of existing units for all income
levels. Market, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental constraints to
housing development in Tustin are summarized below and discussed in greater
detail in the Housing Element Technical Memorandum.
Market Constraints
The high cost of renting or buying adequate housing is a primary ongoing
constraint. High construction costs, land costs and market financing constraints are
contributing to increases in the cost of affordable housing.
Construction Costs: The 2005-2010 Tustin Consolidated Plan reports that the single
largest cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building materials,
usually comprising between 30 to 50 percent of the sales price of a home. These
costs are influenced by many factors such as the cost of labor, building materials,
and site preparation. Marshall & Swift is widely considered the authority on
estimating these costs and has been providing the real estate industry with cost data
for more than 75 years. According to Marshall & Swift estimates, the cost of
residential wood frame construction averages $96.30per square foot5. This estimate
includes labor and materials, excluding the cost of land, off-site improvements, and
indirect costs such as financing costs, escrow fees, property tax, etc.      The costs
attributed to construction alone for a typical 2,200 square foot, wood frame home
would be at minimum $211,860.
A reduction in amenities and quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) could result in lower
sales prices. Additionally, pre-fabricated, factory built housing may provide for
lower priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs. An additional factor
related to construction costs is the number of units built at the same time. As the
number of units developed increases, construction costs over the entire
development are generally reduced, based on economies of scale. This reduction in
costs is of particular benefit when density bonuses are utilized for the provision of
affordable housing. Although it should be noted that the reduced costs are most
attributed to a reduction in land costs; when that cost is spread on a per unit basis.
Land: Although the Consolidated Plan 2010-15 reported that the single largest cost
was related to construction costs, other factors such as the cost of land, depending
upon the type of residential product and market condition is often a more
significant cost than that of labor and materials. With the exception of the former
MCAS Tustin site that is now referred to as Tustin Legacy, the City of Tustin is

generally built out. This scarcity of land within the developed areas of the City and
the price of land on the fringes are constraints adding to the cost of housing and
pricing housing out of the reach of low- to moderate-income families.
Financing: Interest rates can have an impact on housing costs. Some mortgage
financing is variable rate, which offers an initial lower interest rate than fixed
financing. The ability of lending institutions to raise rates to adjust for inflation will
cause existing households to overextend themselves financially, and create
situations where high financing costs constrain the housing market. An additional
obstacle for the first-time homebuyer is the minimum down-payment required by
lending institutions.
Even if Tustin homebuyers are able to provide a 3 percent down-payment and
obtain a 3.6 percent 30-year loan (average loan rate for FHA or VA guaranteed loans
for May 2013), monthly mortgage payments on median priced single-family
detached homes in the City place such homes out of the reach of moderate and
lower-income households in the City. At a 3.6percent interest rate, monthly
mortgage payments on median priced condominiums and townhouses can place
such units out of reach of Tustin's low and very low income households (see Tables
HTM-23 and HTM-25).
The greatest impediment to homeownership, however, is credit worthiness.
According to the Federal Housing Authority, lenders consider a person’s debt-to-
income ratio, cash available for down payment, and credit history, when
determining a maximum loan amount. Many financial institutions are willing to
significantly decrease down payment requirements and increase loan amounts to
persons with good credit rating. Persons with poor credit ratings may be forced to
accept a higher interest rate or a loan amount insufficient to purchase a house. Poor
credit rating can be especially damaging to lower-income residents, who have fewer
financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The FHA is generally more
flexible than conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and allows many
residents to re-establish a good credit history.
Profit, Marketing and Overhead: According to the Comprehensive Affordable
Housing Strategy6, minimum developer profit is estimated at 12 percent of
development costs, based on input from developers and the Building Industry
Association. This level is considered a baseline profit or “hurdle rate,” representing
the minimum necessary for the deal to proceed. In the past, due to high market
demand in communities like Tustin, developers were able to command for higher
prices and realized greater margins for profit. As demand increased and prices
rose, this profit margin was impacted by the escalating costs of land resulting from
a shrinking supply of land. Marketing and overhead costs also add to the price of

homes. The Comprehensive Affordable Strategy 2008 – 2018 estimated developer
overhead is at 4 percent of total development costs.
Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability is affected by factors in the private and public sectors. Actions
by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing. Land use
controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees and other local
programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing may serve as a
constraint to housing development.
Land Use Controls: In efforts to protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare,
government agencies may place administrative constraints on growth through the
adoption and implementation of land use plans and ordinances. The General Plan
may restrict growth if only limited areas are set aside for residential land uses, and
if higher residential densities are not accommodated. The zoning ordinance may
impose further restrictions if development standards are too rigid, or if zoning
designations do not conform to existing land uses. On the contrary, the zoning
ordinance may also be utilized as a tool in encouraging and directing affordable
housing, i.e. relaxed development standards, higher density, provision of incentives
(waiver of fees, expedited review process, etc.) in exchange of the production of
affordable housing, etc.
Tustin's existing zoning ordinance allows for a range of residential densities from an
effective density of 4.35 units per net acre in the E-4 Residential Estate District to
24.9 units per net acre in the R-3 Multiple Family Residential District. Tustin’s
General Plan allows a maximum of seven (7) units per acre with effective density of
5.61 dwelling units per acre within the Low Density Residential land use to a
maximum of 25 units per acre with effective density of 21.53 dwelling units per acre
within High Density Residential land use. Ten (10) units per net acre are also
permitted in the MHP Mobile home Park District (see Table HTM-32). The Planned
Community District has authorized residential subdivisions with single-family lots
of 3,500-5,000 net square feet, which significantly increases density potential. The
Planned Community Development also provides incentives such as no height limits
when certain criterion are met and for innovative designs that incorporate small
lots, residential clustering, mixed density, and mixed income types which also
provides flexibility in overall density.
Within the Multi-Family Residential District (R-3), a 35 foot height limitation and 65
percent coverage precludes the development of housing projects with building
height above the 35 foot limitation. In the interest of protecting adjoining single-
family lot owners, multifamily structures above 20 feet in height require a
conditional use permit when the structures are within 150 feet of single-family
residentially zoned lots. There are approximately 20 properties with an R-3 zoning
designation that abut Single Family Residential (R-1) zoning comprised of a variety of

older apartment units and several parcels within Old Town Tustin that are adjacent to
the First Street commercial zoning areas. While these height limits may place some
restrictions on housing development, these limits are designed to maintain compat-
ibility of land use intensity and to ensure proper and effective transportation within
the community and are commonly used by local governments as a development
tool to further this ideal. When designed properly with features such as limited
windows and door openings along the walls facing single family zoned properties
or using stepped building heights and design to minimize intrusion to the privacy
of existing residents, Conditional Use Permits to allow such development projects
have been granted.
Conversely, within Neighborhood D of the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan, a 150 foot
height limitation up to 180 foot if approved by the Community Development
Director would be allowed which provides for layering products (i.e. stacked flats,
podium style, etc.) with mixed use developments, thereby providing opportunities
for the development of higher density residential products.
The Land Use Element indicates that residential development that supports
commercial uses may also be permitted in the City’s Old Town Commercial area. A
market analysis of the Old Town area prepared in conjunction with comprehensive
1994 General Plan Amendments indicated that new multi-family residential
development would be an important supporting use for the area’s mixed-used
commercial/retail development. As a result, the General Plan was amended in 1997
to permit up to 291 additional residential units in the Old Town commercial area.
To ensure compatibility of residential uses with the commercial area, the location,
density, and building intensity standards for these residential units will be
governed by planned community regulations, the adoption of a specific plan, or the
approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
The East Tustin Specific Plan provides for single-family detached products to be
developed at a variety of densities. The Low Density designation requires a
minimum lot area of 5,000 net square feet while the Medium-Low designation
requires a minimum lot area of 3,000 net square feet and densities not to exceed 5
and 10 units per net acre respectively.
The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan designation provides opportunities for
development of a variety of residential products at varied density ranging up to 25
dwelling units per acre. In addition, the Specific Plan allows for density bonuses
and density averaging. For example, in Neighborhood D, the maximum density on
an individual parcel may exceed 25 units per acre as long as the total dwelling units
allocated to Neighborhood D is not exceeded. Consistent with the City’s policy to
increase homeownership to maintain a balanced community, the majority of
residential units authorized within the Specific Plan are owner-occupied units.
However, in response to market demand, the City processed an amendment to the

MCAS Tustin Specific Plan that allowed for additional renter-occupied units,
including affordable rental units.
The Final Joint EIS/EIR for the Disposal and Reuse of the MCAS-Tustin (hereafter
referred to as Program EIS/EIR for MCAS-Tustin) for the reuse of the base identifies
specific improvements needed to support residential development. The build out of
the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan is expected to occur incrementally over a 20+ year
timeframe. The actual level of development within any given phase will be tied to
the availability of infrastructure necessary to support such development.
Implementation triggers of specific infrastructure improvements are included in the
EIS/EIR for the project.
The anticipated timing of residential development of the MCAS-Tustin Specific Plan
is as follows:

 The remaining opportunity sites consist of a large proportion of small vacant and
underutilized land that is located within the City or Old Town residential areas
where infrastructure is available and no major improvements would be anticipated.
Limited residential uses are also permitted in areas designated Public/Institutional
provided the intended occupants are associated with the primary institutional uses.
Additionally, homeless facilities are permitted by right in the MCAS Tustin Specific
Plan and are allowed throughout the remainder of the City either as an outright
permitted or conditionally permitted use depending on the number of residents in
the project.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance calculates parking requirements by unit type (See
HTM-32 for summary of parking requirements). Parking requirements in Tustin are
generally two spaces per unit, with an additional requirement of one guest space
per every four units in multi-family development. Carports for multi-family units
are permitted which would reduce development costs in contrasts to the provision
of garages. Furthermore, affordable and senior housing development meeting the
State Density Bonus Law would be eligible to use the reduced parking standards
under the State Law.
In response to State mandated requirements and local needs, the City has adopted
ordinances allowing for the development of accessory rental units and density
bonuses. Beyond local requirements, state law created a sliding scale which allows
developers to increase the density of a residential development by at least 20
percent up to 35 percent provided that certain numbers of units are allocated for
lower and moderate-income housing.
In addition, in response to state-mandated requirements and local needs, the City
allows for second dwelling units. Second units serve to augment resources for
senior housing and the needs of other segments of the population. Second dwelling
units are outright permitted in residentially zoned properties that are at least 12,000
square feet in lot size. A two-car garage is required.
The City’s land use regulatory mechanisms accommodate the development of
housing at a range of densities and products and do not constrain the potential for
new construction at densities suitable to meet the needs of all income ranges,
although assistance may be required for units offered at prices affordable to lower
income households.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities/Reasonable Accommodation
The City of Tustin recognizes the importance of addressing the housing needs for
persons with disabilities. The City’s Zoning Code defines “family” as “an

GENERAL PLAN                                  36                     OCTOBER 1, 2013

individual or two (2) or more persons living together as a single housekeeping unit
in a dwelling unit.” This definition accommodates unrelated persons living
together in a dwelling unit; thus, the City’s definition for a family would not
constrain the development and rehabilitation for persons with disabilities.
The City requires each development to comply with Title 24 of the California Code.
All multi-family complexes are required to provide accessible parking spaces based
upon the prescribed State code requirements. For development of special needs
housing such as housing for the disabled, senior housing, etc., parking requirements
would be determined based upon parking demand analysis which by nature would
allow for lower parking ratio in comparison to those required for multiple family
residential units. In addition, an off-street parking ordinance adopted by the City
allows for the reduction in parking due to an American with Disabilities Act (ADA)
upgrade. The Community Development Director is authorized to allow the
reduction in the number of required parking spaces when the site is brought up to
ADA standards. This provision provides incentives to property owners to provide
reasonable accommodation to the disabled.
The City also requires new multi-family housing units and apartment conversions
to condominiums to comply with State specifications pursuant to SB 520 for
accommodation of the disabled.
A Residential Care facility serving six (6) or fewer persons is a permitted use in all
residential districts. The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not contain maximum
concentration requirements for a residential care facility serving six (6) or fewer
persons.
The City recognizes the need of disabled persons to retrofit their residences to allow
for mobility such as wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, grab bars, and access
ramps. When these improvements meet development standards, only a building
permit is required.      , In 2011, the City amended the Zoning Code to remove
governmental constraints to reasonable accommodation for the disabled. The
amendment provides a process in which deviations from the development
standards associated with physical improvements to accommodate the disabled
would be accommodated with administrative approval and without the need of a
public hearing.
Homeless Accommodation
Homelessness is a statewide concern that affects many cities and counties.
Throughout the country, homelessness has become an ongoing problem. Factors
contributing to homelessness include the general lack of housing affordable to low and
moderate income persons, increases in the number of persons whose incomes fall

below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidy to the poor, and the
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill. The issue of homelessness is considered
regional in nature. Nomadic tendencies of homeless persons make it difficult to assess
the population accurately.
Within the City of Tustin, Police reports and windshield surveys indicate limited
numbers of persons on the street and have shown that there are no established areas
where homeless persons congregate in the City and that most persons migrate through
Tustin to other areas within Orange County, rather than stay for extended periods of
time. Information regarding the nature and extent of homelessness by racial and
ethnic groups is not available at this time. The Orange County Partnership, a non-
profit organization whose purpose is to strengthen public and private agencies serving
the homeless and those at risk of homelessness, reported that in 2009 there were 10
homeless persons who identified Tustin as the city of last known permanent address.
The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act reported 55 homeless
children and youth enrolled in the Tustin Unified School District during 2006-07.
In addition to identifying homeless needs in Tustin, pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 2,
statute of 2007, the City is required to engage in a more detailed analysis of
emergency shelters, transitional, and supportive housing (See Technical
Memorandum for further details) by identifying the needs for homeless shelters in
its Housing Element and designating adequate zoning districts to accommodate the
needs. In those districts, emergency shelters must be allowed without a conditional
use permit or other discretionary permit.
With the closure of the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Tustin, the City was
provided with opportunity to address homeless accommodation. As part of the
conveyance process and under the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and
Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 (The “Redevelopment Act”), the City of Tustin as,
the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) was required to consider the interest of
the homeless in buildings and property on the base in preparing the Reuse Plan
(MCAS Tustin Specific Plan/Reuse Plan). In developing the Reuse Plan, one criteria
the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) utilized to determine the
adequacy of the Reuse Plan was whether the Plan considered the size and nature of
the homeless population in the communities, in the vicinity of the installation, and
availability of existing services in such communities to meet the needs of the
homeless in such communities.
At the time of the preparation of the Reuse Plan, it was estimated that there was a
total net homeless need of 411 persons in the City of Tustin and City of Irvine (A
portion of the MCAS Tustin is located within the City of Irvine jurisdiction). A
large portion of this homeless need was identified as necessary to support

emergency transitional housing for youth and individuals. The local homeless need
as described in both Tustin and Irvine’s Consolidated Plans also indicated a gap in
the continuum of care in the areas of vocational and job training/educational
opportunities, some emergency and transitional housing units for individuals and
families, support services, and affordable ownership units. Accordingly, the
Homeless Assistance Plan for MCAS Tustin was adapted to addresses the problem
of homelessness by utilizing the continuum of care model promulgated by HUD for
accommodating the needs of the homeless in a manner which is consistent with the
Consolidated Plans approved for the cities of Tustin and Irvine.
The fundamental components of the continuum of care system implemented with
the MCAS Tustin Reuse Plan:
       Provides emergency shelter beds;
       Offers transitional housing and services which enable homeless persons to
        progress to self-sufficiency; and
       Provides opportunities for permanent affordable housing by the private
        sector.
As a result, the adopted MCAS Tustin Specific Plan provided sites and designated
land uses to accommodate the identified homeless needs. The following sites were
set aside in implementing the homeless accommodation at Tustin Legacy (formerly
MCAS Tustin):
        An approximate five (5) acre transitional/emergency shelter site was set-
        aside for accommodation of the homeless at MCAS Tustin. The City
        acquired a site from the Department of Navy; initially ground leased the site,
        and ultimately conveyed the site to the Orange County Rescue Mission at no
        cost and facilitated the construction of Village of Hope, a 192 unit
        transitional housing facility, without the need for a Conditional Use Permit.
        The project has been completed.
        A four (4) acre site was recommended by the City of Tustin and deeded
        directly by the Department of Navy at no cost to the Orange County Social
        Services Agency for the development of an abused and neglected child and
        emancipated youth facility with 90 beds capacity. The project is complete.
        A total of 50 transitional housing units were originally included in the Base
        Reuse Plan. Based on further negotiations with non-profit homeless
        providers, a total of 32 new transitional housing units were constructed and
        conveyed at no cost to non-profit homeless providers at Tustin Legacy.
        These units are dispersed throughout the Tustin Legacy community to allow

         integration into the community. The sites are designated as residential sites
         and the units were constructed in conjunction with market rate units subject
         to only those restrictions that apply to other residential uses. The units are
         transparent since the units are developed identical to those of market rate
         units in terms of size, materials, locations, etc. No special or other
         entitlement applications were required for the creation of these units other
         than those typically required for development of residential units at Tustin
         Legacy. In addition to the homeless accommodation on-site at Tustin
         Legacy, the City also facilitated the purchase of a 16 unit transitional
         housing facility off-site for one of the homeless providers. The City
         subsidized the creation of these units through the use of housing set aside
         funds and Federal HUD Homeless Assistance funds.
In addition to the homeless accommodation, the City also encourages support
services to support the community of continuum of care model to end the cycle of
homelessness and to provide participants with tools to once again become
contributing members of the community as follows:
         Private sector opportunities are provided to create a balanced mix of
         housing types on the base. Through inclusionary Zoning standards in the
         MCAS Tustin Specific Plan, a total of 8797 affordable units or 20.8 percent of
         total authorized units at Tustin Legacy are required to allow participants
         with opportunity to achieve self-sufficiency. Specific affordable housing
         requirements would be established at the time of development project
         approval to ensure conformity with the Housing Element of the City's
         General Plan.
         The Navy will be transferring a child care facility at the former MCAS Tustin
         to the City of Tustin, which will provide opportunities for access for all to
         mainstream child care facilities, including early child care and education
         programs, Head Start, etc.
         Adult education and training opportunities will be provided by the South
         Orange County Community College District within the educational village.
Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Supportive Housing: SB 2 defines
“Emergency Shelters” as housing for homeless purposes intended for occupancy of
less than six (6) months, where no person is denied occupancy because of inability
to pay. In the City of Tustin, emergency shelters are designated as permitted uses
within Planning Area 3 of the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan. Planning Area 3 is a five

(5) acre site that had been a no cost conveyance to the Orange County Rescue
Mission for the development of an emergency/transitional shelter that is known as
Village of Hope. The City facilitated the development of the Orange County Rescue
Mission Village of Hope and waived permits fees as this was a public/private
partnership. The project consists of 192 units available for emergency and
transitional needs.
As of April 30,, 2013, the Orange County Rescue Mission Village of Hope was at
90% capacity, with a total of 173 homeless individuals consisting of homeless single
men, single women, single women with children, single men with children, and two
parent families. The largest homeless sub-population on the Village of Hope
campus is single women with children. The Orange County Rescue Mission Village
of Hope priority is to serve Tustin homeless population prior to taking any other
referrals from other cities or the County. The Tustin Police Department actively
refers individuals to the Village of Hope upon encounter. The Orange County
Rescue Mission Village of Hope also provides a food service program of
approximately 550 meals daily to the Armory.
Based upon the available data obtained from the Orange County Partnership and
McKinney Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act, approximately 34-55
individuals reported either Tustin as their last known permanent address or
enrolled within the Tustin Unified School District. This means that the City of
Tustin is accommodating 137-158 homeless persons beyond its jurisdictional
boundaries thereby accommodating a regional need. The City interviewed the
Orange County Rescue Mission Village of Hope representative and the City was
told that there are generally 5 vacant units and a minimum of five (5) percent
vacancy is available at any given time. The Orange County Rescue Mission Village
of Hope also indicated that the shelter has met above and beyond the City’s
conservative estimate of 55 homeless persons and that the shelter could
accommodate the year-round needs and seasonal fluctuation in the amount of
available beds.
Transitional housing is defined as rental housing for stays of at least six (6) months
where the units are re-circulated to another person after a set period. This housing
can take several forms, including group housing or multi-family units, and often
includes supportive services component to allow individuals to gain necessary life
skills in support of independent living. Tustin’s Zoning Code accommodates
transitional housing within several zoning districts depending on the project’s
physical structure: 1) transitional housing operated as a residential care facility is
permitted/conditionally permitted depending on the number of occupants in
residential districts; and 2) transitional housing operated as rental apartments, it is
permitted by right as a multi-family residential use where multifamily housing is
permitted.

Supportive housing is defined as permanent (no limit on the length of stay),
provides supportive services and is occupied by low-income persons with
disabilities and certain other disabled persons. Services may include assistance
designed to meet the needs of the target population in retaining housing, career
counseling, mental health treatment, and life skills. Tustin’s Zoning Code permits
supportive housing as a residential use, provided supportive services are ancillary
to the primary use.
Emergency shelters are permitted within Planning Area 1 of the MCAS Tustin
Specific Plan. Transitional homes and supportive housing are also designated as
permitted uses within Planning Areas 1 and 3 of the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan.
Community care facilities such as group homes, foster homes, elderly care facilities,
etc. with six (6) or fewer people are outright permitted within any residentially
zoned property.

         A 192-unit8 emergency/transitional home at the Village of Hope operated by
         the Orange County Rescue Mission.
        A 90-bed intermediate care shelter for abused children and their parents
         operated by the Orange County Social Services Agency.
        Six (6) units at Tustin Field I operated by Salvation Army.
        Acquisition of 16 units in Buena Park operated by the Salvation Army. The
         City assisted in acquisition and contributed grant funds to acquire the units.
         Fourteen (14) units at Columbus Grove operated by Families Forward,
         formerly Irvine Temporary Housing.9
        Six (6) units at Columbus Grove operated by Human Options.
         Six (6) units at Columbus Grove operated by Orange Coast Interfaith
         Shelter.
With the exception of the emergency shelter, these units are transparent and
dispersed throughout the community consistent with the City’s goals and
policies to provide adequate supply of housing to meet the need for a variety of
housing types and the diverse socio-economic and to promote the dispersion and
integration of housing for all socio-economic throughout the community.
The City’s policies for homeless accommodation do not create constraints in the
location of adequate emergency shelters, transitional homes, shelters, and
supportive housing. In addition, current provision of homeless accommodation
supports not only the need of the city but the county as well.
Fees and Improvements: Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and
other outside agencies (e.g., school districts) to cover costs of processing permits
and providing services and facilities, such as utilities, schools and infrastructure.
These fees are assessed based on the concept of cost recovery for services provided.
Tustin is urbanized with most of the necessary infrastructure, such as streets, sewer
and water facilities in place. Nonetheless, site improvements can significantly add
to the cost of producing housing. Cost-effective site planning can minimize site
improvement costs. The Housing Element Technical Memorandum describes in
detail required site improvements and provides a list of fees associated with
development (Table HTM-34)
Development fees are not considered a constraint to housing. However, fees do
contribute to the total cost of development and impact the final purchase or rental
price. The City, in conjunction with the preparation of the 2009 Housing Element
also prepared the Affordable Gap and Leveraged Financing Analysis (Appendix A
8 As defined pursuant to the U.S. Census Bureau definition.
9 Although these units are located in the City of Irvine, these units were negotiated as part of the base
  realignment/conveyance process with Tustin as the Local Redevelopment Authority.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                                    HOUSING ELEMENT

of the Housing Element Technical Memorandum). The analysis evaluated
development costs to arrive to per unit affordability gap in producing affordable
units. Table 12 and Table 13 of the analysis summarize average per unit
development processing and impact fee of $29,277 to $37,530 per unit for owner
housing prototype and $25,586 per unit for rental housing prototype (See Appendix
A for specific development processing fees and analysis).
In response to the recent economic downturn, the City Council also adopted an
economic stimulus program which allowed the payment of specific development
fees for construction of new residential units to be deferred until either prior to final
inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy. This program provided direct and
indirect assistance to developer of residential units in that reduced on-hand cash
flow were required at time of permit issuance.
Building Codes and Enforcement: The City of Tustin adopts the Uniform
Construction Codes, as required by State law, which establish minimum
construction standards as applied to residential buildings. The City's building codes
are the minimum standards necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare and ensure safe housing. Only local modifications to the codes are made
which respond to local climatic or geographic conditions and clarify administrative
procedures.
Although not mandated to do so, the City has adopted the State Historical Code
that relaxes building code requirements citywide for historic structures/buildings.
Adoption of codes reduces rehabilitation costs.
Local Processing and Permit Procedures: The evaluation and review process
required by City procedures contributes to the cost of housing. State law establishes
maximum time limits for project approvals and City policies provide for the
minimum processing time necessary to comply with legal requirements and review
procedures.
The Community Development Department serves as the coordinating agency to
process development applications for the approval of other in-house departments
such as Police, Public Works/Engineering, and Parks and Recreation. All projects
are processed through plan review in the order of submission. The City has
eliminated the potential increase in financing costs caused by a delay in permit
processing by assigning priority to the plan review and permit issuance for low-
income housing projects. If a complete application is submitted, all Design Review
Committee members and plan checking departments simultaneously review the
plans. The Design Review application does not require a public hearing or Planning
Commission approval.           The Tustin City Code authorizes the Community
Development Director to approve development plans when findings can be made
that the location, size, architectural features and general appearance of the proposed
development will not impair the orderly and harmonious development of the area.

In making such findings, the Zoning Code provides items to be considered such as
height, bulk, setbacks, site planning, exterior materials and colors, relationship of
the proposed structures with existing structures in the neighborhood, etc. This code
provision affords the developers with tools to design their projects and thus
increase certainty of project’s design review and approval. Project application which
complies with all the development standards prescribed by the district in which the
project is located would not be required to go through any other discretionary
approval.
For Tustin Legacy, developments under the former Master Developer footprint
(approximately 800 acres) are subject to the Legacy Park Design Guidelines to
ensure compatibility of products proposed by vertical builders. The design
guidelines present minimum design criteria for the achievement of functional,
quality, and attractive development expected at the Tustin Legacy. The guidelines
are intended to complement the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan district regulations and
to provide staff, builders, design professionals, and other users with a concise
document when dealing with Design Review process to avoid ambiguity.
Together the Zoning Code, Design Review provisions, the Legacy Park Design
Guidelines, and the "one-stop" processing system provide certainty to developers
seeking approval for the development of residential projects.
For projects of significant benefit to the low-income community, costs can be
waived by the City Council.
Workload: Another governmental constraint is the number of staff and amount of
staff time available for processing development projects. Since the workload is
determined by outside and uncontrolled forces (economy and market for housing
and availability of general fund revenue), a shortage of staff time may occur which
could lead to increased processing time for development projects.
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
Table H-12 shows the existing and potential dwelling units permitted under each
General Plan land use category, as well as the potential net increase within each
category. Based on the City's Land Use Plan, Tustin has a residential holding
capacity of approximately 29,821 dwelling units. The Land Use Plan provides for a
mix of unit types and densities, including low-density single-family homes,
medium density homes, higher density homes, and mixed-use projects that allow
for a combination of commercial and residential uses.
A large portion of future residential development in the City of Tustin will take
place in the MCAS Tustin Reuse Specific Plan area. The other large Specific Plan
community in Tustin, Tustin Ranch (the East Tustin Specific Plan) has been built
out.

Housing Units Approved/Entitled and Under Construction
A total of 88 Very Low Income units, 73 Low Income units, 101 Moderate Income units, and 871
Above Moderate Income units were approved/entitled at the time of the preparation of this
housing element as follows:
St. Anton Partners:
This residential affordable multiple-family project was approved on November 6, 2012, and
will consist of 225 affordable units, of which 88 units are set aside as Very Low Income units, 73
units for Low Income, and 64 units for Moderate Income households. Completion of the project
is anticipated in spring of 2014.
The Irvine Company Legacy Villas:
This residential multiple family project was approved on November 6, 2012, and will consist of
533 residences, including 37 units for Moderate Income households. Completion of the project
is anticipated in spring of 2014.
Table H-14 illustrates the residential development potential of the vacant and underutilized
land inventory in the City of Tustin. The Tustin Legacy site (formerly MCAS Tustin) presents
the City with 180.67 acres suited for residential development that could accommodate an
additional 2,105units. During the planning period, the majority of the anticipated units will be
accommodated at Tustin Legacy and is being implemented through both the adoption of a
Specific Plan by the City and the adoption of a Redevelopment Project Area (dissolved in 2011).
Based on State Redevelopment Law at that time and Specific Plan requirements, at least 15
percent of the units (607 units) constructed at the MCAS Tustin site will be affordable to Very-
Low, Low, and Moderate-income households, of which at least 6 percent or 243 units must be
affordable to Very Low-income households. The remaining 364 units would be distributed
among the Low and Moderate income households by utilizing RHNA Low and Moderate
income percentages. In addition to these inclusionary obligations, the acreage and densities
permitted by the MCAS-Tustin Reuse Plan created 282 additional units for Very Low-income
households (192 transitional housing units and 90 social services housing units).
Aside from MCAS Tustin, additional sites are located within the City. As a means to ensure
affordability, the City may require developers to provide at least 15 percent of all units
constructed or rehabilitated at prices affordable to Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income
households.
The City aggressively negotiates affordable housing units within individual potential projects.
An example of an approved infill site is the development of a fifty-four (54) unit affordable
senior housing project on a 1.76 acre site. The project was granted a twenty-five (25) percent
density bonus above the City’s maximum allowable density. In addition, the City entered into a
Disposition and Developer Agreement with the developer to issue loans not to exceed $600,000.
The loans are secured by loan agreements, promissory notes and deeds of trust, along with
Regulatory Agreement and Declaration of Restrictive Covenants to be recorded against the
property for a period of not less than 55 years. The project is 100 percent affordable to very low
and low income seniors.

The remaining capacity in Old Town Tustin will be achieved through recycling of underutilized
and vacant infill sites (see Figure 1). According to the City’s Land Use Element, the sites in Old
Town Tustin area are able to accommodate an overall population range for residential use of 2-
54 persons per acre10. The Land Use Element further identifies the potential development of
dwelling units in the Old Town Commercial area, which will be facilitated by the proposed
adoption of zoning regulations and development standards which will allow mixed-use
development (see Program 1.21 of Table H-20 Housing Element Programs). This development
potential is supported by the market analysis of the Old Town area.
To further create housing opportunities, the City provides the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for
the development of affordable housing through a Joint Powers Authority with the California
Statewide Communities Development Authority. Other means would include the City’s
participation in the State and Federal programs such as the Low- Income Housing Revenue
Bond Financing program, Low Income Tax Credits, CHFA financing programs, and others.
Additionally, a Density Bonus Ordinance is available and can be applied to infill sites to
increase allowable density and the Tustin City Code also provides for a Planned Community
District which allows flexibility in site development standards such as the creation of smaller
lots to allow for higher density.
As demonstrated in Table H-13A, there are a total of 205.3 acres of land (177.1 acres from MCAS
Tustin, 15.35 acres vacant land, and 12.85 acres underutilized land) with residential
development potential. These sites could potentially be developed with approximately 2,882
units. This demonstrates that the City has sufficient amount of land available to accommodate
the residential developments to meet the remaining RHNA construction needs through the 2021
period.

Figure 1 and Tables H-14 and 15 detail the zoning designations of vacant and underutilized
land in Tustin. The vacant and underutilized land inventory includes land that is currently
zoned medium- and high-density residential and land that could potentially be designated as
high-density residential. Realistic capacity of sites that are identified in Tables H-14 and 15 are
derived from past development proposals, historical character of the area, inquiries received by
the Community Development Department, Disposition and Development Agreements between
the City and developers, exclusive negotiations with potential developer(s) authorized by the
City Council, maximum zoning and general plan densities, and eligible incentives to developers
for provisions of affordable housing. Realistic capacity for sites identified to meet the City’s
share of regional housing needs either are determined based upon current zoning and general
plan, executed Disposition and Development Agreement, and the City Council authorized
exclusive negotiations with potential developers.
The closure of MCAS Tustin provides the City with opportunity sites to meet the City’s share of
regional housing needs. The majority of the City’s share of housing needs will be provided at
the former MCAS Tustin (Tustin Legacy) project site which was part of the base closure
realignment process. The Federal government provided the land to the City at no cost. The City
has been conveying the land to developers for the development of the Tustin Legacy.
Although the availability of vacant and underutilized land for the provision of housing is not
considered a constraint for the 2013-2021 planning period, future planning periods may be
marked by a lack of available land. While the City's Land Use Plan provides an adequate land
capacity to fulfill housing needs, current development costs in Tustin may preclude the private
housing market from providing affordability for low and very low-income households without
subsidies. Necessary infrastructure improvements and litigation constraints may cause some
delays in the build-out development of the MCAS Tustin project.
Satisfaction of the City’s quantified objectives through new construction will be heavily
dependent upon real estate market trends, cooperation of private funding sources, and
available funding and programs at the local, county, state and federal levels.

       HOUSING ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
This section of the Housing Element contains the goals and policies the City intends
to implement to address a number of housing-related issues. To implement the
Housing Element, the following six major issue areas are identified with related
goals and policies: 1) ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to
meet the needs of existing and future residents; 2) provide equal housing
opportunities for all City residents; 3) ensure a reasonable balance between rental
and owner occupied housing; 4) preserve existing affordable housing; 5) promote
conservation and rehabilitation of housing and neighborhood identity; and 6)
ensure housing is sensitive to the existing natural and built environment.
HOUSING SUPPLY/HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
Tustin is home to persons requiring a variety of housing options. At different stages
in their lives, people require different housing arrangements. Additionally, the City
must respond to the housing needs of all economic segments of the community and
ensure that housing discrimination does not serve as a barrier. It is also important
that the City maintain a balance of housing types and that the City's housing stock
is not overly skewed towards the provision of one type of housing. Finally, the
continuing need for affordable housing in the region requires the City to attempt to
preserve Low-income housing units that are at risk of converting to other uses. The
City establishes the following goals and policies to achieve the above objectives.
GOAL 1: Provide an adequate supply of housing to meet the need for a variety of
housing types and the diverse socio-economic needs of all community residents.
Policy 1.1: Promote the construction of additional dwelling units to accommodate
Tustin's share of regional housing needs identified by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG), in accordance with adopted land use policies.
Policy 1.2: Pursue smart growth principles by supporting the construction of higher
density housing, affordable housing, and mixed use development (the vertical and
horizontal integration of commercial and residential uses) in proximity to transit,
services, shopping, schools, senior centers and recreational facilities, where possible.
Policy 1.3: Consider site scoring, income targeting, and other selection criteria for
competitive funding sources for affordable housing, such as Low Income Housing
Tax Credits, when allocating Agency resources for affordable housing to maximize
leverage of local funds.
Policy 1.3: Continue to implement best practices for developer selection, project
underwriting and due diligence for affordable housing developments that receive

financial and other assistance to ensure long-term viability of affordable housing
and to ensure the maximized leverage of local resources.
Policy 1.4: Preserve affordable housing units, where possible, through actions such
as the maintenance of a mobile home park zone, restrictions on R-3 zone uses to
preserve the multiple family residential characters, facilitate resident access to
funding sources for preservation of low income and assisted housing.
Policy 1.5: Promote the dispersion and integration of housing for low- and very-low
income families throughout the community as opposed to within any particular
geographic area, neighborhood, or project.
Policy 1.6: Encourage the County of Orange to exercise its responsibilities for
housing accommodations for low- and very-low income families within Tustin's
sphere of influence.
Policy 1.7: Utilize various resources, where feasible, to assist in creating
opportunities which will expand opportunities for development of affordable
housing in the community.
Policy 1.8: Allow second (attached/detached) units in single- and multi-family
districts consistent with the Tustin City Code.
Policy 1.9: Utilize Planned Community Districts and Specific Plans to authorize and
promote a variety of lot sizes and housing types.
Policy 1.10: Promote cluster housing consistent with General Plan land use density
standards to reduce the cost of housing construction.
Policy 1.11: Encourage the availability of affordable housing for special needs
households, including large, low-income families. Special needs households
include the elderly, large families, female-headed households with children,
households with a disabled person, and the homeless (see discussion under
Summary of Housing Needs for Special Needs Groups).
Policy 1.12: Encourage incentives to assist in the preservation and development of
affordable housing such as 1) reducing permit processing time and waiving or
reducing applicable permit fees; 2) on-site density bonuses when appropriate; 3)
tax-exempt financing including continuing to make use of the City’s membership in
the California Statewide Communities Development Authority to provide
opportunities for developer assistance in pre-development and development
financing of affordable housing programs; 4) flexibility in zoning or development
standards; and 5) other financial incentives using a variety of special State and
Federal grant and housing programs.

         HOUSING ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
                                   PROGRAM
The Housing Element Implementation Program provides specific actions the City
intends to undertake to achieve the goals and policies of the Element. This section
identifies quantified objectives, available financial resources and affordable housing
resources, and provides a list of specific programs the City intends to pursue.
Housing programs include those currently in operation and new programs added
to address housing needs. A description of each program is provided, along with
the program funding source, responsible agency, and time frame for
implementation. A review of City’s past performance on housing element
implementation programs is contained in Appendix A of the Housing Element.
RHNA QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES 2014-2021
State law requires the City to accommodate its fair share of the State's housing need.
In doing so, the City must quantify the number of homes that are projected to be
built and conserved. The following quantified objectives are adopted as guidelines
toward meeting Tustin's housing needs through 2021.
It is important to note that while the quantified objectives of the RHNA are required
to be part of the Housing Element and the City will strive to attain these objectives,
Tustin cannot guarantee that these needs will be met given its own limited financial
resources and the present affordability gap. Satisfaction of the City's regional
housing needs will partially depend upon cooperation of private funding sources
and the funding levels of County, State, and Federal programs that are used to
support the needs of the very-low, low and moderate-income persons. Additionally,
outside economic forces heavily influence the housing market.
New Construction Objectives
The City of Tustin promotes and encourages the development of a variety of
housing opportunities to accommodate current and projected housing needs which
include 283 very low-, 195 low-, 224 moderate-, and 525 above moderate-income
households per the 2012 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) allocation.
While the Land Use Plan provides adequate sites to fulfill needs established by
RHNA, construction of new units will depend upon the timing of the landowner
and developer in the submission of building plans to meet market demands.
Housing subsidies will depend upon the availability of government funds – local,
County, State, and Federal. Development projects are subject to the interests of
private developers. The construction of secondary units depends upon the desires
of the property owners as related to family needs for housing and economic

resources. The achievements of the housing objectives are thus dependent upon the
private sector and other governmental agencies. The responsibility of the City is to
encourage the construction of affordable housing by providing programs and
assistance to developers and to assist in its creation by facilitating the review and
approval of development permits.
 Table H-17 provides new construction housing objectives for the period 2014-2021.
 With the exception of Tustin Legacy, all sites identified in Table H-17 are privately
 owned. Units identified are broken down into various income limits in light of
 RHNA percentages.
 Table H-13 discusses the City’s progress toward achieving the RHNA quantified
 objective. Based on units approved or under construction, the City of Tustin has
 the following remaining units to achieve RHNA’s construction objective: 195 Very
 Low Income, 122 Low Income, 123 Moderate Income and 29 Above Moderate
 Income units. The City will make its best efforts to accommodate this objective by
 carrying out the following projects and/or programs:
 Preservation
 Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.1(c), up to 25 percent of the lower
 income RHNA may be fulfilled with existing units when affordability is achieved
 through:
        Affordability covenants placed on previously non-affordable units;
        Extension of affordability covenants on affordable housing projects
        identified as at risk of converting to market-rate housing; and
        Acquisition/rehabilitation and deed restriction of housing units.
 With RHNA allocated 478 lower income units, the City may fulfill 120 lower
 income units (71 Very Low and 49 Low) through preservation of existing housing
 units. As identified in the Preservation of Units At-risk for Conversion section of
 the Housing Element, there are a total of 100 units at risk for conversion during the
 planning period at Tustin Gardens. .
 The City, in anticipation of this opportunity, had programmed $2,181,672 of RDA
 housing set aside funds in the Agency’s Comprehensive Affordable Housing
 Strategy’s Six- Year Capital Plan to negotiate the preservation of these units. The
 City Council in their capacity as the Redevelopment Agency (eliminated 2011)
 adopted the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategy (CAHS) in June 2008
 committing up to $2,181,672 of Agency Housing Set-Aside funds for the
 preservation efforts of these at-risk units. However, the dissolution of
 Redevelopment in 2011 effectively eliminated the primary source of funding that
 could be used to preserve these units at risk of conversion.

 As presented in Table HTM-34 of the Housing Element Technical Memorandum,
 the City has fulfilled a portion of its regional share for very low and low income
 households (362 and 127 units respectively) during the prior planning period,
 rendering the City eligible to utilize the alternative site program, if desired. The
 City is in contact with Tustin Gardens regularly and has expressed interest in
 ensuring the continuation of these affordable units. The City is also in contact with
 residents to allow for active public participation with current residents to ensure
 continued affordability.
 Tustin Gardens maintains a Section 8 contract for rental assistance. They are
 currently approved through July 13, 2014 with a HUD-requirement that they
 provide a one-year notice to terminate their current Section 8 contract. The earliest
 date affordability restrictions can expire is July 2015. The city will make every
 effort to assist the owner obtain an extension of the HUD Section 8 contract. .
 Considering the earliest possible scenario of affordability restrictions expiring July
 2015, the total cost of subsidizing Tustin Gardens for the term of the Housing
 Element, July 2014 to October 2021, would be about $4,205,400.
 The City believes Tustin Gardens is a viable project to receive 4% Tax Credit, Tax-
 Exempt Bond funding. Tustin Gardens is a 100% affordable, very-low income
 Senior Project. The City would work with the current owner to establish a non-
 profit affordable housing entity to apply for 4% Tax Credit, Tax-Exempt Bond
 funding for the acquisition and rehabilitation of Tustin Gardens.
 New Construction:
 Tustin Legacy Former Master Developer Footprint (Neighborhoods D and G)
 As mentioned throughout the Housing Element, the closure of the MCAS Tustin
 provides the City with opportunity to create affordable units to accommodate the
 needs of the residents. The City in 2001 adopted the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan
 and in 2003 designated the MCAS Tustin as a Redevelopment Project area and
 adopted the MCAS Tustin Redevelopment Plan (eliminated 2011). As part of the
 adopted Specific Plan, a total of 4,210 housing units were authorized and to date
 2,105 units have been constructed. The 2,105 units yet to be built are under the
 Former Master Developer footprint. 758 units within Neighborhoods D and G have
 been approved. 190 of these 758 units are approved density bonus units.
 Therefore the remaining development potential is 1,537 units (2,105+190-758), plus
 any future density bonus units. In Neighborhood D, the maximum density on any
 individual parcel may exceed 25 dwelling units per acre as long as the total
 dwelling units allocated to Neighborhood D is not exceeded. Thus, a default
 density of 30 units per acre could be achieved in Neighborhood D. The remaining

 development potential in Neighborhood D is 515 dwelling units plus potential
 density bonus units.
 The development of Tustin Legacy is anticipated to occur during the Housing
 Element planning period.
 New Ownership and Rental Housing, outside of Tustin Legacy
 A total development potential of 587 dwelling units outside of Tustin Legacy has
 been identified during the Housing Element planning period on vacant and
 underutilized sites. However, these sites are not required to satisfy the City’s
 RHNA.
 Other New Construction Units
 It is likely that other development will occur through Second Units, and the
 recycling of single family uses on multi-family zoned lots. Based upon recent
 development proposals, the City has observed increased interest in the
 development of, second units and the addition of units within multiple family
 dwelling properties occupied by single family dwellings. The cost to construct
 these units would be borne by the property owner. However, the City would
 facilitate the development process.
 In addition, based upon past development trends (Tustin Grove and Ambrose
 Lane) that utilized Planned Community Districts to allow for higher densities, the
 actual number of units created could be higher than identified. The City will strive
 to ensure that newly constructed units are developed at sufficient densities to assist
 in fulfillment of low and very low income needs by employing inclusionary zoning
 for those sites located within former Redevelopment project areas, mixed use
 zoning in Old Town Tustin, density bonuses particularly in infill sites to allow for
 increase densities to accommodate affordable housing developments, and Planned

Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Other Affordable Housing Program Objectives
The primary beneficiaries of Preservation and Rehabilitation and Assistance
programs are renters and low-income homeowners. It is assumed that above-
moderate-income households will rehabilitate units as needed through private
efforts.
Tustin’s affordable housing strategy is based on the City’s housing needs,
affordability gap analysis, and available financial resources. Several broad policies
establish the framework for the City’s Housing strategy as applied to preservation,
rehabilitation, and other housing program objectives. These include:
     1. Conserve, maintain, and rehabilitate existing housing and revitalize existing
          neighborhoods;
     2. Maximize the supply of affordable housing;

     3. Increase homeownership;
     4. Preserve the existing supply of affordable housing; and,
Consistent with the above policies the City has devised a number of programs of
housing assistance to address the preservation, rehabilitation, and other housing
program objectives. Specific details on these programs can be found in the City of
Tustin Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy for Fiscal Years 2008/09 to
2017/18. In addition, Table H-20 – Housing Element Programs 2013-2021 outlines
the City’s specific housing programs during the planning period.
 Summary of Quantified Objectives
Table H-18 summarizes the City’s Quantified Objectives for the 2013-2021 period.
Based on the requirements of AB 2634, statute of 2006 (Government Code Section
65583(a)(1)), each jurisdiction must address the projected need of Extremely Low-
Income households, defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the Area
Median Income (AMI). The projected Extremely-Low Income need is assumed to be
50 percent of the Low Income need, or 142 units based upon the percentage of
extremely-low income households contained in the regional housing needs
assessment determined by SCAG using American Community Survey data as the
baseline.

IDENTIFICATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES
The City has prepared a Consolidated Plan and Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy identifying and describing all funding programs available to
the City and Tustin Redevelopment Agency (eliminated 2011) to assist in meeting
the City's housing needs. Included in the plan are descriptions of a wide variety of
major housing assistance programs available from federal and state agencies and
private lending institutions. More specific information including details regarding
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                              65                            OCTOBER 1, 2013

eligible projects and activities and funding availability can be found in the
document. The following is a summary of this information along with updates to
reflect new state and federal programs.
The key source of local funding for affordable housing development and
preservation in Tustin was the Tustin Community Redevelopment Agency’s
(eliminated 2011) Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund, also known as the 20
Percent Set-Aside Fund. The estimated fund balance in the Agency’s Low and
Moderate Income Housing Fund as of June 30, 2007 was $17.86 million. With the
dissolution of redevelopment in 2011, these funds are no longer available.
        Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing Rental Units
        The City of Tustin has identified the preservation of existing affordable
        housing units as one of the most cost-effective methods of maintaining the
        stock of affordable housing therefore a high-priority program for the City.
        The City has identified 100 units of at-risk housing with expiring use
        restrictions within the eight-year planning period. The amount of assistance
        provided will be negotiated based on the specific economics of each
        development and the potential availability of leverage financing, such as tax-
        exempt bonds and 4% tax credits. .
        Single- and Multi-Family Home Rehabilitation Program
        The City has identified single- and multifamily home rehabilitation loans
        and grants as another cost-effective method of extending the life of
        affordable housing in the community. Based on available funding, the City
        will target single-family neighborhoods in the vicinity of the Town Center
        opportunity area as part of the Town Center revitalization effort, as well as
        multifamily units citywide.
        First-Time Homebuyer and/or Foreclosure Negotiated Purchase
        The City’s First-Time Homebuyer Program provided down payment and
        second mortgage assistance to low and moderate income buyers to assist
        them to purchase an existing home in the City. The recent mortgage credit
        crises have resulted in increasing foreclosure rates throughout many parts of
        California and the nation. The City will seek funding to assist new first-time
        homebuyers in purchasing a home. This may include negotiated purchase of
        homes in foreclosure, which may represent a lower cost buying opportunity
        for first-time homebuyers.
        Homeless Assistance and Supportive Services

       The City has allocated $88,090 in 2013/14 CDBG funds to continue its
       financial support of homeless assistance and supportive services in the City.
       The City’s goal for this program is to assist 200 homeless individuals per
       year over the projection period.
       Tustin Legacy New Construction
       The City’s inclusionary housing requirements for Tustin Legacy require a
       minimum of 453 new affordable units in Planning Areas D and G combined,
       including 126 units affordable to very low income households, 95 units
       affordable to low income households, and 232 units affordable to moderate
       income households.
       Administrative Support
       The City and the Tustin Housing Authority will provide administrative
       support to implement its affordable housing activities.
       The City has initiated the development of additional very low, low and
       moderate income housing in the MCAS Tustin Project Area through density
       bonus incentives.
       The City is not an entitlement jurisdiction for HOME funds, but may apply
       to the State for HOME funds as described in a separate report prepared by
       DRA entitled Affordable Housing Assistance Programs, presented as Appendix
       C of the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategy.
       The City is an entitlement jurisdiction for Community Development Block
       Grant (CDBG) funds. For FY 2012/13, the City of Tustin was allocated
       $587,277 in CDBG funds.        These funds may be used for a number of
       community development purposes besides housing. Given the many
       competing needs for these funds and the restrictions on these funds for
       housing purposes, the City does not typically allocate CDBG funds for
       affordable housing development.
       As needed and as shown on Table H-21, the City will utilize State and
       Federal resources to leverage local resources as these funding sources match
       the City’s programmatic objectives. Table H- 21 is a summary of affordable
       housing                                                            resources.

REVIEW OF PAST PERFORMANCE
State law establishes an eight-year cycle regulating housing element updates. In
compliance with the SCAG cycle, the Tustin Housing Element was updated in 1989
at which time it was found to be in compliance with State law, and was updated
again in 1994. In 1997, the City of Tustin initiated a comprehensive General Plan
update, and the Housing Element was again updated to accommodate the MCAS
Reuse Plan and to ensure consistency with other General Plan Elements, as well as
to address recent changes in State law. These amendments were adopted on
January 16, 2001. In 2002 and 2009, the City updated its Housing Element and was
certified by The State’s Housing and Community Development Department in
compliance with State’s Law.
Review of Past Housing Element Objectives (2006-2014)
The 2007 SCAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment indicated a new construction
need in Tustin by 2014 of 2,381 units, of which 512 units were for very low income
households, 410 for low income, 468 for moderate income and 991 for above
moderate income.
The following discussion highlights the progress, effectiveness and appropriateness
of 2006-2014 Housing Element Objectives and the progress achieved during the
2006-2014 time period. Table HTM-35 in the Technical Memorandum provides a
more detailed summary of the City’s overall accomplishments for the years 2006-
2014.
As indicated in Table HTM-35, the City was successful in accomplishing the
majority of the objectives established for the past planning period. According to
City Staff, the following objectives were completely or partially met, or exceeded:
New construction
2,102 units were constructed during the 2006-2014period, partially meeting the
City’s objective of 4,368units for the planning period.
Available Sites
The program objective was to primarily utilize Planned Community Districts and
Specific Plans to authorize and encourage mixed-use developments to assist in the
development of new affordable owner and rental housing. The program has seen
development of 2,012 units over the 8 year period.
Mobile homes
The objective to maintain existing units was accomplished.

Deed restricted affordable units
The objective of requiring deed restrictions to ensure continued affordability for
low- or moderate-income housing constructed or rehabilitated with the assistance of
any public funds as may be legally required was successfully met. Between the
years 2006-2014, 243 restricted units were established.
Pre-application conferences
The objective to continue to utilize pre-application conferences and processing
procedures to expedite processing was carried out during the review period.
Transitional Housing
The program objectives were to promote, assist, and facilitate the development of
emergency and transient shelters through continued support of the County
Homeless Assistance Program, and to support local agencies that provide homeless
services with financial assistance. Also, the adoption of a Single Room Occupancy
Ordinance was to be considered. The program has been effective in maintaining 3
homes with a total of 16 beds through the period, as well as 90 beds at the Orange
County Social Services Tustin Family Campus facility as a shelter for abused and
neglected children and their parents and for emancipated youth.
Temporary housing for the homeless
The program to support countywide efforts to assist approved homeless providers
as part of the MCAS Tustin reuse effort was outlined in a series of specific
objectives, all of which were achieved. A large variety of temporary and
transitional facilities to be operated by various homeless providers have been
developed at Tustin Legacy, as follows: Construction of the 192-bed Village of
Hope facility to be operated by the Orange County Rescue Mission is complete.
Twenty-three units of transitional housing operated by the Salvation Army have
been completed at Tustin Field I, as well as acquired in the city of Buena Park with
the City of Tustin’s assistance. Six new transitional units for women and children
have been completed in the Columbus Grove development at Tustin Legacy,
operated by Human Options. An additional 6 units have been completed at
Columbus Grove for families with children, operated by Orange Coast Interfaith
Shelter. Finally, 14 units at Columbus Grove provide transitional housing for
families with children by Families Forward (formerly Irvine Temporary Housing).
Housing opportunities for all economic segments
The program to monitor the implementation of the affordable housing program
adopted as a part of the East Tustin Specific Plan has successfully met the objective
of monitoring 174 units in East Tustin over the 10 year period.

Prior to its dissolution, the Redevelopment Agency successfully administered a
bond financing program that processed a total of 252 restricted units for very-low
and low income households to accomplish Five-Year Quantified Objectives and
help meet the City’s affordable housing needs.
Senior Citizen Housing
The objective in protecting and providing senior citizen housing was identified as
the preservation of 100 at-risk units. The 100 at-risk units were preserved
throughout the review period.
Senior Services Program
The City’s objective to develop a senior services program consisting of a
comprehensive transportation program, case management, information and
referral, and a shard housing program to assist 850 elderly annually was exceeded
with approximately 400 elderly receiving served meals annually between 2006 and
2014 and others receiving other services.
Ongoing Review of Housing Element Programs
The objective to conduct an on-going review of Housing Element programs by
preparing an annual report to the Planning Commission assessing the previous
years’ accomplishments toward meeting Housing Element objectives and then
submitting the annual report to the State HCD was achieved.
Zoning Studies
The City was to undertake zoning studies to consider new programs to encourage
and promote affordable housing and recommend appropriate amendments for
action by the Planning Commission and City Council. The program was effective in
that the City completed the Market Analysis and conducted community meetings to
gather input for the Town Center A New Beginning Study, and the City adopted a
Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance in 2011.
Private Streets
In order to reduce construction costs, the City adopted standards for private streets
and continued to permit developers to install private rather than public streets
when feasible. In the 2006-2014 period, private streets were created at Tustin
Legacy.
Site Improvements
New developments require the construction of site improvements which are often
costs that are passed on from the developer to the housing consumer, creating an
even greater barrier to qualifying for the purchase of home. In order to reduce these
added housing costs, the objective was to evaluate the use of special assessment

district funding at MCAS Tustin (Tustin Legacy) as well as in other developing
areas. During the 2006-2014 period, one of the community facilities district (CFD)
bonds was refunded to take advantage of lower interest rates, thus reducing costs to
property owners. Additionally, a new CFD was created at Tustin Legacy, and
several special assessment district bonds from the mid-90s were defeased.
Environmental Constraints
The on-going goal was to require program Environmental Impact Reports (EIR) on
all major development projects to decrease the delays in processing and
incorporating mitigation requirements into the development plans. During the
Housing Element Planning Period, the Final Program EIS/EIR for MCAS Tustin
served as the program EIR for the implementation of Tustin Legacy.
Density Bonus Program
The objective was to process all requests for density bonuses in order to facilitate the
construction of affordable housing. During the Housing Element Planning Period,
the Density Bonus Ordinance was updated. Between 2001-2008, Lennar/Lyon were
granted 182 density bonus units for the creation of affordable units at Columbus
Square and Grove.
MCAS Tustin Redevelopment Project Area
The goal to create a new redevelopment project area for the MCAS-Tustin site by
adopting the MCAS-Tustin Specific Plan and Redevelopment Project area was
attained. However, all redevelopment agencies in California were eliminated in
2011.
Fair Housing
The City’s objective to provide housing counseling services to assure equal housing
opportunities by assisting approximately 400 residents annually and 3,000 residents
by 2014 was partially met. Between 2006 and 2014, over 1,000 Tustin residents were
provided with housing counseling services.
Shared Housing
The City continued to provide coordination and support to an Orange County
housing sharing program.
Housing Referral Program

The City continued to provide housing referral services to families in need of
housing assistance and information through the Police, Parks and Recreation
Services, and Community Development Departments. The objective was to make
7,500 referrals to social agencies and 50 referrals for shared housing by 2014.
Between 1998-2000, 4,375 social service referrals and 25 shared housing referrals
were made.
Replacement Housing
The program objective was to ensure rehabilitation or construction of an equal
number of replacement units when low and moderate income residential units are
destroyed or removed from the market. The City has exceeded its replacement
housing obligations.
Housing Rehabilitation
The goal to rehabilitate 162 units by allocating CDBG and Redevelopment Agency
(eliminated 2011) funds to finance public improvements and rehabilitation of
residential units in target areas was partially achieved. A total of 20 units were
assisted with RDA funds over the review period.
Housing Authority
The program to contract with the Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA) for
the development and operation of federally assisted low and moderate income
housing programs was continued Rental Assistance
The program to provide rental assistance through Section 8 certificates and voucher
certificate program assistance funds through the OCHA was successful over the
review period. The objective to issue 200 certificates/vouchers annually and 1,200
by 2014 was exceeded. Between 2008 and 2012, 1,704certificates/vouchers were
issued.
Affordable Senior Housing Project and Senior Board and Care Facility
The program objective to maintain 74 units of affordable senior housing (20 units at
17432-17442 Mitchell Avenue and 54 units at 1311 Sycamore Avenue) was achieved.
Over the review period, 74housing units were maintained.
Preservation of Assisted Housing
Tustin has a total of 100 low income units that have been at risk of conversion
during the review period. The objective to monitor and preserve all of these units at
risk was completed successfully.

successful in getting property owners to abate code violations.
Cultural Resources District
The purpose of the City’s Cultural Resources Overlay District is to safeguard the
heritage of the City by preserving neighborhoods and structures that reflect the
City’s heritage and past. The objective in the planning period was to rate historic
structures where applicable and process certificates of appropriateness as received.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Community Development Department issued 89
Certificates of Appropriateness certifying building changes were consistent with
design guidelines and appropriate within the District context.
Energy Conservation
All new construction is required to be subject to state energy conservation (Title 24)
requirements as a condition for the issuance of a building permit. Between 2008
and 2012, 1,231 new units were required by the City to meet these standards.

                          Affordability Gap and leveraged Financing Analysis
       1. 0    Executive Summary
       The               Tustin              David Paul Rosen &       Associates ( DRA) to prepare an
             City   of           retained
       affordability gap analysis and evaluation of leveraged financing options for new residential
       development in Tustin. The ' affordability gap" methodology determines the difference
      between the supportable mortgage on the unit at affordable rents and sales prices and the
      actual development cost of the unit. The gap analysis provides planning -level estimates of
      the typical per unit subsidized required to make different types of housing affordable to
      households at alternative income levels.
     The per unit affordability gaps calculated in this report are based on housing prototypee
     that are 100% affordable to households at each of the income levels modeled (or in the
     case of the leveraged financing analysis, at the mix of income levels necessary to meet the
     requirements and/or competitive standards of the leveraged financing programs).
     However, the results can be used in estimating subsidy requirements for mixed income
     housing    developments      as   well.   Under the assumption that the market rate units are
    financially feasible without subsidy, the subsidy requirement for a mixed income
    development can be estimated by multiplying the number of affordable units by the
    appropriate per unit affordability gap. The results of the gap analysis Provide a useful tool
    to the   City   of Tustin   and   Tustin Redevelopment Agen cy      for capital planning purposes.
    DRA recommends that the subsidy provided to any individual housing development be
    determined based on analysis of the specific economic conditions pertaining to that
    project
   The first step in the gap analysis establishes the amount a tenant or homebuyer can afford
   to contribute to the cost of renting or owninf a dwelling unit based on established State
   and Federal standards. Income levels, housing costs and rents used in the analysis are
   defined below using 2007 published data for Tustin.
   The    second    step  estimate s- the costs   of new
                                                           housing  construction   in Tustin. For this
  purpose, DRA, in collaboration with City staff, formulated five prototypical housing
  developments ( one rental development and four owner developments) suitable for the
  Tustin market today. DRA estimated the cost to develop these housing prototypes in
  Tustin under current housing conditions using information on actual recent housing
  developments provided by Tustin and Orange County area developers.
 The third step in the gap analysis establishes the housing expenses borne by the tenants
 and    owners.
                     These costs can be categorized into operating costs, and financing or
 mortgage      obligations.
                                Operating costs are the maintenance expenses of the unit,
 including utilities, property maintenance and/or Homeownership Association ( HOA) fees,
property taxes, management fees, property insurance, replacement reserves, and
insurance.      For the rental prototype examined in this analysis, DRA assumes that the

       landlord pays ail but certain tenant -paid utilities as an annual operating cost of the unit
       paid from rental income. For owner prototypes; DRA assumes the homebuyer pays all
      operating and maintenance costs for the home.
      Financing or mortgage obligations are the costs associated with the purchase or
      development of the housing unit itself. These costs occur when all or a portion of the
      development cost is financed. This cost is always an obligation of the landlord or owner.
      Supportable financing is deducted from the total development cost, less any owner equity
      or downpayment, to determine the gap between the supportable mortgage on the
      affordable units and the cost of developing those units.
      For the rental housing prototype, the gap analysis calculates the difference between total
     development costs and the conventional mortgage supportable by net operating income
     from restricted rents. For owners, the gap is the difference between development costs
     and the supportable mortgage plus the buyer's down payment. Affordable housing costs
     for renters and owners are calculated based on California Redevelopment Law definitions
     and occupancy standards. Household income is adjusted based on an occupancy
     standard of one person per bedroom plus one.
     The   gaps for  the owner prototypes' are       summarized   in Table 1.  The gaps have been
    calculated for the following three income levels:.
                                                                                      Affordable

   Depending upon the source of subsidy for ownership housing, the gaps may vary. For
   exam le Federal HOME funds do not require deduction of a utility allowance in the
  calculaption of affordable mortgage payment             However, under California Redevelopment
  Law,    owner affordable   housing   expense    is defined to include monthly utility costs.    This
  increases the ownership gaps. The affordability gaps shown in Table 1 include utility
 allowance deductions.
 The gaps for the rental prototype, without non -local leveraged financing, are summarized
 in Table 2. The gaps have been calculated for the following three income levels:

          DRA produced, under separate cover, a comprehensive review of Federal, State, and
         private sources of funding that might be used to subsidize affordable rental and ownership
         housing in Tustin. For ownership housing, per unit mortgage assistance, as available,
         generally reduces the gap on a dollar for dollar basis. For rental developments, the use of
         the Low Income Housing Tax Credit • Program and/or tax- exempt bonds is more
        complicated, because of the formulas for calculating tax credits and the specific income
        targeting rbquired.

        Therefore, for the rental prototype, we have examined the following leverage scenarios:
                  1.        9% Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( Federal only)';
                  2.        4% tax credits with tax -exempt bonds; and
                 3.         4% tax credits, tax -exempt bonds, and the Multifamily Housing Program
                             MHP) of the California Department of Housing and Community
                           Development (HCD).
       The                      and
                                      findings   are  described in the           section.   The sources and

         Since Orange County was de*_ignated as a Difficult to Develop Area ( DDA) by HUD in 2007, projects in
        the County are eligible for a 130`X basis boost for the calculation of Federal tax credits but are not
        eligible for State tax credits

     I Per unit subsidy requirements are calculated as per unit total development cost less affordable
     home purchase price, based on an occupancy standard of one person per bedroom plus one, per
    California Redevelopment Law. Affordable home purchase price is calculated based on monthly
    affordable housing expense, inclusive of mortgage principal and interest, property taxes and
    insurance, utilities and homeowners association ( HOA) dues. Calculations are based on the
    following assumptions: 30 -year mortgage interest rate of 8 percent; average property tax rate of
    1. 20 percent; property insurance costs of $50 per month; HOA dues of $ 175 per month; and a
    utility allowance calculated based on County of Orange, Housing and Community Services
    Department utility allowance schedule, effective October 1, 2006.
    Very low income owner affordable housing is cost calculated as 30 percent of 50 percent of AMI,
    adjusted for household size. Average very low income affordable home purchase price is
      70, 764.
    Low income owner affordable housing cost is calculated as 30 percent of 70 percent of AMI;
   adjusted for household size. Average low income affordable home purchase price is $ 116, 457.
    Moderate income owner affordable housing cost is calculated as 35 percent of 110 percent of

         operating cost of $300, property taxes assumed at an average annual rate of 1. 20 percent; and a 3
         percent vacancy rate. Tenant supported debt calculations are based on a 30•year mortgage interest
         rate of 8 percent and a debt coverage ratio of 1. 25. Affordable monthly rents are based on
         household income, adjusted for household size assuming an occupancy standard of one person

         INTRODUCTION TO THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element is one of seven mandated elements of the General Plan and
is intended to guide the development of the City's circulation system in a manner
that is compatible with the Land Use Element. Because of the importance of a well-
planned circulation system, the State of California has mandated the adoption of a
Citywide Circulation Element since 1955. The anticipated level and pattern of
development, as identified in the Land Use Element, will increase capacity demands
on the City's roadways. To help meet these demands and achieve balanced growth,
the City has adopted specific goals and policies which serve as the basis for the
Circulation Element.
PURPOSE OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
               The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide a safe, efficient
               and adequate circulation system for the City. To meet this purpose
               and the requirements of Government Code Section 65302 (b), the
               Circulation Element addresses the circulation improvements needed
               to provide adequate capacity for future land uses. Corresponding
               goals and policies have been adopted to ensure that all components of
               the circulation system will meet the needs of the City of Tustin. The
               Element establishes a hierarchy of transportation routes with specific
               development standards described for each category of roadway.
               Insofar as they pertain to the community, the following subjects are
               included in the Circulation Element of the general plan:
               o      Streets and highways
               o      Transportation Corridors
               o      Transportation System Management and Transportation
                      Demand Management
               o      Transit and rapid transit
               o      Railroads
               o      Paratransit (e.g., jitneys, carpooling, vanpooling and taxi
                      service)
               o      Bicycle and pedestrian facilities
               o      Commercial, general and military airports
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                1                             JUNE 17, 2008
               This Element is designed to comply with the directive of state law and
               guidelines in order to achieve the objectives of promoting the efficient
               transport of goods and the safe, efficient movement of traffic within
               the City.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               The Circulation Element contains goals and policies designed to
               improve overall circulation in Tustin and to address circulation issues
               that concern the City. For highway transportation, the physical
               attributes involve a network of existing and future roadways defined
               according to designated roadway types, each with specific design
               standards. Other modes are defined by appropriate physical attributes
               (i.e., bicycle trails).
               The General Plan Traffic Analysis technical report prepared by
               Austin-Foust Associates, Inc., and the Circulation Technical
               Memorandum published prior to preparation of the Circulation
               Element provide background information and act as supporting
               documents for the Circulation Element.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               There are a number of transportation plans that affect circulation
               planning for the City of Tustin. Several transportation plans have
               been prepared by the County of Orange, focusing on the development
               of a regional transportation system to handle the anticipated traffic
               loads expected from future development. A number of plans have
               also been prepared identifying the location of future routes for mass
               transit including light rail and conventional buses. Plans and
               programs related to the Circulation Element include the following:
               County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) - The
               MPAH forms part of the Orange County General Plan and designates
               the arterial system in the circulation element of the general plan.
               Defined according to specific arterial functional classifications, the
               MPAH serves to define the intended future road system for the
               County. Cities within the County are expected to achieve consistency
               with the MPAH in their individual general plan circulation elements.

GENERAL PLAN                               2                               JUNE 17, 2008
               Eastern Transportation Corridor (ETC) - The ETC is one of the three
               transportation corridors developed by the Transportation Corridor
               Agencies in Orange County. They have been constructed as toll
               facilities and eventually will revert to free facilities when the facility
               costs are paid off. The west leg of the ETC serves the City of Tustin
               and runs east of and parallel to Jamboree Road from its intersection
               with the east leg in the City of Orange to Jamboree Road north of
               Edinger Avenue near the border between the City of Tustin and the
               City of Irvine.
               South Coast Air Basin and Air Quality Management Plan - The
               South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is a regulatory
               body responsible for improving air quality in the South Coast Air
               Basin. Of primary importance to circulation are the Transportation
               Control Measures (TCMs). The measures are aimed at adjusting trip
               patterns or modifying vehicle use in ways that reduce air pollutant
               emissions. The Air Quality Management District (AQMD) has
               adopted the 2007 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), an advisory
               document which identifies a number of air pollution reduction goals,
               measures and policies. Local jurisdictions have been mandated to
               reduce a fair share proportion of vehicle pollution through the
               implementation of Transportation Control Measures (TCMs).
               The Orange County League of Cities has provided each Orange
               County city its fair share trip reduction goal. The City of Tustin has
               been recently recognized as having met 122% of its allocated vehicle
               trip reduction goal. Therefore, it is currently assumed that the City
               will not need to adopt any additional Transportation Control
               Measures to comply with the 1997 AQMP. In addition, the City
               closely monitors air quality matters with the intent of complying with
               future revisions of the AQMP. Therefore, the mitigation measures and
               policies identified within this document or other measures acceptable
               to the AQMD will be implemented by the City who will have the
               discretion to select those transportation control measures that are
               economically feasible and will achieve compliance with the 1997
               AQMP.
               County of Orange Congestion Management Plan - With the passage
               of the gas tax increase (Proposition 111) in June of 1990, it became a
               requirement that urbanized areas such as Orange County adopt a
               Congestion Management Program (CMP). The goals of the CMP are
               to reduce traffic congestion and to provide a mechanism for

               coordinating land use development and transportation improvement
               decisions. For the most part, the Orange County CMP is a composite
               of local agencys' submittals in which each local jurisdiction develops
               the required data in accordance with the guidelines established by the
               Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). The OCTA
               compiles the data and submits the results to the Southern California
               Association of Governments (SCAG) for a finding of regional
               consistency.
               County of Orange Growth Management Plan - On November, 1990
               voters approved Measure M, the revised Traffic Improvement and
               Growth Management ordinance, which authorized the imposition of a
               one-half percent sales tax to fund needed transportation
               improvements. To be eligible to receive funds, local jurisdictions must
               satisfy a variety of requirements as set out in the Orange County
               Local Transportation Authority (LTA) Ordinance No. 2. Included in
               these requirements are the need to adopt a traffic circulation plan
               consistent with the MPAH, to adopt and adequately fund a local
               transportation fee program, to satisfy maintenance requirements, and
               to adopt a seven year capital improvement program that includes all
               transportation projects funded partially or fully by Measure M funds.
               The GMP requirements include certain provisions that are contained
               within the City's Growth Management Element. Measure M2 was
               approved by voters in November 2007 and extended the imposition of
               the one-half percent sales tax to fund transportation improvements for
               an additional 30 years.
               County of Orange Master Plan of Scenic Highways - The County's
               General Plan includes a scenic highway element which designates
               certain highways as scenic routes. With this designation specific
               guidelines are given for enhancing the scenic amenities of these
               facilities.
               County of Orange Master Plan of Countywide Bikeways - Also part
               of the Countywide General Plan, the Master Plan of Countywide
               Bikeways designates various classes of bike routes throughout the
               county. One of the primary considerations is to provide continuity
               throughout the county and to provide a consistency between
               countywide and local jurisdiction bikeway plans.
               Los Angeles/San Diego Corridor Commuter Rail Action Plan - This
               is one component of the overall rail plan for the Southern California
               area, and seeks to provide increased commuter train service along the
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                    CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                4                              JUNE 17, 2008
               Los Angeles/San Diego corridor with designated stops at various
               locations between the two cities. One of the commuter rail stations for
               this system is located in the City of Tustin in the vicinity of Edinger
               Avenue near Jamboree Road.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
               The preparation of the Circulation Element is guided by and must
               conform with Section 65302(b) of the California Government Code. A
               major goal in the update of the Tustin General Plan is to achieve
               internal consistency throughout the various General Plan elements.
               The Circulation Element relates to the other elements of the general
               plan in a variety of ways. For instance, the Circulation Element
               portrays the roadway system needed to serve traffic generated by the
               uses permitted in the Land Use Element. It is also associated with the
               Noise Element and air quality since traffic forecasts are used, in
               conjunction with other data, to determine noise contours and air
               quality impacts of the General Plan land uses.
               The Circulation Element is also related to the Safety and
               Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Elements and Air Quality
               Subelement. The Safety Element addresses evacuation routes and
               minimum road widths to accommodate City residents in the event of
               a catastrophe, and the Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Element
               can identify standards for roadways, scenic highways and multi-use
               recreation trails.
               Because of its transportation-related issues, the Growth Management
               Element has a relationship with the Circulation Element. In November
               1990 and 2007, Orange County voters approved Measure M and
               Measure M2, respectively, which increase sales tax revenues to fund
               needed transportation improvements throughout the County. To
               qualify to receive a portion of these revenues, each jurisdiction within
               the County must adopt a Growth Management Element. The City of
               Tustin adopted its Growth Management Element in February 1992.
               The Growth Management Element contains a policy that establishes a
               minimum Level of Service (LOS) to be maintained at intersections
               impacted by new development. It also contains a policy to promote
               TDM measures in the City and a Phasing Program to ensure
               coordination between new development and roadway capacities.

               These issues are addressed in a consistent fashion between the
               Circulation and Growth Management Elements.

      SUMMARY OF ISSUES, NEEDS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND
                                CONSTRAINTS
This section summarizes circulation-related issues, needs, opportunities and
constraints identified in the General Plan preparation process, and which are
addressed within the goals and policies and the proposals contained in the physical
description of the Circulation Element.
LOCAL THOROUGHFARES AND TRANSPORTATION ROUTES
               o     Through traffic impacts many residential neighborhoods in
                     Tustin.
               o     A lack of adequate landscaping and buffering exists between
                     many of Tustin's arterial roadways and freeway segments and
                     adjacent land uses.
               o     Tustin's commercial corridor roadways contain a proliferation
                     of driveways, inhibiting traffic flow.
               o     Some streets are presently operating beyond their design
                     capacity.
               o     Standards need to be maintained, such as level of service and
                     performance criteria, to monitor the traffic-related impacts of
                     land use decisions on the circulation system.
               o     Truck routes need to be clearly identified and should avoid
                     residential streets.
INTERCITY AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION
               o     The City of Tustin has limited control over freeway
                     improvements being undertaken by Caltrans.
               o     Tustin has limited control over substantial regional traffic
                     which proceeds through its jurisdiction.

               o The completion of the western leg of the Eastern
                 Transportation Corridor has had a significant effect on traffic
                 circulation in Tustin.
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM/DEMAND MANAGEMENT
               o Traffic Demand Management (TDM) strategies are required
                 under both current air quality legislation and requirements of
                 Proposition 111 legislation (Congestion Management
                 Program).
               o A comprehensive transportation system/demand management
                 program will serve to improve traffic congestion and reduce
                 parking demand.
TRANSIT, BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN, AND EQUESTRIAN FACILITIES
               o In order to maximize use of public transit, new development
                 should be designed to accommodate bus stops.
               o There is a need for "Park-N-Ride" facilities to enhance bus
                 ridership for non-local trips.
               o With portions of the Planning Area not currently served with
                 bikeways (the southwest, west, east, and north), bicycles are
                 forced to compete with automobiles along right-of-ways.
               o Some of Tustin's sidewalks are not wheelchair accessible.
               o The trail system within the City is incomplete and connections
                 of local and regional trails are needed.

PARKING
               o Certain areas of Tustin have inadequate off-street parking
                 which in turn places a burden on public streets or other
                 properties to correct this deficiency.
               o Separate parking areas for small parcels are often inefficient,
                 and result in a proliferation of driveways along arterials.
                 Shared parking provisions should be considered.
               o On-street parking along key City arterials inhibits efficient
                 traffic flow and optimization of roadways for carrying traffic.
ALTERNATIVE FINANCING
               o Alternative financing mechanisms need to be explored for
                 implementation of circulation system management and
                 maintenance.

PARKING
               Adequate and convenient parking facilities are an important part of
               the transportation amenities provided by a City. The Circulation
               Element therefore contains policies which ensure the provision of
               such amenities.
               GOAL 7: Provide for well-designed and convenient parking
               facilities.
               Policy 7.1: Consolidate parking, where appropriate, to eliminate the
               number of ingress and egress points onto arterials.

                             CIRCULATION PLAN
This section of the Circulation Element defines a circulation plan for the City that
meets the requirements for safe and convenient movement of persons and goods at
the development intensity anticipated in the Land Use Element. It includes a
classification system that applies to all roadways that serve the City, and identifies
specific improvements that will be required to implement this plan. A bikeway plan
is delineated, and other components of the element such as public transit are
discussed.
ROADWAY FACILITY CLASSIFICATIONS
               The arterial highway system in Tustin is defined using a classification
               system which describes a hierarchy of facility types. The categories of
               roadways included in this classification system differentiate the size,
               function and capacity of the roadway links for each type of roadway.
               There are four basic categories in the hierarchy, ranging from “major”
               with the highest capacity to "collector" streets with the lowest
               capacity, and these can be summarized as follows:
               Major: A six- to eight-lane divided roadway with no on-street
               parking, with a typical right-of-way width of 120 to 144 feet and a
               curb-to-curb pavement width of 102 to 126 feet. Major arterials
               typically carry a significant volume of regional traffic. When the
               traffic volumes warrant a major arterial highway in areas where a full
               120 to 144 feet of right-of-way is not feasible due to existing structures
               or topography, a lesser right-of-way (no less than 100 feet) can be
               used to accommodate a six-lane facility. This is referred to as a
               “modified major” on the City Arterial Highway Plan.
               Primary: A four-lane divided roadway, with a typical right-of-way
               width of 100 feet and curb-to-curb pavement width of 84 feet.
               Regional traffic will typically be less than for a major arterial, but
               primary arterials form an important component of the regional
               transportation system. When the traffic volumes warrant a primary
               arterial highway in areas where a full 100 feet of right-of-way is not
               feasible due to existing structures or topography, a lesser right-of-way
               (no less than 80 feet) can be used to accommodate a four-lane facility.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                    CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                20                                JUNE 17, 2008

               This is referred to as a "modified primary" on the City Arterial
               Highway Plan.
               Secondary: A four-lane undivided roadway, with a typical right-of-
               way width of 80 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 64 feet.
               These roadways serve as collectors, distributing traffic between local
               streets, and major and primary arterials. For the MCAS Tustin Specific
               Plan, 80-foot right-of-way was modified to a 92-foot right-of-way to
               provide a painted median for two-way left turn lanes and Class II
               bicycle lanes.
               Collector: A two-lane undivided roadway, with a minimum right-of-
               way width of 66 feet and a minimum curb-to-curb width of 50 feet.
               The width may be increased to accommodate roadway features such
               as bicycle lanes, on-street parking, and turn lanes. At LOS “C,” this
               road type accommodates up to approximately 10,000 vehicle trips per
               day. This road functions as a collector facility, however it tends to
               move traffic between two arterials rather than between local streets, it
               has been added to the City’s arterial highway system because it
               provides network continuity and is regionally significant, and may
               serve through traffic demand where projected volumes do not
               warrant a higher classification such as Secondary.
               The Circulation Element roadway classification system does not
               include private streets. Private street widths and cross-sections will
               vary from those described for roadways in this Element. Standard
               cross-sections represent the obvious and accepted answer to most
               situations. However, the standard cross-sections do not always
               provide the best solution to any given need or set of objectives.
               Reasonable flexibility and variety is provided for in the City's private
               street standards.
               Figure C-1 shows schematic cross sections of each category of arterial
               roadway. These sections represent desirable standards, but variation
               in right-of-way width and specific road improvements will occur in
               certain cases due to physical constraints and/or right-of-way
               limitations. In particular, the median width in eight-lane, six-lane and
               four-lane roadways will vary according to the area being served and
               the available right-of-way constraints and turn lane requirements.
               Hence, any of the arterial classifications may deviate from the
               standards where physical constraints exist or where preservation of
               community character dictates special treatment. Bikeway facilities are

               facilities.
               The desirable goal for every classified street section is that it carry the
               designed volume of traffic at the desired level of service. Within this
               requirement, descriptions of width and facilities are offered as basic
               guidelines and as noted above, variation in design is expected,
               depending on different community design characteristics. Different
               optional facilities are also expected (on-street parking, sidewalks
               versus pathways, bicycle lanes or paths, extra parkway or median
               landscape treatment, etc.). Another design consideration is the need to
               provide for the capacity requirements as specified in the County
               Master Plan of Arterial Highways. Specific design requirements for
               construction are available for public streets from the Public Works
               Department.
               To accommodate the estimated future traffic on the arterial highway
               system, two qualifiers are included into the highway component of
               the Circulation Element:
               Modified Right-of-way
               This qualifier is used in the City's Arterial Highway Plan. It allows for
               achieving the same or similar traffic-carrying capacity of basic
               roadway classifications and typical sections identified for each
               classification type, but within a reduced right-of-way. Typical changes
               to the basic section may include reductions in median width and
               sidewalk/pathway width, reduced lane standards and elimination of
               parking and bike lanes.
               Augmented Capacity
               The traditional approach to providing additional capacity on an
               arterial system is to upgrade individual arterials to a higher facility
               type or to add lanes. Typical examples would be upgrading a four-
               lane primary to a six-lane major and upgrading a six-lane major to an
               eight-lane major. The implication is that additional capacity should be
               provided by additional thru lanes along the length of the arterial.
               The augmented capacity concept focuses on sections of arterial where
               the link capacity is deficient and provides additional capacity by a
               variety of means ranging from traffic operations measures to actual
               roadway widening. Typical measures include, but are not limited to:

               o       Addition of through or turn lanes
               o       Preferential traffic signal timing and synchronization
               o       Auxiliary lanes
               o       Removal of on-street parking
               o       Intersection grade separations
               o       Grade separated turning movements
               o       Access consolidation
               o       Access limitation: right-turns only, or no access (streets and/or
                       driveways)
               o       Pedestrian grade separations
               o       Bus turnouts
               o       Other traffic engineering or traffic management strategies
                       which provide enhanced capacity
               The intent of these measures is to minimize conflicts with cross-traffic,
               to improve traffic-carrying capacity, and to facilitate improved traffic
               flow along arterials. The augmented capacity concept is therefore
               intended to represent a strategy that can be utilized on all or a portion
               of a section of roadway to enhance traffic-carrying capacity.
               Common applications of augmented capacity include auxiliary lanes
               which allow for right-turn movements into and out of driveways or
               side streets, and additional lanes at intersections. An example of
               auxiliary lane deployment is on a section of arterial adjacent to a
               freeway interchange. A significant increase in capacity can be gained
               by providing auxiliary lanes on the arterial which serve as dedicated
               lanes for the on and off-ramps. An example of an auxiliary lane can be
               seen on the section of Jamboree Road north of I-5 where Jamboree
               Road has three lanes plus an auxiliary lane. Intersection widening is
               another form of capacity augmentation, and may include additional
               turn lanes as a means of increasing capacity, and additional thru lanes
               may be added if necessary. Also, as noted above, any traffic
               engineering or traffic management strategy which enhances capacity
               can be considered as contributing to the augmented capacity.
               Use of this qualifier recognizes that in augmenting capacity from a
               basic arterial capacity, individual locations have different traffic
               characteristics and therefore, need to be addressed individually.
               Actual improvements will be determined from special design studies,
               and by using the augmented capacity designation, the General Plan
               has a means of showing where such improvements might be needed
               in the future.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
               Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve the desired
               future land uses requires establishing suitable "performance criteria".
               These are the means by which future traffic volumes are compared to
               future circulation system capacity, and the adequacy of that
               circulation system assessed.
               Performance criteria have a policy component which establishes a
               desired level of service (LOS) and a technical component which
               specifies how traffic forecast data can be used to measure the
               achievement of the criteria. The performance criteria used for
               evaluating volumes and capacities on the City street system are
               summarized in Table C-2 and include both average daily traffic (ADT)
               link volume and peak hour intersection volume criteria.
               The City of Tustin has established level of service LOS "D" as a
               threshold standard to monitor capacity needs for both ADT link
               volumes and peak hour volumes. Because of the significant amount of
               regional traffic on the designated Smart Streets (Irvine Boulevard,
               Edinger Avenue, and Jamboree Road south of Irvine Boulevard) level
               of service "E" is the recommended standard for these facilities,
               consistent with CMP guidelines.
               Table C-3 describes traffic flow quality for different levels of service.
               Such criteria would be applied consistently for evaluating land use
               and circulation system changes and are the basis for the General Plan
               circulation recommendations contained in this report.
RELATIONSHIP TO LAND USE
               Future traffic volumes and highway capacity needs are directly
               related to future land use. Table C-4 compares existing and buildout
               land use and the corresponding trip generation. Daily trip generation
               for the entire City in 1993 was around 589,533 vehicle trips per day.
               Approximately 40 percent of this was attributed to residential uses,
               with the remaining 60 percent generated by non-residential uses. For
               buildout of the proposed General Plan land uses, the comparative
               total ADT trip generation was approximately 1,081,058 average daily
               trips, an increase of 83 percent.

                       The Arterial Highway Plan presented in the next section is designed
                       to carry the added trips that will occur with buildout of the City's

                       the surrounding cities and the county. Traffic increases from the latter
                       involve significant amounts of through traffic on certain facilities,
                       such as Irvine Boulevard and Red Hill Avenue.

The following are the performance criteria used for comparing volumes and capacities on the city
street and highway system:
      I.   Average Daily Traffic (ADT) Link Volumes
           Level of Service D – All roadways, except designated Congestion Management Plan
           (CMP) highways
           Level of Service E - CMP highways
           Table A below shows ADT volumes corresponding to these levels of service.
      II. Peak Hour Intersection Volumes
           Level of Service D - Threshold level of service
           Level of Service E - CMP highway intersections
           Table B below shows how these levels of service are specified.
Note: For evlauating land use and circulation system changes in accordance with the Growth Management Element of the General

GENERAL PLAN CIRCULATION SYSTEM
               The goals and policies included in this Element emphasize the need
               for a circulation system that is capable of serving both existing and
               future residents while preserving community values and character.
               The location, design, and constituent modes of the circulation system
               have major impacts on air quality, noise, community appearance, and
               other elements of the environment.
               The highway network designated in the Arterial Highway Plan is
               illustrated in Figure C-2, and indicates all of the designated Major
               arterials, Primary arterials, Secondary arterials, Collector arterials,
               and the sections of roadway designated for modified right-of-way or
               augmented capacity. Table C-5 provides an additional description of
               the Arterial Highway Plan links. Discussions on sections of roadway
               for which these two qualifiers are proposed as follows:
               Modified Right-of-Way
               As noted earlier in this chapter under the description of individual
               roadway classifications, major and primary arterial designations may
               not always imply the full right-of-way requirements as indicated in
               the standard cross-sections. Locations where such modified cross-
               sections are designated are as follows:
               o       Irvine Boulevard, Newport Avenue to Browning Avenue:
                       Classification: Modified Major (six-lane major arterial with
                       modified cross-section)
               o       Newport Avenue, I-5 to Walnut Avenue:
                       Classification: Modified Major (six-lane major arterial with
                       modified cross-section)
               o       Walnut Avenue:
               In each case it has been assumed that the modified cross-section will
               not affect the ADT capacity (e.g., a modified major will have the same
               capacity as a major).

               Augmented Capacity
               As noted in the earlier discussion on this concept, the actual
               improvements for capacity augmentation will be determined during
               special design studies. The following are the roadway sections for
               which the augmented qualifier is proposed:
               Irvine Boulevard: This is a designated "Smart Street" on the County
               MPAH (previously referred to as "superstreet"). As such, capacity
               enhancements could range from maximization of intersection capacity
               under a basic six-lane facility, to a wider facility with potential grade
               separation at major intersections. As part of the countywide smart
               street program, the county will undertake the requisite design studies
               to identify future improvements along this facility. The two sections
               noted here as needing augmented capacity are from Prospect Avenue
               to Holt Avenue, and Newport Avenue to Tustin Ranch Road.
               Red Hill Avenue: The Circulation Element includes the southward
               extension of Newport Avenue to Valencia Avenue as a six-lane major
               arterial and Valencia Avenue is designated as a four-lane roadway
               from that connection point to Red Hill Avenue. At the point where
               Valencia Avenue meets Red Hill Avenue, there is essentially a
               convergence of a four-lane and a six-lane facility.
               The Cities of Tustin and Irvine have negotiated an agreement
               concerning the mitigation of traffic impacts resulting from the City of
               Irvine's decision to increase the allowable intensity of development
               within the Irvine Business Complex (IBC). Under the agreement, a
               Project Design Report will be prepared which recommends
               improvements necessary to City of Tustin standards for mitigation of
               traffic on Red Hill Avenue between Barranca Parkway, Dyer Road,
               and the I-5 freeway. Each City will pay its fair share of the cost of the
               necessary traffic improvements in accordance with the agreement.
               The closure of the MCAS, Tustin has provided opportunities for other
               means of capacity increases in this area (e.g., the extension of Valencia
               into the former Base and then south to Von Karman). Roadway
               assumptions will be determined at the time roadway analysis is
               prepared.
               Newport Avenue: On the section of Newport Avenue north of I-5,
               future traffic volumes will exceed the ADT capacity of the current
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               32                                JUNE 17, 2008
               four-lane primary designation. Augmentation is recommended in the
               form of auxiliary lanes and additional turn lanes at intersections.
               Seventeenth Street, SR-55 to Yorba Street (north): This section of
               roadway near the SR-55 interchange will require some form of
               capacity augmentation, and the specific treatment should be
               determined in relation to the intersection capacity needs of the ramps
               and of Yorba Street.
               Valencia Avenue: With the southward extension of Newport Avenue
               to Valencia Avenue, this roadway will need to be designated as an
               augmented primary.
               Walnut Avenue, Tustin Ranch Road to Myford Road: Future
               volumes on this roadway indicate a need for augmentation, probably
               in the form of intersection treatment at Myford Road, as traffic from
               the industrial area in this vicinity is attracted to the Eastern
               Transportation Corridor interchange with Walnut Avenue.
COUNTY SMART STREETS
               In 1984, the Orange County Transportation Commission (OCTC)
               adopted the Superstreets Program for Orange County in an effort to
               increase the traffic flow and vehicle capacity of major arterial
               highways. The program identified potential Superstreet candidates,
               various roadway improvements, financial costs and funding sources.
               Since that time, the Superstreets in conjunction with the County's
               State Highways, have been designated as the Congestion
               Management Program (CMP) Highway System. The term
               "Superstreet" was changed to "Smart Street" in 1994.
               Within the City of Tustin, Edinger Avenue, Jamboree Road south of
               Irvine Boulevard, and Irvine Boulevard are included on the CMP
               Highway System. These roadways must maintain specified level of
               service (LOS) standards (LOS "E" or better) to be eligible for the funds
               generated by the passage of Proposition 111.
               Potential Smart Street Program improvements for Edinger Avenue
               (Moulton Parkway) as identified in the "Moulton Parkway Superstreet
               Study" (see Reference 5 in Chapter I), include signal coordination and
               modification, creation of bus turnouts, widening and restriping of
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                   CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               33                               JUNE 17, 2008
               intersections, restriction of on-street parking, and widening for major
               arterial highway standards.
               Irvine Boulevard is also a County Smart Street, but has not yet been
               the subject of a special study. It is reasonable to expect similar
               capacity enhancement proposals when such a study is carried out.
               Traffic forecasts indicate higher volumes than can be carried by a six-
               lane major arterial, and the augmented qualifier used here in the
               City's arterial highway plan implies capacity enhancement actions to
               achieve additional capacity.
GRADE SEPARATED INTERSECTIONS
               Jamboree Road south of Irvine Boulevard is part of Orange County's
               Smart Street (Superstreet) system, which makes it a candidate for
               various types of capacity enhancements. For the section south of I-5,
               Jamboree Road joins the southerly termination of the ETC west leg,
               and capacity enhancements have been in the form of grade-separated
               intersections. The Warner Avenue intersection is already constructed
               as a grade-separated interchange, and a grade separated interchange
               was constructed for Edinger Avenue.
               Red Hill Avenue currently has an at-grade crossing at the AT&SF
               Railroad, and would achieve both safety and capacity benefits from
               future grade separation. Two other major arterials which will cross
               this railroad in the future, Newport Avenue and Tustin Ranch Road
               are planned to have grade separations.
ADDITIONAL CROSSING OF THE I-5 FREEWAY
               The Arterial Highway Plan includes two crossings of the I-5 freeway
               which do not exist today. A discussion on each of these follows.
               Browning Avenue
               The existing Circulation Element includes a Browning Avenue
               overcrossing of the I-5 Freeway. Adequate development set-back has
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                    CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                34                             JUNE 17, 2008
               been established on the north site of the freeway to enable the
               overcrossing to connect with El Camino Real.
               Long-range traffic forecasts for the overcrossing show a future
               demand of around 10,000 vehicles per day. This is well within the
               capacity of a four-lane secondary roadway (its current Circulation
               Element designation). The traffic forecast data indicates that future
               trips using the overcrossing are largely local in nature, and the facility
               will provide local traffic with an alternative to Red Hill Avenue or
               Tustin Ranch Road as a means of crossing the freeway. Hence, it does
               not have any direct major role as a regional connection, and is
               primarily a local circulation facility.
               Without the overcrossing, additional traffic would be carried by Red
               Hill Avenue and Tustin Ranch Road and Walnut Avenue. The volume
               increases could cause the ADT link capacities on Red Hill Avenue to
               be exceeded. Of more concern would be peak hour operational
               characteristics, particularly at Red Hill Avenue, as additional turn
               movement traffic is generated at the Walnut Avenue and Nisson Road
               intersections. Special traffic operation strategies (including changes in
               lane configurations) could possibly be required at those locations and
               at the ramp intersections.
               Browning Avenue is on the County MPAH, and hence, a detailed
               study would need to be undertaken to support any deletion of this
               facility. Since future volumes on both Red Hill Avenue and Tustin
               Ranch Road continue to be influenced by new land uses associated
               with the closure of Marine Corps Air Station, Tustin, any detailed
               studies for potential deletion of the Browning Avenue overcrossing
               should be made only after the land uses and infrastructure on the
               former Base are established. Hence, at this time the Browning Avenue
               overcrossing on the Arterial Highway Plan should be retained.
               Myford Road
               An overcrossing of Myford Road was considered during the planning
               work carried out for the East Tustin Specific Plan. Although the
               overcrossing was never placed on the City's Circulation Element,
               right-of-way was reserved for its construction should the need for
               such a facility be established in the future. The sections of roadway
               north and south of the freeway are on the City's Arterial Highway
               Plan. While future forecasts indicate that the north-south traffic

               demand in this area can be adequately carried by Jamboree Road and
               the west leg of the Eastern Transportation Corridor (ETC), such a
               finding is dependent on the capacity provided by the ETC west leg
               operating as a free facility. The Myford Road overcrossing should
               continue to be a part of the City's Arterial Highway Plan until more
               development plans are evaluated in the vicinity.
RELATIONSHIP TO COUNTY MPAH
               The City's Circulation Element recognizes that the County of Orange's
               Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) considers augmented
               capacity arterials as those regionally significant arterials on the Smart
               Street (formerly Super Street) Network with an enhanced traffic-
               carrying capacity. Where such augmented capacity has been found
               necessary on those streets within the City, then it has been included
               on the City's Circulation Element. The Circulation Element further
               recognizes that the opportunities for and the benefits of the
               "Augmented Capacity" concept may also be realized at certain
               locations on other arterial roadways as a capacity enhancement
               strategy.
               The highway component of the Circulation Element is consistent with
               the County MPAH, and as discussed previously, with the augmented
               qualifier in specific locations, is able to carry the projected traffic
               volumes.
               MCAS Tustin Amendment
               The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan/Reuse Plan identifies new Circulation
               Element roadways, such as the southerly extension of Tustin Ranch
               Road and the east west extension of Warner Avenue through the site,
               as well as the addition of a new loop roadway within the site. The
               addition of these roadways also requires an amendment to the
               County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH).

PUBLIC TRANSIT
               An existing network of public bus routes providing access to
               employment centers, shopping and recreational areas is illustrated in
               Figure C-3. Service is provided by the Orange County Transportation
               Authority (OCTA). The established network includes Routes 60, 61,
               65, 66, 71, 75 and 463 and Table C-6 summarizes the origin and
               destination of these routes.
               OCTA is also planning for future facilities and could introduce
               "Park-N-Ride" facilities into the area, thereby enhancing ridership for
               non-local trips. A commuter rail station is located within the City near
               the northwestern corner of Jamboree Road and Edinger Avenue near
               the SCRRA/OCTA Railway. As noted in the policies for Goal 5, the
               City will continue to work with OCTA to provide additional service
               and encourage maximum use of public transportation.

BIKEWAYS
               The existing bikeway system within the City of Tustin and the
               Planning Area is illustrated in Figure C-4. There is one Class I bike
               trail along Newport Avenue between El Camino Real and Irvine
               Boulevard, and several Class II lanes throughout the remainder of the
               City and Planning Area. The County Regional Trail (Class I) currently
               exists from Peters Canyon Road to Jamboree Road. The network of
               bicycle routes is only partially established, and with few exceptions,
               most bicycles share street right-of-ways with automobiles.
               To provide adequate accommodations in the future, a City Bikeway
               Plan has been developed. Missing links in the existing system and
               constraints for future routes were considered with the resulting
               Bikeway Plan illustrated in Figure C-5. Table C-7 describes and
               summarizes classifications relating to the Plan. The future network is
               comprehensive with several new facilities and extensions to existing
               routes. A conscious effort was exerted to ensure the Bikeway Plan
               achieved a continuity of routes and trails that did not terminate except
               at logical locations such as schools or parks.
               A Class I trail is proposed along the Peters Canyon Wash on the
               eastern boundary of the City. This trail is part of the East Tustin and
               Lower Peters Canyon Specific Plans and will also provide facilities for
               pedestrians and equestrians. The trail also extends north of Tustin
               Ranch Road along Pioneer Way, then inland adjacent to the Cedar
               Grove Park site and hillside areas to the west providing access to
               Peters Canyon Regional Park. The trail is part of the regional trail
               network.

Class I Bike Path or Bike Trail
         Provides a completely separated right-of-way designated for the exclusive use of bicycles
         and pedestrians; crossflows with motorized vehicles minimized.
          Sizing: Minimum width for Class I (two-way) is eight feet. Desirable width is 10-12 feet.
          Minimum shoulder width of two feet each side.
         Minimum width for Class I (one-way) is five feet. Minimum shoulder width of two feet
         each side.
Class II Bike Lane
         Provides a restricted right-of-way on a roadway’s shoulder designated for the exclusive
         or semi-exclusive use of bicycles with thru travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians
         prohibited; vehicle parking and crossflows by pedestrians and motorists permitted.
         Vehicle parking in a Class II bike lane is not desirable and should be discouraged and/or
         restricted where possible. Additional lane width (12 feet minimum and 13 feet desirable)
         shall be required if on-street parking is permitted.
          Sizing: Typical width of eight feet. A reduction in width to allow for restriping of an
         existing roadway or for added turning lanes may be permitted. In such cases, a five foot
         width, or gutter width plus three feet, whichever is greater, is the minimum width.
Class III Bikeway
         Provides for shared use of roadway facilities. These bikeways share the street with motor
         vehicles or share the sidewalk with pedestrians. In both of these conditions, bicycle use is
         a secondary function of the pavement.

PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION AND PARATRANSIT
               As related to safety, guidelines are administered through the
               development review process for the construction of pedestrian
               facilities (i.e., sidewalks, paths, wheelchair ramps, etc.), based on City
               policy and federal/state mandates. Sidewalks are typically required
               as a condition of approval or permit issuance for all development.
               Wheelchair ramp curb improvements are also required to meet access
               provisions under the American Disabilities Act.
               Paratransit services, or transportation services for the mobility-
               impaired, are provided by OCTA's Dial-A-Ride for senior citizens and
               the disabled, and by special services for senior citizens participating in
               programs at the Senior Center.
AIR
               Air travel is available from John Wayne Airport (JWA) in Orange
               County, approximately five miles to the south by surface roadway. As
               the closest of the regional airports, JWA would be the major facility
               for air travel for Tustin residents. Other regional airports are located
               approximately 20-50 miles to the north in Long Beach, Ontario and
               Los Angeles.
               The former United States Marine Corps helicopter station (MCAS
               Tustin) was located in the southern portion of the City. The MCAS
               Tustin Specific Plan has resulted in the elimination of aviation uses,
               with the exception of heliports individually permitted or blimp
               operations as an interim use.
RAIL
               Passenger rail service is provided from two Amtrak depots in
               neighboring cities; Irvine to the east and Santa Ana to the west.
               Commuter rail service is planned under the Los Angeles/San Diego
               (LOSSAN) Corridor Commuter Rail Action Plan. Commuter service
               within the corridor -requires stations at various locations. One of the
               stations is located in the City of Tustin in the vicinity of Edinger
               Avenue near Jamboree Road. Three Metrolink lines serve Orange

               The Orange County Transportation Authority is also evaluating the
               regional rail system through its Countywide Rail Study (CRS). This
               study is assessing congested traffic corridors and identifying rail and
               bus enhancements to the existing transportation system. While
               additional rail lines and improved service are being evaluated as part
               of this study,the Tustin station will play an active role in providing
               additional capacity for future commuter rail ridership.
TRUCKING
               Two routes have been previously identified for designated truck
               travel within the City of Tustin, including Irvine Boulevard along its
               entire length, and Red Hill Avenue in the vicinity of Irvine Boulevard.
               In addition to local streets where truck travel is prohibited, weight
               restrictions for commercial trucking have been imposed on several
               facilities and these are summarized in the following table:

   CIRCULATION ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
Many of the Circulation Element policies call for specific implementing actions to be
taken by the city. Other policies refer to subsequent programs and/or actions which
will implement the provisions of the General Plan Circulation Element. The City
Council, by incorporating the Implementation Program into the General Plan
recognizes the importance of long-range planning considerations in day-to-day
decision-making, subject to funding constraints. The following summarizes the
various actions to be taken to implement the Circulation Element of the General
Plan.
ARTERIAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
               1. Improvements to Arterial Highway System: Implementing the
               General Plan Circulation Element will require adding to or improving
               the existing arterial highway system. An implementation program to
               achieve this will monitor improvement priorities, establish funding
               sources, and incorporate the needed improvements into the City's
               Capital Improvement Program (CIP) on a regular (e.g. annual) basis.
               This program is related to the Growth Management Element which
               contains a mandate to identify short-range deficiencies and make
               necessary improvements. Specific implementing actions are as
               follows:
               o      Evaluate and if necessary refine the current CIP mechanism to
                      ensure a formalized method of identifying the roadway
                      improvements that need to be made in a five to seven year
                      time frame.
               o      Establish guidelines for traffic impact fees so that an equitable
                      means can be established for requiring new development to
                      pay a fair share of the needed transportation improvements.
               o      Make an annual determination of potential sources of highway
                      funding, such as Proposition 111 (Congestion Management),
                      Measure M, and the Santa Ana/Tustin TSIA.
               o      Coordinate improvement plans with regional activities so that
                      improvements within the City will obtain maximum benefit

                      transfer activities of AT & SF to off-peak traffic hours.
               o      Through the Moulton Parkway Smart Street Project study the
                      feasibility, costs and environmental impacts of a depressed or
                      elevated grade separation at Red Hill Avenue rail tracks, north
                      of Edinger Avenue.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM/DEMAND MANAGEMENT
               10. Transportation System Demand Management Strategies: The
               Circulation Element requires maximizing the efficiency of the
               Circulation System through use of Transportation System Demand
               Management strategies. Implementing actions can be summarized as
               follows:
               o      Implement traffic signal coordination on arterial streets to the
                      maximum extent practical.
               o      Encourage the implementation of Employer Transportation
                      Demand Management (TDM) measures as required by the
                      Southern California Air Quality Management District's Rule
                      2202 and by Proposition 111 as part of the Congestion
                      Management Program.
               o      Require that major new non-residential developments include
                      the submission of a TDM plan to the City, including
                      monitoring and enforcement provisions.
               o      Require applicable developments to provide on-site, in a
                      central location accessible to all employees and tenants,
                      informational services that will enhance ridesharing and the
                      use of other non-vehicular commute modes.
               For public transportation, the desire to maximize transit use is
               contained in the Circulation Element. Implementing actions to be
               undertaken for this are as follows:
               o      Support the efforts of the appropriate transportation agencies,
                      such as the Orange County Transportation Authority, to
                      continually upgrade local and express bus service to and from

                      the Tustin community and to provide Park and Ride lots near
                      the freeways.
               o      Require new development to participate in transit amenities,
                      such as bus shelters, turn-outs, landing pads and similar items.
               o      Coordinate roadway improvements with transit service so that
                      where applicable, special features, such as bus turn-outs, can
                      be provided in the improvement program.

               actions are as follows:
               o      Provide uniform standards and practices for the safety of
                      pedestrians and bicyclists by providing adequate sidewalks,
                      bicycle lanes, and off-road bicycle trails and requiring
                      dedication and improvement of these facilities where deemed
                      necessary to meet public needs arising as a result of
                      development.
               o      Include pedestrian walkway standards as requirements on
                      new development.
               o      Coordinate the development and maintenance of bikeways

   INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE,
                       AND RECREATION ELEMENT
Due to its location both on the coastal plain and in the Santiago Foothills, the Tustin
Planning Area possesses a wide variety of natural and open space resources.
Protecting, conserving, and managing these resources is the main purpose of the
Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Element. The Conservation/Open
Space/Recreation Technical Memorandum provides the necessary background
information and supporting documentation for this element.
According to the California State Government Code, all general plans must include
a conservation element and an open space element. For the City of Tustin General
Plan, these two elements have been combined along with the optional Recreation
Element, primarily due to the overlapping nature of the issues dealt with in the
elements.
The conservation element deals primarily with the preservation of natural resources,
such as water, soils, minerals, and animal life. An Air Quality "Sub-element" is also
included in the conservation element. The open space element deals primarily with
the preservation of "open-space land", or land that is used for agricultural
production, scenic enjoyment, and natural resource extraction, while the recreation
element addresses recreational resources and needs. The commonality between the
three elements includes preservation and management of natural resources.
PURPOSE OF THE CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE, AND RECREATION
ELEMENT
               This Element meets State requirements concerning the Conservation
               and Open Space Elements as defined in Sections 65302d and 65302e of
               the Government Code. According to these requirements, the
               Conservation Element must contain goals and policies that further the
               protection and maintenance of the State's natural resources such as
               water, soils, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources, and pre-
               vents their wasteful exploitation, degradation, and destruction.
               The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies concerned
               with managing all open space areas, including undeveloped lands
               and outdoor recreation areas. Specifically, the Open Space Element
CITY OF TUSTIN                                             CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE/
GENERAL PLAN                                                     RECREATION ELEMENT
                                            1                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               must identify open space that is left undeveloped for public health
               and safety reasons and open space that is used for the preservation of
               natural resources, for the managed production of resources, and for
               outdoor recreation.
               The Recreation Element identifies planned park and recreation
               facilities designed to support the recreational needs of Tustin's
               population.
               While air quality is not a mandatory General Plan element, the South
               Coast Air Quality Management Plan now contains specific guidance
               for air quality to be addressed in the General Plan. Air quality has
               been included as a sub-element to the Tustin Conservation/Open
               Space/Recreation Element to fulfill AQMP requirements. The purpose
               of the Air Quality Sub-element is to reduce current and projected
               emission levels through stationary source control measures; mobile
               source, transportation and land use control measures; and energy
               conservation measures.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               There are a number of existing plans and programs which are directly
               applicable to the aims and objectives of this Element. These plans and
               programs were enacted through Federal, State, and local legislation
               and are administered by agencies or special districts that have been
               delegated with powers to enforce Federal, State and local laws.
               Federal laws that are concerned with the protection of significant
               cultural and natural resources include the Endangered Species Act of
               1973 (as amended in 1978), the Antiquities Act and the National
               Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the National Environmental
               Policy Act (NEPA).
               California Environmental Quality Act Law and Guidelines
               The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by
               the State legislature in response to a public mandate that called for a
               thorough environmental analysis of those projects that might
               adversely affect the environment. The provisions of the law, review
               procedure, and any subsequent analysis are described in the CEQA
               Law and Guidelines as amended in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

               CEQA will continue to be instrumental in ensuring that the impacts of
               all potentially significant projects are assessed.
               Air Quality Management Plan
               In 2007, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the
               Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) adopted an
               updated Air Quality Management Plan designed to achieve the
               National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
               Since 1989 the South Coast Air Quality Management District has
               witnessed significant regulatory achievements in reducing emissions
               from mobile and stationary sources and consumer products.
               California Fish and Game Regulations
               The California Fish and Game Code was adopted by the State
               legislature to protect the fish and wildlife resources of the State.
               Special permits are required for any lake or stream alterations,
               dredging or other activities that may affect fish and game habitat.
               Other Plans
               Plans and programs that contribute to the planning related to con-
               servation, open space, and recreation include the following
               documents:
               County of Orange Master Plan of Local Parks: The County's Master
               Parks Plan provides goals, objectives, and policies and provides
               implementation programs for a comprehensive county-wide park
               plan. In conjunction with the County's Local Park Code, specific
               criteria are intended to provide an adequate supply of usable county
               parkland. This Plan provides a regional park planning context for the
               Tustin Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element.
               County of Orange Master Plan of Regional Riding and Hiking
               Trails: The County's trails plan provides policies and programs to
               implement the future development and operation of the County-wide
               trails system. The Plan includes an inventory of existing and proposed
               trails and standards and criteria for new trails.

               County of Orange Recreation Element: The Recreation Element of
               the County of Orange General Plan provides an inventory of existing
               and proposed parks and open space and includes the Master Plan of
               Local Parks and Trails component.
               County of Orange Resources Element: The County's Resources
               Element includes an inventory of the County-wide resources such as
               agricultural, mineral, and wildlife resources, energy, water, air, open
               space, and cultural-historic resources. The element also includes goals,
               policies, and programs for the development, management,
               preservation, and conservation of the county's resources. This Element
               provides sources of regional information affecting the Tustin area.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               In addition to the Introduction, the Conservation, Open Space, and
               Recreation Element includes four sections: Summary of Issues, Needs,
               Opportunities, and Constraints; Goals and Policies; the Conservation
               and Open Space Plan; and the Recreation Plan. The issues, needs,
               opportunities, and constraints identified in the Technical
               Memorandum lead to the formulation of Goals and Policies designed
               to address the issues identified. The Plan specifically explains how the
               Goals and Policies will be achieved and implemented.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
               All Elements of a general plan must be internally consistent. This
               assumes an interrelationship between each element. The
               Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element contains goals
               and policies which support goals and policies within each of the other
               elements.
               The Conservation/Open Space/Recreation (COSR) Element relates to
               other elements in a variety of ways. The Land Use Element directly
               relates to the Element by designating areas of the City where open
               space/recreational opportunities exist and by designating resources
               that should be conserved. Jobs/housing balance issues addressed in

               the Land Use Element are directly related to the achievement of air
               quality goals which are addressed within this Element.
               The City's Land Use Element contains two land use designations that
               encompass open space land uses: Public/Institutional and Planned
               Community Public/Institutional.
               Public/Institutional: The Public/Institutional designation includes a
               wide range of public and quasi-public uses distributed throughout the
               community such as schools, churches, child care centers,
               transportation facilities, public buildings and facilities, public utilities,
               libraries, museums, art galleries, community theaters, hospitals,
               cultural and recreational activities, community recreational facilities,
               and parks. Certain public institutional uses may be permitted within
               other land use designations when determined appropriate. In
               addition, land uses which support and are specifically related to the
               function of the primary institutional use may also be permitted. These
               support uses may include residential (for purposes of housing
               persons related to an institutional use), retail and service commercial,
               and industrial uses (e.g., warehousing for a city yard facility).
               PC Public/Institutional: The range of permitted uses is identical to
               the Public/Institutional Land Use designation. To ensure
               compatibility of land uses permitted within the classification, with the
               character of surrounding development and within a development
               area, the location, land use type, density and building intensity
               standards will be specifically governed by Planned Community
               District provisions or adoption of a Specific Plan as authorized by the
               California Government Code.
               The COSR Element's relationship to the Housing Element is
               conditioned by the need to serve a growing population's recreational
               needs in the areas of the City with the highest density. Also, housing
               requirements for land must be balanced by the need to conserve
               natural resources.
               The Circulation Element attempts to provide an efficient and well
               balanced circulation system. The COSR Element includes multi-use
               recreation trails which can also serve as elements of the circulation
               system. In addition, the air quality component of the COSR Element is
               closely linked with the Circulation Element, in that both concerned
               with reducing vehicle trips and improving traffic flow.

               The Public Safety Element relates to the COSR Element by designating
               areas which are unsafe for development such as fault line areas and
               floodplains. Although these areas are unsafe for intensive
               development, such lands may be suitable for recreation and open
               space purposes.
               Similar to the Public Safety Element, the Noise Element relates to the
               COSR Element by discussing a health and safety related issue area.
               Techniques for reducing noise often involve open space or some sort
               of buffer zone between noise sources and noise-sensitive land uses.

      SUMMARY OF ISSUES, NEEDS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND
                                 CONSTRAINTS
This section describes the issues, needs, opportunities, and constraints of the Tustin
Planning Area relative to open space, conservation, and recreation.
AIR QUALITY
               o     State and federal air quality standards, especially ozone
                     standards, are often exceeded.
               o     Extensive use of motorized transportation modes and large
                     particulate generating uses in the area contribute to poor air
                     quality.
               o     Topography, climate, and emissions combine to create an air
                     quality environment which must be managed for the public
                     health, safety, and welfare.
               o     New regulations must be implemented to fulfill Air Quality
                     Management Plan requirements. These regulations include trip
                     reduction, jobs/housing balance, point source reduction,
                     efficient land use, and alternate forms of transportation and
                     energy.
NATURAL RESOURCES AND UNIQUE NATURAL FEATURES
               Water
               o     Protection of domestic groundwater supply.
               o     Continued drought conditions highlight need for continuing
                     conservation efforts.

               o     Limited riparian habitat exists in the Planning Area.
               o     The northern half of the Peters Canyon retarding basin
                     supports an assemblage of riparian vegetation which, when
                     fully restored, would provide many plant and animal species
                     with suitable habitat.
               o     Jurisdictional wetlands have been identified on the former
                     MCAS Tustin site.
               Eucalyptus, Cedar, and Redwood Trees
               o     The Eucalyptus groves and remaining Eucalyptus windrows in
                     East Tustin lend a nostalgic rural and agricultural character to
                     the local landscape. Many of these remaining Eucalyptus trees
                     are in need of substantial care.
               o     There is a Cedar/Redwood grove on a passive community
                     park site in the northeasterly portion of East Tustin that is
                     unique and visually prominent.
               Special Management Areas
               o     Peters Canyon retarding basin and wash offers opportunity for
                     preservation and conservation of open space and natural
                     amenities.
               o     Hillside areas in East Tustin and the northeasterly portion of
                     Planning Area are an important identifying feature. There is
                     significant potential to enhance City's living environment and
                     overall image through creative and sensitive treatment of
                     major topographic features.
               o     The Peters Canyon ridgeline is a prominent visual feature in
                     East Tustin which should be protected.
               o     Natural hillside features and open space should be used to
                     protect the public health and safety in areas of potential

               Managed Production of Resources
               o    Limited amounts of agricultural land remain in Tustin.
SOLID WASTE RECYCLING
               o    Southern California continues to generate increasing amounts
                    of solid waste while landfill space is limited.
               o    The California Integrated Waste Management Board required
                    the City to divert at least 50% of its waste from landfills.
               o    Implementation of recycling and other solid waste reduction
                    programs will require cooperation of local residents and
                    businesses and a strong effort by City government.
ENERGY RESOURCE CONSERVATION
               
               o    Limited conventional energy resources require conservation
                    and development and use of alternative energy resources.
HISTORIC, CULTURAL, ARCHAEOLOGIC, AND PALEONTOLOGICAL
RESOURCES
               
               o    There is a wide range of historically significant resources in
                    Tustin.
               o    The two Lighter-Than-Air-Hangars at the former Marine Corps
                    Air Station are included on the National Register of Historic
                    Places.
               o    Tustin's location and geology make it an important
                    archaeological and paleontological resource area.

               o Methods of protecting archaeological and paleontological
                 resources while permitting development must be addressed.
PARKS AND OPEN SPACE SYSTEM
               o A comprehensive integrated plan for parks, open space, and
                 scenic highways does not exist, and so, a complementary
                 system of such resources is difficult to create or maintain.
               o Without the support of school facilities, Tustin faces a shortage
                 of recreational facilities, especially in the southern and western
                 portions of the community where densities are higher.
               o In 2011, the City had 113 acres of existing local and community
                 parks, but needed an additional 114 acres to serve its
                 population based on a standard of three acres per 1,000
                 persons based on January 2011 City population of 75,781.
               o Regional recreation facilities will be located in Tustin,
                 requiring coordination with adjacent jurisdictions.
               o Limited recreation space often precludes programs for all
                 segments of population. Increasing population will aggravate
                 this problem.
               o Given the limited recreation space, careful planning is needed
                 to provide a balance of diverse facility needs.
               o The community's facilities are limited and disrepair would
                 create a severe deficiency in facilities.
               o The City has limited resources, so various segments of
                 community must assume some responsibility for providing
                 facilities, services and programs.
               o Land acquisition for park and open space purposes and
                 development of recreational facilities must compete for very
                 limited funding sources.

           THE CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE PLAN
The Conservation and Open Space Plan describes the approaches to be used in
implementing the Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element goals and
policies. Implementation of any individual action program will be subject to further
citizen input, funding availability and the discretion of the City Council. The
Conservation and Open Space Plan identifies those measures implemented for
conservation purposes, including air quality measures. The Plan also identifies
undeveloped lands reserved for public health and safety, the preservation of natural
resources, and the managed production of resources.
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
               Tustin must protect the public health and safety of the community.
               This involves identifying areas that pose a potential threat to health
               and safety and implementing proper planning techniques to minimize
               potential threats to health and safety. Improving air quality and
               minimizing soil-related and water quality hazards are vital
               components of conservation for public health and safety.
               Air Quality
               Air quality has become an issue of such regional and critical
               importance that the Southern California Association of Governments
               now requires local jurisdictions to address air quality within a
               separate element or as a major section of the General Plan. As a
               component of the Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Element, the
               air quality section provides direction for implementing programs
               which will support regional efforts to improve air quality in the South
               Coast basin. Goals 1 through 4 set forth the City's Goals for air quality
               and the policies established to attain those goals.
               Of primary importance in attaining air quality goals is a coordinated
               regional effort. Tustin will cooperate with the South Coast Air Quality
               Management District and the Southern California Association of
               Governments to implement the goals of this element and the Air
               Quality Management Plan (AQMP).

                                             27                       NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               Transportation Control Measures: Measures related to transportation
               have been identified in the AQMP that need to be addressed by local
               government level (i.e. City of Tustin) in partnership with SCAQMD
               and SCAG. These measures are generally aimed at reducing the total
               number of vehicle trips, improving traffic flow, and utilizing clean
               fuels in motor vehicles.
               The goal of the Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) is to
               influence transportation choices of mode, time of day, or whether to
               travel. The strategies also address fuel selection and applications of
               technology to motivate a shift from petroleum-based fuels.
               These control measures include            the   following   advanced
               transportation technology measures:
               (a)     Telecommunications;
               (b)     Smart shuttle transit;
               (c)     Zero emissions vehicles/infrastructure;
               (d)     Alternative fuel vehicles/infrastructure;
               (e)     Intelligent vehicle highway systems
        
               Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation Options: The 1997
               AQMP included Rule 2202 providing employers with a menu of
               options to reduce mobile source emissions generated from employee
               comments. As of June, 1998, Rule 2202 applied to any employer who
               employs 250 or more employees on a full to part-time basis at a
               worksite for a consecutive six-month period. These employers must
               establish an emission reduction target (ERT) with SCAQMD using one
               or more of the following options:
               (a)     Mobile source emissions reduction credits;
               (b)     Emission reduction credits from stationary sources;
               (c)     Air quality investment program; and/or
               (d)     Other emission reduction strategies, such as peak commute
                       trip reduction, alternative fuel vehicles or vehicle miles
                       traveled reduction.
               Dust Control and Particulates: Grading activity, building, and road
               construction result in particulate emissions from both the materials
               used (including sealers, paints, and solvents) and construction
               methods (such as sawing wood, grinding concrete, and spraying
               paint).
CITY OF TUSTIN                                            CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE/

               Two control methods designed to reduce particulate emissions
               (PM10) to the atmosphere are: (a) storage and movement of fine
               particulate matter and (b) the paving of unpaved roads and parking
               lots.
               Energy Conservation: Energy use contributes significantly to
               emissions of criteria pollutants as well as global warming gases. The
               District, in the pursuit of achieving all criteria pollutant air quality
               standards and reducing adverse global impacts, is committed to
               reduce energy-related emissions by implementing two major policies:
               o      Promoting clean energy
               o      Reducing the demand for energy
               The AQMP calls for a significant increase in the use of alternative,
               cleaner types of energy, relative to the traditional petroleum-based
               fuels.
               Energy conservation provides one of the major avenues of achieving
               clean air, providing resource diversity, and energy independence. The
               AQMP relies on the energy savings from future utility programs,
               building and appliance standards, and local government programs to
               provide the majority of savings necessary to meet conservation goals
               proposed in the 1997 AQMP until further program cost-effectiveness
               can be completed.
               In addition to these energy conservation measures, the City of Tustin
               can also play a vital role in increasing the recycling of waste glass,
               paper and plastic throughout the City. The use of recycled materials
               by local glass and paper manufacturers lower air emissions due to
               decreased energy consumption.
               In 1989, the State approved comprehensive recycling and source
               reduction legislation in the form of AB 939. That bill required cities
               and counties to adopt source reduction and recycling elements
               designed to divert 25 percent of all solid waste from landfill or
               transformation facilities by January 1, 1995 through source reduction,
               recycling, and composting activities. With some exceptions, cities and
               counties were also required to divert 50 percent by January 1, 2000.
               This legislation should lead to significant increases in the current level
               of recycling.

               The City of Tustin has adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling
               Element, which permits the City to meet the goals of AB 939. The
               City's element addresses the following eight components: Source
               reduction, recycling, composting, special waste, public education and
               information, disposal facility capacity, funding, and integration.
               Soil Related Hazards
               Figure COSR-1 depicts the areas in the community which require
               special planning considerations to avoid potential hazards. Three soil
               related safety problems are seismic hazards, soil liquefaction, and
               landslides. As none of the geologic fault systems within Tustin are
               known to be active, they are not identified on Figure COSR-1;
               however, if the Division of Mines and Geology should determine that
               the El Modena Fault, or any other faults within the Planning Area, are
               active, Figure COSR-1 will be modified to identify those active faults,
               and additional actions necessary to protect public health and safety
               will be prescribed.
               Areas within the Planning Area have been identified as susceptible to
               liquefaction or potential bedrock landslides. These areas are identified
               on Figure COSR-1. When development is proposed within these areas,
               studies shall be performed as directed by the City to determine the
               potential for hazards and the amount of development which is
               supportable on the site.
               The following techniques can be used to acquire or dedicate land for
               open space to protect public health and safety or to preserve natural
               and cultural resources described in the next section:
               Open Space Easements - pursuant to the Open Space Easement Act of
               1974 (Government Code Section 51070 et seq.).
               Conservation Easements - pursuant to the Conservation Easement Act
               (Civil Code Sections 815-816).

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
NATURAL/CULTURAL RESOURCES
               The most significant natural resources in Tustin include land with
               open space potential, lands with biological resources, water resources,
               prominent landforms, and those sites or structures which have
               historical, archaeological, or paleontological resources. Peters Canyon
               is the largest remaining undeveloped area within the City. This area
               contains some coastal sage scrub vegetation which could support a
               variety of animal species with some revegetation. These important
               natural resource areas are shown on Figure COSR-2.
               Water Resources and Riparian Habitats
               The 1990 Groundwater Management Plan outlines strategies for
               conserving water resources in Orange County. The Plan outlines the
               following five goals for conserving water in Orange County:
               1)increasing basin water supplies, 2) protecting and enhancing water
               quality, 3) improving basin management, 4) improving relations with
               constituents, and 5) improving Orange County Water District
               management and operation.
               The City of Tustin is participating in several programs to improve
               basin management and decrease reliance upon imported water. One
               program is the Nitrate Removal Demonstration Project mentioned
               above. The OCWD has constructed a Demonstration Treatment Plant
               which removes nitrates from groundwater in the wells at the City's
               Main Street Plant. If this program is successful, wells in Tustin and
               elsewhere in Orange County that are currently closed due to high
               nitrate levels may undergo similar treatment to permit reopening.
               A second water improvement program is the Seventeenth Street
               Desalter project. Two wells at the City's Seventeenth Street Plant and
               one at the Newport Avenue well site are closed due to high nitrate
               levels and high levels of total dissolved solids. With treatment, these
               wells will produce an additional 3,000 acre-feet of water per year.
               A third program is the MWD Seasonal Storage Program. This
               program gives local agencies financial incentives to store water

               through the winter months, thus reducing peak loads in the drier
               summer months.
               A fourth program is the OCWD Conjunctive Use Well Program. This
               program offers local agencies low interest loans for construction of up
               to three wells.
               An additional method of managing the groundwater resources is
               using reclaimed water. The Irvine Ranch Water District supplies
               reclaimed water by the Michelson Water Reclamation Plant, a 15
               million gallon per day facility. Although the water is of near potable
               quality, it is used strictly for irrigation purposes and replaces water
               that would otherwise be pumped from the ground. The Irvine Ranch
               Water District services East Tustin.
               The City of Tustin also promotes water conservation, through its
               water conservation ordinance. The ordinance, "Finding and
               Determining the Necessity for Adopting a Water Management Plan"
               identifies water conservation stages and water use limitations. The
               Water Management Plan ordinance specifies water conservation
               stages and prohibited activities during each stage. The City also
               participates in low volume toilet replacement, showerhead
               replacement and landscape water conservation programs through the
               Municipal Water District of Orange County.
               In response to Assembly Bill 1881, legislation of 2006, the City
               adopted the Water Efficiency Landscape Ordinance. Its purpose is to
               promote the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping in a
               manner that conserves regional water resources by ensuring that
               landscaping projects are not unduly water-needy and that irrigation
               systems are appropriately implemented to minimize water waste.
               Water resources and features, including watersheds and riparian
               habitats, are very important to Southern California, and riparian
               habitats are quite rare. The most prominent water feature in Tustin is
               Peters Canyon. Several mitigation measures were adopted for Peters
               Canyon as part of the East Tustin Specific Plan. These mitigation
               measures continue to reflect City policy. For several years, the Lower
               Peters Canyon Retarding Basin contained a small riparian habitat.
               This habitat severely deteriorated in recent years. The City will work
               with the County of Orange, which recently constructed a replacement
               dam, to preserve the riparian area and implement active measures to

       Plant and Animal Communities
       In addition to the riparian habitat, two other plant groups provide significant
       benefits to Tustin. These are the Coastal Sage Scrub and the imported trees -
       Eucalyptus and Cedar stands. These have been preserved through the East
       Tustin Specific Plan and EIR. Coastal Sage Scrub is home to some of
       California's sensitive or endangered species such as the California
       Black-tailed Gnatcatcher, the San Diego Cactus Wren, and the San Diego
       Coast Horned Lizard. The Coastal Sage Scrub itself is now very limited and
       needs careful management. Peters Canyon Regional Park assists in
       preserving most of Tustin's existing Coastal Sage Scrub. The development of
       Peters Canyon Regional Park took into consideration the preservation and
       improvement of the sensitive plant and animal communities within its
       borders.
       The General Plan also mandates the continued maintenance of significant
       tree stands. Healthy trees have been identified through the Eucalyptus Study
       performed in 1988 and shall be cared for to maintain their health. As existing
       healthy trees die or become irreversibly damaged, they shall be replaced. The
       study makes several recommendations which the City will observe. Among
       the nine recommendations are selective pruning, removal of dead plant
       material, appropriate irrigation, and the minimization of heavy equipment
       use within 20 feet of the tree trunks.
       Policies within this Element support these previous efforts. The
       redwood/cedar grove has already been protected by including it within a
       new park. In addition, new developments will require a biological
       assessment. Biological resources which are important to the local ecosystem
       or to the City's aesthetic environment will be integrated into new
       development.
       Topography, Soils, Paleontology, and Archaeology
       Topographical features, soils, and paleontologic, and archaeologic features
       are all generally most affected by earthmoving and subsequent urban
       development. This Element requires the utilization of standards to preserve
       the unique landforms existing within the Planning Area. The City has very
       detailed standards and requirements for grading that are designed to protect
       sensitive topographic, soil, paleontologic, and archaeologic resources. The
       Tustin Grading Manual prescribes appropriate measures to protect the earth
       by controlling erosion, sedimentation, and storm damage.

               Proper grading, soil management, and open space standards will
               work to preserve these resources. Sensitive locations will be
               identified, and their preservation will be a high priority for the City
               during any project review. As new resources are identified in the City,
               they will be documented as features or resources the City desires to
               preserve.
               To further protect paleontological and archaeological resources, a
               records search will be performed prior to a development. If no record
               of resources exist, a field survey will be performed. Any proposed
               project which is located within a sensitive area as defined by Figure
               COSR-2, or is identified through a subsequent study, will require a
               licensed paleontologist or archaeologist to be present on the site to
               observe grading or other earthwork.
               Historic Resources
               Tustin's many fine historic buildings are very important resources to
               the community. The City conducted historic surveys in 1990 and 2003,
               and maintains an historic preservation district. Significant structures
               outside the district are also protected by the City. In addition to City
               recognition, the Orange County Historical Commission recognizes the
               Hewes House and the First Advent Christian Church. The National
               Register of Historic Places also designates the Lighter-than-Air
               Hangars at the former MCAS Tustin. Prior to the closing of MCAS
               Tustin, additional historic resource surveying of the facility was
               completed. It was concluded that there existed two discontiguous
               historic districts containing World War II structures at former MCAS
               Tustin, including heating plant buildings and blimp mooring areas.
               Any environmental impacts of the reuse plan for MCAS Tustin will
               need  to  address  the  disposition  of  these  resources.  Figure COSR-3
               identifies current historic resources within Tustin.
               Cultural Resources District: The Tustin Cultural Resources District
               was established in response to growing concerns over future
               development in Old Town. The purpose of the Cultural Resources
               District is to provide a framework for recognizing, preserving, and
               protecting culturally significant structures, natural features, sites, and
               neighborhoods within the City of Tustin. The District includes much
               of the area within the original City boundaries.

               The Cultural Resources District ordinance establishes criteria for use
               in designating cultural resources and Cultural Resources Districts and
               the procedures to be followed in making such designations. Final
               action of any designation must be approved by the City Council.
               Certificates of Appropriateness are required for improvements within
               Cultural Resource Districts or upon Designated Cultural Resources
               when such improvements require a City building permit.
               The preparation of a historic resources survey enables a city to apply
               for status as a Certified Local Government (CLG). The Certified Local
               Government Program is a federal program which allows a city to
               participate more directly in historic preservation efforts. Application
               is made through the State Office of Historic Preservation. A CLG is
               eligible for matching grants which can be used for a variety of historic
               preservation efforts. Tustin became a CLG in 1991.
               Scenic Resources
               As new development is considered by City decision makers, public
               views should be preserved as much as possible. Consideration will be
               given to protecting public views along the ridge lines, views toward
               the inland mountains and along scenic transportation corridors.
               Figure COSR-4 conceptually identifies significant public scenic
               resources in Tustin.
               Solid Waste Recycling
               The need to conserve landfill space has been addressed by State
               legislation. Assembly Bill 939 mandates the preparation of a Source
               Reduction and Recycling Element for solid wastes. This is not an
               element that is required to be incorporated into the General Plan. Goal
               10 of this element is the reduction of solid waste in the City. Specific
               policies set forth by the City include implementing the Source
               Reduction and Recycling Element, maximizing integration of source
               reduction programs, and maximizing public awareness. These goals
               and policies are set forth explicitly in the Source Reduction and
               Recycling Element. While that element is not a part of the General
               Plan, the City's intention is to implement it, and the General Plan fully
               supports that element as City policy.

               Energy Resource Conservation
               Tustin's location in the foothill region of Orange County makes it well
               suited to taking advantage of solar power.
               Design of buildings and subdivisions should take the mostly sunny
               winters and the hot summers into consideration. Southern exposures
               in the winter and limited western exposure in the summer are both
               important. Streets which run east-west are more adaptable to solar
               energy practices than north-south streets. The ideal building
               orientation for the Southern California coastal inland regions has been
               recommended as a 35 degree variation to the southwest of the
               building's long axis. State Title 24 Energy Regulations establish energy
               performance Building Code requirements that the City has
               implemented.
 
CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE FOR THE MANAGED
PRODUCTION OF RESROUCES
               Open Space areas for the managed production of resources with
               regard to this section include agricultural lands and areas containing
               major mineral deposits. The conservation of open space areas for the
               managed production of resources does not directly affect lands within
               the City of Tustin Planning Area.
               The City of Tustin is an urbanized community and contains limited
               undeveloped land, most of which is within Tustin Legacy. Very little
               of this undeveloped land is currently used for commercial agriculture,
               and it is unlikely that any will be used in the future.
               The only mineral resource identified within the Tustin Planning Area
               is the Mercury-Barite deposit in Red Hill (the hill). However, this
               resource is not utilized.

                            THE RECREATION PLAN
 
The Recreation Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the goals
and policies of this element pertaining to recreation resources and opportunities.
The recreation facilities in Tustin play an important part in the lives of Tustin
residents. Tustin has been developed with several open space amenities including
local public and private recreational facilities, pedestrian and bicycle trails,
equestrian trails, and other public open spaces. Opportunities exist to provide
strong linkages between these open space resources to form a cohesive system of
open space.
 
 
RELATION TO LAND USE PLAN
                
               The City's Land Use Plan places open space, parkland, and
               recreational facilities into the Public/Institutional land use category.
               The Public/Institutional designation includes a wide range of public
               and private uses distributed throughout the community such as
               schools, churches, child care centers, transportation facilities,
               government offices and facilities, public utilities, libraries, museums,
               art galleries, community theaters, hospitals, cultural and recreational
               activities, and community recreational facilities and parks. The Plan
               also permits Public/Institutional uses in other land use designations
               when the use serves a local need and is compatible with surrounding
               development.
PARK CLASSIFICATION AND STANDARDS
               The Recreation Plan establishes a classification system that applies to
               all existing and future park and recreation facilities in the City.
               Specific standards, based upon existing parkland, have been
               developed for each category of park or recreation area. The existing
               parks and recreational facilities are listed on Table COSR-2. Proposed
               park and recreation facilities are listed on Table COSR-3.

                    General Standards
 
                    The State of California Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision
                    Map Act Code Section 66477 (The Quimby Act) indicate that the
                    legislative body of a City or County, may, by Ordinance, require the
                    dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a
                    combination of both, for park and recreational purposes as a condition
                    to the approval for a final tract map or parcel map. In cases where
                    such dedications or fees have not been obtained for particular lots
                    through a map, they may be imposed at the time that building permits
                    are issued. Among other requirements, the following conditions must
                    be met:
                    o         The Ordinance must include definite standards for determin-
                              ing the proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated and the
                              amount of any fee to be paid in lieu thereof; and
                    o         The legislative body has adopted a General Plan containing a
                              Recreation Element, and any proposed park and recreational
                              facilities are in accordance with definite principles and
                              standards contained therein.
                    In conformance with this statute, the City of Tustin Conservation,
                    Open Space, and Recreation Element includes standards determining
                    land requirements for future park sites. The standards identified in
                    Table COSR-4, Tustin Subdivision Code, and in the following text
                    should be utilized in selecting sites for parks and should serve as
                    guidelines governing the acceptance of land dedicated to the City.
                    Future acquisition should focus on acquiring land for parkettes and
                    neighborhood and community parks as well as obtaining easements
                    and property for trails. Generally, parkettes are not cost effective to
                    maintain and this will be considered prior to acceptance of dedication.
                    Figure COSR-5 presents the Tustin Recreation Plan for parks and
                    other recreational open space facilities.

           for the MCAS Tustin Specific Plan to meet the needs of this area of the City. The Specific Plan identifies by
           neighborhood required parks and open space acreages that need to be accommodated.
     2.    This standard is satisfied by neighborhood and community parks. Peters Canyon Regional Park is not used to meet this
           standard. However, the MCAS Tustin urban regional park is included due to active sports facilities that will be available to the

       Parkettes
       Parkettes are small, passive, local parks, generally less than one acre in size.
       Most parkettes are established in higher density areas as a substitute for
       backyards. Size and location are usually determined by the availability of vacant
       land. These parks may serve any age group, depending on the characteristics of
       the neighborhood. They usually feature play apparatus, a paved area for
       wheeled toys, benches, and landscape treatment. They may also feature
       children's play areas, quiet game areas, and some sports activities such as
       multi-purpose courts, if space allows. Some mini-parks are natural areas with
       minimal improvements (e.g., benches) which safeguard identified
       archaeological/paleontological sites or other natural resources, or serve as
       viewpoints. As the City approaches build-out, it becomes more important to take
       advantage of opportunities available to the City for the establishment of park
       space. Parkettes could be established in areas that lack conveniently accessible
       parkland. The maintenance costs of proposed parkettes require consideration
       prior to acceptance of dedication.
       Neighborhood Parks
       Many of the facilities located within neighborhood parks are associated with
       active recreation. All neighborhood parks should contain some area for active
       recreation depending on the size of the park.
       The park site should contain consolidated parcels with appropriate area devoted
       to active recreation such as ball fields (soccer and baseball), multi-purpose fields
       and open turf, game courts, tot lots, picnic facilities, swimming pools,
       community buildings, restroom building and on-site parking. The neighborhood
       park site also needs to include amenities such as trees, shrubs, groundcover, turf
       areas, benches, trash receptacles, picnic tables, shade structures, paved or
       decomposed-granite trails. The standard minimum size for neighborhood parks
       is three acres.
       Neighborhood parks should be located near the center of a neighborhood unit
       and, if possible, adjoining an elementary school. Easy access should be provided
       to pedestrians, bicyclists, and maintenance and public safety vehicles. A
       neighborhood park should not be separated from its user population by major
       highways, railroads, or other un-traversable obstacles. A neighborhood park
       should be situated adjacent to or near greenbelts, open space linkages, or other
       community open space/recreation facilities to facilitate an open space system
       throughout the City.

       Community Parks
       Community parks are intended to serve an approximate population of 10,000.
       No specific shape is required for community parks as they are intended to
       incorporate both active recreational facilities and passive open space in the form
       of unique physical features such as a ridgeline. Community parks should be a
       minimum of eight acres. Community parks should encompass pedestrian and
       bicycle paths and natural open space.
       Community parks should contribute to the City's open space system by
       connecting to neighborhood parks through open space linkages or connecting to
       other recreational facilities. They should be located at or near the intersection of
       an arterial near the center of their service area. Community parks should contain
       space for active recreational facilities such as gamefields, game courts,
       swimming pools or aquatic center, and play areas as well as community centers,
       on-site parking, restrooms, and picnic areas. Amenities such as trees, shrubs,
       groundcover, large open turf areas, hardscape, benches, trash receptacles, paved
       and decomposed granite trails, club house with storage area, lighted parking
       lots to meet facility and amenity demands, picnic tables, barbeques, shelter
       structures, and restroom buildings should be provided.
       Community Linear Park
       A Community Linear Park is envisioned at Tustin Legacy. The Community
       Linear Park would provide (private and public owned portions) trees, shrubs,

       Regional Parks
       The County of Orange owns and maintains many regional recreational facilities.
       Policy for the development, maintenance, and improvement of these parks is
       provided by the Orange County Recreation Element, which includes a Master
       Plan for regional recreational facilities in the County.
       The County currently operates the Peters Canyon Regional Park within the
       northwesterly portion of East Tustin. The City also supports the County in
       locating other regional park facilities in the City. A regional park of
       approximately 84.5 acres (including 11 acres occupied by a blimp hanger) is
       proposed to be transferred to and operated by the County within the MCAS

       Tustin Specific Plan area. Outdoor recreation activities and adaptive reuse of
       existing buildings within this regional park location for recreation-oriented uses
       is planned.
       School Playgrounds/Joint Agreements
       Organized sports leagues such as those for baseball, soccer, and football utilize
       school ballfields through a permit process with the School District. The City
       includes school recreational facilities in which the City has a joint use agreement
       with the School District to meet the overall standard of three acres per 1,000
       population. At the time of the General Plan update, one school facility
       (Columbus Tustin) is used jointly by the City and the School District. Up to 1.5
       acres per 1,000 population can be provided through school recreation areas
       provided the school recreation areas are open to the public.
       Opportunities exist to maintain and enhance school/recreation joint use
       agreements with the Tustin Unified School District. Whenever feasible, the City
       should work to improve agreements with schools to enter into a joint
       school/recreation use and maintenance program.
       An educational college campus is proposed within the Tustin Legacy
       development which could provide recreational facilities open to the public.
       Biking/Hiking Trails
       The County of Orange maintains a coordinated system of trails, including
       bikeways, equestrian trails and hiking trails within the City. The Tustin Parks
       and Recreation and Community Development Departments disseminate public
       information regarding trail availability, and assists with design review of new
       trails.
       Bikeways comprise the most extensive part of the City's trail network. There are
       three categories of bikeways:
       o Class I: a paved path that is separate from any motor vehicle travel lane;
       o Class II: a restricted lane within the right of way of a paved roadway for the
           exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles; and
       o Class III: a bikeway that shares the street with motor vehicles or the
           sidewalk with pedestrians.
       The biking network in Tustin connects with other trails and paths in adjacent
       communities and throughout Orange County. The County of Orange has
       required that a bikeway and hiking trail for connection within the Tustin Legacy

       project be provided along the Peters Canyon Channel as an obligation of the
       Tustin Legacy project. The trail would be paved and also include a decomposed-
       granite trail with landscaping, benches, trash receptacles, and low-level lighting
       and directional signage. Direct connections from adjacent residential
       developments at Tustin Legacy are to be provided. The trails would be
       completed in conjunction with improvements that are to be made to the Peters
       Canyon Channel.
       A number of policies included in this Element are concerned with the expansion
       of the City-wide system of hiking and biking trails. Precise development
       standards for the various types of trails are difficult to establish since trail width
       and gradient will depend on topography, surface features, and availability of an
       easement. The City's trail system includes pedestrian and bike trails within open
       space corridors and along regional trails which link to local and regional
       parkland. The bikeways located along the City's street system are addressed in
       the City's Circulation Element. The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan also includes a
       Recreational Bikeway/Trail Concept Plan that provides an opportunity to
       complete vital links to local and regional systems.
       Other Recreational Facilities
       In addition to its parks and trails, Tustin has many private recreational facilities.
       While some private facilities (e.g., private parks, tennis courts, swimming pools)
       are available only to the residents of the general particular complex in which
       they are located, others are available to the public for a fee (e.g., Tustin Ranch
       Golf Course). The City encourages the inclusion of such facilities in private
       development, especially those open to the public.
       The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan should also offer opportunities for other forms of
       commercial or privately operated recreation. These might include commercial
       recreation uses, such as health clubs, bowling alleys, family entertainment
       centers and other activities.
       FUTURE RECREATION FACILITIES
       Identifying areas which will be adequately served by existing park facilities and
       areas for which new parks will be needed is possible by comparing projected
       build-out for the City with the standards and criteria of this Element. The
       implementation program for this Element includes a plan showing the
       approximate number and location of additional park facilities, by category,
       according to the specific criteria outlined in this Element. This information will
       be used as a reference tool, along with the above criteria, for planning the
       acquisition and siting of park facilities.

 CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
                      IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
The Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element Implementation Program
provides a guide to the community, City Staff, and City officials in day-to-day
decision-making by suggesting ways to implement adopted policy. Implementation
measures for the Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element are intended to
preserve natural resources, maintain public health and safety, and provide for the
recreational needs of the City's inhabitants. The Implementation Program is a series
of actions, procedures, and techniques that carry out the Element policy through
implementing a standard or program. The City Council, by incorporating the
Implementation Program into the General Plan, recognizes the importance of long-
range planning considerations in day-to-day decision-making, subject to funding
constraints.
AIR QUALITY
                
               The Air Quality Management District (AQMD) has adopted the 2007
               Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), an advisory document which
               identifies a number of air pollution reduction goals, measures and
               policies. Local jurisdictions have been mandated to reduce a fair share
               proportion of vehicle generated air pollution through the adoption of
               a menu of optional Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) which
               have been determined by the local agency to be politically and
               economically feasible.
               The Orange County League of Cities has provided each Orange
               County city its fair share trip reduction goal. The City of Tustin has
               been recently recognized as having met 122% of its allocated vehicle
               trip reduction goal. Therefore, it is currently assumed that the City
               will not need to adopt any additional Transportation Control
               Measures to comply with the 1997 AQMP. In addition, the City
               closely monitors air quality matters with the intent of complying with
               future revisions of the AQMP. Therefore, the mitigation measures and
               policies identified within this document or other measures acceptable
               to the AQMD will be implemented by the City who will have the
               discretion to select those transportation control measures that are

       INTRODUCTION TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
The urban environment contains many natural and man-made hazards which
require special consideration and treatment in the land use planning process. The
purpose of the Public Safety Element is to identify these hazards and to establish
appropriate policy to minimize the exposure of Tustin residents to such hazards. An
emphasis is placed on tying land use decisions to public safety concerns. The Public
Safety Element also stresses the importance of emergency preparedness in reducing
community disruption in the event of a disaster.
PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
               The purpose of the Public Safety Element is to identify and address
               those natural or man-made characteristics which exist in or near the
               City which represent a potential danger to the safety of the citizens,
               sites, structures, public facilities, and infrastructure. The Element
               establishes policies to minimize the danger to residents, workers, and
               visitors; and identifies actions needed to deal with crisis situations.
               The manner in which emergency response agencies cooperate with
               one another and with other jurisdictions is a key component of the
               element.
               Issues Overview
               The Public Safety Element is a State-mandated component of a
               General Plan. Government Code section 65302(g) sets forth a list of
               hazards or public safety issues that the Element must cover if they
               pertain to the City. For the City of Tustin, the applicable hazards are:
               o       Flooding;
               o       Seismically induced conditions, including surface rupture,
                       ground shaking, ground failure, and seiche;
               o       Slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
               o       Subsidence and other geologic hazards;

GENERAL PLAN                                1                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               o      Wildland/urban interface fires; and
               o      Evacuation routes.
               State law also permits cities to add safety issues to this list and to
               delete issues which are not pertinent. Potential safety issues were
               researched and documented for preparation of the Public Safety
               Technical Memorandum that was completed as a background
               document for the General Plan. The following public safety issues
               were added to those mentioned above:
               o      Hazardous materials;
               o      Law enforcement; and
               o      Aircraft overflights.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               The Public Safety Element issues relate closely to certain issues
               discussed in the Land Use and Conservation/Open Space/ Recreation
               Elements of the General Plan. Tustin is updating its Emergency
               Preparedness Plan that addresses several hazard areas including
               seismic, flooding, and hazardous materials. This Emergency
               Preparedness Plan will be reviewed by State and Federal agencies
               which have their own roles in the event of an emergency, including
               the Federal Department of Homeland Security and the State Office of
               Emergency Services (OES).
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               This Element is composed of three major sections: Summary of Public
               Safety Issues, Needs, Opportunities, and Constraints; Public Safety
               Goals and Policies; and The Public Safety Plan. The Public Safety
               Issues, Needs, Opportunities, and Constraints section establishes the
               basis for formulation and expression of the City goals and policies
               related to public safety. The Public Safety Goals and Policies section
               establishes public safety objectives and a decision-making framework
               for City leaders in evaluating issues for their safety impact. The Public

               Safety Plan provides more detailed approaches to hazard mitigation
               and ensures adequate emergency response to identified hazards.
               The Public Safety Plan is based upon the Element's goals and policies,
               and relies on the detailed description of local hazards from the Public
               Safety Technical Memorandum.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
               As one element of the General Plan, the Public Safety Element must be
               consistent with other General Plan Elements. All elements of the Plan
               are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals and policies of each
               element may also address issues that are the primary subjects of other
               elements. The Public Safety Element relates most closely to the
               Circulation and Noise Elements. The Circulation Element relates to
               the Public Safety Element by establishing safe road widths,
               accessibility standards for firefighting equipment, and emergency
               evacuation routes. The Noise Element relates to the Public Safety
               Element by establishing standards for safe levels of noise.
               The other Elements of the General Plan relate to the Public Safety
               Element by supporting the Public Safety Element. The Land Use and
               Conservation/Open Space/Recreation Elements address public safety
               issues by designating lands with unstable or hazardous
               characteristics, and the Housing Element promotes safe housing for
               City residents. Taken as a whole, all the elements contribute to the
               promotion of a safer environment for Tustin inhabitants.

           SUMMARY OF PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES, NEEDS,
                 OPPORTUNITIES, AND CONSTRAINTS
The Tustin Planning Area is affected by many issues, opportunities, and constraints
that affect public safety. The following section summarizes these and establishes a
basis for future goals and policies.
FLOODING
               
               o      The Planning Area contains creeks and washes which create
                      potential flooding problems.
               o      Some eastern parts of the City are subject to flooding in a 100-
                      year storm, and most of the southern and eastern areas of
                      Tustin Legacy are subject to flooding in a 500-year storm;
                      however, no significant flooding has occurred in the last
                      decade.
               o      The City has applied to the Federal Emergency Management
                      Agency for modification of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
                      where needed to reflect flood improvements as they are made
                      in the City.
               o      The Santiago and Villa Park Reservoirs could inundate parts of
                      the Planning Area if their dams failed.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
               
               o      The Tustin Planning Area lies within a seismically active
                      region.
               o      No known active or suspected potentially active faults exist
                      within the Planning Area. The El Modena fault passes through
                      the Planning Area's northern section; however, studies have
                      not been conclusive about the active/inactive status of this
                      fault.

               o Several major faults lie within 10 to 45 miles of the Planning
                 Area.
               o Potential hazards include ground shaking, liquefaction,
                 unreinforced masonry structural hazards, and tilt-up concrete
                 buildings constructed prior to 1974.
HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC 7 MATERIALS
               
               o Risks to individuals and the community would occur in the
                 event of accidental release or combustion of hazardous
                 materials.
               o High pressure pipelines which carry petroleum and fuels pass
                 through the City.
FIRE
               
               o The Tustin Planning Area is subject to both urban and
                 wildland fire hazards which result from a number of causes,
                 including arson, carelessness, home or industrial accidents, or
                 from ignorance of proper procedures for home or business
                 repairs.
               o The northeast part of the Planning Area is most susceptible to
                 wildland fires while the southwest area is most susceptible to
                 urban fires.
               o Low water pressure affects the Old Town and Cowan Heights
                 areas.
CRIME/LAW ENFORCEMENT
               
               o Efforts have been focused on keeping crime activity to a
                 minimum.

               discourage commercial or general aviation activities which increase
               noise exposure or general safety risks to Tustin residents.
EMERGENCY PLANNING/DISASTER RESPONSE
               Proper preparation for major emergencies is necessary to minimize
               disruption, personal injury, and property damage. Preventive
               measures taken before an emergency occurs can hasten recovery from
               such incidents.
               GOAL 8: Improve the City's ability to respond to natural and man-
               made emergencies.

               preparedness and disaster response; distribute information about
               emergency planning to community groups, schools, churches, and
               business associations; and hold emergency drills in various parts of
               Tustin to test the effectiveness of emergency preparedness plans.
               Policy 8.4: Maintain a high level of multi-jurisdictional cooperation
               and communication for emergency planning and management and
               solicit participation from private sector sources (i.e., ham radio,
               cellular telephone, etc.) to enhance local communication and response
               capability.
               GOAL 9: Reduce the amount of personal injury, damage to
               property, and economic or social dislocation as the result of disaster.
               Policy 9.1: Existing vital facilities not designed to be disaster-resistant
               should be examined, and hazardous conditions should be fully

RELATED GOALS AND POLICIES
               Goals and policies contained in the other Elements are also important
               in addressing public safety issues. The Land Use Element ensures
               incompatible uses are located away from each other. The Housing
               Element also contains policies that underscore the importance of
               ensuring that housing is both safe and decent. The Circulation
               Element relates to this element by establishing safe road widths,
               accessibility standards, and emergency routes. The Noise Element
               relates to this element by establishing standards for safe noise levels.
               A number of goals and policies contained in the Conservation/Open
               Space/Recreation Element are concerned with development
               restrictions in areas subject to environmental constraints that might
               affect both persons and property. Other Elements containing policies
               that serve to support the aims expressed in this Element are identified
               in Table PS-1.

                           THE PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN
The Public Safety Plan describes the approach to be used in implementing the Public
Safety Element goals and policies. The goals and policies of the Element provide
direction for specific actions by the City. How Tustin achieves those goals and
implements those policies is determined by programs, actions, and cooperative
efforts sponsored or participated in by the City.
FLOODING
               As indicated in the Summary of Issues, Needs, Opportunities, and
               Constraints, flooding can potentially occur throughout the Planning
               Area. The Planning Area contains many creeks and washes; however,
               few parts of the Planning Area have been identified as areas within a
               100-year storm flood area. Areas that have been so designated have
               not flooded within the last 10 years and are less susceptible to
               flooding due to more recent storm drain and flood control
               improvements.
               As new development occurs, the City has and will continue to
               improve or require the improvement of flood control facilities. These
               flood control improvements will be coordinated with Circulation
               Element roadway construction projects to ensure that major
               thoroughfares in the City are useable during 100-year storm
               conditions. Improvement of the Peters Canyon Channel so that runoff
               from a 100-year storm could be carried represented an important
               flood control project requiring the joint efforts of the City and the
               Orange County Flood Control District. Flood control will also be
               improved through the use of detention basins in appropriate areas.
               Future development in areas near public water storage reservoirs will
               be designed so that any damage that might result from leaks or
               ruptures to storage facilities is minimized. Additionally, the City has
               applied to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for revision of
               the Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
               The risk of flooding resulting from dam breaches or failures will be
               reduced by working directly with the State Office of Emergency
               Services to make physical improvements (if necessary) and monitor
               the safety of the Santiago and Villa Park Reservoirs. The potential for
               loss of life associated with dam breaches or failures will be reduced by
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                   PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                17                        NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               periodically disseminating information describing emergency
               preparedness methods and procedures useful to City inhabitants.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
               Groundshaking, liquefaction, unreinforced masonry structures, and
               older tilt-up concrete structures represent the main seismic dangers
               within the Planning Area. The City requires the retrofitting of
               unreinforced masonry structures. The City also anticipates
               inventorying tilt-up concrete structures built prior to 1974. When the
               inventory is complete, the City will encourage the owners of such
               structures to retrofit them.
               Since the primary seismic danger in Tustin is groundshaking, the City
               cannot directly mitigate this hazard. Earthquakes and groundshaking
               in Southern California are unavoidable. However, the City will
               require that housing and other structures be designed to be as shock
               resistant as possible or feasible. Of particular importance are those
               structures designed for human occupancy, critical service structures,
               and vital emergency facilities which are essential during periods of
               emergency. Earthquake awareness programs will be periodically
               promoted by the City stressing individual preparedness and
               understanding of community-wide procedures.
               The City will require geologic investigations for all development.
               Means of siting or constructing a building which will render it more
               resistant to groundshaking will be balanced against competing City
               goals, and will be encouraged or required if necessary for public
               safety. Development within areas shown to be unsafe in light of the
               geologic investigation will be restricted and mitigated to ensure
               reasonable safety. Should structural deficiencies of critical public
               facilities such as bridges and overpasses be identified, the City will
               work directly with Caltrans, the County of Orange, the
               SCRRA/OCTA (Metrolink) Railroad, and other responsible agencies
               to correct such deficiencies.

HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC MATERIALS
               Hazardous and toxic materials which would present the greatest
               threat in Tustin include those transported through the Planning Area,
               either on the freeways or railroads, or in the pipelines travelling
               underground. With recommendations from other responsible
               agencies, the City will identify specific transportation routes and
               procedures for conveying hazardous materials to minimize risk to
               inhabitants.
               The main regulatory means of controlling hazardous materials are
               City regulations governing the siting of and conditions imposed upon
               facilities which handle hazardous materials. The County Hazardous
               Waste Management Plan is a document which will also contribute to
               the control of such facilities. The County prepared the Plan which was
               approved by the State on October 30, 1991. Subsequently, the City
               adopted their final Hazardous Waste Facilities Ordinance. The City
               has also adopted a Household Hazardous Waste Element which
               includes educational programs that inform the public of their
               responsibilities and appropriate techniques to protect the
               environment, such as recycling and source reduction.
               State law requires cities to: 1) adopt a plan or 2) refer to County Plan
               in the City's General Plan, or 3) enact an ordinance to prepare plans
               and policies for regulating hazardous wastes, including siting and
               planning for hazardous waste facilities. The City through their
               Hazardous Waste Facilities Ordinance has established siting criteria
               for hazardous waste treatment, transfer, and disposal sites. The
               criteria will be used to review all proposals for such facilities within
               Tustin. A general description of the City's siting factors, objectives,
               and criteria is presented in Table PS-2.
               Management of hazardous materials will include the establishment of
               safe distances separating land uses that produce, store, transport,
               handle, or dispose of such materials from other uses. The City also
               supports the efforts of other agencies responsible for regulating the
               use of hazardous materials. In particular, the County of Orange will
               be supported in its efforts to implement the National Pollution
               Discharge Elimination System Permits (NPDES) regulations.

MCAS TUSTIN CLEANUP PLAN
               Like most military facilities, MCAS Tustin was a user of hazardous
               materials and there have been many documented leaks and spills
               since base commissioning in 1942. In 1980, Congress passed the
               Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
               Liability Act (CERCLA) which required the Department of Defense
               (the Department of Navy assumes this role for MCAS Tustin) to begin
               work to identify, investigate, and clean-up hazardous waste disposal
               sites and areas of potential contamination at military bases.
               The military created a team to organize and implement a Base Closure
               and Realignment Act Base Cleanup Plan (BCP). The purpose of the
               BCP is to summarize the status of current environmental restoration
               and associated environmental compliance programs in support of
               base closure and to provide a strategy for integrating all ongoing site
               activities in a comprehensive and efficient manner that protects
               human health and the environment.
               The BCP will integrate and coordinate activities under the Installation
               Restoration Program (IRP), the Resource Conservation and Recovery
               Act (RCRA), and other compliance programs which are ongoing at the
               closed base.
               The Program will identify all sites of potential contamination,
               investigate those with the potential to affect human health and the
               environment, and remediate all sites as necessary to meet applicable
               federal, state, and local standards.

FIRE HAZARDS
               Two main problems contribute to fire hazards in Tustin, low water
               pressure and large areas of dry vegetation. The primary program to
               improve fire protection will be to upgrade water lines in areas where
               pressure is deficient. Acceptable water pressure and fire department
               response time standards are shown in Table PS-3.
               Fire protection will also be improved by establishing and maintaining
               mutual aid agreements with surrounding jurisdictions. A primary
               means of improving fire prevention will be the requirement of
               construction materials that are either specifically fire resistant or of
               low fuel value.
               Education also plays an important role in fire safety. Particularly in
               wildland interface areas, people must be made aware of the fire
               danger in natural and open space areas, particularly in the fire season.
               Education programs will be sponsored in cooperation with the local
               fire department.
CRIME/LAW ENFORCEMENT
               As urban development progresses through Orange County, parts of
               Tustin become more susceptible to crime. Efforts to reduce crime have
               met with some success. Even though crime has increased, a higher
               percentage of reported crimes are now resulting in arrest. Reducing
               crime effectively is a time and labor intensive effort. The City will do
               everything possible to increase service levels and acquire funding to
               do so. Table PS-3 shows Police Department standards for responding
               to calls.
               Public awareness is also vital in the fight against crime. The City will
               encourage an activated citizenry to "take ownership" of their streets,
               report crimes, and be a visible presence. One such program is
               Neighborhood Watch and community oriented policing. The City will
               also work with the citizens in creating a force of volunteers. Such a
               program has been proven effective in some other Southern California
               cities.

                               Non-emergency calls:        13 minutes
               Another method that the City can use in the fight against crime is to
               ensure that new construction is designed in a way that discourages
               gang activity and other aggressive lawless behavior. Some examples
               of "protective architecture" or defensible space are well lit entryways,
               lack of convenient hiding places, entryways which are easily seen
               from the street, and other similar concepts.
AIRCRAFT OVERFLIGHT HAZARDS
               Large parts of Tustin's residential areas lie underneath the flightpath
               of John Wayne Airport. While the City's power to limit the operational
               activities of these facilities is extremely limited, the City can
               participate in land use control within the flight paths and the
               legislative process which regulates civilian and military air
               operations. This includes coordinating land use planning and
               emergency preparedness planning with the Airport Land Use
               Commission for Orange County and John Wayne Airport.
               Flight operations involving blimps may occur as an interim use at
               former MCAS Tustin. The MCAS Tustin Specific Plan also allows
               heliports as a conditional use. The Airport Environs Land Use Plan
               (AELUP) for Heliports and the AELUP for John Wayne Airport
               should be consulted to address specific noise and safety factors
               associated with blimp and helicopter flights.

               The City should ensure that each applicant seeking a Conditional Use
               Permit or similar approval for the construction or operation of a
               heliport or helistop complies fully with the State permit procedure
               provided by law and with all conditions of approval imposed by the
               Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), by the Airport Land Use
               Commission for Orange County (ALUC), and by Caltrans/Division of
               Aeronautics. The City will comply with the AELUP for Heliports in
               the development and permitting of new heliports.
               All development proposals affected by the airport land use
               commission consistency criteria are referred to the Airport Land Use
               Commission (ALUC). The ALUC reviews areas within the 60 dB
               CNEL contour, areas within the Safety Compatibility Zones, areas
               with Building Height restrictions, or within specified distances from
               runway surfaces. As with most controversial safety related topics, the
               involvement of citizens is of great importance. The City will
               encourage and notify residents of opportunities to become involved in
               airport related issues.
AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES AND COORDINATION
               The City contracts with the Orange County Fire Authority for Fire and
               Paramedic Services. Other agencies which have jurisdiction or which
               provide public safety services within Tustin include the California
               Highway Patrol, and the Orange County Health Department. The City
               coordinates with these agencies to provide the highest level of public
               safety services.
               The City will continue to work with these agencies to ensure adequate
               service. Plans for proposed developments, including City projects,
               will be sent to appropriate agencies for their review and comment.
               This will occur whether or not an environmental impact report is
               prepared. An integral part of the updated Emergency Operations Plan
               will be the explanation of the appropriate responses and
               responsibilities of individual agencies and the interagency
               coordination required to implement emergency procedures.
               The Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project (SCEPP) is
               a State and federally-funded effort to encourage local jurisdictions to
               prepare for catastrophic earthquakes that may occur in Southern

               California. SCEPP recommendations have also been approved by the
               Orange County Board of Supervisors. SCEPP works directly with
               local governments, private industry, and volunteer groups in a
               cooperative planning effort. It addresses the full range of earthquake
               strategies, including mitigation (long term response), prediction (short
               term response), emergency actions, and recovery.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION
               This section of the Public Safety Element discusses emergency
               preparedness planning needed to respond to major disasters. With
               Tustin's updated Emergency Operations Plan, the reader or user of
               this Element is able to review that document in conjunction with the
               material contained here. The Emergency Operations Plan is meant to
               be a preparedness document, designed to be read before a disaster,
               not in response to one.
               Each city must have a plan for response to emergency and disaster
               situations. The City of Tustin currently has an Emergency Operations
               Plan. The plan establishes response procedures for peace and wartime
               disasters. The Plan conforms to the provisions of the California
               Emergency Preparedness Plan and Emergency Resources
               Management Plan which apply to city governments. The Plan will be
               adopted in 1997 to comply with state law and the standard emergency
               management system (SEMS).
               Emergency Evacuation
               The City's Emergency Operations Plan identifies routes through the
               City which are suitable for use as evacuation routes. The extent and
               severity of a disaster will determine which routes and which
               directions people may take in order to escape the afflicted areas.
               Figure PS-1 shows the City's emergency evacuation routes.
               Emergency Response Personnel
               First response will be provided by the City Police Department,
               County Fire Authority and Public Works Department who bear most

               of the responsibility for providing emergency services. In addition to
               the above agencies, in the event of a major disaster, other City,
               County, and State personnel assume local emergency response roles.
               The updated Emergency Operations Plan details these roles and
               responsibilities. Table PS-4 shows which agencies are responsible for
               various tasks in emergency situations and Table PS-5 shows the City’s
               emergency operation center organization.
               Emergency Shelters
               In the event of either a natural or man-made disaster, homes may be
               destroyed or be inaccessible for extended periods of time. Area
               residents will need some form of temporary shelter. The American
               Red Cross bears primary responsibility for providing emergency
               shelter to displaced residents. The Red Cross maintains an inventory
               of sites suitable for use as emergency shelters. The site or sites used in
               a particular emergency depend upon the scope and scale of the
               emergency and the length of time required to shelter the refugees.
               Sites most frequently used for shelter are schools, senior centers,
               community centers, public buildings, and churches. In the event of a
               disaster, the City will activate their Care and Shelter operations and
               provide food, clothing, shelter and other basic necessities of life, and
               continue to cooperate with the Red Cross to make City owned
               facilities available as emergency shelters.

CITY OF TUSTIN    PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN   31      NOVEMBER 20, 2012
   PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
The Public Safety Element Implementation Program provides a guide to the
community, City staff, and City officials in daily decision-making by suggesting
methods to implement adopted policy. Implementation measures for this Element
are intended to address natural and man-made conditions which represent potential
dangers or safety hazards to the City's properties and inhabitants. The
Implementation Program is a series of actions, procedures, and techniques that are
designed to apply the overall policy direction contained in the Element. By
incorporating the Implementation Program with the General Plan, the City Council
recognizes the importance of long-range planning considerations in day-to-day
decision-making, subject to funding constraints.
CONTROL OF LAND USES
               1. Land Use Controls: Implement the following land use regulations
               to control development in areas that are subject to hazardous
               conditions.
               a.     Continue to regulate roofing materials in high potential fire
                      hazard areas to reduce fire impacts;
               b.     Recommend fuel modification plant materials in high potential
                      fire hazard areas;
               c.     Enforce provisions of the City's Grading Manual requiring
                      geological and/or engineering reports in areas where
                      geological hazard conditions may exist;
               d.     Enforce provisions of the City's Hazardous Waste Facilities
                      Ordinance to regulate and control the location and operation of
                      facilities and guarantee public participation through a public
                      hearing process;
               e.     Coordinate with the Airport Land Use Commission to protect
                      and prevent the construction of sensitive and residential land
                      uses under air traffic corridors in order to reduce the potential
                      accidents affecting highly populated areas; and

                      information.
               g.     Reduce public safety risks resulting from aircraft operations by
                      participating in and monitoring the planning process for John
                      Wayne Airport by continuing to monitor proposed activities,

                   INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
The control of noise is an essential part of preserving the quality of a community.
The development of effective strategies to reduce excessive noise in the community
resulting from mobile sources such as traffic, aircraft, rail, and stationary sources,
such as construction activity, music and air conditioners is essential to creating a
safe and compatible living and working environment. Since 1971, the noise element
has been mandatory in a California general plan. Due to California's rapid growth,
a noise element is required by the state to enable communities to limit exposure to
excessive noise levels. The Noise Element Technical Memorandum provides the
necessary background information and supporting documentation for this element.
PURPOSE OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
               The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive approach for
               including noise control in the planning process. It is a tool for
               achieving and maintaining environmental noise levels compatible
               with land use. The Noise Element identifies noise sensitive land uses
               and noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact. The element
               establishes goals, policies, and programs to ensure that Tustin
               residents will be protected from excessive noise.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
              There are several existing plans and programs that are directly
              applicable to the aims and objectives of this Element. These plans and
              programs have been enacted through State and local legislation and
              are administered by agencies that are delegated with powers to en-
              force State and local laws.
              California Environmental Quality Act Law and Guidelines
              The State legislature adopted the California Environmental Quality
              Act (CEQA) in response to a public mandate that called for a thorough
              environmental analysis of those projects that might adversely affect
              the environment. The CEQA law and guidelines describe the
              provisions of the law, the review procedure, and any subsequent
              analysis that is required. CEQA recognizes that excessive noise
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                          NOISE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               1                          NOVEMBER 20, 2012
              associated with certain types of public and private projects represents
              an environmental impact that must be avoided or reduced. CEQA
              will continue to be instrumental in ensuring that City officials and the
              general public assess the potentially significant noise impacts of
              development projects.
              California Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24)
              The California Commission of Housing and Community Development
              officially adopted the noise insulation standards in 1974 and they
              became effective on August 22, 1974. On November 14, 1988, the
              Building Standards Commission approved revisions to these
              standards (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). The
              revisions state that "Interior noise levels attributable to exterior
              sources shall not exceed 45 dB in any habitable room. The noise
              metric shall be either . . . Ldn or . . . CNEL, consistent with the noise
              element of the local general plan." Additionally, the commission
              specifies that residential buildings or structures to be located within
              exterior CNEL (or Ldn) contours of 60 dB or greater of an existing or
              adopted freeway, expressway, parkway, major street, thoroughfare,
              rail line, rapid transit line, or industrial noise source shall require an
              acoustical analysis showing that the building has been designed to
              limit intruding noise to an interior CNEL (or Ldn) of 45 dB.
              City of Tustin Noise Ordinance/Conditions of Approval
              The City's noise ordinance, permitted by the State of California Health
              and Safety Code, provides a basis for controlling excessive and
              annoying noise from stationary sources such as construction activity,
              industrial plants, pumps, compressors, refrigeration units, etc. The
              ordinance provides specific noise standards to be applied for various
              land uses for both daytime and nighttime hours, prohibits certain
              noise sources, and describes the manner in which the noise standards
              are to be enforced.
              Where applicable, the City routinely applies several noise-related
              conditions of approval to a development before issuing building
              permits. These conditions identify the proposed project as located in a
              noise impact area and require that mitigation be provided as
              necessary to ensure compliance with the City's noise exposure
              standards.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                            NOISE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                 2                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
              The Noise Element follows the State guidelines prepared by the Office
              of Noise Control, State Department of Health as a result of Senate Bill
              860(A) (effective January 1, 1976). The element quantifies the
              community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for
              both near- and long-term levels of growth and noise-generating
              activity. The information is a guideline for the development of goals
              and policies to achieve noise compatible land uses. In addition to the
              Introduction, the Element is divided into four sections: Summary of
              Issues, Needs, Opportunities, and Constraints; Goals and Policies; the
              Noise Plan, and the Implementation Program.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
              The Tustin General Plan consists of seven different elements. All of
              the elements – Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation/Open –
              are related to the Noise Element.
              When integrated with the Noise Element, the Land Use Element will
              show land uses in relation to existing and projected noise contours. In
              this way, compatible and incompatible land uses may be identified.
              The Noise Element relates to the Circulation Element since the
              circulation system is the primary source of noise throughout the
              planning area. Noise exposure will be a factor in the location and
              design of new arterials, and the mitigation of noise from existing
              arterials in relation to existing and planned land uses.
              Since residential land use is noise sensitive, the information provided
              in the Noise Element will need to be considered in the planning of
              future housing developments, as discussed in the Housing Element.
              The Noise Element also relates to the Open Space/Conservation/
              Recreation Element since excessive noise can have a detrimental
              impact on the enjoyment of open spaces. Therefore, the information
              provided in the Noise Element needs to be considered in planning for
              this type of land use. In addition, open space areas can be used as a
              buffer to mitigate noise levels at more noise-sensitive residential areas.
              Excessive noise can also be detrimental to a person's health or cause
              hearing loss over long periods of time. Therefore, the Noise Element
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                           NOISE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                3                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012

              will need to be considered in the Public Safety Element when
              assessing occupational environments, and the noise exposure levels at
              noise-sensitive areas (residential, parks, schools, libraries, and
              hospitals).
              Finally, growth within the planning area will result in increased
              housing, increased use of the circulation system and increased noise
              levels. The Noise Element will need to be considered in the Growth
              Management Element when planning future developments.

      SUMMARY OF ISSUES, NEEDS, OPPORTUNITIES AND
                                CONSTRAINTS
This section summarizes the noise-related issues, needs, opportunities, and
constraints for the Tustin Planning Area. These will form the basis for the Noise
Element goals and policies.
TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
               o     The City of Tustin can exercise little control over flight opera-
                     tions at John Wayne Airport.
               o     Noise from John Wayne Airport, while generally below
                     accepted CNEL guidelines for residential uses, produces
                     annoyance among Tustin residents due to repetitive oc-
                     currence.
               o     The activities and opportunities at John Wayne Airport should
                     be monitored as needed to protect the planning area from un-
                     wanted aircraft noise.
               o     Citizen involvement in committees that will influence future
                     aircraft operations at John Wayne Airport needs to be encour-
                     aged.
               o     Outside agencies exercise responsibility for noise associated
                     with the freeways and railroads.
               o     Many residential neighborhoods are located next to heavily
                     traveled arterials, some of which are exposed to "unacceptable"
                     ambient noise levels as defined by the State Office of Noise
                     Control.
               o     The Tustin Planning Area is bisected by two major freeway
                     corridors - the I-5 and SR-55 - resulting in significant traffic
                     noise levels.
               o     Increases in traffic volumes will increase noise levels
                     throughout Tustin.

GENERAL PLAN                               5                         NOVEMBER 20, 2012
               o Noise from train movements and whistles on the Southern
                 California Rail Authority (SCRRA) rail line significantly affects
                 nearby residences.
NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING INTEGRATION
               o Availability of manpower and expertise needed to perform
                 noise measurements and to identify noise control measures in
                 the enforcement of city, state and federal laws is limited.
               o Noise control measures and noise-related compatibility
                 considerations need to be included in all new land use
                 developments.
               o Enforcement of city, state and federal requirements regarding
                 noise control is necessary, specifically: The City's noise ordi-
                 nance regarding intrusive noise, the state vehicle code and
                 provisions regarding mufflers and excessively loud radios, the
                 state noise insulation standards for multifamily developments,
                 and the federal and state requirements regarding noise control
                 in work places.
               o Many commercial and residential uses in Tustin are located
                 near one another, creating potential noise conflicts between
                 these uses.
               o Trucking operations and mechanical equipment associated
                 with commercial/industrial activities impact nearby resi-
                 dences.
               o The introduction of mixed-use zones that integrate residences
                 above ground floor commercial uses presents potential noise
                 conflicts from both traffic noise generated from the frontage
                 street and noise generated from ground floor commercial
                 activity.

              
               o The noise impact of construction activity adversely affects
                 residences when carried on for long periods of time, and on the
                 weekends and in the evenings.
               o As in most urban settings, Tustin's residents are subject to
                 noise from nuisances such as lawn mowers, leaf blowers,
                 radios, parties and sporting events.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                          7                        NOVEMBER 20, 2012

               NOISE ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
A substantial portion of the City is affected by various sources of noise. The
following goals and policies are intended to address identified noise issues in the
community.
TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
              Transportation-related activities are primary sources of noise affecting
              the quality of life in Tustin. Effective reduction of noise associated
              with transportation is necessary to ensure protection from the
              detrimental effects of excessive noise.
              GOAL 1: Use noise control measures to reduce the impact from
              transportation noise sources.
              Policy 1.1: Pursue construction of new barriers, or the augmentation
              of existing barriers, to reduce noise impacts along the Route 5 and
              Route 55 freeways along segments directly next to residential areas.
              Policy 1.2:   Intentionally omitted
              Policy 1.3: Encourage John Wayne Airport to set up noise control
              procedures and to consider methods to reduce and minimize noise
              exposure due to aircraft flyovers within the Tustin Planning Area.
              Policy 1.4: Continue to monitor all John Wayne Airport activities to
              minimize noise impacts within the Tustin Planning Area resulting
              from airport operations, and oppose legislation promulgated by the
              FAA that could eliminate local flight restrictions.
              Policy 1.5: Work to reduce risks and noise impacts resulting from
              aircraft operations by (a) participating in and monitoring the planning
              process for John Wayne Airport and (b)continuing to discourage
              commercial or general aviation activities which increase noise
              exposure.

              operations in Orange County.
              Policy 1.7: Encourage construction of noise barriers by the Public
              Utilities Commission, Southern California Regional Rail Authority,
              Amtrak, and Orange County Transportation Authority along the
              Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe rail line where residences exist next to
              the tracks.
              Policy 1.8: Encourage the Public Utilities Commission, Southern
              California Regional Rail Authority, Amtrak, and the Orange County
              Transportation Authority to minimize the level of noise produced by
              train movements and whistle noise within the Planning Area by
              reducing speeds, improving vehicle system technology and develop-
              ing improved procedures for train engineer whistle blowing.
              Policy 1.9: Encourage, where feasible, noise mitigation measures,
              such as noise barriers and realignments, in the design and
              construction of new roadway projects in the Tustin Planning Area.
              Policy 1.10: Enforce the State's Vehicle Code noise standards within
              the City.
              Policy 1.11: Consider noise impacts to residential neighborhoods
              when designating truck routes and major circulation corridors.
              Policy 1.12: Work with the Orange County Transportation Agency to
              establish bus routes that meet public transportation needs and
              minimize noise impacts in residential areas.
NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING INTEGRATION
              Consideration of the effects of noise early in the land use planning
              process can minimize or avoid detrimental impacts.
              GOAL 2: Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning
              decisions.
              Policy 2.1: Adopt planning guidelines that establish acceptable noise
              standards for various land uses throughout the Tustin Planning Area.

              Policy 2.2: Apply the state's noise insulation standards to the conver-
              sion of existing apartments into condominiums wherever feasible.
              Policy 2.3: Use noise/land use compatibility standards as a guide for
              future planning and development.
              Policy 2.4: Review proposed projects in terms of compatibility with
              nearby noise-sensitive land uses with the intent of reducing noise
              impacts.
              Policy 2.5: Require new residential developments located in proximity
              to existing commercial/industrial operations to control residential
              interior noise levels as a condition of approval.
              Policy 2.6: Require that commercial uses developed as part of a
              mixed-use project (with residential) not be noise intensive. Design
              mixed-use structures to prevent transfer of noise from the commercial
              to the residential use.
              Policy 2.7: Require new commercial/industrial operations located in
              proximity to existing or proposed residential areas to incorporate
              noise mitigation into project design.
              Policy 2.8: Replace a significant noise source with non-noise
              generating land uses when plans for future use of areas are developed.
NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
              Sources of noise that are not related to transportation can be controlled
              to avoid exposure to excessive noise levels.
              GOAL 3: Develop measures to control non-transportation noise
              impacts.
              Policy 3.1: Implement a review process of Tustin's noise ordinance,
              and City policies and regulations affecting noise.
              Policy 3.2: Minimize the impacts of construction noise on adjacent
              land uses through limiting the permitted hours of activity.

                Policy 3.3: Require City departments to observe state and federal
                occupational safety and health noise standards.
                Policy 3.4: Require new equipment and vehicles purchased by the
                City to comply with noise performance standards consistent with
                available noise reduction technology.
RELATED GOALS AND POLICIES
                Goals and policies of the other General Plan Elements also relate to
                issues addressed in the Noise Element. To ensure internal
                consistency, Table N-1 lists each element, noise issues, and the goals

                                THE NOISE PLAN
To achieve the goals and objectives of the Noise Element, an effective Noise Plan
implementation program developed within the constraints of the City's financial
and staffing capabilities is necessary. The purpose is to reduce the number of
people exposed to excessive noise and to minimize the future effect of noise in the
City.
COMMUNITY NOISE CONTOURS
              The noise environment for the Tustin Planning Area can be described
              using noise contours developed for the major noise sources within the
              area. Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure. Figure
              N-1 presents the noise contours for the Tustin Planning Area for Land
              Use Policy Map buildout conditions. The contours shown on the
              maps range from a CNEL of 60 dB to 80 dB for aircraft, train, and
              traffic noise. Full size exhibits (scale: 1"=800') are available for in-
              spection at the Community Development Department.
              The noise contours for the Tustin Planning Area were developed
              based upon existing and future traffic conditions, train operations and
              environmental conditions. The assumptions and methods used to
              develop the contours are explained in detail in the Technical Memo-
              randum.
              Noise Impact Areas
              The noise contours are used as a guide for planning. The 60 dB CNEL
              contour defines the noise impact area. Any proposed new noise
              sensitive land use (i.e., residential, hospitals, schools and churches)
              within this area shall be evaluated on a project specific basis to meet
              City or State (Title 24) standards. An acoustical analysis prepared by a
              qualified acoustical engineer, should be required in these Noise
              Impact Areas for all noise sensitive land uses verifying that the
              structure has been designed or mitigation measures proposed to limit
              intruding noise to the prescribed allowable levels.

       Areas of Special Concern
              Areas of special concern within the Noise Impact Area are near the I-5
              and SR-55 freeways. At these locations the existing CNEL ranges from
              70 to 80dB. Caltrans constructed soundwalls along these freeways as
              part of the freeway widening projects. These walls reduce the CNEL
              at the adjacent residences.
              Residences next to a number of major and secondary arterials in the
              Tustin Planning Area are also exposed to a CNEL over 65 dB. These
              arterials include:
                Bryan Avenue                 Edinger Street
                Fairhaven Avenue             Irvine Boulevard
                Newport Avenue               Red Hill Avenue
                Yorba Street                 Prospect Avenue
                Browning Avenue              17th Street

                Walnut Avenue                Sycamore Avenue
               Measurements have shown that residences located next to the
               Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) rail line are
               were exposed to a CNEL of about 70 dB and maximum noise levels of
               78 dB(A). By the year 2010, the CNEL at the adjacent residences will
               increase by as much as 6 dB due to increased rail activity related to
               commuter rail activities along the SCRRA/OCTA railway (Metrolink).
                The primary source of annoyance at these locations will be afternoon
               and early morning peak hour train passes.
LAND USE COMPATIBILITY GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS
               Table N-2 provides guidance for the acceptability of certain develop-
               ment projects within specific CNEL contours and will act as a set of
               criteria for assessing the compatibility of proposed land uses within
               the noise environment.
               Land Use Compatibility Guidelines are the basis for development of
               the specific noise standards presented in table N-3 which should be
               utilized as city policy related to new land uses and acceptable noise
               levels development.

               For the City to achieve noise and land use compatibility it is impera-
               tive that mitigation measures be imposed during site planning to
               mitigate anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive land
               uses. The submittal of an acoustical analysis report in noise impact
               levels is one mechanism to evaluate proposed projects. The
               incorporation of mitigation measures as described in this Noise Plan
               and other action may enable a project to comply with exterior and
               interior noise compatibility guidelines and standards.
               Construction Standards
               The provisions of the State of California Noise Insulation Standards
               (California Administrative Code, Title 24) specifying that the indoor
               noise levels for multifamily residential living spaces shall not exceed
               45 dB CNEL (or Ldn) due to the combined effect of all noise sources
               will be enforced. The State requires implementation of this standard
               when the outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB CNEL (or Ldn). The
               noise contour maps can be used to decide when this standard needs to
               be addressed. The code requires that this standard be applied to all
               new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings, other than
               detached single family dwellings. The City will also, as a matter of
               policy, apply this standard to new single family developments and
               condominium conversion projects where feasible.
               The noise levels presented in Table N-2 represent exterior noise levels.
               The primary purpose of the noise compatibility matrix is to identify
               potential conflicts between proposed land uses and the noise envi-
               ronment. The matrix is usually used at the General Plan or zoning
               level of approvals. If a project falls within Zone A or Zone B the
               project is considered compatible with the noise environment. Zone A
               implies that no mitigation will be needed. Zone B implies that minor
               soundproofing of the structure may be needed and should be
               engineered before issuance of building permits. Zone C shows that
               substantial noise mitigation will be necessary, such as construction of
               noise barriers and substantial building sound insulation. However,
               projects in Zone C can be successfully mitigated. The project may be
               approved for land use and then is mitigated as necessary to achieve
               City standards (Table N-3) before issuance of building permits or
               other appropriate milestones.

TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
               The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from trans-
               portation systems is to reduce noise at the source.
               However, since the City has little direct control over source noise
               levels because of state and federal preemption (i.e., State motor
               vehicle noise standards and Federal air regulations), programs should
               be focused on reducing the impact of the noise on the community.
               Cooperative efforts with state and federal offices are essential.
               Within the Tustin Planning Area are several transportation related
               noise sources including train tracks, two freeways, major arterials,
               collector roadways, and a commercial airport. Although MCAS
               Tustin closed in 1999, blimp flight operations may occur as an interim
               use. These sources are the major contributors of noise in Tustin. Cost
               effective strategies to reduce their influence on the community noise
               environment are an essential part of the Noise Element.

    INTERPRETATION
    ZONE A                            Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal
      CLEARLY COMPATIBLE              conventional construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
    ZONE B                            New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction
      NORMALLY COMPATIBLE             requirements are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional
                                      construction, with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
    ZONE C                            New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development
      NORMALLY INCOMPATIBLE does proceed, a detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise
                                      insulation features included in the design
    ZONE D                            New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

               Noise Barriers
               The most effective method for mitigating transportation noise is
               through reducing the impact of the noise onto the community by
               utilizing the site design review process and the California
               Environmental Quality Act. Mitigation through site planning,
               landscaping, as well as topography, and the design and construction
               of a noise barrier (wall, berms, or combination wall/berms) are the
               most common ways of alleviating traffic noise impacts in existing
               urban environments. Setbacks can also be used to provide partial
               mitigation or full mitigation where a small noise reduction is needed.
               Noise attenuating barriers are commonly incorporated into projects
               and can be extremely effective in reducing noise levels. The effective-
               ness of the barrier depends on the relative height and materials of the
               barrier, the noise source, the affected area, the horizontal distance
               between the source and the barrier, and between the barrier and the
               affected area. Although noise barriers can be extremely effective, their
               aesthetic effect on a neighborhood should be considered.
               Noise mitigation measures should be included in the design of
               roadway improvement projects consistent with funding capability.
               Efforts by the California Department of Transportation, the Orange
               County Transportation Agency and others to provide for acoustical
               protection of existing noise sensitive land uses affected by these
               projects will be supported by the City, and consideration of
               soundwalls will be requested to mitigate significant adverse impacts
               as part of any Caltrans and OCTA roadway projects. The Route 5 and
               55 freeways, and the proposed Eastern Transportation Corridor are
               primary candidate projects for the inclusion of barriers to reduce noise
               impact.
               The use of walls and berms in the design of new residential and other
               noise sensitive land uses that are next to major roads, rail lines,
               commercial, or industrial areas may be extremely helpful in
               mitigating noise impacts. The City will also encourage the reduction
               of train noise by requesting that the Southern California Regional Rail
               Authority, OCTA and Amtrak reduce speed and use welded track in
               good repair throughout the Planning Area.

               Noise Control At The Source
               The California Vehicle Code contains noise limits applicable to new
               vehicles at the time of manufacture and noise regulations pertaining
               to the operation of all vehicles on public roads.
               The City will provide for continued evaluation and enforcement of
               truck and bus movements and routes to minimize noise at the source
               for sensitive land uses. Regulation of traffic flow can also significantly
               minimize noise impacts. The State Motor Vehicle noise standards for
               cars, trucks, and motorcycles will be enforced through coordination
               with the California Highway Patrol and the Tustin Police.
               The City and its citizens will also participate in the planning process
               for John Wayne Airport. Any changes in operations or land uses
               within the facility that will increase noise exposures in the Planning
               Area will be opposed. The City will encourage implementation of
               procedures that will reduce noise levels in the area and will minimize
               the number of aircraft overflights.
NON-TRANSPORTATOIN NOISE CONTROL
               People, and noise sensitive areas, must be protected from excessive
               noise generated by non-transportation sources including commercial
               and industrial centers. These impacts are most effectively controlled
               through the environmental and site plan review process by imposition
               of mitigation measures and the application of a City Noise Ordinance.
               Typical Mitigation for Industrial and Commercial Uses
               Consideration should be given to the control of noise in new
               commercial and industrial developments when noise levels would
               otherwise be generated that would exceed the noise level for the
               district in which they are located and that would adversely affect
               nearby projects. The following mitigation measures could be applied
               when reviewing these new projects:
               o       Furnaces - Acoustically treat natural draft and/or forced draft
                       units and combustion air intake plena. Insulation of firing
                       walls and damped and lined ducting are but a few of the
                       treatments that could be considered.

               o Fans - Air cooled heat exchangers can be provided with
                 silencers where effective (i.e., primarily on small, high-speed
                 air fans). For larger coolers, quieter equipment can be
                 installed.
               o Motors - Quiet-design motors can be employed and located to
                 minimize impacts on nearby properties.
               o Centrifugal Compressors - Centrifugal compressors can be
                 equipped with inlet and discharge silencers. Acoustical
                 enclosures may also be considered.
               o Centrifugal Pumps - Centrifugal pumps may be equipped
                 with suction and discharge piping that has been acoustically
                 treated. Acoustical enclosures may be considered.
               o Steam and Gas Generators - Acoustical enclosures for turbines
                 may be effective in reducing noise. Inlet and discharge piping
                 may be acoustically treated and expansion joints added or
                 comparable attenuative modifications made to minimize
                 structure-borne vibrations.
               o Control Valves - Quiet valves should be used whenever avail-
                 able. In other circumstances, in-line silencers can be employed.
               o Atmospheric Vents, Exhaust and Intakes - Noisy vents should
                 be equipped with silencers. Where safety is not an overriding
                 concern, vents should be positioned close to the ground or
                 below grade.
               o Paging Systems - Loudspeaker paging systems shall be
                 regulated pursuant to the City's noise ordinance. Whenever
                 possible suitable alternatives such as radio or visual paging
                 systems should be utilized.
               o Delivery/Loading Areas - Limit delivery hours for stores with
                 loading areas or docks fronting, bordering, or gaining access in
                 driveways next to noise sensitive uses.

               Noise Ordinance
               The City's noise ordinance will be reviewed periodically for adequacy
               and changes implemented as needed to address the City's current
               needs. The noise ordinance will continue to be enforced to ensure that
               adjacent properties are not exposed to excessive noise levels from sta-
               tionary sources. The ordinance protects people from non-transpor-
               tation related noise sources such as music, construction activity,
               machinery and pumps, air conditioners, and truck traffic on private
               property. The Community Development Department will act as noise
               control coordinator. This will ensure the continued operation of noise
               enforcement efforts of the City.
               Application of the provisions of the Noise Ordinance will include: (a)
               requiring that any proposed development projects show compliance
               with the City's Noise Element and Ordinance; (b) requiring con-
               struction activity to comply with limits established in the City's Noise
               Ordinance; and (c) requiring all City departments to comply with the
               state and federal OSHA noise standards, and any new equipment or
               vehicle purchases to comply with city, state, and federal noise
               standards.

          NOISE ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
The City's Noise Element provides information that is important for maintaining
environmental noise levels that area compatible with existing and planned land
uses. The Element addresses three primary areas: noise from transportation
services, such as aircraft, freeways and major roadways; integration of information
about the existing and forecasted noise environment into land use planning
decisions; and noise from non-transportation sources such as commercial, industrial,
and construction activities.
The City Council, by incorporating the Implementation Program into the General
Plan, recognizes the importance of long-range planning considerations in day-to-

               1. Roadway Improvement Projects: The principal method of
               protecting sensitive land uses from traffic noise is the construction of
               noise barriers in concert with road improvement projects. The City
               will request, where necessary to mitigate identified adverse significant
               noise impacts, the inclusion of soundwalls, earthern berms, or other
               acoustical barriers as part of any Caltrans or OCTA roadway project.

               2. Rail Line Noise Control: The principal methods of protecting
               sensitive land uses from rail vehicle noise are the construction of noise
               barriers, reduction of vehicle speed, the use of well-maintained
               welded track, rubberized crossings and whistle blowing procedures.
               The City will seek assistance from the Public Utilities Commission,
               Southern California Regional Rail Authority, OCTA, and Amtrak in

       INTRODUCTION TO THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT
                                     ELEMENT
The City of Tustin is a part of the rapidly growing Southern California region.
Growth in the City should not be allowed to exceed existing transportation
infrastructure capacity, and planning and development activities in the City should
be coordinated with those of surrounding communities. The broad nature of growth
impacts requires that local planning decisions take into account regional issues and
be coordinated with State, regional and County planning efforts.
PURPOSE OF THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
               The primary purpose of this element is to ensure that growth and
               development is based upon the City's ability to provide an adequate
               traffic circulation system pursuant to the Orange County Division,
               League of California Cities "Countywide Traffic Improvement and
               Growth Management Plan Component." This element also guides
               Tustin's participation in interjurisdictional planning efforts and
               establishes a goal that the provision of jobs and housing be balanced.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ELEMENT
               The Growth Management Element contains policies for the planning
               and provision of traffic improvements that are necessary for orderly
               growth and development. Presented in this element are policies and
               programs for the establishment of specific traffic level of service (LOS)
               standards, development mitigation and development phasing. Also
               presented are goals and policies related to coordinating and
               cooperating with other jurisdictions to manage growth, and goals and
               policies related to the balance between jobs and housing in the City.
               This element satisfies the growth management requirement of the
               Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance
               (Measure M) and conforms to the guidelines for Growth Management
               elements as set forth in the Orange County, Countywide Growth
               Management Program Implementation Manual of April, 1991.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                         GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                1                                JUNE 17, 2008
               Tustin is a largely developed community with most of its
               infrastructure already in place. For this reason it is considered a
               Developed Community for the purposes of Measure M. As a result,
               this element does not need to address certain infrastructure issues,
               such as fire, sheriff/police, and library facilities, required to be
               addressed by developing communities.
               The former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station has significant
               infrastructure needs to support the development of Tustin Legacy.
               Infrastructure planning was integrated into the planning of the site
               and redevelopment of the former base will be required to address the
               costs and timing of additional infrastructure required to serve it.
CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
               A major goal of the Growth Management Element is to ensure that the
               planning, management and implementation of traffic improvements
               and public facilities are adequate to meet the current and projected
               needs of the City. While this goal is a high priority, it must be
               achieved while maintaining internal consistency among the other
               elements of the General Plan as required by State law. Therefore, the
               Growth Management Element does not replace or supersede any of
               the other General Plan elements; instead, the Element addresses,
               amplifies and supports the goals and policies that are included in the
               other General Plan elements and establishes new goals and policies
               where necessary.
               The Growth Management Element is implemented through various
               coordinated programs developed to support and carry out its goals,
               objectives and policies. In addition, this element minimizes
               duplication between Measure M and Congestion Management
               Program (CMP) requirements (see Related Plans and Programs
               below).
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               Many federal, state, regional, and Orange County plans and laws
               affect growth management in the City. Broadly, they include the
               Orange County Growth Management Plan, the Southern California

               Association of Governments (SCAG) Growth Management Plan,
               South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), State Assembly
               Bill 471 (Proposition 111 - Congestion Management), and Measures M
               and M2 (Orange County). Of all of these measures, M/M2 will have
               the most direct and significant impact upon the City's Growth
               Management Plan. Each of these plans and/or systems is described
               below.
               Orange County Growth Management Plan Element
               The stated purpose of the Orange County Growth Management Plan
               Element is to ensure that the planning, management and
               implementation of traffic improvements and public facilities are
               adequate to meet the current and projected needs of Orange County.
               The Plan sets forth goals, objectives, policies, and implementation
               programs for growth management. The goals of the Plan are
               summarized as follows:
                       "...to reduce traffic congestion, ensure that adequate
                       transportation facilities, public facilities, equipment and service
                       are provided for existing and future residents and to protect
                       the natural environment of Orange County."
               The Plan establishes the following five major policies:
               1.      Development Phasing: Development will be phased according
                       to Comprehensive Phasing Plans (CPPs) adopted by the
                       County. Phasing will be linked to roadway and public facility
                       capacities.
               2.      Balanced Community Development: Development will be
                       balanced to encourage employment of local residents and both
                       employment and employee housing, in the County generally
                       as well as in individual Growth Management Areas (GMAs).
               3.      Traffic Level of Service: This policy requires development
                       project sponsors to make improvements to intersections
                       significantly impacted by the "projects". A Level of Service "D"
                       must be attained at affected intersections. A "significant
                       impact" is generally defined in terms of increases in
                       intersection capacity utilization and levels of service. The
                       policy also establishes a Deficient Intersections List and

GENERAL PLAN                                 3                                 JUNE 17, 2008
                     establishes a developer fee program to pay for improving
                     affected intersections on a pro-rata basis.
               4.    Traffic Improvement Programs: The Plan provides for the
                     establishment of comprehensive traffic improvement program
                     to ensure that all new development provides necessary
                     transportation facilities and intersection improvements as a
                     condition of development approval.
               5.    Public Facility Plans: The Plan requires comprehensive public
                     facility plans for fire, sheriff/police, and library services. New
                     development shall participate on a pro-rata basis.
               To implement its policies, the Plan sets forth four implementation
               programs. These include the following:
               1.    Growth Management Areas (GMAs): The Plan calls for the
                     establishment of Growth Management Areas in order to
                     implement the Comprehensive Phasing Plans.
               2.    Facility Implementation Plans (FIPs): These plans address the
                     financing of transportation, police/sheriff, fire, library facilities
                     and flood control for each GMA in accordance with the goals,
                     objectives and policies of the Growth Management Plan
                     Element.
               3.    Countywide Implementation of Growth Management Plan:
                     This involves an annual evaluation of compliance with
                     development phasing, planned roadway and/or public facility
                     development, and maintenance of service levels.

                     Agreements: This program requires that any public service or
                     traffic improvements implemented through Development
                     Agreements must be consistent with the overall Orange
                     County Growth Management Plan.
               The Orange County Growth Management Plan Element further
               provides that additional implementation programs may be developed
               as deemed necessary by the County.

               SCAG Growth Management Plan
               The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends ways to redirect
               the region's growth in order to minimize congestion and better
               protect the environment. While SCAG has no authority to mandate
               implementation of its Growth Management Plan, some of the Plan's
               principal goals (such as improved jobs/housing balance) are being
               implemented through the South Coast Air Quality Management Plan
               (AQMD) which the South Coast Air Quality Management District
               does have the authority to implement.
               South Coast Air Quality Management Plan
               The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan mandates a variety of
               measures to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality, . The
               City is subject to all AQMP requirements for local jurisdictions.
               Assembly Bill 471 (Proposition 111)
               Assembly Bill (AB) 471, as subsequently modified by Assembly Bill
               1791, requires every urbanized city and county with a population of
               50,000 or more, to adopt a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) to
               reduce traffic congestion. A city or county which does not comply
               with the CMP requirement will lose gasoline sales tax revenues to
               which it would otherwise be entitled. Tustin has completed a CMP for
               its 2007 submittal, and will continue to work with the County on
               annual updates to the CMP.
               The CMP requirements include traffic level of service (LOS)
               standards, a trip reduction program, and a seven-year capital
               improvements program for traffic and transit. Many of the AB 471
               requirements are the same or similar to the requirements of Measure
               M (discussed below). The County has attempted to reconcile
               overlapping requirements through the Measure M implementation
               guidelines. (see Countywide Growth Management Program Revised
               Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance
               Implementation Manual).

GENERAL PLAN                              5                              JUNE 17, 2008
               Measures M and M2
               Orange County voters approved a measure (Measure M) in 1990 to
               allocate additional funds to provide needed transportation facilities in
               Orange County. Measure M specifically authorized a half cent retail
               sales tax increase for a period of 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The
               monies received from Measure M are returned to local jurisdictions
               for use on local and regional transportation improvements and
               maintenance projects. The tax is estimated to raise approximately $3.1
               billion Countywide over the 20 years. The County of Orange is
               divided into eleven (11) GMA's and the City of Tustin is currently
               contained within GMA #7 along with portions of the cities of Irvine,
               Santa Ana, Orange and the County of Orange. In order to qualify for
               these revenues, however, Measure M requires each City to comply
               with the Orange County Division, League of California Cities -
               Countywide Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Program
               which was included by reference in the Measure M ordinance. The
               Countywide Growth Management Program is designed to achieve a
               cooperative process among local Orange County jurisdictions to
               coordinate and implement traffic improvements and stronger
               planning on a Countywide basis. Measure M2 was approved by
               voters in November 2007 and extended the imposition of the one-half
               percent sales tax increase to fund transportation improvements for an
               additional 30 years.
               In order to receive its allocation of Measure M funds, the City must
               submit a statement of compliance with the growth management
               components which are summarized as follows:
               Adoption of a Growth Management Element that includes:
               o       Traffic Level of Service (LOS) standards
               o       Development mitigation program
               o       Development phasing and annual monitoring program
               Participation in interjurisdictional planning forums
               Development of a 7-year Capital Improvement Program
               Address housing options and job opportunities
               Adoption of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance.

PLANNED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS
               As the City of Tustin and the entire southern California region
               continues to grow, additional demands will be placed on the
               transportation network within the City. The following major
               transportation programs and projects have been identified as part of
               the Tustin General Plan update to help alleviate future traffic
               congestion:
               o     Buildout of existing and proposed arterials, collectors,
                     interchanges, and superstreet links, including extension of
                     Newport Avenue from south of Sycamore Avenue to Valencia
                     Avenue and extension of Tustin Ranch Road from Walnut
                     Avenue to Edinger Avenue.
               o     Extension of existing and proposed arterials and collectors to
                     support the reuse of MCAS Tustin, including the extension of
                     Tustin Ranch Road from Edinger Avenue to Barranca
                     Parkway, and extension of Warner Avenue from Redhill
                     Avenue to Jamboree Road;
               o     Coordination of circulation system improvements with the
                     City of Santa Ana through the Santa Ana/Tustin
                     Transportation System Improvement Program;
               o     Promotion of increased ridership through alternate means of
                     travel such as the connection and expansion of High
                     Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes with existing roadways and
                     expansion of public transit routes; and
               o     Efficient utilization of existing roadway capacity through
                     Transportation System Management (TSM) strategies.

 GROWTH MANAGEMENT ISSUES, NEEDS, OPPORTUNITIES
                              AND CONSTRAINTS
The City of Tustin is part of a large, fast-growing region. The pace of new
development has exceeded the ability of infrastructure to adequately support that
development. The Growth Management Element addresses primarily the issues
associated with rapid growth, traffic congestion, and transportation facilities.
       o       The City's rate of growth and development and impacts of growth in
               adjacent jurisdictions and throughout the County has created a
               necessity for a regional approach to transportation growth
               management.
       o       A significant portion of transportation problems in the County stem
               from the inadequate capacity of the freeway system to serve peak
               period travel demands. This lack of capacity results in poor levels of
               service characterized by severe congestion and low travel speeds
               during peak hours. The most severe congestion occurs at the junction
               of I-5 and SR-55.
       o       Actual highways are intended to handle the bulk of intra-regional
               traffic and complement the freeway system and local street network.
               As congestion increases on the freeway, more drivers utilize the
               arterial system, particularly those that parallel the freeways or those
               arterials serving the same trip destination as the freeway.
               Consequently, these arterials, such as Newport Avenue, Red Hill
               Avenue, and Irvine Boulevard are becoming increasingly congested
               and receive heavy traffic volumes well in excess of their design
               capacity. This situation is of special concern on those arterials which
               provide access to the freeway system.
       o       The City's transportation system is greatly influenced by two
               freeways which run through the City - the I-5 (Santa Ana) Freeway
               and the SR-55 (Newport-Costa Mesa) Freeway.
       o       Traffic congestion in Tustin is as much a regional as it is a local
               problem. The development which occurs in neighboring jurisdictions
               and throughout the County has effects upon the freeways and many
               of the major arterials that traverse the City of Tustin. Thus, it is not
               possible for the City to fully address growth management issues in
               isolation of other jurisdictions.

GENERAL PLAN                                8                              JUNE 17, 2008
 GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
The following new goals and policies are designed to meet all the Growth
Management Element requirements for Developed Communities as set forth by
Measure M and elaborated by the Countywide Growth Management Program
Implementation Manual.
TRAFFIC CONGESTION
               Traffic congestion is a problem on local streets as well as arterials and
               regional freeways. In particular, heavy traffic volumes in Tustin exist
               along Red Hill Avenue between Warner Avenue and Edinger
               Avenue, along Seventeenth Street in the vicinity of Yorba Street, and
               along Irvine Boulevard between the Newport-Costa Mesa Freeway
               and Browning Avenue. Traffic volumes along the I-5 corridor are also
               extremely heavy and cause significant slowing during the peak hours.
               GOAL 1: Reduce traffic congestion.
               Policy 1.1: Within three years of the issuance of the first building
               permit for a development project or within five years of the first
               grading permit for said development project, whichever occurs first,
               ensure that the necessary improvements to transportation facilities to
               which the project contributes measurable traffic are constructed and
               completed to attain Level of Service (LOS) "D" at the intersections
               under the sole control of the City. Intersections under the jurisdiction
               of another City or the County or the State or those included on the
               Deficient Intersection List established by the City and compiled by the
               GMA (Growth Management Area) in which the City participates (see
               Policy 3.1) are exempt from this requirement.
               Policy 1.2: Level of Service (LOS) will be measured by the Traffic
               Level of Service Policy Implementation Manual established by the
               Local Transportation Authority.
               Policy 1.3: All development contributing measurable impacts to
               intersections on the Deficient Intersection List and all projects
               contributing cumulatively, or individually, 10 percent or more of the
CITY OF TUSTIN                                          GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                9                                JUNE 17, 2008
                  traffic using an intersection shall be assessed a mitigation fee
                  determined by the jurisdictions in the GMA and locally administered
                  as part of the City's Capital Improvement Program.
                  Policy 1.4: Promote traffic reduction strategies through TDM
                  measures adopted by City ordinance.*
ADEQUATE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
                  Many of the regional transportation facilities are not adequately sized
                  to accommodate existing and projected growth. Largely in response to
                  this situation, Orange County voters approved Measure M in 1990
                  and Measure M2 in 2007 to allocate additional funds to provide
                  needed transportation facilities.
                  GOAL 2: Ensure adequate transportation facilities are provided for
                  existing and future inhabitants of the City.
                  Policy 2.1: Require that all new development pay its share of the street
                  improvement costs associated with the development, including
                  regional traffic mitigation.
                  Policy 2.2: New revenues generated from Measure M shall not be
                  used to replace private developer funding which has been committed
                  for any project.
                  Policy 2.3: The City shall continue to collect Transportation System
                  Improvement Program (TSIP) fees for improvements within its
                  boundaries and shall work with adjacent jurisdictions to determine
                  acceptable impact fees within the growth management areas. These
                  fees may be assessed as necessary in addition to the City's TSIP fees to
                  cover shortfalls that may not be generated by the established fee
                  program.
*Not required for Growth Management Element but required to meet Measure M requirements.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                                 GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                                    10                                    JUNE 17, 2008
               Policy 2.4: A Deficient Intersection Fund shall be established by the
               City to make improvements on those intersections necessary to
               achieve the LOS standard established in this Element.
               Policy 2.5: All new development shall be required to establish a
               development phasing program which phases approval of
               development commensurate with required improvements to roadway
               capacity. The Phasing Plan shall include an overall buildout
               development plan which can demonstrate the ability of the
               infrastructure to support the planned development.
               Policy 2.6: Development phasing for new projects shall be a
               component of the development review and entitlement process and
               shall be approved prior to issuance of building or grading permits.
               Policy 2.7: The City shall monitor the implementation of the
               development phasing program of each of the new development
               projects on an annual basis and prepare a report which indicates the
               status of development approval and required traffic improvements
               and relationship between them.
               Policy 2.8: A Performance Monitoring Program shall be developed to
               provide an annual evaluation of compliance with development
               phasing and evaluation of the maintenance of transportation service
               levels.
               Policy 2.9: A Seven Year Capital Improvement Program shall be
               adopted and maintained in conformance with provisions of Measure
               M for the purpose of maintaining adopted traffic level of service
               standards established in this Element.
INTERJURISDICTIONAL COORDINATION/COOPERATION
               Traffic congestion in Tustin is both a regional and local problem. The
               development which occurs in neighboring jurisdictions and
               throughout the County has effects upon the freeways and many of the
               major arterials that traverse the City of Tustin. Thus, the City cannot
               fully address growth management issues in isolation from other
               jurisdictions.
CITY OF TUSTIN                                          GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
GENERAL PLAN                               11                              JUNE 17, 2008
               GOAL 3: Cooperate with neighboring jurisdictions and the County
               to achieve reduction in regional traffic congestion.
               Policy 3.1: The City shall participate in interjurisdictional planning
               forums within its established growth management area and will
               continue to participate in forums with neighboring or affected
               jurisdictions to address transportation or other planning issues.
               Policy 3.2: The City will continue to cooperate with the OCTA in
               annually updating its Congestion Management Plan pursuant to the
               requirement of AB 471 in order to continue to receive its share of State
               gasoline sales tax revenues.
JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
               One of the major causes of traffic congestion is land use patterns that
               hinder the ability of people to live and work in the same area. Long
               commutes can overburden traffic infrastructure and diminish quality
               of life. Creating communities where people can both live and work in
               relatively close proximity shortens commutes and encourages the use
               of alternative forms of transportation to and from employment.
               GOAL 4: Strive to develop and maintain a balance between jobs
               and housing in Tustin.
               Policy 4.1: To the extent feasible, utilize information on the
               jobs/housing balance in the City and region as a factor in land use
               decision-making.

GENERAL PLAN                                     13                                     JUNE 17, 2008
                  THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN
The City's Growth Management Plan includes all of the components required for
Developed Communities by Measure M, the Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management Ordinance. Additional implementation programs independent of this
Element will be required in order to implement the Growth Management Plan.
TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE GOALS
               Policy 1.1 of this Element requires that development sponsors make
               necessary improvements to the circulation system, where affected by
               their development, so as to maintain acceptable LOS levels at intersec-
               tions and on roadway links under City control. Roadway expansions
               will be planned as part of the Capital Improvement Program and
               phased according to the Comprehensive Phasing Program. The LOS
               goals will be enforced through conditions of approval and monitored
               annually through the Performance Monitoring Program.
               Achievement of the adopted Levels of Service standard and
               implementation of exacted transportation improvements shall take
               into consideration extraordinary transportation circumstances which
               may impact identified intersections and/or timing of the required
               improvements. An example of an extraordinary circumstance would
               be when arterial roadways serve as substitute freeway access (thus
               impacting LOS performance) while planning and construction of
               additional freeway improvements are underway.
DEVELOPMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM
               The City shall establish a Development Mitigation Program based on
               Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) timetables to
               ensure that all new development pays its share of needed
               transportation improvements to the City's roadway network
               associated with that development. Participation shall be on a pro-rata
               basis and be required of all development projects except where an

               increased level of participation exceeding these requirements is
               established through negotiated legal mechanisms.
               The City will work to facilitate coordination of this program through
               inter-jurisdictional forums in order to determine minimally acceptable
               impact fees for application within the GMAs. The City will receive
               credit for existing traffic mitigation fee programs with regard to the
               GMA base level fee.
COMPREHENSIVE PHASING PROGRAM
               The City shall prepare a Comprehensive Phasing Program (CPP)
               based on OCTA timetables. The purpose of this program is to ensure
               to the extent feasible that adequate infrastructure (roadways, utilities)
               is constructed as development occurs by linking the ability of the
               development to proceed to either construction of the improvement(s)
               by others, construction of the improvement(s) by the developer, or by
               the developer's timely provision of the appropriate funding to the
               City so that the provision of these facilities is in balance with demand.
               While the Comprehensive Phasing Program will provide plans for
               new facilities, the Performance Monitoring Program will provide
               annual evaluation of compliance with phasing plans in order for
               development to continue. The Comprehensive Phasing Program shall
               provide reasonable lead time (three years from first building permit
               or five years from first grading permit) to design and construct
               specific transportation improvements.
PERFORMANCE MONITORING PROGRAM
               The City shall prepare a Performance Monitoring Program based on
               OCTA timetables. The Performance Monitoring Program will
               establish a system for annual evaluation of compliance with
               development phasing allocations. Under this program, roadway and
               other transportation facility improvements or fundings must actually
               be provided in order for new development to continue. If the
               improvements/funding are not provided, development shall be
               deferred until compliance with the provisions of this program are
               achieved.

               The Performance Monitoring program will provide an annual
               evaluation of the maintenance of transportation service levels. Annual
               traffic reports prepared under this Program shall utilize data collected
               within three (3) months of preparation of the report. In the event that
               the Performance Monitoring Program identifies one or more service
               level deficiencies, measures shall be implemented to correct identified
               deficiencies.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS
               The City shall establish a Capital Improvement Program for
               transportation systems improvements to effectively manage the
               system based on OCTA timetables. The purpose of the Capital
               Improvement Plans is to estimate future development over a seven
               year period and determine the necessary infrastructure and associated
               costs required for this new development. The Capital Improvement
               Plans will be closely linked with the Comprehensive Phasing Plans.
               The City will determine the capital projects needed to meet and
               maintain both the City's adopted Traffic Level of Service and
               Performance Standards. Capital financing programming will be based
               on proposed development to be constructed during (at a minimum)
               the following seven year period. The CIP shall include approved
               projects and an analysis of the costs of proposed projects as well as a
               financing plan for providing the improvements.
INTERJURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION
               The City of Tustin will become involved in interjurisdictional
               coordination for various purposes, including:
               o       Cooperating with the County of Orange, the Orange County
                       Transportation Authority (OCTA), and other local jurisdictions
                       on the implementation of Measure M and the development of
                       future revisions.
               o       Working with interjurisdictional forums (such as the City-
                       County Coordinating Committee) to make sure that the City's

                       fees are consistent with minimally acceptable impact fees for
                       application within the larger Growth Management Area;
               o       Participating in the Interjurisdictional Planning Forums at the
                       Growth Management Area (GMA) level to discuss
                       implementation of traffic improvements, cooperative land use
                       planning, and appropriate mitigation measures for
                       developments with multi-jurisdictional impacts;
               o       Working with the interjurisdictional forums to develop
                       strategies for bringing about greater jobs/housing balance at
                       the subregional level;
               o       Cooperating with the County of Orange in implementing the
                       Facility Implementation Plans and collaborating in the
                       Development Monitoring Program;
               o       Cooperating with State, County, and local governments in
                       planning and implementing the City's Circulation Element,
                       and coordinating efforts to ensure orderly development; and
               o       Coordinating population, housing, employment and land use
                       projections with the State Department of Finance, SCAG, the
                       County of Orange Development Monitoring Program, school
                       and water districts.
COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR LARGE PROJECTS
               Tustin will require that any new large developments prepare a
               comprehensive development plan and environmental impact analysis.
               A Specific Plan is an example of a Comprehensive Development Plan
               for large projects. This will allow the City to anticipate the impacts of
               large projects prior to development of any portion of the projects, and
               permit more time to plan for public services and facilities needed to
               support the projects.

Compatibility - The characteristics of different uses or activities that permit them to
be located near each other in harmony and without conflict. The designation of
permitted and conditionally permitted uses in zoning districts are intended to achieve
compatibility within the district. Some elements affecting compatibility include:
intensity of occupancy as measured by dwelling units per acre; pedestrian or
vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and such environmental ef-
fects as noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, or the presence of hazardous materials.
 On the other hand, many aspects of compatibility are based on personal preference
and are much harder to measure quantitatively, at least for regulatory purposes.

ally, and the structure, common areas and facilities are owned by all the owners on
a proportional, undivided basis.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP) - A mechanism employing growth manage-
ment techniques, including traffic level of service requirements, development mitiga-
tion programs, transportation systems management, and capital improvement
programming, for the purpose of controlling and/or reducing the cumulative regional

cities, and counties that include urbanized areas, to adopt and annually update a
Congestion Management Plan.
Congregate Care Housing - Generally defined as age-segregated housing built
specifically for the elderly which provides services to its residents, the minimum of
which is usually an on-site meal program, but which may also include housekeeping,
social activities, counseling, and transportation. There is generally a minimum
health requirement for acceptance into a congregate facility as most do not offer
supportive health care services, thus differing from a nursing home. Residents
usually have their own bedrooms and share common areas such as living rooms,
dining rooms, and kitchens; bathrooms may or may not be shared.
Conservation - The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction
or neglect.
Cooperative - A group of dwellings or an apartment building that is jointly owned by
