                                   Introduction
1.0     INTRODUCTION
In 2006 the City of Reedley initiated the General Plan 2030 Update. The Update was initiated
to look at the Reedley General Plan from a comprehensive perspective, incorporate adopted
specific plans and streamline or simplify the organization of the document. The City of Reedley
has prepared this General Plan 2030 Update in response to a number of changing conditions
in and near the City limits. The General Plan 2030 Update is designed to provide increased
attention to development policies and to assist in addressing development issues. Attention is
directed at expanding the economic base of the community and attracting a more diversified
economy to the City. The City recognizes that residential growth is beneficial; however, it is
also understood that growth must be balanced with local jobs and increased sales tax
revenues to support continued City services.
The Reedley General Plan is a vision for the City that incorporates the ideas, thoughts and
goals of the many citizens, businesses and public officials that took the time to participate in
the planning process. The City of Reedley General Plan serves as the City's constitution and
blue print for community growth and development across this planning horizon.This Plan is a
long range planning document which will guide the growth and development of the City over
the next 25 years. The resulting plan embraces the community and reflects current values of
maintaining Reedley as a vibrant, growing community with a history linked to agriculture.
1.1     GENERAL PLAN PURPOSE
The purpose of the General Plan 2030 Update is to develop a document that includes the
vision of the City of Reedley, is easy to read and complies with the laws of California. This
General Plan will supersede the previously adopted General Plans, and is directing expansion
and diversification of the City's economic base. The City recognizes that residential growth is
beneficial; however, it is also understood that growth must be balanced with local employment
opportunities, City services, and increased sales tax revenues to support continued City
services. The General Plan addresses the need for master planning local infrastructure to
accommodate growth. The document will define what kind of community Reedley should be in
the future.
The City Council chose to take the opportunity to revisit where the City is today and plan for its
vision in the future. California State Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Section
65300) also requires that the City periodically prepare and adopt a general plan. The
overarching goal of the City of Reedley General Plan 2030 Update is to accomplish the
following focal points:
        (a)     Establish a long range vision and plan for the community that reflects the need
                and desire of the citizenry.

         (b)    Maintain Reedley’s small town atmosphere.
         (c)    Incorporate the Reedley Specific Plan, the Rail Corridor Master Plan and the
                Southeast Reedley Industrial Area Specific Plan into a single document.
         (d)    Ensure neighborhood         connectivity    and   walkability orientation through
                subdivision design.
         (e)    Provide more opportunities for mixed use projects.
         (f)    Preserve and expand the core of Reedley.
         (g)    Encourage more variety and blends of housing types.
         (h)    Provide adequate educational facilities.
         (i)    To provide economic stability, encourage a diversified job base, expand local
                economy while enhancing local and regional shopping opportunities.
1.2      STATE OF CALIFORNIA GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
Each City in California is required to prepare and adopt a comprehensive general plan that will
guide the physical development of that City and any land outside it’s boundaries that have a
relationship to its planning. The California Supreme Court has called the general plan the
“constitution for future development”. A general plan expresses the community’s goals and
defines the public policies relative to the distribution of land uses.
A general plan is required to include seven mandatory elements: Land Use, Circulation,
Housing, Open Space, Conservation, Safety and Noise. The mandated elements of a general
plan must be legally adequate and internally consistent with one another. In addition, state law
permits the city to address additional issues such as public facilities and services, energy,
recreation, or any other subject that relates to the physical development of a city. The issues
discussed in each element are described below:
The Land Use Element designates the type, intensity, and general distribution of land uses for
housing, business, industry, open space, public buildings and grounds and other categories of
public and private uses.
The Circulation Element is correlated with the land use element and identifies the general
location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities.
The Housing Element is to identify the community's housing needs, state the community’s
goals and objectives with regard to housing production, rehabilitation, and conservation to
meet those needs, and to define the policies and programs that the community will implement
to achieve the stated goals and objectives. State law also requires cities to address the needs
of all income groups in their Housing Elements. In addition, it embodies policies for providing
adequate housing and includes action programs for that purpose.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 2

The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural
resources, including water, forests, soils, rivers, and mineral deposits.
The Open-Space Element details plans and measures for the long-range preservation and
conservation of open-space lands, including open space for the preservation of natural
resources, the managed production of resources (including agricultural lands), outdoor
recreation, and public health and safety. The Reedley General Plan combines the
conservation and open space elements and recreation services into the Conservation, Open
Space and Recreation Element.
The Noise Element identifies and appraises noise problems within the community and forms
the basis for land use distribution.
The Safety Element establishes policies and programs to protect the community from risks
associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and wildfire hazards.
The depth of discussion on each issue in the General Plan depends upon local conditions and
the relative local importance of that issue. A local general plan may also include other topics of
local interest.
The General Plan Update will also include the development of policies that will address the
current laws, AB 32 and SB 375. Because air quality is an important issue in Reedley and the
Central Valley, air quality issues are also addressed in this document. City of Reedley staff
participated in the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint process and includes the concepts of
compact, concentric growth in many of the new or revised policies.
In 2009, the City Council adopted a resolution for Healthy Cities Initiative. Many of the
concepts and policies encouraged in the sample policies have been incorporated into existing
or new goals or policies.
The City of Reedley must ensure that all the elements of its General Plan are integrated and
internally consistent. This update consists of an update to the Land Use, Circulation,
Conservation, Open Space and Recreation, Noise and Safety Elements of the General Plan.
The Housing Element must be updated on a five-year schedule and will be updated
separately.
1.3     BACKGROUND
Reedley is situated approximately 25 miles southeast of the City of Fresno and equidistant
from the City of Visalia, also southeast of Reedley. Manning Avenue, a four-lane divided major
arterial street, connects the City with State Highway 99 which is 12 miles to the west. State
Highway 180 is located eight miles north of the City, and both highways are heavily used by
local, regional, and national residents, travelers, and motor carriers. In addition to its location
near these major highways, the community lies adjacent to the Tulare Valley Railroad and the
Southern Pacific Railroad lines.
Reedley is located in the central San Joaquin Valley portion of California, lying inland between
the State's coastal mountain ranges and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Reedley's economy
continues as predominantly based upon agricultural production and agriculturally-oriented
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                     Page 3
industry. The valley floor is the richest intensive agricultural production area in the world.
Although there has been economic diversification in recent years, local economy continues to
be significantly dependent upon the underlying agricultural character of the region. The City’s
local and regional setting is shown in Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2.
1.4      HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The people in Reedley are some of the friendliest and most neighborly you will meet.
Reedley's citizens are a community comprised of many converging cultures and peoples, from
Asian, African, Central American, European, Mexican, Native American and South American.
This makes for a rich community that provides exposure to a mixture of social and cultural
living in one place.
Civil war hero Thomas Law Reed settled here to provide wheat for Gold Rush miners in the
mid 1800's. His donation of land for a railroad station site established the town as the center of
the Valley’s booming wheat business. Railroad officials commemorated his vision by naming
the fledgling City in his honor. When wheat demand slackened, Kings River water was diverted
for crop irrigation, and the region began its over 100-year tradition of bountiful field, tree, and
vine fruit harvests.
With water and railroad services in place, farming families of European immigrants were
recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and
prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. An important element in the
early town was a colony of German Mennonites, whose strong traditions and values still shape
Reedley’s culture. The population today is diverse and multi-cultural and Reedley boasts a
current population of 24,622. Each of the town’s major ethnic groups has shown strong civic
leadership, a desire to retain cultural and religious traditions, and the ability to work
successfully together for Reedley’s betterment. In 2013, Reedley will celebrate 100 years of
incorporation.
Among the community's 25 churches are Armenian, Baptist, Buddhist, Catholic, and many
other congregations. The area's 41 organizations and 12 civic clubs include Filipino community
organizations, a Finnish organization, and American Lebanese Women's Club, several
Hispanic and Latin American organizations, and a Japanese organization among the many
sports, cultural, conservation, charitable, and civic associations. In 1988, Reedley celebrated
the first 100 years of its multi-cultural heritage and the 75th anniversary of incorporation.
Education is a vital part of community life, with seven elementary, three junior, and two
high schools, both public and private. Over 6,000 students are served by these facilities
as part of the Kings Canyon Unified School District. For 70 years, Reedley College has
capped the local educational structure, providing area residents with a lively assortment of
classes, programs, activities, and community events.
Reedley College enhances our community with its multitude of programs and student
exchange efforts. From pre-school to High School, our educational facilities are some of
the very best in the Central Valley; from public to private we can possibly surpass your
expectations. Part of a 106 campus and 71 district California Community College system,
it has a total on and off-campus enrollment of over 6,252. Small classes, on-campus
housing, an excellent library, strong career guidance resources, and a spirited athletic
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                      Page 4

program add to the college's appeal. Students can select certificate or associate degree
programs in a wide variety of educational majors.
Within a 30 mile radius of the City are California State University, Fresno City College,
College of the Sequoias (Visalia), two law schools, a Christian college, and a graduate
professional psychology school. Local television and radio stations, the Reedley Exponent
newspaper which provides local communication and perspective opportunities, a full range
of newspapers from around the country, a local branch public library, and an active
historical society and local museum complete the community's education profile.
Reedley contributes a wide variety of agricultural products to the County's economy. The
area's rich, fertile soil produces the finest fruit, nut, vegetable, grain and cotton varieties.
Since 1946, Reedley has been known as the Fruit Basket of the World because we lead
the nation in the shipping of fresh fruit. Thirty fruit and vegetable packing and cold storage
facilities, including the world's largest plant, along with nearby wineries, supply tree and
vine fruit products of consistently high quality. Related manufacturing industries in
Reedley include boxes and packing machinery, and automatic packing equipment.
The Council-Manager form of government administers a general fund operating budget of
over $4,700,000 with a total budget in excess of $15,000,000. The City has had a
Planning Commission since the 1940's and provides full City services including a
municipal airport, water system, sewer plant, and trash collection. A modern, acute-care
hospital with a new birthing center provides comprehensive medical coverage. The active
Chamber of Commerce & Visitor's Bureau and Reedley Downtown Association are
responsible for significant on-going revitalization and beautification.
Key to Reedley, however, is its exceptional recreational amenities. On the banks of the
Kings River, sandy beaches and clear stretches of open water lure enthusiasts for
swimming, fishing, boating and water-skiing. Parks along the river draw families and
friends from great distances for frequent picnics and festivities. The City's public parks,
swimming pool, and comprehensive recreational program, along with its annual
community-wide pageants and festivals, complete with three area golf courses, nearby
Pine Flat Reservoir and the redwoods, lakes, streams, and hiking trails minutes away in
the mountains. Reedley's spectacular setting is enhanced by the entertainment and
shopping radius surrounding the city center, and its success in combining the best of its
rural heritage and contemporary urban comforts.
1.5      GENERAL PLAN UPDATE PROCESS
The City of Reedley General Plan 2030 Update began in 2008 and has included many
opportunities for public engagement and involvement. The 2030 Update began with the City
Council authorizing the formation of a Committee charged with the sole task of completing a
general plan update. The Committee consists of two City Council members and two Planning
Commission members.Generally, the Committee meets on a monthly basis to discuss, take
input from the public, and provide direction to staff on the various aspects of the General Plan.
The result is a General Plan that has been shaped by the community.

Southeast Reedley Industrial Area Specific Plan.
Although part of the General Plan, the Housing Element is a separate document that is
updated every five years on a schedule determined by the State of California. The General
Plan Update consists of a Land Use Element, Circulation Element, Conservation, Open Space,
Parks and Recreation Element, Safety Element and Noise Element. Two new elements are
being added, the Economic Element and Community Health Element, both located in Chapter
Two as Sections 2.8 and 2.9, respectively. As part of the effort to ensure Reedley’s economic
viability, the Economic Development Element will contain goals and policies that promote
economic stability, encourage a diversified job base, expand the local economy and provide
more local and regional shopping opportunities. The Community Health Element will contain
goals and policies that encourage healthy living and lifestyles.
The General Plan document consists of chapters containing each element. The Housing
Element will be under separate cover and will be updated according to state-mandated time
frames. The contents of the General Plan chapters are as follows:
         Chapter One – Introduction
         Chapter Two – Land Use Element
         Chapter Three – Circulation Element
         Chapter Four – Conservation, Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element
         Chapter Five – Safety Element
         Chapter Six     – Noise Element
The Reedley General Plan 2030 Update is composed of text and maps. The text identifies and
analyzes the principal physical development issues facing the Planning Area, describes plan
proposals, and includes statement of goals, objectives and policies. General Plan
implementation methods and procedures are presented as policy statements. The General
Plan Diagram shows the planned land uses and street and highway classifications. Other
descriptive illustrative maps are also found in this document.
The General Plan is intended to present a clear and concise statement of City goals and
policies toward development and to accommodate additions and modification necessary for
future updating. Each element of the General Plan contains brief background information to
establish the context for the policies in the element. The background information is followed by
a list of goals and policies that will be used to guide the future development of the City of
Reedley.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 7

Goals
A goal is a policy statement which describes a long-term vision or future condition that the City
desires to achieve, and is a general expression of community values. Following each goal(s) is
a series of policy statements. These policy statements are implementation, or action
necessary to achieve the goal.
Goals are contained within each Element are highlighted in a shade box. Within each box each
goal is assigned by a combination of letters corresponding to the Element. Goals and policies
are then placed in ascending numerical order. For example, goals within the Land Use
Element will be identified by (LU), Circulation Element (C), Conservation, Open Space, Parks
and Recreation (COSPR), Safety (S), Noise (N), Economic Development(ED), Community
Health (HS).
Policies are statements that describe the course of action to achieve a specific goal. Policies
of the General Plan will be identified by the Chapter they are located in and followed by a
number.
For Example:
Goals
 LU 2.4A - Preserve and enhance Reedley’s unique character and achieve an optimal balance
 of residential, commercial, industrial, public and open space land uses.
Policies
LU2.4.1 -       Develop design standards for structures, landscaping and parking areas to
                facilitate compatibility with surrounding uses and overall character of the City
                of Reedley.
1.7     STUDY AREA
The Study Area is the area generally bounded by Adams Avenue to the north, Floral Avenue
to the south, Englehart Avenue to the east and Lac Jac Avenue to the west, as shown in
Figure 1.3. The Study Area encompasses 10,620 acres. The current city limits consists of
3,133 acres and the sphere of influence (SOI) contains approximately 5,053 acres. The
proposed SOI expansion includes an additional 2,860 acres, totaling approximately 7,913
acres. The proposed areas for expansion to the Sphere of Influence boundary are identified in
Figure 1.4.
Within this area, the General Plan has identified new growth areas and designated an
expanded Sphere of Influence boundary, which will require approval by the Fresno Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo). To implement the approved General Plan 2030
Update, the City will prepare and submit to the Fresno Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCo) an annexation application.

1.8     PLANNING PERIOD
The General Plan 2030 Update planning horizon is proposed through the year 2030. The Plan
may also be periodically amended to reflect changes in economics, social characteristics,
development patterns or other variables identified within the community. Proposed Policy
adjustments required by changing public attitudes and differing circumstances can be made to
each of the mandatory elements of the Plan as often as necessary to fully implement the
overarching goals of the Plan. With opportunities for review and update insures that the plan
can remain current and relative, thus extending its continued effectiveness to the City as an
expression of official policies concerning the future.
1.9     COMMUNITY PROFILE
Population
In 1992, when the General Plan was last updated, the City of Reedley had a population of

1.10     SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BLUEPRINT
The City has actively been involved in the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint planning process. The
Valley Blueprint process began in 2006, and is made up of seven Valley Council of
Government (COG) members and one Regional Transportation Planning Agency representing
the San Joaquin Valley. In 2010, the San Joaquin Valley Blueprint Council, the decision-
making body, approved the adoption of 12 Growth Principles. The growth principles reflect the
vision for the future of the San Joaquin Valley. In the process of updating the Reedley General
Plan, the Growth Principles have been used to develop or update many, if not all, of the
policies within the General Plan Update.
The San Joaquin Valley Blueprint Smart Growth Principles:
         (a)    Create a range of housing opportunities and choices.
         (b)    Create walkable neighborhoods.
         (c)    Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration.
         (d)    Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong sense of place.
         (e)    Make development decisions predictable, fair, and cost-effective.
         (f)    Mix land uses.
         (g)    Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental
                areas.

                                 Chapter Two
                         Land Use Element
2.0     INTRODUCTION
California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that a land use element of the General
Plan include; and more specifically, mandates that the element address the following:
        “... the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses
        of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture,
        natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public
        buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other
        categories of public and private uses of land. The Land Use Element shall
        include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity
        recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The development of land is generally a benefit of property ownership; however, it can create
competing interests if improperly planned or developed. Reedley’s past and present economic
base is closely tied to agriculture. The loss of prime agricultural land to intensive development
could adversely affect Reedley’s agricultural ties and economic base. Improper planned
growth patterns could: (a) strain the City’s ability to provide necessary infrastructure and
services; (b) inadvertently allow inconsistent, conflicting and/or competing land use patterns;
and (c) result in improper development of flood prone areas where soil or geologic conditions
pose severe limitations to orderly development.
The Land Use Element evaluates and anticipates Reedley’s growth and describes a pattern of
development within the City and the larger proposed Planning Area. The Element establishes
urban development goals, policies and land use patterns which seek to maximize orderly
development, while minimizing potential competing interests and adverse impacts of
development on the local economy and physical environment.
The Land Use Element is viewed as one of the core elements of the General Plan and is
frequently the most referenced element. The General Plan Land Use map designates land
uses on a parcel by parcel basis for all lands within the City and Sphere of Influence. The Land
Use map also depicts the community’s intended physical form and areas for future growth.
Incorporated into this General Plan 2030 Update are three previously adopted specific plans;
the 2001 Reedley Specific Plan, the 1985 Southeast Industrial Area Specific Plan, and the
2002 Rail Corridor Master Plan. These plans will be repealed as part of adoption of the
General Plan 2030 Update.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 17

2.1     BACKGROUND
This section of the Land Use Element evaluates the many potential growth-inducing factors
and limits to development, which will determine the extent and rate of future urban growth
within the Reedley Planning Area. As such, these factors provide the basis for the illustrative
maps and policy statements which follow in this Chapter and in subsequent elements of the
General Plan.
Population
The City of Reedley’s historic population data is presented in Table 2-1. Between 1990 and
2010, Reedley experienced an average annual growth rate of 2.73% per year. In the last ten
years, the average growth rate was 2.54% per year, and in the last five years the average
growth rate was 3.59% per year. These trends are one of the major indicators of the City’s
potential growth over the planning horizon. By analyzing past growth trends, in comparison to
the State Department of Finance projections for growth in the San Joaquin Valley, an average
annual growth rate of 3% to 2030 has been identified as a mean. Using this mean Table 2-2
represents the Population Forecast for the City of Reedley to 2030. The table also indicates
that the City can anticipate a 137 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2030. The
project increase in population would also suggest that there will be an increasing demand for
urbanized land within the Planning Area.

Existing Land Use
According to the General Plan 2012 the existing Planning Area and planned land uses are
shown on Figure 2.1. Existing land uses are primarily residential and industrial. Single-family
residential represents 56.4% of overall land use and industrial 12.5%, are shown in Table 2-4.
Land Availability
The current city limits consists of 3,133 acres and the sphere of influence (SOI) contains
approximately 5,053 acres. The proposed SOI expansion in this General Plan Update includes
an additional 2,860 acres, totaling approximately 7,913 acres. The balance of land is within the
unincorporated area of Fresno County and is designated for future development with various
land use designations to accommodate anticipated orderly development through the year
2030. The predominant land use designation in the Plan anticipates the allocation of land to
approximately 60 percent residential, 9 percent commercial and 12 percent industrial. The
current plan consists of 44 percent residential, 4 percent commercial and 18 percent industrial.

2.2     INCORPORATION OF EXISTING SPECIFIC PLANS
Reedley Specific Plan
In 2001, the City adopted the Reedley Specific Plan (Resolution No. 2001-009) and associated
environmental documents (FEIR, SCH #2000031100) to guide future development along the
fringe edges of the existing Reedley Planning Area. The stated goals were geared toward
achieving the highest quality development that addresses issues such as protecting farmland,
improving air quality, building a strong sense of community, energy efficient design and
encouraging development that accommodates alternative transportation modes such as
walking and bicycling. The Reedley Specific Plan contained goals and policies for residential
and commercial growth which have been evaluated and incorporated into this General Plan
2030 Update, Land Use Element. See Figure 2.2 – Reedley Specific Plan Map below.
Figure 2.2 - Reedley Specific Plan Map
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                             Page 21

Southeast Industrial Area Specific Plan
In 1986, the Southeast Industrial Area Specific Plan was adopted by the City Council
(Resolution No. 3732) to address land use, circulation, and public facilities for an
approximately 640-acre area in the southeast area of Reedley, Figure 2.3. The specific plan
was not updated following the last General Plan Update. As such, there are some
inconsistencies that can only be rectified by incorporating the plan into this update. Therefore,
one of the many goals of this update is to incorporate the goals and policies from the Specific
Plan. The General Plan 2030 Update reflects the goals and policies that focus on maintaining
adequate acreage for industrial development and emphasis on the importance on industrial
land as an economic tool for Reedley.

Rail Corridor Master Plan
During October 2002, the City Council adopted the Rail Corridor Master Plan (Resolution No.
2002-094). The purpose of the Rail Corridor Master Plan was to guide future development in
the area focusing around the Reedley Parkway (Rail Trail) from Manning Avenue at the Kings
River to the north and south of Dinuba Avenue to the south, Figure 2-4. The Rail Trail has
been completed in the Downtown area. The goals and policies from the Rail Corridor Master
Plan have been incorporated into the General Plan Update. Primarily, that the City shall
encourage development of parcels that complement the Parkway and will transition to higher
value uses and away from underutilized industrial parcels.

The overall guiding principles for future land use, as listed below, form the basis for the more
detailed statements of goal and policy statements. These principals are derived, in part, from
the known changes in physical and social environments which have occurred over time
coupled with applicability of specific goals and objectives from previous General Plans and the
incorporation of the goals found in the Reedley Specific Plan, Southeast Industrial Area
Specific Plan and Rail Corridor Master Plan. A more detailed discussion follows later under the
appropriate sections of the Land Use Element.
        (a)     Protect the agricultural economic base of the Reedley area by encouraging the
                preservation of the maximum feasible amount of productive and potentially
                productive agricultural land.
        (b)     Plan for urban growth in a manner that minimizes impacts on agriculture and the
                consumption of agricultural land.
        (c)     Increase residential densities to reduce the impacts related to loss of agricultural
                lands.
        (d)     Establish a pattern of urban development which provides for the economically
                efficient provision of urban services with particular emphasis on sewer, water
                and storm drainage infrastructure.
        (e)     Seek a balanced and compatible land use pattern which accommodates
                projected population growth and encourages alternative transportation such as
                walking, bicycle or transit.
        (f)     Provide transitions between various land uses and intensities using high quality
                design.
        (g)     Integrate land use planning, transportation planning, and air quality planning to
                make the most efficient use of public resources.
        (h)     Development in the planning area shall occur in a fashion that protects and
                enhances air quality and water quality.
        (i)     Public open space shall be made an integral part of new development in the
                planning area.

2.4     COMMUNITY CHARACTER/IDENTITY
Goals
 LU 2.4A - Preserve and enhance Reedley’s unique character and achieve an optimal balance
 of residential commercial, industrial, public and open space land uses.
 LU 2.4B - Strive to keep Reedley separate and distinct from the nearby communities of
 Parlier and Dinuba.
 LU 2.4C - Maintain and enhance Reedley’s small town characteristics.
 LU 2.4D - Maintain and preserve the downtown area as Reedley’s business and social
 center.
Policies
LU 2.4.1        To facilitate compatibility with surrounding uses and overall character of the City
                of Reedley develop design standards for structures, landscaping and parking
                areas.
LU 2.4.2        Develop well-designed and landscaped major gateways or entrances to the City
                at the following locations:
                (a)     Manning Avenue near the Kings River
                (b)     North and South Reed Avenue
                (c)     Manning Avenue and Buttonwillow Avenue
                (d)     East Dinuba Avenue
LU 2.4.3        Develop pedestrian amenities in the Downtown area to include open space or
                plazas, street furniture and lighting and signage.
LU 2.4.4        Continue to improve the physical aesthetics of the Downtown area.
LU 2.4.5        Establish an overlay zone in the Downtown area that will allow more flexible or
                mixed use of existing buildings.
LU 2.4.6        Consider adoption of a form based code for the overlay district that will allow
                greater flexibility in design standards and facilitate continued investment in the
                Downtown area.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 25

2.5     URBAN GROWTH MANAGEMENT
This General Plan Update does anticipate future population and economic growth in the
Reedley Planning Area which might necessitate some demand for potential conversion or re-
use of agricultural land to a more urban use. Also recognizing the conversion of individual
agricultural properties has the potential to cause adjoining parcels to be converted to non-
agricultural uses because of various economic conditions such as rising land values, conflicts
with other land uses, and the inhibiting effect of increased numbers of people on normal
agricultural operations. Therefore, the policies in this section seek where ever possible, to
minimize the premature and unplanned conversion of agriculture by recommending an urban
growth management plan be developed to ensure an orderly growth pattern along the urban
fringe.
Goals
  LU 2.5A - Establish urban growth management policies which seek to minimize the
  premature conversion of productive and potentially productive agricultural land to urban
  uses.
  LU 2.5B - Minimize urban sprawl and leapfrog development.
  LU 2.5C - Facilitate orderly transition from rural/agricultural uses to urban land uses.
  LU 2.5D - Designate growth areas that can be served by existing and planned infrastructure.
  LU2.5E - Encourage a concentrated urban land uses pattern which provides for the
  economically efficient provision of urban services and maintains Downtown as the core of
  the City.
Policies
LU 2.5.1        Within the areas outside of the city limits, the City should encourage Fresno
                County to:
                (a)     Maintain an exclusive agricultural zone district.
                (b)     Maintain a minimum permitted lot size for agricultural land which assures
                        that the land can be used for agricultural purposes.
LU 2.5.2        Development standards shall incorporate measures to protect and preserve
                agricultural land.
LU 2.5.3        Oppose formation of new land conservation contracts within the Reedley Sphere
                of Influence, and work with land owners to file for non-renewal of Williamson Act
                contracts in advance of urban development.
LU 2.5.4        Adopt a right-to-farm ordinance.
LU 2.5.5        Consider evaluating and adopting an agricultural land mitigation policy.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 26
LU 2.5.6        Seek through the Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCo) an approved
                Sphere of Influence that would reflect the goals and policies of this General
                Plan.
LU 2.5.7        Require contiguous development within the Sphere of Influence unless it can be
                demonstrated that the development of contiguous property is infeasible.
LU 2.5.8        Implement an annexation policy that is based on annexing land for residential
                development only when at least 80 percent of the residentially designated land
                inside city limits is developed.
LU 2.5.9        Work with Fresno County and Fresno LAFCo to maintain agricultural
                designations in areas outside the planning area and the Reedley Sphere of
                Influence.
LU 2.5.10       Continue to maintain a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fresno
                County regarding annexations, tax sharing etc.
LU 2.5.11       The Plan should foster the establishment of a concentrated urban development
                pattern, with land outside the planned urban area being designated exclusively
                for agriculture.
LU 2.5.12       New urban development should occur in an orderly manner with initial
                development occurring on the available undeveloped properties which are
                closer to the built-up area.
LU 2.5.13       The City should promote and provide urban services to development within the
                City as a means of controlling and directing growth.
LU 2.5.14       Initial development shall incorporate necessary infrastructure to accommodate
                future development for the surrounding area consistent with the goals and
                objectives of the General Plan. A reimbursement agreement or other
                mechanisms may be provided to the developer as a means to share the
                equitable burden of costs.
LU 2.5.15       Provide transitional design between land use types and high quality urbanuses.
LU 2.5.16       The City shall encourage projects incorporating pedestrian-oriented design.
LU 2.5.17       The City shall identify areas and zones that can accommodate mixed use
                planning that will provide a combination of residential, commercial services and
                employment opportunities.
2.6     SMART GROWTH/SUSTAINABILITY
Table 2.3 is a consistency matrix to guide and ensure orderly development over the planning
horizon. This matrix creates the linkage between planned land use designation and regulatory
zone district designation. This table will also be used to guide future decision-making as the
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 27
physical environment and development patterns changes over time which warrant a review of
the appropriateness of an assigned planned land use or zone district designation.

Goals
 LU 2.6A - New development (residential, commercial and public) shall be designed in a way
 that creates fully integrated neighborhoods with a variety of land uses arranged so that
 access by walking or bicycling is possible and encouraged.
 LU 2.6B - New development in the planning area shall be designed on a pedestrian scale,
 as opposed to the automobile scale.
 LU 2.6C - Street standards shall be revised to allow narrower streets - thereby reducing the
 amount of land consumed for urban development.
 LU 2.6D- The City shall prepare and implement a policy that supports and encourages infill-
 development for vacant/undeveloped or by-passed parcels within the existing urban area.
 LU 2.6E - The City shall review and revise parking standards contained in the zoning
 ordinance and reduce requirements where appropriate. The City shall also encourage
 shared parking facilities when practical.

  LU 2.6F - Street standards shall be revised to reflect Complete Streets design which
  includes thefollowing:
     (1) Narrow street widths, particularly on local streets, to the maximum extent practical.
     (2) Revised geometrics of street intersections, including smaller turning radii.
     (3) Tree-lined streets, including parkways between the curb and sidewalk.
     (4) Along major streets, landscaped medians shall be constructed.
     (5) Revised street standards shall ensure safe and efficient access for emergency
  vehicles.
     (6) Roundabouts shall be located at selected street intersections to improve traffic flow,
  reduce air emissions and to provide community landmarks.
     (7) Circulation plans for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic shall provide for effective
  connections to major community facilities, such as the Kings River, Rail Trail, Downtown,
  Reedley College, Reedley High School, elementary schools and parks and employment
  areas.
     (8) Street designs for collector and arterial roadways shall include provisions forfuture
  fixed route transit systems.
  LU 2.6G - In order to provide efficient transportation, new development shall be arranged
  with a grid street pattern, to the extent practical. The use of cul-de-sac streets shall be kept
  to a minimum.
  LU 2.6H - Sidewalk standards shall be revised to encourage and facilitate pedestrian activity
  by increasing sidewalk width, allow meandering sidewalk patterns and incorporating the
  placement of street trees between the sidewalk and the street.
  LU 2.6I - New residential development shall be designed around “activity nodes” which
  provide commercial uses, employment centers, higher density development, and a complete
  range of supporting social and cultural facilities to the surrounding neighborhood.
2.7      LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Planned land use designations typically fall into one of four categories; residential, commercial,
industrial and other (e.g. public facility, open space). The planned land use designation is an
illustrative representation on the land use map (Figure 2.5 – Proposed Land Use Additions and
Changes). The particular land use designation is then further described using goals and
policies, as described below.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                        Page 29

This 2030 General Plan update includes changes to those designations which have been
eliminated since the last update, or to more accurately describe and guide development have
been changed. Figure 2.6 – Land Use Category Changes depicts the proposed visual mapping
changes and applicable planned land use designation through the planning horizon. Table 2-4
and Table 2-5 provide additional detailed information related to the proposed land uses.

RESIDENTIAL LAND USE
The City should provide for a wide range of housing types, styles and densities. A city with
these characteristics insures that housing opportunities are made available for all socio-
economic levels.
Goals
 LU 2.7A - Provide for the distribution of varying residential densities throughout the
 community to ensure that residential development reflects various income and lifestyle
 options.
 LU 2.7B - Residential densities shall be moderately increased to encourage more compact
 development consistent with smart growth design principles.
 LU 2.7C - Preserve existing neighborhoods and create strong new neighborhoods that are
 well designed and maintained.
 LU 2.7D - Promote integration of affordable housing units toward inclusionary development of
 neighborhoods with mixed income levels.
Policies
LU 2.7.1        Establish the following residential densities:
                (a)    Suburban Residential (1-4 dwelling units per gross acre) – The Suburban
                       Residential density designation is intended for single-family detached
                       residential development. The designation is intended to accommodate
                       larger residential parcels, which generally range from 7,500 square feet
                       to one-acre in size.
                (b)    Low Density Residential (4.1-8 dwelling units per gross acre) – The Low
                       Density Residential designation is intended for single-family detached
                       residential development, attached single family, and low density multi-
                       family uses. The Low Density Residential designation is the predominant
                       residential designation in the City of Reedley. This land use category
                       accommodates the typical residential subdivision in Reedley.
                (c)    Medium Density Residential (8.1-20 dwelling units per gross acre) – The
                       Medium Density Residential designation is intended for single-family or
                       multiple-family development. Medium density development shall be
                       located near or adjacent to collector or arterial intersection and close to
                       shopping and employment opportunities. Multiple family developments
                       may serve as a transition from commercial to single family residential
                       neighborhoods.
                (d)    High Density Residential (20.1-30 dwelling units per gross acre) – High
                       Density is intended for multiple-family development including multi-story

                residential and commercial zone district to ensure compatibility.
LU 2.7.5        Encourage and support within existing neighborhoods in-fill development.
LU 2.7.6        Ensure that residential development occurs in areas that have sufficient
                infrastructure to accommodate the density of residential development being
                proposed.
LU 2.7.7        Residential development shall be designed in a manner so that new
                development is well connected to the surrounding area and to encourage
                pedestrian and bicycle transportation.

                       compatibility with surrounding land uses.
COMMERCIAL LAND USE
Commercial land uses are intended to provide goods, services and employment opportunities
for the citizens of Reedley and surrounding areas. General Plan Commercial designations are
Central Downtown Commercial, Neighborhood Commercial, Community Commercial, Office
and Service Commercial.
Modern commercial development has typically been designed in a fashion that does not
particularly respect traditional neighborhood design or the design identity of the community.
Large parking lots often dominate the streetscape creating an environment in which most
people do not wish to spend time. A goal of the General Plan is to facilitate commercial
development that blends neighborhoods, in terms of scale and architectural appearance.
Goals
 LU 2.7G - Ensure adequate commercial shopping opportunities and office space to meet
 anticipated need for economic development.
 LU 2.7H - Provide for the timely development of planned commercial areas as determined by
 community needs and the availability of urban services.
 LU 2.7I - Enhance the viability of the downtown area and preserve its role as the urban core.
 LU 2.7J - Encourage further efforts to strengthen the downtown core, including linking it with
 other commercial uses along Manning Avenue and “I” Street.
 LU 2.7K - Designate sufficient commercial land to accommodate growth for the entire
 planning horizon.
 LU 2.7L - Provide for the compatibility of commercial land uses with surrounding land uses.
 LU 2.7M - Encourage “big box” retail to locate in the community commercial planned land use
 designation.
Policies
LU 2.7.23       Future commercial development in the planning area shall be well designed to
                respect neighborhood scale and traditional architectural design. Toward that

                end, commercial development will be reviewed utilizing the following design
                standards:
                (a)     Parking space requirements shall be minimized for commercial
                        developments. Parking lots should be segmented to minimize the impact
                        of parking on the streetscape. In particular, parking should be located to
                        the rear or to the side of commercial and office buildings.
                (b)     Incorporate interface design standards (e.g.; setbacks, fencing) into each
                        residential and commercial zone district to ensure compatibility.
                (c)     Commercial development shall be designed to facilitate pedestrian and
                        bicycle access and function, featuring outdoor seating, pedestrian plazas
                        and wide, shade-covered walkways.
                (d)     Landscaping, particularly shade trees and drought tolerant plants, shall
                        be maximized in all commercial developments.

                standards for all new commercial and industrial development.
LU 2.7.25       Off-street parking for commercial areas shall be designed to adequately support
                surrounding land use pattern. Off-street parking areas shall also include
                landscaping to provide shading for at least 50 percent of the surfaced area
                within 10 years from planting.
LU 2.7.26       Encourage efficient use of land by allowing a percentage of compact car parking
                spaces.
LU 2.7.27       Planned unit developments shall be permitted in all commercial designations.
LU 2.7.28       Encourage continued efforts to improve the appearance of the commercial areas
                including the commercial corridor along 11th Street.

LU 2.7.31       Encourage mixed uses in new and existing structures.
LU 2.7.32       Create a mixed use overlay zone to include design standards that will allow for
                creative use and design of both new and existing structures.
Neighborhood Commercial Land Use
Neighborhood Commercial Centers will be composed of a mix of retail and service-oriented
uses that will serve the immediate neighborhoods and provide a destination for local transit
and places for social gathering of neighborhood residents. Future commercial centers will be
designed with the pedestrian in mind and provide for connectivity to surrounding areas.

                neighborhood shopping center up to ten acres.
LU 2.7.38       Neighborhood Commercial uses shall be designed to be compatible with
                adjacent residential uses by addressing scale, height and architectural.
LU 2.7.39       Locations at an intersection are most appropriate for Neighborhood Commercial
                uses.
Community Commercial Land Use
The Community Commercial designation supplements the central business commercial, retail,
business, and other services by providing a wide range of consolidated shopping opportunities
near residential concentrations. Such activities serve the entire community. Where possible,
these uses should be concentrated into unified retail centers.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 40

                between arterial streets and residential development.
LU 2.7.45       Office Commercial uses are intended as a transition land use between
                residential and more intensive commercial uses. Residential development would
                also be appropriate in this land use designation.
Service Commercial Land Use
Shall mean land designated for general wholesale or heavy commercial uses, which, due to
space requirements or the distinctive nature of their operations, are not usually located in other
commercial centers. Uses that can be located in Neighborhood and Community Commercial
centers should generally be discouraged from locating in Service Commercial areas.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 41

2.9     COMMUNITY HEALTH
The City of Reedley is responsible for protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of its
citizens, and has the ability to do so through implementation of land use plans, policies, and
programs to meet the needs of its community. The built environment and land use decisions
play an important role in shaping the pattern of community development and in either
promoting or discouraging good health for its citizens.
A community’s overall health depends on multiple factors, including the environment they live
in. A healthier living environment reduces health risks and promotes better lifestyle choices.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 47

The overall objective is to make Reedley community health and safety a high priority.

                               Chapter Three
                        Circulation Element
3.0      INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element is intended to function as a comprehensive transportation plan
covering not only streets and highways, but also bikeways, public transportation, railway and
airport systems, and truck routes. The Circulation Element consists of text and an
accompanying Circulation Diagram which indicates the location of major streets and highways
within the Planning Area. In addition, it establishes policies intended to insure optimum
efficiency and safety in the movement of people and goods within and beyond the Planning
Area.
Mandatory circulation element issues, as defined in the statute, are the following:
         (a)    Major Thoroughfares
         (b)    Transportation Routes
         (c)    Terminals
         (d)    Complete Streets
         (e)    Other local public utilities and facilities
The Circulation Element is also to a large extent interdependent with the Land Use Element.
Careful integration of policies within both Elements is required to ensure that there is sufficient
roadway capacity to accommodate existing and future traffic generated by development. The
planning of a surface transportation system must be coordinated and integrated with Fresno
County and Caltrans efforts.
This Circulation Element of the General Plan satisfies California Government Code, Section
65302(b), which requires the General Plan to include a circulation element indicating the
location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
terminals and facilities.
3.1      BACKGROUND
The Circulation Element was last updated in 1993. It contained a list of objectives, goals and
policies pertaining to streets and highways, bikeways, public transportation, railway and airport
systems. The City’s streets system is based on a functional classification system providing four
service levels; major arterials, arterials, collectors and local streets. Circulation in the City of
Reedley is complicated by the change from a diagonal street grid pattern within the central
older portion of the community, to a more traditional north/south and east/west grid system in
the newer areas surrounding the community’s core area. This has created some complex and
inefficient intersections and movement throughout the City.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 50

In 2001, the City of Reedley adopted by resolution, the Reedley Specific Plan. One of the
many goals of the Specific Plan was to rediscover street design concepts of the past where
pedestrians and a slower pace of life were the norm. The Plan called for a return to a grid
pattern for streets that maximizes access options, calms traffic and reduces traffic congestion.
As part of the General Plan 2030 Update, many of the policies in the Reedley Specific Plan
have been incorporated into this General Plan Circulation Element. The revised and new
policies will apply to all development in the City of Reedley in both existing and new growth
areas.
In 2008, the Governor signed Assembly Bill 1358, the California Complete Streets Act. The Act
states that communities must make the most efficient use of urban land and transportation
infrastructure and improve public health by encouraging physical activity by finding innovative
ways to reduce vehicle miles traveled and to shift short trips in an automobile to biking, walking
and public transit.
The Circulation Element Update was also prepared with AB 1358 compliance in mind. Suitable
to the rural nature of the City of Reedley in providing a balanced multi-modal transportation
network on all streets that will provide safety for the pedestrian and those traveling by vehicle.
The City of Reedley is primarily accessible from four major roadways; Reed Avenue from the
north, Manning Avenue from the west, Frankwood Avenue from the south, and Dinuba Avenue
from the east. Other major roadways provide access to State Route 99 to the west and the
neighboring communities of Fresno and Clovis, Dinuba, Orange Cove and Parlier.
Reedley currently provides a localized Dial-A-Ride system and does not have a fixed route bus
system. There is also a fully developed parkway/trails systems which runs through the core of
the City.
3.2     STREET AND HIGHWAY CIRCULATION SYSTEM
Reedley’s surface transportation system is composed of numerous city streets, which, in some
cases, connect to county roads on the peripheral of the City. Other system modalities include
public transit system, fixed route transit services, paratransit services, general aviation and
freight rail services. Where service is available, public transportation is utilized primarily by a
transit-dependent population; i.e., the elderly, students, low-income residents and the
physically handicapped. These segments of the population generally have limited access to
automobiles. Implementation of the Reedley General Plan Circulation Element will improve the
existing regional transportation and circulation system.
The Circulation Element identifies a hierarchy of roads based upon their intended function and
projected travel levels. The City’s surface transportation system of streets and highways is
based on a functional classification system providing four levels of service: major arterials,
arterials, collectors, and local roads. The hierarchy of roadways is listed and briefly described
below in Table 3-1 -Roadway Classifications.
Major Arterial roadways are typically designed with four through lanes, two transition/right-turn
lanes and are divided by a raised median providing left-turn lanes. Major Arterial roadways are
intended to provide a high capacity in selected high volume corridors. Major arterial roadways
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 51

are designed with required right-of-way, as described in the City of Reedley, Standard Plans
and Specifications.
Table 3-1-Roadway Classifications
    Facility Type                                  Functional Emphasis
  Freeway/Highway     Mobility with no direct land access and access limited to interchanges.
     Expressway       Mobility with more frequent access to “arterial” but no direct land access.
        Arterial      Mobility with access to “collectors”, some “local” streets and major traffic
                      generators.
      Collector       Connects “local” streets to “arterials”, also provides access to adjacent land
                      uses; balances mobility and access. May be “major” or “minor” collector
                      streets.
         Local        Access to adjacent land uses only; no mobility function.
         Alley        Access to adjacent land use only, no mobility function.
Arterial roadways are typically designed with four through lanes and two shoulder/transition
lanes and can be divided or undivided by a median. Arterial roadways provide connection to
collector streets and access to major traffic generators. Arterial roadways are designed with
required right-of-way, as described in the City of Reedley, Standard Plans and Specifications.
Collector roadways are typically designed with four through lanes and two parking/transition
lanes and provide connection between arterial streets to local streets. Collector streets can
provide some limited access to private properties. Collector roadways are designed with
required right-of-way as described in the City of Reedley, Standard Plans and Specifications.
Local streets are typically designed for either industrial or residential carrying capacity. Local
streets are intended exclusively to provide direct access to properties and designed to
discourage through traffic between major streets. Typically designed for either industrial or
residential carrying capacity, these street cross-sections can be found in the City of Reedley,
Standard Plans and Specifications. However, local streets are typically not planned by the
General Plan 2030 Update, Land Use and/or Circulation Elements, but existing local streets
may be shown on exhibits for informational purposes.
The City has also developed surface transportation standards for alleys, frontage roads,
secondary and emergency/maintenance access road standards. These standards can be
found in the City of Reedley, Standard Plans and Specifications.
Level of Service
“Level of Service” (LOS) is a description of the ability of a street segment or intersection to
accommodate levels of traffic demand. LOS is a qualitative measure of traffic operating
conditions, whereby a letter grade “A” through “F” is assigned to an intersection or roadway
segment representing worsening representing progressively worsening traffic conditions (See
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                        Page 52

Table 3-2 - Level of Service Description). LOS A, typically represents unrestricted free flow of
traffic and excellent comfort for motorists, to LOS F, which represents highly congested forced
flow conditions where traffic exceeds the capacities of streets. The adopted LOS in the
General Plan 2012, Circulation Element is LOS C, which is also the recommended LOS for
this proposed update.

CIR 3.2.5       The City shall revise roadway standards for future streets to include the
                following:
                (a)     Narrow street widths, particularly on local roadways.
                (b)     Revise geometrics of street intersections, including smaller turning radii,
                        to the maximum extent practicalto slow turning movements, thereby,
                        improving safety for pedestrians.
                (c)     Tree lined streets, including parkways between the curb and sidewalk.
                (d)     Along major streets, landscaped medians shall be constructed.
                (e)     Revised Street Standards shall ensure efficient and safe access for
                        emergency vehicles.
                (f)     Roundabouts shall be located at selected street intersections to improve
                        traffic flow, reduce air emissions and to provide community landmarks.
                (g)     Circulation plans for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic shall provide
                        for effective connections to major community facilities, such as the Kings
                        River, Rail Trail, downtown, Reedley College, Reedley High School,
                        elementary schools, parks and employment areas.
                (h)     Street designs for collector and arterial roadways shall include provisions
                        for future fixed route transit systems.
                (i)     Traffic signals where warrants for traffic demands are met.
CIR 3.2.6       Street standards shall be developed to include street trees planted in planter
                strips between the curb and sidewalk in order to shade paved street surfaces.
CIR 3.2.7       Subdivisions shall be designed to maximize connectivity between subdivisions
                and surrounding development. Use of a grid pattern with reasonable street
                lengths to maximize the number of connections to surrounding collector street
                system is encouraged.
CIR 3.2.8       A walled-in subdivision shall be discouraged unless noise measurements
                exceed the threshold for residential development adjacent to roadways.
CIR 3.2.9       Cul-de-sacs shall feature breaks in the perimeter wall to allow pedestrian and
                visual access to the neighborhood.
CIR 3.2.10      Standards for block lengths shall be developed to eliminate overly long blocks
                that allow for vehicles to reach increased speeds.
CIR 3.2.11      Major arterials shall provide for through traffic movement on continuous routes
                with limited direct access to abutting property. Intersections with cross streets
                are generally at grade and generally spaced a minimum of one-half mile apart.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 56
CIR 3.2.12      Arterials provide for through traffic movement on continuous routes, joining
                major traffic generators, major arterials, and other arterials. Access to abutting
                property should be controlled and limited.
CIR 3.2.13      Collectors provide internal traffic movement within an area and connect local
                roads to the arterial system. Access to abutting property is generally permitted.
CIR 3.2.14      Local streets provide internal traffic movement within an area and primarily serve
                to provide direct access to abutting property.
CIR 3.2.15      Street cross sections may deviate from the standards, if the proposed cross
                section results in increased traffic capacity or circulation. Primarily, deviation
                should be restricted to older sections of the City that cannot accommodate
                current standards. All deviations are subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
CIR 3.2.16      The City shall maintain the landscaping on street rights-of-way on collector and
                arterial roadways by the use of Landscape and Lighting Districts in new areas.
CIR 3.2.17      The City shall explore adoption of a city-wide landscape and lighting district to
                ensure equal maintenance of street rights-of-way.
CIR 3.2.18      Access to property abutting an arterial or collector roadway will be subject to the
                following criteria:
                (a)     Direct access from an arterial or collector to a major traffic generator
                        should be restricted through design requirements on new developments
                        which provide for frontage roads, access to other roads, or limits on the
                        number and location of direct access points. Major traffic generators may
                        be defined as including, but not limited to, large multiple-family residential
                        development, large commercial developments, industrial developments,
                        educational institutions and medical centers.
                (b)     New residential subdivisions should be designed with a minimum number
                        of lots fronting directly on collector streets and with no lots fronting
                        directly on arterial streets. Vehicular access may be permitted from a
                        frontage road or from other roads. Where direct access is provided from
                        a residential subdivision lot to a collector street, turnaround facilities shall
                        be required for each lot as a condition of subdivision approval so that
                        vehicles do not back out onto the roadway.
                (c)     Turnaround facilities shall be required as a condition for a parcel map
                        approval where the new parcels will have direct access to arterial or
                        collector streets. Such turnaround facilities should insure that vehicles
                        need not back out onto the roadway.
CIR 3.2.19      Existing landscaped medians should be extended to their logical conclusion
                within the street and highway system. In particular, Manning Avenue and
                Kingswood Parkway should be extended as new development occurs.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                        Page 57
CIR 3.2.20      The primary street and highway entrances leading into the community should
                have landscaped medians. This would include North Reed Avenue, East Dinuba
                Avenue, North and South Frankwood Avenue and Buttonwillow Avenue between
                Dinuba and South Avenue.
CIR 3.2.21      The City should ensure completion of planned arterial and collector streets as
                they become necessary to serve developing urban areas or unmet traffic
                demands of the City by the following:
                (a)    Adopt a street improvement program based on a needs priority system.
                (b)    Require dedication and improvement of necessary street facilities as a
                       condition of land development.
                (c)    Coordinate the street improvement program with other public service
                       facility improvement programs.
                (d)    Utilize available FCTA, State and Federal funds for street and highway
                       development.
CIR 3.2.22      The City should insure that planned streets and highways operate to their
                maximum efficiency by coordinating their multi-modal use as follows:
                (a)    Develop bikeways in accordance with the City Bikeways Plan.
                (b)    Consider the need for transit and bikeway facilities when establishing the
                       ultimate rights-of-way of streets and highways.
                (c)    The City should prepare typical roadway cross sections which define
                       standards for transit and bikeway facility improvements.
                (d)    Provide additional rights-of-way and improvements off of the travel way of
                       arterial and collector streets where deemed necessary for public
                       transportation.
                (e)    Provide areas for pedestrian travel which will enhance the safety and
                       efficiency of the street system.
CIR 3.2.23      The City should minimize the adverse impact of truck traffic on the community by
                maintaining and enforcing a system of designated truck routes.
CIR 3.2.24      The City should insure the installation of signals, roundabouts, signs, lighting,
                and other traffic improvements necessary for the safe and efficient movement of
                vehicular traffic and pedestrians within the City by the following:
                (a)    Adopt and maintain a traffic safety and operations improvement program
                       based on a needs priority system as part of the City street improvement
                       program.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 58
                (b)     Require the installation of necessary street improvements as a condition
                        of land development.
CIR 3.2.25      The City shall encourage the use of traffic calming designs such as
                roundabouts, bulb-outs, etc., where they will improve the operation or LOS of a
                street.
CIR 3.2.26      The City should minimize the adverse environmental impact of street and
                highway development by utilizing road construction methods which reduce the
                air, water, and noise pollutions associated with such development.
CIR 3.2.27      Where a portion of the right-of-way of a planned new street lies outside the
                boundaries of property proposed for development under a subdivision, site plan
                review, or conditional use permit application, the applicant may be required,
                depending on the magnitude of the development and the amount of traffic it will
                generate, to dedicate sufficient right-of-way width to allow for the development of
                two travel lanes and one shoulder, curb, gutter and planting area.
CIR 3.2.28      Development resulting in any of the following shall be required, as part of the
                special permit approval process, to have a licensed engineer complete a traffic
                impacts study. The scope of that study shall be determined by the City Engineer
                and paid for by the developer.
                (a)     500 vehicle trips per day; or
                (b)     250 a.m. or p.m. peak hour trips; or
                (c)     25 Percent increase to existing traffic conditions from the development
                        project.
CIR3.2.29       Continue to seek and secure financing for all components of the transportation
                system through the use of special taxes, assessment districts, developer
                dedications and fees, or other appropriate mechanisms to be applied uniformly
                throughout the City.
                (a)     The City Engineer shall periodically prepare a report with
                        recommendation to the City Council to ensure transportation funding is
                        sufficient to meet the City’s LOS standard.
CIR 3.2.30      Pursue the implementation of city-wide fees on new development sufficient to
                cover the fair share portion of that development’s impact to the street and
                highway system that is not covered by other funding sources.
CIR 3.2.31      Review of local and regional transportation plans and capital improvement plans
                to ensure that only new development projects consistent with this plan are being
                proposed and funded.
CIR 3.2.32      Prepare and adopt Official Plan Lines or Director Determination for major streets
                to preserve right-of-way needed for future improvements.

City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 61

Analysis of Street and Highway System
The street and highway system previously described is based on an evaluation of the existing
and planned land use patterns, the existing and potential future traffic volumes, the existing
county circulation plans and the previous City circulation plan, and the information developed
as a result of citizen participation workshops. In addition, this Circulation Plan seeks to provide
for the maximum feasible integration between the planned City and County streets and
highway systems to accommodate circulation needs to the year 2030. The analysis also
provides the City a qualitatively analysis to anticipate digression of the surface transportation
system and to respond appropriately.
3.4      BIKEWAYS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
The Reedley Bicycle Transportation Plan is a separate plan adopted consistent with the
Reedley General Plan Circulation Element. The plan consists of text and maps that show both
existing bikeways and future bikeways. The plan is an expression of the City’s intent to
properly assess the needs of cyclists and to develop a bikeway system that can best satisfy
the needs of cyclists in an efficient and effective manner, both in terms of safety and financial
costs. The Circulation Element contains a map depicting a Bikeway Plan, which is the
foundation for the Bicycle Transportation Plan which is updated every five years.
A “bikeway” is a general term for any type of facility that explicitly provides for bicycle travel.
The bikeway can be anything from an independent, grade-separated facility on a separate
right-of-way to just a signed route along a city street. The City of Reedley has three
classifications of bikeways: bike paths, bike lanes, and bike routes, based on the degree of
exclusivity with which the facility is preserved for bicycle use as shown on Figure 3-2. The two
main purposes of bikeways are to guide bicyclists to their destinations and to provide some
measure of protection or safety. The types of bikeways included in a bikeway system will
determine the measure of safety.
Bike Path – is a Class 1 facility which is a special pathway facility for the exclusive use of
bicycles which is separated from motor vehicle facilities by space or a physical barrier. A bike
path may be located on a portion of a street or highway right-of-way not related to a motor
vehicle facility, it may be grade separated, or have street crossings at designated locations. A
bike path is identified with guide signing and may also have pavement markings. An example
of a Class 1 facility is the Reedley Rail Trail/Parkway which provides a separated bike and
pedestrian trail.
Bike Lane – is a Class 2 facility which is a lane on a paved area of road for preferential bicycle
use. It is usually located along the right edge of a paved road area or between the parking lane
and the first motor vehicle lane. A bike lane is identified by “Bike Lane” or “Bike Route” guide
signing, special lane lines and other pavement markings. Bicycles have exclusive use of the
bike lane, but must share the facility with motor vehicles and pedestrians crossing it.
Bike Route – is a recommended route for bicycle travel along an existing right-of-way which is
signed but not striped.
The Bikeway Plan was prepared in conjunction with the updated Reedley Bicycle Master Plan
adopted by the City of Reedley in 2011 and updated to include future streets, Figure 3-2. The
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 62

County of Fresno adopted an update of the Fresno County Regional Bicycle Master Plan in
March 2011. The intent of the Fresno County Regional Bicycle Master Plan is to provide
regional connectivity to the unincorporated areas of Fresno County.
Figure 3.2 - Bikeway Plan Map
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                        Page 63
The proposed Fresno County Regional Bicycle Master Plan identified four bikeway routes
affecting Reedley. The routes are as follows:
        (a)     Manning Avenue Corridor (Fresno County). A Class II bikeway is planned along
                Manning Avenue from the California State Corridor Route (Golden State
                Boulevard) to the Fresno/Tulare County Line (Hills Valley Road) connecting the
                cities of Parlier and Reedley. The corridor also makes connections with the
                Kings River Loop Trail Corridor at Newmark and Reed Avenues (10 Miles).
        (b)     Kings River Loop Trail Corridor (Fresno County). The route extends from the
                Manning Avenue Corridor along Newmark Avenue to Rainbow Road connecting
                the Cities of Parlier and Sanger. The route continues north connecting with the
                Kings River Trail Corridor at Belmont Avenue. The Loop Corridor continues to
                Piedra Road then south along Highway 180 at Centerville to Reed Avenue
                connecting with the City of Reedley and the Manning Avenue Corridor (25
                miles).
        (c)     Reed Bikeway – A future Class II bikeway on Reed Avenue between the City of
                Reedley and the community of Minkler.
        (d)     Reedley Trail – A future Class II bikeway along the old AT&SF rail corridor
                between Reedley and the Tulare County Line.
The Reedley bikeway system is designed to serve all major community traffic generators
including commercial areas, schools, recreational facilities and major public facilities and
connect with regional bicycle facilities. However, the majority of licensed bicycles in Reedley
are operated by elementary school children. A principal emphasis of the Plan is to cater to this
juvenile cycling population by linking residential areas to schools and recreational facilities.
The Plan generally spaces bikeways no more than one-half mile apart. This is based on the
generally recognized standard used both in the United States and abroad for urban bikeways
designed to serve utilitarian riders. The City bikeway system is proposed for development
along existing roadways, rather than along canal or railroad rights-of-way. This is because
bikeway development on the latter would involve more legal constraints and time delays that
would their development on streets which are already under City jurisdiction.
Goals
 CIR 3.4A- Encourage the use of bicycles as a viable means of transportation.
 CIR 3.4B - Develop a continuous and easily accessible bikeways system which facilitates the
 use of the bicycle as a viable alternative transportation mode.
 CIR 3.4C - Develop programs, standards, ordinances, and procedures to achieve and
 maintain safe conditions for bicycle use.
 CIR 3.4D - Encourage bicycling for reasons of ecology, health, economy, and enjoyment as
 well as for transportation use.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                     Page 64

Policies
CIR 3.4.1       Priority should be given to bikeways that will serve the most cyclists and
                destinations of greatest demand.
CIR 3.4.2       Bikeways should be designated near major traffic generators such as
                commercial and employment centers, schools, recreational areas, and major
                public facilities.
CIR 3.4.3       Bicycle parking and storage facilities should be provided at major bicycle traffic
                generators.
CIR 3.4.4       Bikeways should be provided in both existing and future parks where they will
                not cause serious conflicts with other uses of the parks.
CIR 3.4.5       Bikeways should be continuous and should be linked to other bikeways and
                recreation facilities.
CIR 3.4.6       Where ever possible, bikeways should be developed in conjunction with street
                construction and improvement projects occurring along streets and roads where
                bikeways have been designated on the Bikeways Plan map.
CIR 3.4.7       The City and County should develop a coordinated program for the construction
                of bikeways in the Planning Area.
CIR 3.4.8       The design and construction of a bikeway shall conform to the standards
                established by the California Department of Transportation and the City of
                Reedley Standard Plans and Specifications.
CIR 3.4.9       Work with the City of Dinuba to provide a bicycle/pedestrian trail system that will
                connect to a similar system in the City of Reedley near the Sports Park.
CIR 3.4.10      Safe conditions for bicycle use shall be developed and maintained. The
                following shall apply:
                (a)     A visually clear, simple, and consistent bikeway system with clearly
                        defined areas and boundaries should be established.
                (b)     For the safety of those who use the bikeways, the City should consider
                        stopping a bikeway before a major street intersection or dangerous
                        railroad crossing and starting it again after the area has been passed.
                        Within these potentially dangerous areas, bicyclists walk their bicycles or
                        ride with extra caution at their own risk.
                (c)     Through mass media, school, and private efforts, the City of Reedley
                        should encourage a program of education in the rules of the road aimed
                        at both the cyclist and the motorist.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 65
                (d)     Bikeways should be constructed and maintained to reduce or eliminate
                        hazards such as unsafe drainage grated, dirt, glass, gravel, and other
                        debris.
                (e)     The bikeway system should be monitored and evaluated in order to
                        determine the effectiveness of established bikeway facilities in terms of
                        use, safety, and efficiency.
CIR 3.4.11      Require large scale development projects to provide bike racks to encourage
                bicycling as an alternative mode of transportation.
3.5     PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
The City of Reedley’s Community Services Department runs an advance reservation van, and
on-call door-to-door van service. The twelve-passenger vans operate Monday through Friday
between the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. These vans provide service to the downtown
stores and offices (including City Hall, Post Office and Library), the Hot Meals program at the
Community Center, the shopping centers at Buttonwillow and Manning Avenues, the Adventist
Medical Center Hospital and the other locations within a two-mile radius of Reedley. The vans
are also used to transport children from house to school.
Reedley College operates a bus which connects Sanger, Fowler, Selma, and Parlier with the
College. The Kings Canyon Unified School District also provides bus service within its service
area. However, both operations are limited solely to students.
Fresno County Regional Transportation Authority (FCRTA) operates Orange Cove Transit, a
bus service that runs Monday through Friday, twice a day each way, from Orange Cove to the
City of Fresno. There are three stops in the City of Reedley at Manning and Buttonwillow, East
and Springfield, and Manning and Reed.
Dinuba Area Regional Transit (DART) operates a bus that runs from Reedley College,
Adventist Medical Center Hospital and Palm Village to the Dinuba Transit Center. The service
operates at different times ranging from five times a day during the school year to seven times
a day in the summer.
Goals
 CIR 3.5A - Promote the variety of public transit connections with other nearby cities and
 locations.
Policies
CIR 3.5.1       Continue to evaluate public transit needs.
CIR 3.5.2       Explore increased transit opportunities with nearby cities.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 66

3.6     RAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
The steel rail crossing bridge over the Kings River is the old Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway (AT&SF) Bridge. The Exeter Branch of the San Joaquin Valley Railroad (formerly
Southern Pacific Railroad) bridge was wooded and built in 1887. The AT&SF and the SP
provide freight service to the Reedley area. The AT&SF and SP later combined tracks by
Reedley College at Manning Ave during the late 60s to share one river crossing on the newer
ATSF Bridge, 1914 era. The two rail lines then would split over by the winery which was once
served by both railroads.
The ATSF (Santa Fe) Railroad was on property that is now our City’s Rail Trail Bike Path
through our community. This is what is referred to as the Visalia Branch. This line ran from the
Santa Fe Calwa yard. The mainline traveled south through Del Rey, Parlier, Reedley, North
Dinuba, Sultana, Cutler (at one time branched from Cutler north to East Orosi, Orange Cove,
Navelencia passing between Mt. Campbell and the Jesse Morrow Mt. and connected to the
Piedra Line at Hwy 180 and Frankwood), Visalia, Tulare and returned to the mainline in
Corcoran. This Visalia Branch line was sold to the Tulare Valley Railroad and was used by the
San Joaquin Valley Railroad until it was scrapped for rail steel and wood tie value.
The AT&SF’s Visalia branch connects Reedley and eastern Tulare County with the Mainline at
the Calwa freight terminal. The route has one run per day, six days a week after the hour of
6:00 p.m. The San Joaquin Valley Railroad’s (SJVRR) Exeter branch line links Reedley with
Sanger, the Valley Mainline in Fresno, and Ivanhoe, in Tulare County. There is presently one
run per day Monday through Friday between noon and 4:00 p.m. The Visalia and Exeter
Branch lines run parallel to each other through the center of Reedley.
The railroads have a considerable impact on land use within the community, with existing and
planned industrial uses adjacent to the Exeter and Visalia Branch lines. Specifically, the Land
Use Element indicates that industry is the most appropriate area adjoining the tracks. In
addition, the parallel Exeter and Visalia lines separate largely residential areas south of the
tracks from the Central Business District immediately north of the tracks. Access across both
branch lines is limited to grade crossings at a total of eight points: Buttonwillow Avenue,
Dinuba Avenue, Thirteenth Street, Eleventh Street, Tenth Street, Eighth Street, North and
Reed Avenues, and Manning Avenue. Access across the Piedra Branch line, which divides
primarily existing and planned residential areas, is limited to Reed, Manning, and Parlier
Avenues.
Additional rail spurs may be needed in the future within the proposed industrial area south of
Dinuba Avenue, as that area begins to develop with new industry. A new grade crossing of the
SJVRR Branch line will be required when a future collector street south of the Huntsman
Avenue alignment is developed within the planned industrial area as indicated on the
Circulation map.
The City of Reedley is currently processing a request with the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) to become a quiet zone, which would eliminate the train horns at road crossings. This is
important because several crossings are near existing and proposed residential areas.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 67

Goals
 CIR 3.6A - Maintain the viability of the rail service to the community of Reedley.
Policies
CIR 3.6.1       Ensure that development along the rail corridor complies with noise limits
                identified in the Noise Element.
CIR 3.6.2       Pursue the reduction of the noise by eliminating the train horns at intersections
                in the City of Reedley through the continued pursuit of a quiet zone in the City of
                Reedley.
CIR 3.6.3       Maintain the viability of the rail system to encourage continued use for
                commercial and industrial applications.
3.7     AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
Reedley Municipal Airport was established in 1979 following acquisition of the former Great
Western Airport by the City of Reedley. The airport is located on a 138-acre site and consists
of one paved runway serving single and light twin-engine aircraft. The site is located
approximately five miles north of the City on the west side of Frankwood Avenue between
American and Central Avenues, Figure 3-3.
The airport is a Basic Utility Airport, Stage 1. This type of airport accommodates approximately
75 percent of the propeller aircraft under 12,500 pounds and limits operations largely to single-
engine aircraft with some use by light jets and twin-engine aircraft. Such an airport is primarily
intended to serve low-activity locations, such as small population centers and remote
recreation areas. No commercial air carrier service is to be provided to the proposed municipal
airport, and Reedley travelers will still be dependent upon the Fresno Air Terminal or Visalia
Airport for such service.
The City of Reedley is currently proceeding with plans for future development of the Reedley
Municipal Airport. Installation of VASI’s, expansion of the aircraft parking apron, additional
hanger units (a 12-unit structure was built in 1981), and 200-foot southward and northward
extensions of the runway (bringing the airport to Basic Utility State II standards is among the
planned projects).
The City of Reedley contemplates the eventual upgrading of the planned municipal facility to
Basic Utility Airport Stage II Standards, if required by future demands, such expansion is not
part of the current plan and would be subject to the same County, State, and Federal review
and approval process required for the current expansions. See Airport Master Plan for detailed
formation.
The Reedley College campus has a short turf strip, suitable only for the occasional delivery of
aircraft to its aeronautics department. The College has no plans for expanding or upgrading
that facility.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 68

Goals
 CIR 3.7A - Promote the integrity of the Reedley Municipal Airport.

3.8      TRUCK ROUTES SYSTEM
The Reedley City Code authorizes the establishment of truck routes and provides that no truck
is permitted to travel on a street which is not designated as a truck route unless it is for the
purpose of picking up or delivering supplies within the City limits. A truck is defined as a truck,
trailer, wagon or other vehicle that exceeds 10,000 pounds in weight or having a maximum
gross vehicle weight (GVW) of five or more tons.
Existing and planned truck routes are indicated of Figure 3.4 – Truck Routes Map. Truck
routes are indicated on arterial and collector streets which, because of function, pavement
quality, and adjoining land use can best accommodate such traffic.
Goals
  CIR 3.8A - Provide safe and efficient truck routes into and within the community.
Policies
CIR 3.8.1       Truck traffic shall be permitted on the designated arterial and collector streets
                only, as identified in the Circulation Element Truck Route Map, Figure 3-4. Truck
                access through non-designated routes will only be allowed for purposes of
                picking up or delivering supplies within City limits.
CIR 3.8.2       Truck parking shall be prohibited on residential areas for vehicles in excess of
                10,000 GVW, or higher than eight feet.
CIR 3.8.3       Truck parking shall be discouraged on arterial/collector streets outside of the
                industrial park or other designated areas.

                50% shade coverage.
CIR 3.9.6       Maintain existing park and ride facilities and explore opportunities of additional
                sites.
3.10    PUBLIC UTILITIES
The capacity of public utilities that serve a community can affect the quality of life of the
residents of the community. Many public utility services require a significant investment in
infrastructure. The City of Reedley provides water, sewer and storm-water services to the
citizens of Reedley. The City is in the process of updating its Water, Sewer and Storm Drain
Master Plans. As information is available it is being incorporated into the General Plan Update
as part of the analysis.
Water
The City relies on groundwater to provide municipal water service to the citizens of Reedley.
Although the water table has dropped in recent years, the City has not had any difficulty
providing water service. The City operates 7 active water wells (with an additional standby
well), two above-ground water storage towers, and an additional water storage tower facility is
under construction and schedule to be operational in 2014. One of the water storage towers
will be located in the southern area of the City in the sports park complex. The City does
anticipate constructing another water storage tower in the northern area of the City.

                                 Chapter Four
             Conservation, Open Space,
          Parks and RecreationElement
4.0     INTRODUCTION
The Conservation, Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element provides for the conservation,
development and utilization of natural resources including air, biotic, water, soils, rivers, wildlife
and other natural resources and the provision of recreational services to the citizens of
Reedley. This Open Space, Conservation, Parks and Recreation Element does meet State
requirement, pursuant to Government Code Sections 65302(d) and (e). However, unlike other
Elements within the General Plan this Chapter is almost exclusively oriented towards natural
resources and recreation opportunities.
Accordingly, this Element contains goals and policies to conserve, protect and maintain natural
resources such as water, soils, wildlife, and minerals. The Element is also required to contain
goals and policies to protect open space for the protection of places, features and objects,
including local open space, undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Because of the
substantial overlap in these two required elements, they have been combined, along with the
Parks and Recreation Element
Open space generally refers to any water or land which has value for single or multiple open
space functions. Specifically, there are five different functional types of open space. These
include open space for: (1) the preservation of natural resources, including rivers; (2) the
managed production of agricultural and other resources; (3) public health and safety, including
flood plains and unstable soil areas which require special management or regulation; (4)
controlling urban form and preventing inefficient patterns of development; and (5) outdoor
recreation, including parks and areas of historic and cultural value. As used in this Element,
open space refers to land usable by the public for passive or active recreational purposes.
Because air quality is an important issue in Reedley and the Central Valley, air quality issues
are also addressed in this document.
4.1     EXISTING PLANS
Kings River Corridor Specific Plan
In 1990, the City of Reedley adopted the Kings River Corridor Specific Plan for the purpose of
recognizing the Kings River as Reedley’s most important natural resource. As adopted, the
document is the primary implementation document that contains provisions for conservation
and preservation of the Kings River environs. The Specific Plan provides a detailed “blueprint”
of how the river environment will be protected, where recreational facilities and access to the
river will be provided, and how residential and commercial land will be developed. A primary
goal of the Specific Plan is to protect and enhance existing native habitat, wildlife resources,
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                     Page 76

and other aspects of the Kings River environment. Contained in the Plan are policies to
enhance native vegetation, the riparian area, protect “significant natural habitat” by limiting
access to these areas and reforest certain open space lands within the river corridor.
The Kings River Corridor Specific Plan will continue to exist as an adopted Specific Plan
following the General Plan Update. However, State Government Code, Section 65454,
requires specific plans to be consistent with a City’s General Plan. To insure compliance with
the consistency requirement, it is recommended that the Kings River Corridor Specific Plan
undergo a complete review and, as necessary, amended to be consistent with the General
Plan Update.
Park and Recreation Master Plan
In 2009, a Park and Recreation Master Plan was completed and accepted by the City Council.
The plan was a comprehensive effort to identify park and recreation needs for the community.
The Park and Recreation Master Plan was prepared to provide baseline data, policies and
recommendations, as well as standards for future park and recreation facilities. The Master
Plan also included a plan for funding and allocation of resources for parks, recreation facilities
and programs. The baseline data was used in the preparation of the General Plan Update.
Following adoption of the General Plan, it is recommended that the Master Plan be reviewed
for consistency and adopted as a Park and Recreation Master Plan.
4.2     NATURAL RESOURCES
Conservation of natural resources including open space, groundwater, soils and air quality has
been acknowledged as an important factor to the well-being of the community. This
commitment is evidenced by the adoption of the Kings River Specific Plan that strives to
preserve the natural environment surrounding the Kings River, a significant resource for the
community of Reedley.
Recent drought years have raised the level of community awareness and the appreciation of
water as a significant natural resource. Reedley depends upon pumping groundwater from the
unconfined aquifer that underlies the entire San Joaquin Basin for municipal use. Despite past
groundwater abundance, the City of Reedley promotes water conservation to its residents and
provides information, literature and household water saving devices to its water customers.
Goals
 COSP 4.2A - Preserve and protect the natural resources that contribute to the well-being of
 the residents of Reedley.
 COSP 4.2B - Encourage the maximum cooperation among all levels of government and
 private individuals in the management, conservation, and protection of open space
 resources.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 77

Policies
COSP4.2.1       Provide proper supervision of the river area to minimize damage to vegetation,
                minimizes soil erosion, and prevents accumulation of litter.
COSP4.2.2       Foster and maintain the scenic atmosphere of the river front area.
COSP4.2.3       Protect areas of groundwater recharge from land uses and disposal methods
                which would degrade water sources.
COSP4.2.4       Provide public sewer service to new urban development as a means of
                protecting groundwater resources.
COSP4.2.5       To protect human health the City groundwater resources will be monitored on a
                regular basis to test for bacteriological and toxic chemical components.
COSP4.2.6       Promote activities which combine storm-water control and water recharge.
COSP4.2.7       The City will enhance groundwater recharge supply by requiring the installation
                of detention/retention ponds in new growth areas.
COSP4.2.8       Continue to implement provisions of the Kings River Corridor Specific Plan to
                ensure conservation of the riparian area.
COSP4.2.9       The City should modify and expand the Kings River Corridor Specific Plan to
                include determination of appropriate land base on the west bank and riparian
                area of the Kings River.
COSP4.2.10 Continue to encourage water conservation.
4.3     AGRICULTURE
The conservation and preservation of agricultural lands within the Reedley area is in large part,
a function of adopted Fresno County land use policies and agricultural zone districts that
substantially preserve and protect agricultural lands from conversion and urban encroachment.
Agricultural land contained within the Reedley sphere of influence is predominantly within the
unincorporated area. This land will eventually be converted to urban uses as development
occurs within the ultimate sphere of influence boundary.
Goals
 COSP 4.3A - To preserve prime farmland, farmland of statewide importance and farmland of
 local importance within the Reedley Planning Area.
 COSP 4.3B - To provide a greenbelt around the City’s perimeter to maintain the physical
 separation between the City of Reedley and the Cities of Dinuba and Parlier.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 78

Policies
COSP4.3.1       Support the County of Fresno efforts to preserve and protect farmlands outside
                the urban area.
COSP4.3.2       Maintain a 20-acre minimum parcel size for agriculture designated parcels to
                encourage viable agricultural operations and to prevent parcelization into rural
                residential or ranchette developments.
4.4     AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE
AB 170 passed in 2003, requiring cities in the San Joaquin Valley to include data, analysis,
comprehensive goals, policies, and feasible implementation strategies to improve air quality.
Air Quality and Climate Change goals and policies address these requirements, as well as a
clear commitment to take action on reducing air emissions, including greenhouse gases.
Appendix “A” contains additional background information.
This document provides a comprehensive set of goals and policies that promote development
patterns, site designs, and transportation systems that support alternatives to the automobile.
As development occurs in a manner consistent with air quality goals and policies, local
government control measures will be more effective and growth in vehicle trips and vehicle
miles traveled will be reduced.
Overall strategies include:
        (a)     A commitment to determine and mitigate project level and cumulative air quality
                impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
        (b)     A commitment to integrate land use plans, transportation plans, and air quality
                plans.
        (c)     A commitment to plan land uses in ways that support a multi-modal
                transportation system.
        (d)     A commitment to take local action to support programs that reduce congestion
                and vehicle trips.
        (e)     A commitment to plan land uses to minimize public exposure to toxic air
                pollutant emissions from industrial and other sources.
        (f)     A commitment to reduce particulate emissions from sources under local
                jurisdiction.
        (g)     A commitment of support for District and public utility programs to reduce
                emissions from energy consumption and area sources (water heaters,
                barbecues, etc.).
The San Joaquin Valley has a serious air pollution problem that will take the cooperation of
cities, the development community, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                Page 79

(SJVAPCD), and the public to solve. The solution to the problem requires a fundamental shift
in priorities from emphasis on private automobiles to a multi-modal system, as well as a
change in attitude from the public to support development patterns and transportation systems
that differ from the status quo.
The U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin
as a non-attainment basin for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). This
means that SJVAPCD plans for achieving National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
must include stringent emission control measures to attain standards by the deadlines
specified in the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). If the District’s plans fail to meet all requirements,
the EPA will take action to exert increasing federal presence in controlling emissions, ranging
from sanctions to preparation of a federal plan for attaining ambient standards.
Why Technology Has Not Won the Battle
Mobile sources are a substantial portion of the pollutant inventory in the San Joaquin Valley.
Although cars and trucks are getting cleaner, rapid population growth and increased vehicle
miles traveled can offset improvements achieved through technology. This is unacceptable
considering that federal law mandates us to reduce emissions of ozone precursors by at least
three percent per year until air quality standards are attained. Any slack created by increases
in motor vehicle emissions must be made up from job-producing stationary sources, or we will
face the consequences of federal actions to reduce emissions.
Potential Air Quality Benefits
A small community that comprehensively plans an area so that land uses are supportive of
walking, bicycling, and transit can achieve long-range trip reductions of 5 to 10 percent
compared to standard suburban development patterns. Many communities in the Central
Valley are attempting to plan their growth in ways that address a number of problems.
Increasing traffic congestion, loss of farmland, urban sprawl and lack of money to support
public infrastructure and services, are concerns of many Valley communities. A number of the
goals and policies promote the concept of more livable places being implemented. These
planning concepts use the strong application of urban design techniques, compact
development, and more efficient transportation systems to achieve goals.
Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change
There are many strategies local government can undertake to reduce GHG emissions, and
help minimize the extent of climate change that does occur. Some of the strategies depend on
coordinated action with other agencies and levels of government; others can be implemented
independently. In addition to implementing programs to reduce its own carbon emissions, local
government has an important role to play in reducing private sector GHG emissions. A local
government that has implemented some of these strategies in its own municipal operations is
in a good position to demonstrate savings and encourage business participation in these types
of programs.
In the majority of cases, measures implemented to reduce GHG emissions will also contribute
to improved air quality. Since the City of Reedley is in an area where air quality does not meet
state and federal health standards, GHG reduction measures make sense from a local public
benefit perspective since they would likely contribute to improved local air quality. In general,
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                      Page 80

public support and acceptance of GHG reduction efforts will be enhanced by the clear
presentation of the co-benefits associated with these actions. This presents a significant
opportunity to local decision makers to help improve public health and welfare while
simultaneously addressing the issue of climate change.
Greenhouse Gases and Their Sources
In California and throughout western North America, signs of a changing climate are evident.
As the atmospheric concentration of GHGs increases, California can anticipate increased
average temperatures of 1 to 2 degrees in the next few decades, and perhaps as much as 100
by the end of the century. While total annual precipitation is not expected to change
substantially, a much greater percentage will fall as rain instead of snow, with a corresponding
decrease in snowpack and the spring runoff that supplies water to agriculture and major urban
centers. Reduced water supplies and increased temperatures will directly impact which crops
can be grown in California and the state’s forests will likely sustain an increase in wildfires.
Finally, the predicted rise in sea level from 3 to 6 feet by the end of the century will drastically
alter California’s extensive coast, as well as low-lying inland areas, land along tributaries, inlets
and bays.
Carbon dioxide is the most dominant greenhouse gas; however, a number of other gases also
contribute significantly to climate change, including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6), hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). From a
land use standpoint, carbon dioxide and methane are the most important GHGs that local
government can influence and will be the primary focus of the recommended policies and
reduction strategies.
Increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere primarily result from increased combustion
of fossil fuels. The transportation sector is the largest contributor in California, accounting for
38% of CO2 emissions, with gasoline combustion the greatest portion of those emissions.
Methane accounted for approximately 6 percent of California’s total GHG (CO2e) emissions in
2002, with landfill decomposition accounting for the majority of CH4 emissions in California.
Agricultural processes such as fermentation, manure management, and rice cultivation are
also significant sources of CH4.
Over the last several years, a number of new programs have been established to reduce
emissions of GHGs. While most of these do not operate directly on or through General Plans,
they create a strong foundation upon which General Plan elements for GHGs can be built. This
section of the report provides a brief summary of the key programs.
State Reduction Targets for GHGs (Executive Order S-3-05)
The first comprehensive state policy to address climate change was Executive Order S-3-05,
signed in 2005, which established ambitious GHG reduction targets: reduce GHG emissions to
2000 levels by 2010, reduce to 1990 levels by 2020, and reduce emissions 80% below 1990
levels by 2050. This Executive Order is binding only on state agencies, and has no force of
law for local governments; however, S-3-05 sent a clear signal to the Legislature about the
framework and content for legislation to reduce GHG emissions.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 81

Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32)
California AB 32, the “Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,” codifies the State’s GHG
emissions target by directing the Air Resources Board (ARB) to reduce the State’s global
warming emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. ARB regulations must begin phasing in by 2012.
AB 32 defines a number of milestones to be met in the effort to achieve the 2020 emissions
target. The cornerstone of the program is the adoption by ARB of a Scoping Plan, approved by
the ARB Board in November, 2008. The Plan specifies the target level of GHG emissions that
must be achieved by 2020, and estimates levels that would occur in the absence of reduction
measures – the “business-as-usual” scenario. The difference represents the quantity of
emissions that must be reduced by the measures in the plan.
In December of 2007, the ARB approved the baseline inventory analysis of the GHG
emissions in California in 1990; total GHG emissions were 427 MMTCO2(e). ARB estimates
that under the business-as-usual scenario, GHG emissions will rise to 596 MMTCO2(e) by
2020. In order to comply with the mandates of AB 32, California must implement strategies
sufficient to remove 169 MMTCO2(e). This represents an overall reduction of 30% from
business-as-usual, and about 10% from the levels emitted today. On a per capita basis, each
Californian will be responsible for nearly 14 tons of CO2(e) in 2020 under a business-as-usual
scenario, and that needs to be reduced to about 10 tons for each man, woman, and child.
The greatest contribution comes from the transportation sector, which is responsible for about
                                  1
60.2 MMTCO2(e) in reductions . The electricity sector is the second largest contributor, with a
total of 49.7 MMTCO2(e). Specifically in regard to reductions from improvements in land use,
the Scoping Plan discusses establishing Regional Targets for GHG reduction, and requiring an
integrated planning process for transportation, air quality, and General Plans. This approach is
further supported by SB 375, discussed below. The Scoping Plan also discusses two primary
ways in which local governments can achieve direct GHG reductions other than improved land
use planning. These involve local government action and actions by businesses and residents
within their communities to reduce energy use, increase recycling, reduce waste and water
use, reduce energy used in the handling and treatment of waste and water, and reduce carbon
emissions from vehicle fleets.
Improved Land Use Planning (SB 375)
In September, 2008, the Governor signed Senate Bill 375 with five main provisions:
        (a)     It requires Air Resources Board (ARB) to establish regional targets for
                reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from use of light duty vehicle
                (passenger cars and small trucks) associated with land use decisions.
        (b)     It requires creation of a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) to meet the
                reduction targets established by ARB – the local SCS will be prepared by the
                Fresno Council of Governments (COG) as part of the Regional Transportation
                Plan (RTP).

 The two primary methods to reduce vehicle GHG emissions in California are AB 1493 – GHG emission
standards for automobiles – and Executive Order S-1-07 – Low Carbon Fuel Standards.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 82

        (c)     It requires that funding decisions for regional transportation projects be internally
                consistent within the RTP.
        (d)     It aligns the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) with the RTP.
        (e)     It provides CEQA relief, in the form of streamlining and exemptions, for projects
                are consistent with the SCS.
Sustainable Communities Strategy- The Sustainable Communities Strategy will constitute the
land use element of the RTP. The SCS is required to:
        (a)     Identify the general location of uses, residential densities, and building
                intensities within the region.
        (b)     Identify areas to house all the population of the region, including all economic
                segments, over the course of the planning period of the RTP (i.e., 25 years).
        (c)     Identify areas sufficient to house an eight-year projection of the regional housing
                need (i.e., an eight-year RHNA).
        (d)     Identify a transportation network to service the transportation needs of the
                region.
        (e)     Forecast a development pattern that will achieve the targeted greenhouse-gas
                emission reduction from automobiles and light trucks.
Technically, SB 375 does not require the local General Plan to conform to the SCS.
Conformity is strongly encouraged, however, through funding incentives and CEQA
streamlining. Finally, the SCS is subject to approval by ARB, but ARB’s role is limited to a
determination of whether the measures included in the SCS will achieve the target ARB
established for the region.
If the SCS will not achieve the reduction goals, an Alternative Planning Strategy (APS) must
be prepared by the COG. It is important to note that the APS is not part of the SCS, and is
therefore not part of the RTP. Under SB 375, the APS is not a binding commitment; however,
consistency with the APS can provide some streamlining and regulatory relief under CEQA.

                space and resource conservation issues. When feasible, such programs should
                be coordinated with local school districts and community groups.
4.14    CULTURAL RESOURCES
Several State laws, most common is the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), protect
archaeological and historical resources. To preserve historic resources, the State has formed
the State Historical Resources Committee. The committee maintains the California Register of
Historic Resources, which identifies historic resources and points of interest and the committee
provides recommendations for the National Register of Historic Places.
The lands within the Planning Area have a long history of human habitation, including
habitation by the Southern Valley Yokut Indians. The Reedley area was the territory of the
Wechikit or WechikitYokuts.
As was the case all over California, the arrival of the railroad, even miles away, stimulated
commercial agricultural development. In 1884, Civil War veteran Thomas Law Reed moved to
what is now Reedley and began farming more than 2,000 acres. Reed’s land included what
was to become the entire Reedley town site of 360 acres.
Archaeological and Historical Resources
According to the Southern San Joaquin Valley Archaeological Information Center at California
State University Bakersfield, 30 recorded cultural resources are found in and within a 1-mile
radius of the project area. Four of these sites are Native American archaeological sites or
isolates, while the remainders are historic buildings and sites. Two sites are listed on the
National Register of Historic Places and on the California Register of Historic Resources, the
Reedley Opera House and the Old Bank of America Building.
Goals
 COSP 4.14A - Protect the cultural heritage of Reedley.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                 Page 101

                California Environmental Quality Act.
COSP4.14.5 Update the City of Reedley inventory of historic and archaeological resources to
                determine sites or buildings of local, State, or Federal significance.
4.15    PARKS AND RECREATION
While the goals and policies of the combined Open Space and Conservation Element address
the various functional types of open space and conservation, the Parks and Recreation section
of the Element is concerned primarily with passive and active outdoor recreational facilities
located within the Reedley Planning Area. Specifically, the Parks and Recreation Section is
intended to guide the amount, location, and kind of urban outdoor recreation facilities
necessary to meet the present and future needs of the Reedley area.
The City of Reedley is committed to improving the parks and recreation opportunities available
to residents. Neighborhood and community parks are an important component of Reedley’s
quality of life. The benefits of specialized recreation areas, community and neighborhood
parks, open space and trails only serve to increase property values and create stronger
community ties which are crucial factors in any city’s long term growth.
The City of Reedley did extensive community outreach as part of the preparation of a Parks
and Recreation Master Plan. The Master Plan identified the following objectives:
        (a)     Identify current and future park and recreation needs.
        (b)     Identify current and future facility needs.
        (c)     Identify current and future recreation program needs.
        (d)     Review and update current park facility standards.
        (e)     Identify the amount and types of parkland needed to be acquired or developed
                to satisfy established park ration standards.
        (f)     Identify the locations for new parks and facilities based on park needs, types
                and distance recommendations.
        (g)     Develop strategies addressing park safety and reducing gang activity.

         (h)    Develop funding strategies and identify potential revenue alternatives.
         (i)    Address the financial needs for meeting the goals and policies set forth.
         (j)    Develop a timeline to prioritize the City’s goals for future park development and
                improvements.
         (k)    Establish design and maintenance standards for parks.
         (l)    Involve the community and gain their input, perception and support.
         (m)    Provide policies and guidelines.
Existing Park Facilities
Currently, the City of Reedley manages 72.48 acres of developed acreage which includes 13
formal parks, four facilities and the trail system. Previously, the City classified parks into four
sub-categories; pocket, neighborhood, community/regional and school joint-use facilities. As
part of the General Plan Update, the new park classifications are Neighborhood, Community,
Special Recreation Area, and Multi-use Trail. Open space, joint-use facilities, and community
facilities are not calculated as part of the parkland acreage per thousand residents.
Currently, the City of Reedley has a ratio of 2.63 acres of park per thousand residents based
on developed park/trail area of 68.82 acres and a population of 26,227. The park ratio is based
on neighborhood parks, community parks, specialized recreational area and trails. Table 4-1
summarizes Reedley existing park acreage. Figure 4.1 illustrates the location of existing parks,
as well as proposed facilities.

4.16     PARK CLASSIFICATIONS
Neighborhood Parks
Previously categorized as pocket parks, which were allowed to be as small as 7,000 square
feet, neighborhood parks are defined as park areas totaling one to three acres and intended to
serve as a neighborhood recreation/open space area primarily within newly created
subdivisions. Currently there are five neighborhood parks totaling 2.24 developed acres and
4.16 undeveloped acres. Smaller pocket parks will not be allowed to be substituted for larger
one to three acre parks. If a developer wants to dedicate and construct the improvements at
the developers cost a pocket park would be permitted, but the acreage will not be credited for
development impact fees and will not be counted towards neighborhood park acreages.
Maintenance of pocket parks as part of a development can be included in the landscape and
lighting district for the subdivision at the developer’s request.
New neighborhood parks should be centrally located within neighborhoods and designed so
that as many lots will face the park as possible “eyes on the park” and shall serve an area
between ½ to 1 mile radius.
Existing Neighborhood Parks
         (a)      East Carob - .30 ac. developed
         (b)      East Myrtle - .50 ac. developed
         (c)      Carpenter/Cyrier - .25 ac. developed
         (d)      Columbia Park - .72 ac. developed

        (e)     East Carpenter - .17 ac. developed
        (f)     Tobu Park - 4.16 ac. undeveloped
Community Parks
Currently, there are five developed community parks, together totaling 29.75 developed and
5.90 undeveloped acres. Community parks are defined as parks between 1 and 15 acres in
size, which offer a variety of recreational opportunities intended primarily for use by the
community’s residences.
Existing Community Parks
        (a)     CF Mueller – 6.93 ac. developed/ .30 ac. undeveloped
        (b)     Camacho* - 8.01 ac. developed/ .82 ac. undeveloped
        (c)     Pioneer – 1.38 ac. developed
        (d)     Citizens – 9.60 ac. developed / 1.74 ac. undeveloped
        (e)     Smith’s Ferry – 3.83 ac. developed / 3.04 ac. Undeveloped
        (*Camacho total includes .53 acres of developed parking lot)
Specialized Recreation Area
The current developed specialized recreation areas total 13.60 acres and 60.60 undeveloped
acres. Specialized recreational areas are used by the community, but because of their
distinctive qualities, may also draw visitors from outside the City of Reedley thus require
special consideration and may be operated differently from traditional parks.
Existing Specialized Recreation Areas
        (a)     Reedley Beach – .30 ac. developed / 18.06 undeveloped
        (b)     Cricket Hollow – 4.50 ac. developed / 2.38 ac. undeveloped
        (c)     Reedley Sports Park – 8.08 ac. developed / 40.16 ac. undeveloped
Multi-use Trail
Multi-use trails are typically located within greenways, corridors, parks or natural areas and are
relatively uninterrupted. Trails serve as a connective structure of the park and recreation
system and provide safe, alternative modes of transportation. Multi-use trails also provide a
link to the existing regional trail system such as the Fresno County Bikeway, Tulare County
Bikeway and Blossom Trail. The City of Reedley currently maintains the Community Parkway
Rails to Trails, comprising 23.23 developed acres and 6.27 undeveloped acres which stretch
2.5 miles from South Buttonwillow to the Kings River.

Open Space
Land which is unsuitable for development, but offers significant natural resource potential is
also defined as open space. Currently, there is approximately 86.87 acres of undeveloped and
unmanaged open space. The area is along the Kings River Corridor. The future development
of this area as a park and community recreational resource is detailed in the Kings River
Corridor Specific Plan.
Recreation/Community Facilities
The City of Reedley has three facilities that are not considered parks or open space, but
provide opportunities for recreation. The Community Center, Luke Trimble Pool and the Opera
House are all valuable community assets.
Public School Joint Use Facilities
There is a joint-use agreement between the Kings Canyon Unified School District, Reedley
Community College and the City of Reedley for joint use of recreational facilities.
4.17    PARK STANDARDS AND DEMAND
The City’s park standard is four acres of parks per thousand persons. The park acreage is
calculated using neighborhood, community, specialized areas and trails. The build-out of the
General Plan would result in approximately 21,142 new residents, with a total 2030 population
of 47,369. Using the standard four acres per thousand criteria, the City of Reedley will need
189.47 acres of parkland. The City of Reedley currently has 68.82 acres of developed parks,
so would need an additional 120.65 acres of developed park land. The City currently owns an
additional 76.93 acres of land that is undeveloped. By 2030, the City will need to develop the
undeveloped acreage and acquire an additional 43.71 acres to meet the standard of four acres
per thousand persons. Table 4-2 identifies existing park land and future needs.

                                      Technical Information
EXISTING AIR QUALITY AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
This section describes the impacts of the proposed Project on local and regional air quality,
based on the assessment guidelines of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
(SJVAPCD). This section describes existing air quality, construction-related impacts, direct
and indirect emissions associated with the proposed Project, the local and regional impacts of
those emissions, and mitigation measures warranted to reduce or eliminate any identified
significant impacts.
Air quality is regulated by several agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution
Control District (SJVAPCD). Each of these agencies develops rules and/or regulations to attain
the goals or directives imposed upon them through legislation. Although EPA regulations may
not be superseded, both State and local regulations may be more stringent. In general, air
quality evaluations are based upon air quality standards developed by the federal government
and several State agencies. Emissions limitations are then imposed upon individual sources of
air pollutants by local agencies, such as the SJVAPCD. Mobile sources of air pollutants are
largely controlled through federal and State agencies, while most stationary sources are
regulated by the SJVAPCD.
Regulatory Background
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
The EPA is responsible for implementing the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), which passed in
1970 and was last amended in 1990 to form the basis for the national air pollution control
effort. The FCAA required the EPA to establish primary and secondary Federal and State
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as shown in Table 4-3, and reassess, at least every
five years, whether adopted standards are adequate to protect public health based on current
scientific evidence.
The FCAA also required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as a State
Implementation Plan (SIP). The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (FCAAA) added
requirements for states with nonattainment areas to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional
control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is periodically modified to reflect the latest
emissions inventories, planning documents, and rules and regulations of the air basins as
reported by their jurisdictional agencies. The EPA has responsibility to review all state SIPs to
determine conformation to the mandates of the FCAAA and determine if implementation will
achieve air quality goals. If the EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, a Federal
Implementation Plan (FIP) may be prepared for the nonattainment area that imposes
additional control measures. Failure to submit an approvable SIP or to implement the plan in
the mandated timeframe may result in sanctions being applied to transportation funding and
stationary air pollution sources in the air basin.

California Air Resources Board (CARB)
CARB is responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control
programs and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The CCAA requires that
all air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain the California Ambient Air Quality
Standards (CAAQS) by the earliest practical date. The act specifies that districts should focus
particular attention on reducing the emissions from transportation and area-wide emission
sources, and provides districts with the authority to regulate indirect sources.
The CARB is primarily responsible for developing and implementing air pollution control plans
to achieve the NAAQS. The CARB is primarily responsible for statewide pollution sources and
produces a major part of the SIP. However, local air districts are still relied on to provide
additional strategies for sources under their jurisdiction. The CARB combines local district data
and submits the completed SIP to the EPA.
Other CARB duties include monitoring air quality (in conjunction with air monitoring networks
maintained by air pollution control and air quality management districts), establishing the
CAAQS (which in many cases are more stringent than the NAAQS), determining and updating
area designations and maps, and setting emissions standards for new mobile sources,
consumer products, small utility engines, and off-road vehicles.
San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
The SJVAPCD attains and maintains air quality conditions in Fresno County through a
comprehensive program of planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and
promotion of the understanding of air quality issues. The clean air strategy of the SJVAPCD
includes the preparation of plans for the attainment of ambient air quality standards, adoption
and enforcement of rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, and issuance of
permits for stationary sources of air pollution. The SJVAPCD also inspects stationary sources
of air pollution and responds to citizen complaints, monitors ambient air quality and
meteorological conditions, and implements programs and regulations required by the FCAA
and the CCAA. In January of 2002, the SJVAPCD released a revision to the previously
adopted guidelines document. This revised Guide for Assessing and Mitigating Air Quality
Impacts (GAMAQI) is an advisory document that provides lead agencies, consultants, and
project applicants with uniform procedures for addressing air quality in environmental
documents. The GAMAQI contains the following applicable components:
         (a)     Criteria and thresholds for determining whether a project may have a significant
                 adverse air quality impact.
         (b)     Specific procedures and modeling protocols for quantifying and analyzing air
                 quality impacts.
         (c)     Methods available to mitigate air quality impacts.
         (d)     Information for use in air quality assessments and EIRs that will be updated
                 more frequently such as air quality data, regulatory setting, climate, topography,
                 etc.

ISR- Indirect Source Review - As population continues to grow and more vehicles are put on
roads, air quality will continue to be an issue due to an increase in emissions. To address this
concern, the SJVAPCD adopted Rule 9510 and Rule 3180 to mitigate construction, area, and
operational emissions created by development (valleyair.org/ISR/ISROverview.htm).
Any of the following projects require an application to be submitted unless the projects have
mitigated emissions of less than two tons per year each of NOX and PM10. Projects that are at
least:
        (a)     50 residential units.
        (b)     2,000 square feet of commercial space.
        (c)     9,000 square feet of educational space.
        (d)     10,000 square feet of government space.
        (e)     20,000 square feet of medical or recreational space.
        (f)     25,000 square feet of light industrial space.
        (g)     39,000 square feet of general office space.
        (h)     100,000 square feet of heavy industrial space.
        (i)     Or, 9,000 square feet of any land use not identified above.
Air Quality Plans- The SJVAPCD submitted the 1991 Air Quality Attainment Plan in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the CCAA. In addition, the CCAA requires a
triennial assessment of the extent of air quality improvements and emission reductions
achieved through the use of control measures. As part of this assessment, the attainment plan
must be reviewed and, if necessary, revised to correct for deficiencies in progress and to
incorporate new data or projections. The CCAA requirement for a first triennial progress report
and revisions of the 1991 Air Quality Attainment Plan was first fulfilled with the preparation and
adoption of the 1995-1997 Triennial Progress Report and Plan Revision. Triennial reports were
also prepared for 1995-1997, 1997-1999, and 1999-2001 in compliance with the CCAA.
In an effort to reach attainment for ozone, the SJVAPCD submitted the 1994 Ozone
Attainment Demonstration Plan. This plan stresses ozone attainment and focuses on
strategies reducing NOx and ROG air emissions by promoting active public involvement,
enforcement of compliance with rules and regulations, public education in both the public and
private sectors, development and promotion of transportation and land use programs designed
to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the region, and implementation of stationary and
mobile source control measures.
In addition to the above mentioned items, the SJVAPCD has submitted numerous plans with
respect to ozone, PM10, and CO in compliance with the FCAA and CCAA, as listed below:
        (a)     1992 Federal Attainment Plan for Carbon Monoxide.

Physical Setting
Reedley is located in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB) which occupies the southern
half of the Central Valley and is approximately 250 miles long and 35 miles wide. The Coast
Range serves as the western border of the SJVAB. The Tehachapi Mountains, part of the
Sierra Nevada, are located to the south of the SJVAB. The Sierra Nevada extends in a
northwesterly direction and forms the eastern boundary of the SJVAB. The ranges to the west
and south induce winter storms from the Pacific to release precipitation on the western slopes,
producing a partial rain shadow over the valley. In addition, the mountain ranges block the free
circulation of air to the east resulting in the entrapment of stable air in the valley for extended
periods during cooler months.
Winter in the SJVAB is characterized as mild and humid, while the summer is hot and dry.
During summer, a Pacific high-pressure cell is centered over the northeastern Pacific Ocean,
resulting in stable meteorological conditions and a steady northwesterly wind flow. In winter,
the high-pressure cell weakens and shifts southward, resulting in wind flow offshore and
storms.
Summer temperatures that often exceed 100 degrees coupled with clear sky conditions are
favorable to ozone formation. Winds and unstable atmospheric conditions associated with
winter storms result in periods of low air pollution and excellent visibility. However, between
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 115
winter storms, high pressure and light winds lead to the creation of temperature inversions and
stable atmospheric conditions which results in high CO and PM concentrations. Summer wind
conditions promote the transport of ozone and its precursors from the Bay Area through the
Carquinez Strait, Altamont Pass, and Pacheco Pass.
With respect to Reedley, the annual normal precipitation is approximately 11 inches. January
temperatures range from a normal of 34 degrees to 54 degrees. July temperatures range from
a normal of 62 degrees to 96 degrees. The predominant wind direction and speed is from the
north-northwest at 8 mph.
Existing Ambient Air Quality
The CARB and the U.S. EPA currently focus on the following air pollutants as indicators of
ambient air quality: O3, CO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter
(PM), and lead. Because these are the most prevalent air pollutants known to be deleterious to
human health, they are commonly referred to as “criteria air pollutants.”
EPA has established primary and secondary NAAQS for the following criteria air pollutants:
O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and lead. The primary standards
protect the public health and thesecondary standards protect the public welfare. In addition to
the NAAQS, CARB has established CAAQS for the following criteria air pollutants: sulfates,
hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility-reducing particulate matter. In most cases the
CAAQS are more stringent than the NAAQS. The NAAQS and CAAQS as discussed above
are listed in Table 4.3.
Criteria air pollutant concentrations are measured at several monitoring stations in the SJVAB,
including seven monitoring stations in Fresno County. The Fresno-First Street site, Fresno-
Skypark site, and the Parlier site were chosen to represent the ambient air quality in the
vicinity of Reedley. The two Fresno air monitoring locations are closest in relation to the project
area, while the Parlier site is located southeast of the community. Table 4-4 summarizes air
quality data from these locations for the most recent years available. Ambient air quality
conditions with respect to each separate criteria pollutant are described below.

Both CARB and EPA use monitoring data to designate areas according to their attainment
status for criteria air pollutants. The purpose of the designations is to identify those areas with
air quality problems and thereby initiate planning efforts for improvement. The three basic
designation categories are Nonattainment, Attainment, and Unclassified. Unclassified is used
in an area that cannot be classified on the basis of available information as meeting or not
meeting the standards. In addition, the California designations include a subcategory of the
Nonattainment designation, called Nonattainment-Transitional. The Nonattainment-Transitional
designation is given to Nonattainment areas that are progressing and nearing Attainment.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 117

Ozone
Ozone (O3) is a photochemical oxidant, a substance whose oxygen combines chemically with
another substance in the presence of sunlight, and the primary component of smog. Ozone is
not directly emitted into the air, but is formed through complex chemical reactions between
precursor emissions of Reactive Organic Gases (ROG) and NOx in the presence of sunlight.
ROG are volatile organic compounds that are photo chemically reactive. ROG emissions result
primarily from incomplete combustion and the evaporation of chemical solvents and fuels. NOx
are a group of gaseous compounds of nitrogen and oxygen that results from the combustion of
fuels.
Ozone occurs in two layers of the atmosphere. The layer surrounding the earth’s surface is the
troposphere. Here, ground level or “bad” ozone is an air pollutant that damages human health,
vegetation, and many common materials. It is a key ingredient of urban smog because sunlight
and heat serve as catalysts for the reaction between ozone precursors, peak ozone
concentrations typically occur during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The
troposphere extends to a level about 10 miles up, where it meets the second layer, the
stratosphere. The stratospheric or “good” ozone layer extends upward from about 10 to 30
miles and protects the earth from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays (UV-B).
The adverse health effects associated with exposure to ozone pertain primarily to the
respiratory system. Scientific evidence indicates that ambient levels of ozone affect not only
sensitive receptors, such as asthmatics and children, but healthy adults as well. Exposure to
ambient levels of ozone ranging from 0.10 to 0.40 ppm for 1 to 2 hours has been found to
significantly alter lung functions by increasing respiratory rates and pulmonary resistance,
decreasing tidal volumes, and impairing respiratory mechanics. Ambient levels of ozone above
0.12 ppm are linked to symptomatic responses that include such symptoms as throat dryness,
chest tightness, headache, and nausea. In addition to the above adverse health effects,
evidence also exists relating ozone exposure to an increase in the permeability of respiratory
epithelia; such increased permeability leads to an increase in responsiveness of the
respiratory system to challenges, and the interference or inhibition of the immune system’s
ability to defend against infection.
With respect to the NAAQS, Fresno County is currently designated as a Severe Non-
Attainment area for the National 8-hour ozone standard. In addition, Fresno County is
currently designated as a Severe Non-Attainment area for the state 8-hour ozone standard.
As shown in Table 2, the national 1-hour ozone standard had been exceeded a majority of the
years in the past 20 years in all three collection locations. A sign of improvement has been
displayed in the past 3 years with a reduction in the days exceeding the standards. A similar
trend is noticed in the same table for the days exceeding the standards. A similar trend is
noticed in the same table for the days exceeding the state ozone standards. Maximum peak
ozone values in the SJVAB have trended downwards over the last twenty years. The number
of days on which the national 1-hour standard has been exceeded has been variable over the
years, but indicates an overall improvement; however, the ozone problem in the SJVAB still
ranks among the most severe inCalifornia.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                              Page 118

Particulate Matter
Particulate matter pollution consists of very small particles suspended in the air, which can
include smoke, soot, dust, salts, acids, and metals. Particulate matter also forms when
industry and gaseous pollutant undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Respirable
particulate matter (PM10) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) represent fractions of particulate
matter.
PM10 refers to particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter and PM2.5 refers to
particulate matter that is 2.5 microns or less in diameter. Major sources of PM2.5 include
diesel fuel combustion (from motor vehicles, power generation, and industrial facilities),
residential fireplaces, and wood stoves. PM10 sources include all PM2.5 sources as well as
emissions from dust generated by construction, landfills, and agriculture; wildfires and
brush/waste burning, industrial sources, windblown dust from open lands, and atmospheric
chemical and photochemical reactions. The adverse health effects associated with PM10
depend on the specific composition of the particulate matter. For example, health effects may
be associated with metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other toxic substances
absorbed onto fine particulate matter, which is referred to as the piggybacking effect, or with
fine dust particles of silica or asbestos.
Generally, adverse health effects associated with PM10 may result from both short-term and
long-term exposure to elevated PM10 concentrations and may include breathing and
respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
alterations to the immune system, carcinogenesis, and premature death. PM2.5 poses an
increased health risk because the particles can deposit deep in the lungs and contain
substances that are particularly harmful to human health. Fresno County is currently
designated as a Non-Attainment area for the state and national PM10 standards. As shown in
Table 2, the national 24-hour PM10 standard was exceeded only during one year from 1989-
2007 at the First Street station. The state standard was exceeded a number of times each year
from 1989-2007, however, there is an improvement trend in a declining number of days
exceeding the standards, as we move towards the future.
Direct emissions of PM10 have decreased from 1988 to 2005, as shown in Table 2. CARB’s
Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality (CARB 2003a) projects that PM10 emissions will remain
nearly constant between 2005 and 2020. PM10 emissions in the SJVAB are dominated by
emissions from area-wide sources, primarily from vehicle travel on unpaved and paved roads,
waste burning, and residential fuel combustion.
Carbon Monoxide
Unlike ozone, carbon monoxide (CO) is released directly into the atmosphere by stationary
and mobile sources and typically found at high concentrations near the source of emission. CO
is a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas produced by incomplete burning of carbon in fuels,
primarily from mobile sources; 77% of nationwide CO emissions are from mobile sources. The
other 23% consists of emissions from wood-burning stoves, incinerators, and industrial
sources.
Fresno County is currently designated as an Unclassified or Unclassified/Attainment area for
the state and national CO standards. With respect to CO air quality trends according to the
2003 California Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality, the maximum peak 8-hour trend for the
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                               Page 119

SJVAB shows a fairly consistent downward trend from 1982 to 2001, with year-to-year
variability especially in the 1980’s because of meteorological conditions. The national CO
standards have not been exceeded since 1991 and the state standards have not been
exceeded the past six years. The decline in ambient CO is attributable to the introduction of
cleaner fuels and newer, cleaner motor vehicles.
CO enters the bloodstream through the lungs by combining with hemoglobin, which normally
supplies oxygen to the cells; however, CO combines with hemoglobin much more readily than
oxygen does, resulting in a drastic reduction in the amount of oxygen available to the cells.
Adverse health effects associated with exposure to CO concentrations include such symptoms
as dizziness, headaches, and fatigue. CO exposure is especially harmful to individuals who
suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Nitrogen Dioxide
NO2 is a brownish, highly reactive gas that is present in all urban environments. The major
human-made sources of NO2 are combustion devices, such as boilers, gas turbines, and
mobile and stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines. Combustion devices emit
primarily nitric oxide (NO), which reacts through oxidation in the atmosphere to form NO2. The
combined emissions of NO and NO2 are referred to as NOx, which are reported as equivalent
NO2. Because NO2 is formed and depleted by reactions associated with photochemical smog
(O3), the NO2 concentration in a particular geographical area may not be representative of the
local NOx emission sources.
Inhalation is the most common route of exposure to NO2. Because NO2 has relatively low
solubility in water, the principal site of toxicity is in the lower respiratory tract. The severity of
the adverse health effects depends primarily on the concentration inhaled rather than the
duration of exposure. An individual may experience a variety of acute symptoms, including
coughing, difficulty with breathing, vomiting, headache, and eye irritation during or shortly after
exposure. After a period of approximately 4 to 12 hours, an exposed individual may experience
chemical pneumonitis or pulmonary edema with breathing abnormalities, cough, cyanosis,
chest pain, and rapid heartbeat. Severe, symptomatic NO2 intoxication after acute exposure
has been linked on occasion with prolonged respiratory impairment with such symptoms as
chronic bronchitis and decreased lung functions. Fresno County is currently designated as an
attainment or unclassified/attainment area for the state and national NO2 standards.
Sulfur Dioxide
SO2 is produced by such stationary sources as coal and oil combustion, steel mills, refineries,
pulp and paper mills. The major adverse health effects associated with SO2 exposure pertain
to the upper respiratory tract. SO2 is a respiratory irritant with constriction of the bronchioles
occurring with inhalation of SO2 at 5 ppm or more. On contact with the moist mucous
membranes, SO2 produces sulfurous acid, which is a direct irritant. Concentration rather than
duration of the exposure is an important determinant of respiratory effects. Exposure to high
SO2 concentrations may result in edema of the lungs or glottis and respiratory paralysis.
Fresno County is currently designated as an attainment or unclassified/attainment area for the
state and national SO2 standards.

Lead
Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured products. Lead
emissions have historically been primarily from mobile and industrial sources. As a result of
the phase-out of leaded gasoline, metal processing is currently the primary source of lead
emissions. Other stationary sources are waste incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery
manufacturers. Twenty years ago, mobile sources were the main contributor to ambient lead
concentrations. In the early 1970s, EPA set national regulations to gradually reduce the lead
content in gasoline. EPA banned the use of leaded gasoline in highway vehicles in December
1995. As a result of EPA’s regulatory efforts, levels of lead in the air decreased by 94%
between 1980 and 1999. Transportation sources, primarily airplanes, now contribute only 13%
of lead emissions.
The decrease in lead emissions and ambient lead concentrations over the past 25 years is one
of California’s most dramatic success stories. All areas of the state are designated as
Attainment for the state lead standard (the EPA does not designate areas for the national lead
standard). Although the ambient lead standards are no longer violated, lead emissions from
stationary sources still pose “hot spot” problems in some areas. As a result, the CARB has
identified lead as a toxic air contaminant.

                              Safety Element
5.0     INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element focuses on topics which ensure a safe environment for our citizenry, while
considering and planning for future development in and around the City of Reedley. There is a
genuine focus on the protection of the community from identifiable hazards like flooding,
natural fires, public safety (police & fire) and other geologic hazards. The Safety Element aims
at reducing hazards, risk, death, injuries, property damage, and economic and social
dislocation. The General Plan avoids significant changes in planned land use, circulation and
other variables which could increase risk resulting from known hazards or a radical change to
the environment.
The Safety Element is a primary vehicle for relating to local safety planning. Emergency
services for these hazards, including fires and police services, are considered in the Safety
Element. Implementation of safety objectives will be incorporated into provisions of the
Reedley Municipal Code to include zoning regulations, subdivision requirements and
entitlement permit processes as a means to abate or mitigate safety hazards.
Briefly discussed below are existing conditions pertaining to the specific issues relating to
safety in the City of Reedley. The issues are flooding, geologic hazards, fire, seismic hazards,
police protection, and hazardous land use relationships.
Goals
 SE 5.0A - Prevent and minimize personal injury and loss of life due to natural and man-
 made hazards.
 SE 5.0B - Prevent and minimize the potential for property damage.
 SE 5.0C - Protect the City and its residents from avoidable loss resulting from improper
 development in hazardous areas.
 SE 5.0D - Safeguard public safety and property by educating and involving the public in all
 the tenets of community-oriented policing and problem solving, thereby, reducing crime.
5.1     FLOODING
Flood damage to properties is often the result of the improper use of flood-prone lands. Flood
losses can take place in several ways. When a flood occurs, many types of land uses, which
are located within the flood-prone area, may be damaged. More importantly, however,
development in flood hazard areas usually increases the natural flood heights and velocities
with resulting damage to upstream, downstream, and adjacent lands. Therefore, the potential
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                Page 122
costs of permitting improper uses on flood-prone lands can be considerable. One method of
reducing these flood losses would be to limit development of lands within flood hazard areas.
The Kings River begins on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada and flows westerly to Pine
Flat Reservoir. Twenty-five miles downstream of this reservoir, the river passes along the west
side of Reedley as it flows to the Valley floor. The supply of surface water for the Kings River
Basin area comes primarily from two sources, the Kings River and the San Joaquin River. The
Kings River flows are regulated by Pine Flat Dam, with a storage capacity of 1,000,000 acre
feet. Flows in the river at Reedley come from releases from Pine Flat Dam and tributary inflow.
The dam, completed in 1954, was constructed for flood control, irrigation, recreation and water
conservation.
The annual flow in the Kings River, as measured at the Reedley Narrows gaging station
located three miles upstream of Reedley, averages approximately 1,000,000 acre-feet per
year for the period 1963 to 1987. The highest average monthly flows occur in late spring with a
maximum flow of approximately 3,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), while the lowest flows
generally occur in late fall with a minimum flow of approximately 290 cfs.
Flooding in the Reedley area can occur due to high flows in the Kings River or as a result of
local runoff from intense rainfall.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has designated certain portions of the
Planning Area west of Reed Avenue as subject to a 100-year flood by the Kings River, areas
in the northern plan area as subject to a 100-year flood by the Wahtoke Creek and areas in the
eastern plan area as subject to 100-year flood by the Travers Creek. Such a flood has a one
percent chance of occurrence during any given year and is the flood magnitude which
communities must protect against under Federal Insurance Administration regulations. The
general location of the flood-prone area is indicated on Figure 5-1. The map shows that the
flood-prone area consists of Designated Floodway and of the Flood-Fringe area. The most
recent Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) from F.E.M.A. affecting the City of Reedley was
updated in February 2009.
The following objectives and policies are based on the Fresno County Safety Element and on
Federal Insurance Administration regulations. The similarity between the City and County
Safety Elements should insure that the City of Reedley and Fresno County follow a uniform
approach toward the management of the Kings River flood-prone areas. See Figure 5.1 –
FEMA Flood Map.
Goals
  SE 5.1A - Minimize the potential for damage caused by inundation in flood hazard areas.
Policies
SE 5.1.1        Continue the flood-plain management approach and operation of an overall
                program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and
                preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain
                including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works,
                flood plain management regulations and open space plans.

Policies
SE 5.1.2        Flood hazard regulations shall be applied to all property subject to a 100-year
                flood. Staff shall evaluate all permits for development located within a 100-year
                flood area and apply the following:
                (a)    Portions of the 100-year flood hazard area to remain free of all new
                       obstructions in order to reasonably provide for the passage of
                       floodwaters of a given magnitude.
                (b)    Limited development, subject to City policies and Federal Flood
                       Insurance Program requirements, may be permitted if adequate flood-
                       proofing measures are constructed.
SE 5.l.3        Areas identified on Figure 5-1 are subject to flooding, but on which detailed flood
                studies (delineating the area and depth of a 100-year flood) are not yet
                available, shall be treated as Flood-Fringe areas unless conclusive evidence is
                presented to the contrary. Any development requiring a City permit in these
                flood-hazard lands shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer.
                The following conditions should apply:
                (a)    In cases of uncertainty, as to the exact area and depth of flooding, the
                       subdivider or developer may, at his expense, have a qualified registered
                       civil engineer report either: (a) the area and depth of a 100-year flood, or
                       (b) that the particular parcel is not subject to inundation in a 100-year
                       flood. If the developer chooses not to provide an engineer’s report, then
                       development may be permitted under other provisions of this section in
                       conjunction with applicable zone districts.
                (b)    The lowest floor to be inhabited should be a least two (2) feet above the
                       100-year flood elevation or one (l) foot above the top of curb of adjacent
                       street, whichever is higher.
                (c)    In areas where no detailed flood studies exist but where topography or
                       flood history indicates the area is subject to flooding above the required
                       elevations, the height rise may be increased as determined by the City
                       Engineer.
SE 5.1.4        Where there are accurate and detailed flood-hazard maps that indicate the exact
                area and depth of inundation by a 100-year flood, the following conditions shall
                apply:
                (a)    The lowest floor of a proposed residential structure within a Flood-Fringe
                       area shall be elevated to or above the 100-year flood height in a manner
                       that will not adversely affect other properties.
                (b)    The lowest floor of proposed non-residential structures, which require a
                       City permit and are located within a Flood-Fringe area, shall be elevated
                       to or above the 100-year flood height; or, together with attendant utility
                       and sanitary facilities, be flood proofed up to at least the height of the
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 125

                        100-year flood. This work shall be done in a manner that will not
                        adversely affect other properties.
                (c)     A subdivision map creating more than four (4) parcels of land in a Flood-
                        Fringe area shall not be approved unless flood hazards can be overcome
                        by flood-proofing measures that will not adversely affect other property.
                        These measures shall be designed and constructed in a manner
                        approved by the City Engineer. The map shall clearly show the area that
                        could be flooded in the event of a 100-year flood and the depth of
                        flooding.
                (d)     The City shall require flood proofing, to the maximum extent practical, in
                        connection with substantial improvement to existing structures in Flood-
                        Fringe areas. The elevation of the lowest floor of the structure may be
                        raised to or above the height of a 100-year flood; or, for non-residential
                        uses, flood proofing measures may be required up to the elevation of the
                        100-year flood.
SE 5.1.5        All flood proofing shall be done in a manner that will not cause floodwaters to be
                diverted onto adjacent property, increase flood hazards to property located
                elsewhere, or otherwise adversely affect other property. Flood proofing
                measures such as, but not limited to, the following may be required:
                (a)     Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
                (b)     Use of special water resistant paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce
                        see page of water through walls.
                (c)     Addition of weight to structures to resist flotation.
                (d)     Construction of water and waste systems to prevent the entrance of
                        floodwaters.
                (e)     Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or
                        floating debris.
                (f)     Location of all electrical equipment, circuits, and installed electrical
                        appliances in a manner that will assure they are not subject to inundation
                        by a 100-year flood.
                (g)     Flood-proofing shall be required for structural storage facilities containing
                        chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other
                        toxic materials which could be hazardous to public health, safety, and
                        welfare. These shall be located in a manner which will assure that the
                        facilities are: (a) situated at elevation above the height associated with
                        the 100-year flood protection elevation; or (b) adequately flood-proofed to
                        prevent flotation of storage containers or damage to storage containers
                        which could result in the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                     Page 126
SE 5.1.6        In flood-hazard areas, all public utilities and facilities, such as road, sewage
                disposal, gas, electrical, and water systems, shall be located and constructed to
                minimize or eliminate flood damage to the facilities. This work shall be done in a
                manner that will not adversely affect other property.
SE 5.1.7        Open space uses should be encouraged in flood-hazard areas and Land
                Conservation Contracts and Open Space and Scenic Easements should be
                made available by the County to property owners within 100-year flood areas
                located in the unincorporated area.
5.2     GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Several geologic hazards may pose threats to the safety of Reedley area residents. These
hazards include expansive soils, weak soils, and erosion. While Figure 5-2 depicts the
generalized locations of the geologic hazards found within the Reedley Planning Area,
pinpointing the extent of the hazard as well as the possible mitigation measures would require
detailed on-site surveys.
Figure 5.2 - Geological Hazard Areas
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                  Page 127
Expansive Soils
Whenever relatively large percentages of certain clay minerals are present in the soil,
expansive soils develop. The soil expands in volume when it absorbs water and shrinks when
it is dry. Under saturated or swelled conditions, the soil becomes very compressible and,
therefore, loses its strength. These characteristic of expansive soil often cause serious
distortion to building frames, floor slabs, and pavements.
Severe expansive soil conditions which could cause heavy damage to buildings, roads, and
other structures are rare within the Planning Area. They are limited to the Cometa (CzaD) soil,
with its dense clay subsoil, which is found in the far northwestern portion of the Planning Area.
Although, according to the Soils Conservation Service, this soil has a severe limitation rating
for most urban type land uses, its relatively isolated location will insure that it will not adversely
impact Reedley’s future development.
Moderately expansive soils – including soils in the Ramona (Rb; Rc) and San Joaquin (ScA;
SeA) Series – are found in a relatively large area within the northeastern and eastern portions
of the Planning Area. Although these areas are generally planned for urban uses, moderately
expansive soils will usually cause damage only to substandard structures and to flatwork such
as streets and patios. In addition, foundations can usually be especially engineered to
minimize damage due to these moderately expansive soils. The Ramona and San Joaquin
soils, however, also have a severe limitation rating for use as septic tank absorption fields and
storm drainage basin sites because of their slow permeability.
Weak Soils – Weak soil conditions are generally found near the Kings River and the southern
portion of the planned urban area between Reed and Frankwood Avenues. According to the
Soil Conservation Service, the Tujunga soil (TzbA), which is found in these areas, has a
severe limitation rating with respect to allowable pressure for building foundations based on
the provisions of the California Building Code. This is due to the loose loamy sand conditions
which are found one foot below the surface of the soil. On-site soil analysis would be needed
in these locations to determine the building foundation design and site planning required in
relation to the soil conditions. In cases where special treatment to mitigate these problems is
infeasible, Policy SE 5.2.2 provides that development should be prohibited.
Erosion
Erosion is a natural geologic process resulting from the removal and transportation of earth
materials. Rainfall, freezing, wind, lack of ground cover, and soil characteristics are some of
the many natural forces in the erosion process. Erosion can be accelerated through
urbanization which involves the clearing of vegetation, grading of slopes, road cuts, excessive
irrigation, and increased runoff.
Because the topography of the Reedley area is relatively flat, erosion does not have a
significant impact in the area. Moderate-to-severe water erosion potential does exist, however,
along the bluffs of the Kings River as a result of the steep slope conditions found in that area.
Gullies can be started at the onset of the rainy season; and, once started, they can cut back
into the adjacent level soils. It is generally more difficult to control such gullies than to prevent
them. In areas of the bluff where there are gopher or squirrel burrows, tunnel erosion may
result since such burrows can collapse. As a result, water and rodent management may be
needed on the bluffs.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                      Page 128

A band of Atwater (AoA) soil is found in the northeastern portion of the Planning Area. This soil
consists of stabilized old dunes of wind-sorted materials which are susceptible to moderate-to-
severe wind erosion during infrequent periods of high wind.
Due to the instability of soil conditions in these areas, Safety Element policies provide that
preliminary on-site soil surveys would be needed in order to determine the appropriate
mitigation measures. In areas where investigation shows that the erosion potential is
sufficiently high, it may be necessary to limit development.
Goals
 SE 5.2A - Protect the lives and property of residents of the Reedley area by establishing
 urban growth patterns and development policies which recognize the limitations of soils and
 physical features.
Policies
SE 5.2.1        Proposed development projects may be subject to a variety of discretionary
                action and conditions of approval. The actions and conditions are based on
                adopted City plans and policies essential to mitigate adverse effects on the
                environment including the health, safety, and welfare of the community. For
                example, the City may require a preliminary soil (Reedley Municipal Code,
                Section 11-4-2-D), geotechnical or seismic reports when the subject property is
                located on land exhibiting potentially unstable soil conditions, suitability for
                additional development, or other hazardous geologic conditions.
SE 5.2.2        Development should be prohibited in areas where corrective measures to affect
                the geologic hazard are not feasible.
SE 5.2.3        The City Ordinance shall be amended continually to reflect changes in policy
                and code requirements.
5.3     FIRE HAZARDS
Urban type fires are the most relevant fire hazard for the Reedley area. Because of the nature
of farming and the small amount of vacant land in the fringe area, there is only a minimal fire
hazard to the rural area. Therefore, urban fire protection and prevention services are the major
subject of this section.
The Reedley Volunteer Fire Department is the primary fire protection provider within the City of
Reedley.
The Fresno County Fire Protection District provides fire protection to the unincorporated
portions of the Planning Area. As a result of a mutual aid agreement between the two
agencies, the City Volunteer Fire Department may be requested to provide emergency back-
up service in the unincorporated area and Fresno County may be requested to provide
emergency back-up service to the City.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                Page 129
The City has a Class IV fire insurance rating based on the ten-point scale established by the
Insurance Service Office (ISO). Class I is the ISO’s highest rating. The City water wells have
adequate capacity to meet normal demand as well as emergency situations. During periods of
electric outages, water can be provided by the City’s two elevated storage tanks and by two
wells with pumps powered by natural gas engines. In addition, Reedley fire-fighting equipment
carries a total of 3,250 gallons of water while the Fresno County equipment dispatched to
Reedley carries a total of 2,000 gallons of water. The City also has mutual aid agreements with
Tulare County and Orange Cove Fire Protection District if more assistance is required.
Reedley’s level terrain and grid street pattern allow free movement of emergency equipment.
However, as Reedley continues to grow, the need for additional fire stations should be
evaluated to address issues such as response times, east/west movement when a train is
traveling railroad tracks, growth west of the river and growth in the northeast area. Minimum
road widths and distances between structures are established by the City.
The City operates a fire prevention program consisting of inspections of properties for fire
hazards. The City’s Life Safety/Code Officer notifies property owners of fire hazards
determined as a result of inspections. The Fire Department reviews land development
applications for fire safety considerations and also conducts business inspections for code
compliance.
Goals
  SE 5.3A - Minimize the loss of life and damage to property as a result of fire.
  SE 5.3B - Continue to meet or exceed current levels of service as demand increases.
Policies
SE 5.3.1        Monitor water supply to insure adequacy for fire protection.
SE 5.3.2        Continue to provide adequate fire flow as a suppression measure.
SE 5.3.3        Continue to provide fire department training programs.
SE 5.3.4        Continue to review         land use  development     proposals    for fire  safety
                considerations.
SE 5.3.5        Continue to inspect properties for the purpose of reducing fire hazard and
                facilitating fire suppression.
SE 5.3.6        Encourage the installation of heat and/or smoke detection early warning and fire
                suppression systems in existing structures.
SE 5.3.7        Adopt and enforce the latest national building, plumbing, mechanical, and fire
                prevention codes.

SE 5.3.8           Continue to implement the Community Facilities District to ensure additional staff
                   and equipment to adequately service new development.
SE 5.3.9           Provide public safety education and awareness and ensure fire code
                   compliance.
SE 5.3.10          Pursue funding opportunities and options for capital projects to repair, renovate
                   and expand facilities and provide additional stations.
5.4      SEISMIC HAZARDS
The Reedley planning area is within Seismic Zone 3. This area is characterized as having a
relatively thin section of sedimentary rock overlying granite. In this zone, the amplification of
shaking that would affect low-to-medium rise structures is relatively high. There is sufficient
distance to either the San Andreas or Owens Valley Faults, (expected source of shaking) that
the effects should be minimal. There are no known seismic faults located within the Reedley
Planning Area or the immediate surrounding environs. A map, therefore, was not prepared.
The Uniform Building Code requirements for Zone are applicable for all new construction and
critical facilities. Secondary hazards due to landslides, subsidence and settlement,
liquefaction, and seiching are considered to be minimal in this area.
The following objectives and policies are adapted from two documents: (a) The Five County
Seismic Safety Element (Volumes I and II) which was prepared by the Tulare County
Association of Governments and (b) the Fresno County Seismic Safety Element.
Goals
  SE 5.4A - Minimize serious physical damage to structures used for human occupancy and to
  critical facilities and structures where large numbers of people are apt to congregate.
  SE 5.4B - Insure the continuity of vital services, functions, and facilities.
Policies
SE 5.4.1           Abuilding or structure constructed prior to 1948 should be examined to
                   determine the earthquake resistant capacity. If the structure is determined to be
                   below an acceptable standards a program to minimize potential hazard should
                   be established.
SE 5.4.2           Structures of more than 50 feet or four (4) stories, or requiring special design
                   considerations for seismic hazards shall be constructed consistent with State
                   law. Additional factors to be considered, as recommended in the Five County
                   Seismic Safety Element, are as follows:
                   (a)    A dynamic analysis procedure shall be used for assessing structural
                          design requirements for structures of more than 50 feet or four (4)
                          stories.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                    Page 131
                (b)     Critical facilities should be designed at double the current seismic design
                        forces required in Zone 3 by the current California Uniform Building
                        Code.
                (c)     The bracing and anchoring of all mechanical and electrical equipment for
                        critical facilities shall be designed to with stand lateral seismic forces
                        equal to 20 percent of its total dead load.
5.5     POLICE PROTECTION
Crime prevention has become the number one issue on the minds of the public. The increases
in robbery, gang activity, graffiti, autotheft, etc. have led to the public’s request for more
officers on the street. Reedley currently has 30 full-time sworn officers, or about 1.1 officers
per 1,000 persons. The goal of the Police Department is to maintain a ratio of 1.5 officers per
1,000.
Goals
 SE 5.5A - Protect the citizens of Reedley by preventing criminal activity, enforcing laws, and
 meet community police service demands.
Policies
SE 5.5.1        Actively involves citizens in crime prevention and public safety awareness
                through programs such as Neighborhood Watch and Community Oriented
                Policing and Problem Solving (COPPS).
SE 5.5.2        Ensure that the Police Department has the necessary personnel to protect the
                citizens of Reedley.
SE 5.5.3        Strive to maintain a ratio of 1.5 officers per 1,000 citizens.
SE 5.5.4        To minimize criminal activities provides comments on the design of public and
                private spaces.
SE 5.5.5        Maintain effective disaster response plans that address emergency response
                and traffic control and security of damaged areas.
SE 5.5.6        Maintain the Community Facilities District as a way to adequately fund additional
                officers and equipment to service new development.
5.6     HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The management of hazardous materials has emerged as an important environmental and
planning issue. Past and present management of hazardous materials have led to
contamination of the air, soils, surface water and groundwater. As Reedley grows, it is possible
that hazardous materials will be handled by an increasing number of residents and employees.
City of Reedley, 2030 General Plan Draft                                                   Page 132

The City and local businesses must comply with stringent local, state and federal requirements
related to the handling, storing and disposal of hazardous materials.
It is anticipated that continued development of industrial uses may result in businesses using
potentially hazardous materials. Fresno County maintains a hazardous materials response
team that serves the entire County, including the City of Reedley.
Goals
  SE 5.6A - Protect the public and the environment from exposure to hazardous materials.
Policies
SE 5.6.1        Assess the risk involving the transportation, disposal, manufacture, storage and
                handling of any hazardous materials at all levels of planning.
SE 5.6.2        Residential development in close proximity to heavy industrial zones shall be
                avoided.
SE 5.6.3        Establish a program to obtain hazardous materials control, technical assistance
                and cleanup to response to hazardous materials incidents.
5.7     EMERGENCY SERVICES
Planning of emergency services is essential to disaster mitigation. Although emergency
services planning cannot prevent disasters, it can provide for coordinated public action during
the time of disaster to reduce loss.
Fresno County has an adopted emergency services plan and Chapter Five of the Reedley City
Code provides for the adoption of an emergency services plan by the City Council.
Goals
  SE 5.7A - Provide a basis for direction and control of emergency operations by coordinating
  operations with the emergency organizations of other jurisdictions.
  SE 5.7B - Coordinate operations with the emergency organizations of other jurisdictions.
Policies
SE 5.7.1        Continue to maintain a disaster emergency services plan which coordinates the
                City of Reedley disaster services with those of the Fresno County Emergency
                Services Plan.

                               Noise Element
6.0      INTRODUCTION
Noise is an important factor which can influence the quality of life in the City of Reedley. Such
exposure to excessive noise levels can adversely affect human health. Therefore, we must
recognize the interrelationship of the noise element to land use, housing, circulation and open
space. The purpose of the General Plan Noise Element is to identify noise sources that exist
within the City and proposed Planning Area. The Noise Element also establishes goals and
policies to minimize potential adverse impacts from transportation and stationary noise to
sensitive land uses such as residents, schools, churches and hospitals.
The methods used in the preparation of the Noise Element are defined by California
Government Code Section 65302 (f) and the Guidelines for the Preparation and Contents of
Noise Elements of the General Plan, adopted and published by the California Office of Noise
Control (ONC). The ONC Guidelines provides definition related to major noise sources and
noise-sensitive uses (receptors) and identifies the types of major sources to be quantified. The
current adopted guidelines give local government flexibility in identifying local levels of
concern, in identifying sensitive uses, and in tailoring the noise element to local conditions.
6.1      NOISE ANALYSIS
A noise assessment was completed in 2010. Through that study it was determined that there
are four major sources of community noise within the Planning Area; traffic on major local
roadways, rail operations on the San Joaquin Valley Railroad (SJVRR), commercial/industrial
facilities and aircraft operations at the Reedley Municipal Airport. Due to Reedley’s location in
a major agricultural area, noise from farming activities is also a concern.
According to the Government Code and ONC Guidelines, noise exposure information should
be developed in terms of the Day-Night Average Level (DNL) or Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL) for transportation related noise sources. Analytical noise modeling techniques
are typically used to measure major noise sources (traffic and railroads) within the study area.
The CNEL descriptor was developed for the quantification of aircraft noise and used to
measure noise sources at the Reedley Municipal Airport. These noise sources are then
quantified for evaluating their impacts on sensitive receivers and land uses. This noise element
was prepared in accordance with State law, ONC and an Environmental Noise Assessment,
prepared by Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc.
Noise sensitive land uses identified in the Government Code and applicable in the City of
Reedley would be residential development, schools, hospitals, churches and libraries.

6.2     NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND DEFINITIONS
        (a)     A-Weighted Sound Level: All sound levels referred to in this document are in A-
                weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and very high
                frequencies of sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most community
                noise standards utilize A-weighting, as it provides a high degree of correlation
                with human annoyance and potential adverse health effects.
        (b)     Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The time-weighted average sound
                level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately 5 dB to
                sound levels during the evening hours (7:00 p.m.-10:00 p.m.) and 10 dB to
                sound levels during the nighttime hours (10:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m.). The State of
                California requires that aircraft noise exposure be defined in terms of the annual
                average CNEL.
        (c)     Day/Night Average Sound Level (DNL): The time-weighted average sound level
                during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of 10 dB to sound levels during the
                nighttime hours (10:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m.). The DNL and CNEL are similar
                descriptors of the community noise environment and are generally considered to
                be equivalent within ±1.0 dB.
        (d)     Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): The sound level containing the same total energy
                as atime varying signal over a given period. The Leq is typically calculated for
                either onehour or 24-hour periods, but may be calculated for any stated period
                of time.
        (e)     New Development: Projects requiring land use or building permits, but excluding
                remodeling or additions to existing structures.
        (f)     Noise-Sensitive Land Use: Residential land uses, transient lodging, schools,
                libraries, churches, hospitals and nursing homes.
        (g)     Outdoor Activity Areas: Outdoor activity areas for single-family homes are
                generally considered to be individual backyards. Outdoor activity areas for multi-
                family residences or transient lodging facilities are generally considered to be
                patios, decks and common outdoor recreation areas.
        (h)     Stationary Noise Source: Any fixed or mobile source not preempted from local
                control by federal or state regulations. Examples of such sources include
                agricultural, industrial and commercial facilities and vehicle movements on
                private property.
        (i)     Transportation Noise Source: Traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations
                and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by federal
                or state regulations. However, the effects of noise from transportation sources
                may be controlled by regulating the locations and design of adjacent land uses.

6.3     OVERVIEW OF SOURCES
Noise is generally defined as “unwanted sound”, which is a subjective determination of
measureable physical phenomena. Ambient noise levels are a major determinant of “quality of
life”. Noise levels not only affect the utility and enjoyment of property, they directly affect
property values and affect human health.
The City of Reedley is bisected, in part, by the Exeter Branch of the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad (formerly Southern Pacific Railroad). The rail line is located on a northwest-southeast
corridor through the center of Reedley. The community’s major industrial belt is concentrated
on both sides of the rail corridor, both through the central core and through the southeastern
quadrant of the Planning Area. This combined rail and industrial corridor is the principal noise
generator within Reedley. The corridor’s impact on residential uses and on sensitive receivers
is minimized, however, due to the attenuation provided by the existing Central Business and
Service Commercial uses located immediately northeast of the tracks and by the Service
Commercial strip located along the southwest side of “I” Street.
The Plan further recommends that new industrial uses which are proposed for development
within the Service Commercial areas near Downtown be carefully evaluated to insure that they
do not have a detrimental effect on surrounding commercial and residential uses. This Plan
seeks to further minimize the potential adverse impact of industrial noise by concentrating new
industrial uses in the southeastern and north portion of the Planning Area where they are
generally removed from most residential areas and by recommending the use of landscaping
and setbacks where planned industrial uses adjoin planned residential uses.
In addition, the Plan provides for Light Industrial as a land use buffer between Heavy Industrial
and non-industrial land uses. Light industrial designations are located in the industrial park
area between the Heavy Industrial areas along the rail corridor. Light Industrial land uses,
particularly those uses which have the potential produce noise impacts, will be restricted or
prohibited or required to comply with the noise standards identified in this element.
As part of evaluating the existing condition the Fresno County Noise Element was reviewed.
The County’s Element indicates that major noise generators in Fresno County, including the
City of Reedley, are transportation facilities such as railroads and streets, airports and fixed
point sources such as manufacturing plants. The County’s Element is also consistent with
Reedley’s existing condition.
Goals
  NE 6.1A - To protect the citizens of the City from potential harmful effect due to exposure to
  excessive noise.
  NE 6.1B - To preserve the tranquility of residential and other noise sensitive areas by
  preventing noise-producing uses from encroaching upon existing and planned noise
  sensitive uses.
  NE 6.1C - To develop a policy framework necessary to achieve and maintain a healthful
  noise environment.

NE 6.1.4        Within noise impact zones, the City will evaluate the noise impact on
                development proposals. Mitigating measures, including but not limited to the
                following, may be required:
                (a)     Setbacks, berms, and barriers.
                (b)     Acoustical design of structures.
                (c)     Location of structures.
NE 6.1.5        Design of all proposed development should incorporate features necessary to
                minimize adverse noise impacts, while also minimizing effects on surrounding
                lands uses.
NE 6.1.6        Land use and transportation planning should include analysis of the potentially
                adverse noise levels associated with various design and use alternatives.
NE 6.1.7        The design of proposed transportation facility should incorporate feasible
                measures to diminish potential increases in noise levels.
NE 6.1.8        To relieve excessive noise generation associated with various modes of
                transportation, the City should:
                (a)     Designate truck routes where appropriate (see Circulation Element).
                (b)     Limit vehicle speed where appropriate.
                (c)     Adoption of State Noise Insulation Standards (California Code of
                        Regulations, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the Uniform Building Code
                        (UBC) concerning interior noise exposure for new single, multi-family
                        housing, hotels and motels.
                (d)     Encourage appropriate authorities to stringently enforce California Motor
                        Vehicle Code standards relating to noise emission levels and muffler
                        systems.
                (e)     Maintain awareness of State and Federal standards or legislation relating
                        to noise and lend support or criticism as appropriate.
NE 6.1.9        The City should cooperate with Fresno County to adopt compatible noise control
                programs.
NE 6.1.10       The City should develop noise contours for the following facilities:
                (a)     Major roads classified in the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
