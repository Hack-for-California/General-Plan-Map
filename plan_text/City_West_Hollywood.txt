10 SAFETY AND NOISE
Protecting the public health, safety and welfare is one of the City’s most basic
responsibilities, and is the legal and historical basis for its police power and planning
authority. The City’s tools for protecting public safety include regulating land use planning
and other activities, providing police and emergency services, research and monitoring,
preparing for potential natural disasters and threats to residents’ well-being, community
engagement, and enacting other policies that promote public safety and welfare.
After discussing statutory requirements for protecting public safety, this chapter organizes
policies and background information into the following sections:
  •	 Environmental Hazards
  •	 Noise
  •	 Police, Fire and Emergency Services
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
According to California Government Code, a city’s general plan is required to address safety
and noise. This Chapter meets state requirements with respect to the safety and noise
elements, and addresses additional topics important to the community.
Safety Element
Community safety is governed in part by California Government Code §65302(g), which
requires that each city prepare and adopt a Safety Element. Safety includes natural hazards
as well as man-made hazards, including earthquakes, landslides, flooding, fires, water
supply, and related hazards (CGC §65302(g)(1-2)). The Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research (OPR) describes the purposes of the Safety Element as risk identification, risk
reduction, hazard mitigation, and comprehensive decision-making related to hazards in new
and existing development, as follows:
     The safety element must identify hazards and hazard abatement provisions to guide local
     decisions related to zoning, subdivisions, and entitlement permits. The element should
     contain general hazard and risk reduction strategies and policies supporting hazard
     mitigation measures. Policies should address the identification of hazards and emergency
     response, as well as mitigation through avoidance of hazards by new projects and
     reduction of risk in developed areas. (2003 OPR General Plan Guidelines, 90).
West Hollywood’s General Plan meets the requirements of the safety element by identifying,
preventing, mitigating, and managing reasonably anticipated hazards to the City, such as
seismic hazards, fires, flooding and exposure to hazardous materials.

Noise Element
The Noise Element is also a mandatory component of the General Plan. Government Code
Section 65302(f) describes the noise element as follows:
(1)	      A noise element…shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community.
          The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise
          Control and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined
          by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following
          sources:
     (A)	 Highways and freeways.
     (B)	 Primary arterials and major local streets.
     (C)	 Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
     (D)	 Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helispot, and military airport operations, aircraft
          overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions
          related to airport operation.
     (E)	 Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
     (F)	 Other ground stationary noise sources, including, but not limited to, military installations,
          identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
(2)	      Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of
          community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise
          contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally
          accepted noise modeling techniques for the various sources identified in paragraphs
          (1) to (6), inclusive.
(3)	      The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses
          in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to
          excessive noise.
(4)	      The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions
          that address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise
          element shall serve as a guideline for compliance with the state’s noise insulation
          standards.
This General Plan provides policies regarding stationary, ambient, and mobile sources of noise
through state-mandated and approved standards and noise thresholds.
Optional Topics
This chapter’s section on Police, Fire and Emergency Services is not mandated by state law,
but is included here because of its importance to public safety.
                                                                                Safety and Noise 10-3

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
West Hollywood is committed to reducing the community’s exposure to environmental
hazards. This includes disaster prevention, mitigation, response, and evacuation related to
potential hazards including earthquakes, flooding, landslides and mudslides, subsurface gas,
fire, and hazardous materials. In addition to prudent land use and regulation, an important
component of minimizing risk from hazards is building a strong safety network through
collaboration with residents, neighborhoods, districts, neighboring local governments and
regional entities. The following chapter contains policies as well as context for minimizing
environmental hazards in West Hollywood, addressing fires, earthquakes, flooding, landslides
and mudslides, subsurface gas, and hazardous materials.
Context
West Hollywood is susceptible to fire, earthquakes, flooding, landslides and mudslides,
subsurface gas, as well as potential public exposure to hazardous materials. These are
described in greater detail below.
Fires
West Hollywood sits at the base of the Hollywood Hills, where roads can be difficult to
navigate and significant vegetation and brush cover the undeveloped areas between homes
and neighborhoods. A fire in the Hollywood Hills could easily spread to the northern region
of the City of West Hollywood. Figure 10-1 shows a map of wildland fire hazards.
In addition, urban fires are possible from careless human activity, or in the event of an
earthquake, subsurface gas explosion, or hazardous material combustion. In the event
of an urban fire, fire growth is related to type of building construction, water supply, fire
department response time and resources, and building density and fire breaks.
Earthquakes
West Hollywood is located in a seismically active zone. The City is susceptible to the effects
of earthquakes within the greater Los Angeles area as well as its own borders. The active
Hollywood Fault runs through the City and is capable of producing surface fault rupture
during a future earthquake. The City has established a Fault Precaution Zone spanning the
mapped trace of the Hollywood Fault within the City. In 2001, West Hollywood was the
location of an earthquake of magnitude 4.2, which was felt throughout the Los Angeles
Basin and San Fernando Valley. Future earthquakes in the region are virtually inevitable and
could be of a magnitude that would compromise buildings and structures.
In addition to strong ground shaking and movement, West Hollywood is susceptible to
liquefaction during seismic activity due to conditions of loose, granular alluvial soils and
locally shallow water table. Liquefaction causes soil to become disturbed in the presence of
water, lose strength, and take on the properties of liquid during an earthquake. Liquefaction
significantly amplifies the effects of ground shaking, putting structures and individuals at

greater risk. This means that existing buildings in liquefaction zones, as mapped by the State
of California, are at greater risk during an earthquake. It also means that new development
on liquefaction zones should only occur if potential hazards have been addressed based on
technical guidelines adopted by the City. Figure 10-2 shows seismically prone areas in the City.
Flooding
The City is land-locked, and therefore unlikely to experience direct inundation from rising
sea levels. However, West Hollywood is susceptible to flooding from watercourses that flow
through narrow, steep canyons from the natural drainage basin in the hills above the City.
The basin has historically experienced flooding during major winter storms. Moreover, the City
has a high water table, which decreases the ability of pooled water to drain.
No portions of West Hollywood lie within a federally designated mandatory flood insurance
zone. On June 3, 1994, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued a
Letter of Map Revision for Case No. 94-09-540P. The FEMA flood insurance rate map was
revised for the eastern portion of the City to reflect upgrades to flood protection due to
the completion of the Los Angeles County Flood Control District’s Pan Pacific Flood Control
System. On September 29, 2008, FEMA issued a Letter of Map Revision for Case No.
08-09-1715P. The flood insurance rate map was revised for the southwest portion of the
City to reflect upgrades to flood protection due to the completion of the Los Angeles County
Flood Control District’s Holly Hills Storm Drain System.
Localized flooding represents the only flood concern in the City. Historically, localized
flooding has occurred in low topographic areas where street gutters must accommodate
peak flows during a storm event. Generally, localized flooding does not overtop curbs and
dissipates quickly after heavy rain ceases. The topographical features in the City and local
drainage infrastructure reduce any serious threat of storm flooding within the City. The
Los Angeles County Flood Control District maintains the backbone flood control system, a
network of catch basins and underground storm drain pipes. The City owns and maintains a
few catch basins and small storm drain pipes that directly flow into the Los Angeles County
Flood Control District system.
Parts of the City are also within a potential dam inundation area. Figure 10-3 shows potential
dam inundation hazard areas.
Landslides and Mudslides
Landslides and mudslides are a potential danger during earthquakes, rainstorms, and
flooding conditions. They are also a possibility during excavation or from the placement
of buildings and infrastructure on steep slopes. West Hollywood lies at the base of the
Hollywood Hills, and northern portions of the City are at steeper grades, susceptible to
landslides and mudslides. Sites located on slopes along the north side of the City will require
slope stability evaluation of critical slopes including seismic loads from a nearby earthquake.
Figure 10-2 identifies landslide hazards in West Hollywood.

Subsurface Gas
Surface gas in the form of natural methane deposits and from abandoned oil fields is present
in the area under the City. While this gas may innocuously seep out in non-urbanized areas,
it poses a significant health and safety risk in urban West Hollywood. The urban landscape
tends to cap gases underground, where they can accumulate to the point of combustion
and/or escape in higher concentrations during construction, earthquakes, and other ground
movements. In addition, a rising water table may also pressurize or force gases upward into
the urbanized environment. Depending on the circumstances, these gases can combust,
cause asphyxiation, and lead to urban fires. For example, the Fairfax district experienced a
subsurface natural gas explosion and related fires in 1985. Other deposits may be present as
well. The Sherman Oil Field is under the City and the Salt Lake Oil Field is immediately to the
southeast.
Hazardous Materials
A variety of hazardous materials have become a part of modern life, and are either
transported through West Hollywood, used in commercial and production processes, or used
by individuals and households in their daily lives. Some materials cause acute public health
issues; others are more chronic.
California law requires State agencies to compile a list of properties affected by hazardous
waste. This so-called “Cortese List” is maintained in the EnviroStor online database by
the State Department of Toxic Substances Control, and generally includes commercial and
industrial properties with focused chemical activity. In addition, the State Water Resources
Control Board maintains a database of underground fuel tanks that can result in significant
groundwater pollution.
Common hazardous materials used in urbanized areas are prevalent throughout the City and
may include petroleum, fertilizers, pesticides, motor oil and lubricants, cleaning products,
high VOC paint and paint thinners, old batteries, and other chemicals and products. Many
of these contain chemicals known by the state of California to cause cancer or birth defects
as defined by Proposition 65, California’s toxic disclosure law. Therefore, proper disposal of
these products is important, as is minimizing their use.

         Precaution Zone delineated around the Hollywood Fault Zone.
SN-1.4	 Maintain high standards for the seismic performance of buildings in all new
         development, through requirements for detailed geotechnical investigations
         following State guidelines and prompt adoption and careful enforcement of the
         best available standards for seismic design.
SN-1.5	 Ensure adequate site runoff and connections to the storm drain system to minimize
         flooding.
SN-1.6	 Utilize relevant data on natural hazards, including earthquakes, flooding,
         liquefaction, landslides, natural gas and subsurface methane gas, and apply this
         information for purposes of land use planning, including any permitting.
SN-1.7	 Maintain the West Hollywood Emergency Plan (2009), including plans for police
         and fire services, vulnerable populations, and sensitive facilities, as well as plans for
         the continuity of the community and important networks following a significant
         disaster.
SN-1.8	 Utilize the latest technologies to inform the community regarding potential hazards,
         locations of potential sources of hazards, and actions to take in case of emergency,
         ensuring that emergency preparedness is the mutual responsibility of the City,
         residents, and the business community.
                                                                     Safety and Noise 10-13
SN-2: Minimize exposure to hazardous materials.
Intent: To minimize community exposure to hazardous and potentially hazardous
materials, including materials that can lead to delayed, chronic and/or acute health
effects.
SN-2.1	      As feasible, continue to avoid toxic cleaning and building materials and products
         in civic facilities and services to avoid health impacts to building occupants, visitors,
         maintenance crew, and to minimize environmental pollution to the soil, air, and
         water from material production and disposal.
SN-2.2	      Provide information, opportunities, and incentives to the community for proper
         disposal of toxic materials to avoid environmental degradation to the air, soil, and
         water resources from toxic materials contamination.
SN-2.3	      Encourage non-toxic materials and products in homes and businesses as an
         alternative to products containing potentially hazardous materials, including
         cleaning products, personal care products, storage and packaging products,
         furnishings, as well as foodstuffs to minimize the community’s exposure to
         petrochemicals, volatile organic compounds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other
         chemicals suspected of causing cancer, reproductive toxicity or other health-related
         concerns.
10-14 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

NOISE
The City of West Hollywood aims to protect residents’ quality of life by maintaining an
environment free from excessive or harmful noise. This includes minimizing point-source
and ambient noise, transportation-related noise, and noise from sources other than
transportation sources. West Hollywood will identify current and future sources of noise
so that future land uses can be organized and new development adequately designed in a
manner to minimize noise impacts to community residents and businesses. The section below
contains policies and background information about noise and noise mitigation in West
Hollywood.
State planning law requires the Noise Element to be consistent with other General Plan
elements. Policies and plans developed in the Noise Element are intended to protect
current and planned land uses identified in the Land Use and Urban Form Chapter from
excessive noise. Potential noise sources are identified in the Noise Element and programs are
established to avoid or mitigate noise impacts from new planned development. Preventing
the intrusion of negative environmental conditions, such as excessive noise, in order to create
a healthy environment is a central objective of the Land Use and Urban Form Chapter.
The transportation issues discussed in the Mobility and Infrastructure, Resources, and
Conservation Chapters are also directly related to noise. Noise from transportation is largely
responsible for excessive noise levels in certain locations in urban environments. The Mobility
Chapter addresses truck routes in the City. Projected noise distribution, depicted as noise
contours, is corollary to circulation and infrastructure. Noise policies and implementation are
largely based on the Mobility and Infrastructure, Resources, and Conservation Chapters, and
are aimed to minimize the effects of transportation noise on current and planned land uses.
The Parks and Recreation Chapter is also related to noise. Enjoyment of parks and open
spaces can be diminished by excessive noise, and noise information provided in this
chapter should be considered in planning new recreational areas. At the same time, where
appropriate, open space areas can serve as effective buffers between sensitive land uses and
noise producers.
Context
West Hollywood is committed to minimizing excessive noise and limiting the community’s
exposure to loud noise sources. The City of West Hollywood Noise Ordinance (Chapter
9.08 of the West Hollywood Municipal Code) is intended to protect people from non-
transportation noise sources such as construction activities, commercial operations,
machinery, and nightlife. Enforcement of the noise ordinance requires new developments
to show compliance with the ordinance, including operating in accordance with noise levels
recommended in this chapter. The ordinance also provides general standards for prohibited
noises and identifies specific activities that are prohibited because of their capability to create
unreasonable noise. As an example, the City requires construction activity to comply with
established work schedule limits (Section 9.08.050(f), Prohibited Noises).
                                                                       Safety and Noise 10-15

The City of West Hollywood is located in an urbanized and developed environment which is
subject to numerous noise sources. The primary noise source in the City is currently vehicular
traffic along major arterials including Sunset Boulevard, Fountain Avenue and Santa Monica
Boulevard. In addition, typical urban noise sources (e.g., hospitality businesses, entertainment
venues, community events, construction activities, landscape equipment, and emergency
vehicle sirens) also contribute to the overall noise environment. Another significant source
of noise is the CEMEX ready mix concrete facility located at 1000 North La Brea Avenue.
Because of City’s distance from airports, noise from aircraft over-flights are audible but are
not considered excessive. The closest airports to West Hollywood are the Burbank-Glendale-
Pasadena Airport and Santa Monica Municipal Airport, which are both located approximately
7 miles from the city limits.
Noise and Land Use Planning
Consideration of the sources and recipients of noise early in the land use planning and
development process can be an effective way to reduce the impact of noise on the
community. Consideration should be given to both reducing noise in severely impacted areas
through rehabilitative improvements and avoiding potential noise impacts through effective
land use planning and design.
Accumulation of noise from transportation activities and stationary sources determines
the overall noise environment within a community. Noise generated from automobile use,
trucking, airports and rail operations is referred to as transportation-related noise, while
noise from stationary sources such as commercial establishments, machinery, air conditioning
systems, compressors and landscape maintenance equipment is typically referred to as non-
transportation noise. Noise is most problematic when it affects “sensitive receptors” such
as residences, schools, hospitals, religious facilities, theaters, concert halls, libraries, offices,
and parks. These uses are considered sensitive because the presence of excessive noise
may interrupt normal activities typically associated with their use. Consideration of noise
sources, sensitive receptors, and information regarding the future noise environment leads to
implementation of effective ways to avoid noise impacts.
Noise Contours and Impacted Areas
Noise contours, based on the location of major noise sources, describe the noise environment
within the community. These contours outline areas of equal noise exposure. Existing (2010)
noise contours are illustrated in Figure 10-4. Information about existing and projected land
use development and transportation activity has been used to estimate future noise contours
for West Hollywood.
Future noise contours for West Hollywood shown in Figure 10-5 will guide land use and
development decisions to address potential noise issues. Noise impacted areas are those
areas that fall within the 60 dB(A) CNEL or greater noise contours.
Noise producing land uses will be evaluated using the standards set forth by the City to

If the analysis demonstrates that the noise standards can be met by implementing the
mitigation measures, the project can be approved conditioned upon those measures. Noise
attenuation measures may include soundwalls, berms, and other noise-reducing devices.
Transportation Related Noise
Transportation activity is a significant contributor of noise to the overall noise environment
within West Hollywood. Transportation related noise is primarily concentrated along the
transportation corridors that traverse the community such as Santa Monica Boulevard.
Reduction of transportation-related noise levels is desired to improve quality of life in all
neighborhoods and for other noise-sensitive receptors.
Noise Control at Reception Sites
The City has little direct control over noise produced by transportation sources since the State
is responsible for regulating motor vehicle noise. Therefore, City noise programs focus on
reducing the impact of transportation noise on the community.
The most effective ways to mitigate transportation noise impacts on the community are
through mitigation of potential noise impacts during the design review process. Identification
of potential impacts from transportation noise will occur during this stage of the
development process and mitigation measures may be required to meet City noise standards
identified in this Chapter. The most common ways to reduce transportation-related noise
impacts are through site planning, landscaping, use of natural topography, and the design
and construction of noise barriers. Small noise reductions can also be achieved by use of
setbacks, landscaping and architectural design.
Non-Transportation Related Noise
In addition to transportation related noise, excessive noise generated by non-transportation
sources, such as commercial and industrial uses, and restaurants and bars (nightlife), have
the potential to impact sensitive receptors. Noise is also associated with construction
activity, manufacturing or business operations, and everyday activities in West Hollywood
neighborhoods, such as leaf blowing, dog barking, and lawn mowing. Analysis of
potential noise impacts during the site design review process, compliance with CEQA, and
enforcement of City noise requirements are the best means to protect sensitive receptors.
When reviewing proposed non-residential projects, the City considers noise generation and
potential impacts to surrounding development. New development can be made compatible
with the noise environment by utilizing noise and land use compatibility standards and
the Noise Map (see Figure 10-5) as a guide for planning and development decisions. An
acoustical analysis is required for projects that will generate noise potentially affecting
sensitive receptors. Where significant impacts are identified, mitigation measures are
required. Mitigation measures that could be applied when reviewing projects include, but
are not limited to, acoustically treated and/or quiet designs for furnaces, fans, motors,
compressors, valves, pumps and other mechanical equipment. Noise resulting from special
                                                                      Safety and Noise 10-21
one-time events should be minimized as well. The City may also require limited delivery
hours and/or hours of operation in order to minimize impacts to adjacent residential uses. In
addition, all City departments must comply with State and federal OSHA standards. Any new
equipment or vehicles purchased by the City will comply with local, State and federal noise
standards, and the City will encourage landscaping contractors to utilize modern noise-
reducing equipment.
Noise Standards
Excessive noise is considered an environmental impact under the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). The provisions of the law and environmental review procedure are
described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures
that during the decision making stage of development, City officials and the general
public will be able to assess the potential noise impacts associated with private and public
development projects.
Noise standards are also dictated by state acoustic standards. The California Commission
of Housing and Community Development officially adopted noise insulation standards in
1974. In 1988, the Building Standards Commission approved revisions to the standards
(Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). As revised, Title 24 establishes interior
noise standards for residential space (CNEL or Ldn). Acoustical studies must be prepared for
residential structures to be located within noise contours of 60 dB(A) or greater (CNEL or
Ldn) from freeways, major streets, thoroughfares, rail lines, rapid transit lines, or industrial
noise sources. The studies must demonstrate that the building is designed to reduce interior
noise to 45 dB(A) or lower (CNEL or Ldn).
Noise generally is defined as unwanted or intrusive sound. Because noise consists of pitch,
loudness, and duration, describing noise with a single unit of measure presents a challenge.
The A-weighted decibel scale (dB(A)) has been developed to describe the loudness of a
sound or sound environment based on the sensitivity of the human ear.
The dB(A) descriptor only reports noise from a single source or combination of sources at a
point in time. To allow a more comprehensive description of the noise environment, Federal
and State agencies have established noise and land use compatibility guidelines that use
averaging approaches to noise measurement. Two measurement scales commonly used in
California are the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night level (Ldn).
To account for increased human sensitivity at night, the CNEL level includes a 5-decibel
penalty on noise during the 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. time period and a 10-decibel penalty
on noise during the 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. time period. The Ldn level includes only the 10
decibel weighting for late-night noise. These values are nearly identical for all but unusual
noise sources. West Hollywood’s standard daytime hours are 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and
nighttime hours are from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.

Noise Standards and Land Use Compatibility
Table 10-1 summarizes non-transportation source noise level guidance for use in determining
general compatibility of proposed residential properties with adjacent properties. These noise
levels represent the maximum acceptable noise levels for new developments as measured
from any adjoining or proposed residential property within the City. Accordingly, proposed
development should generally not cause, or if residential in nature, be exposed to a noise
level that exceeds the noise levels shown in Table 10-1.
The land use compatibility guidelines presented in Table 10-2 are based in part on the City’s
noise Level Guidance for Residential Properties. A project is considered to be compatible with
the noise environment if the noise level generatd by the project falls within Zone A or Zone
B. If the anticipated noise level of a proposedproject falls into Zone A, typically no mitigation
is needed, and if it falls into Zone B, minor mitigation may be required to meet City and
State Title 24 noise standards. All project proponents must demonstrate that noise standards
have been met prior to human occupation of a building.
If the noise level of a proposed project falls within Zone C, mitigation is likely needed to
meet City noise standards. Mitigation may include, but is not limited to, construction of
noise barriers, and/or the inclusion of substantial building sound insulation. Projects in Zone
C may be successfully mitigated; however, project applicants with a project in Zone C must
demonstrate that the noise standards can be met prior to issuance of a building permit. If
noise levels of a proposed project fall within Zone D, the project is incompatible with the
noise environment.

          ZONE A - Normally Acceptable: Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings
          involved meet conventional Title 24 construction standards. No special noise insulation requirements.
          ZONE B - Conditionally Acceptable: New construction or development shall be undertaken only after a detailed
          noise analysis is made and noise reduction measures are identified and included in the project design.
          ZONE C- Normally Unacceptable: New construction or development is discouraged. If new construction is proposed,
          a detailed analysis is required, noise reduction measures must be identified, and noise insulation features included in
          the design.
          ZONE D- Clearly Unacceptable: New construction or development should not be undertaken.

POLICE, FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
West Hollywood is one of the safest communities
in Southern California, supporting economic health
and walkability as well as physical and mental health
among residents and visitors. This is partially a result
of the City’s progressive and well-trained police force,
whose mission is to promote and protect public safety.
Public safety is also enhanced by its excellent fire and
emergency services, which seek to minimize natural
and safety hazards and meet those threats when they
arise. The following section provides specific policies
and context for police, fire and emergency services in
the City.
Context                                                     Los Angeles County Fire Station #8 on Santa
                                                            Monica Boulevard.
The Public Safety and Community Services Division of
the City Manager’s Office oversees crime prevention
services in West Hollywood. The Division coordinates
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,
which contracts with the City to provide police
services out of the West Hollywood Sheriff’s Station.
In response to the community’s unique demographics,
West Hollywood Sheriff’s Deputies utilize innovative
and progressive law enforcement programs such
as Community-Oriented Policing, Russian-Speaking            Many Neighborhood Watch groups celebrate
                                                            National Night Out, a chance for residents to
Community Outreach, Domestic Violence Prevention            meet their neighbors, City staff, and safety
Programs, and Hate Crimes Enforcement. The                  personnel.
West Hollywood Sheriff’s station has also created a
Community Impact Team that provides specialized services, entertainment policing, and
special events staffing.
As part of the Community-Oriented Policing Program, the City operates under the “broken
window theory,” which holds that broken windows, graffiti, and dirty neighborhoods
invite and propagate crime and therefore should be repaired as soon as possible. Citizen
involvement is also a vital component in crime prevention. There are several active
Neighborhood Watch groups within the City’s 1.9 square miles. Most of those participate in
the National Night Out Against Crime, an annual city-wide event to reinforce safe nightlife
and public gathering.
In addition to ongoing public safety, both police and fire services offer assistance in cases
of emergency. Fire services in West Hollywood are provided by the Los Angeles County Fire
Department, which has two fire stations in West Hollywood. The two stations within the
City are staffed by 19 Firefighters and a Battalion Chief who work 24 hour shifts. There
                                                                       Safety and Noise 10-29

are 3 shifts total for a total of 60 personnel. The City of West Hollywood is part of the
Consolidated Fire Protection District of the County of Los Angeles, which also provides
immediate access to the Urban Search and Rescue and HazMat teams, Air Operations, and
other sophisticated resources.
The City of West Hollywood also has an active Sheriff’s Volunteer Program and Community
Emergency Response Training comprised of volunteer citizens trained to respond to
emergencies and natural disasters, particularly providing assistance to the elderly and persons
with disabilities. The City also engages in a number of emergency preparedness outreach
programs, such as community fairs, hand-outs, and an emergency mass notification system.
West Hollywood firefighters provide public education outreach to schools, residents, seniors,
and staff and teach Community Emergency Response Training.
The City maintains the West Hollywood Emergency Plan (2009), which is an all-hazards
preparedness, emergency evacuation, response and recovery plan. It addresses hazards
including, but not limited to fires, earthquakes, flooding, terrorism, transportation accidents,
public health emergencies, and hazardous materials accidents.

         visual transparency in the urban landscape to achieve improved public safety in
         project design.
SN-7.2	 Continue to utilize community policing to improve public safety and involve the
         community in working to improve the overall safety of West Hollywood.
SN-7.3	 Provided that it serves the best interests of the community, continue to contract
         with Los Angeles County for the provision of police services and remain part of
         the Consolidated Fire Protection District of the County of Los Angeles for fire/
         emergency services, and annually review the services regarding the responsiveness
         to community needs, effectiveness, and efficient resource allocation.

Summary of Quantified Objectives 11-30
11 HOUSING
The Housing Element provides an indication of the need for housing in the community,
particularly the availability, affordability, and adequacy of housing. This Housing Element
serves as a strategy to address housing needs across the economic and social spectrum of
the City of West Hollywood.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
Housing Element Requirements
The West Hollywood Housing Element as a mandated chapter of the General Plan has
been designed to satisfy the requirements of State law. Section 65583 of the California
Government Code establishes the required components for a Housing Element. The Housing
Element consists of the following four sections: (1) Statutory Requirements; (2) Context
and Strategies; (3) Goals and Policies; and (4) Housing Programs. The Technical Background
Report (bound separately) provides a detailed assessment of the City’s existing and projected
housing needs, constraints and opportunities for addressing those needs, and an evaluation
of the City’s achievements under the prior 2000-2005 Housing Element (extended by
legislation to cover through June 30, 2008).
This Housing Element covers the planning period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2014. The
Housing Element is designed to achieve the following objectives set forth in State law:
1.	    Identify adequate sites for a range of housing opportunities;
2.	    Assist in the development of adequate and affordable housing;
3.	    Address constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs;
4.	    Conserve and improve the condition of housing; and
5.	    Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
The “Context and Strategies” summarizes the City’s housing needs based on the detailed
review of population and housing stock characteristics contained in the Technical
Background Report. The Technical Background Report contains specific information on the
community’s housing needs, constraints to housing development, and resources available
for the delivery of housing services and affordable housing. A key component of the
detailed analysis contained in the Technical Background Report is the City’s ability to provide
adequate sites to meet its share of the regional housing needs assigned to the City by the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
Having documented the extent of housing needs related to population growth and
changes, as well as market conditions in the Technical Background Report, the Housing
Implementation Plan sets forth goals and policies to address the identified housing needs
and remove/mitigate constraints to the preservation and development of affordable housing.
Specific housing programs designed to implement the City’s goals and policies are identified
in the section entitled “Housing Programs.”
11-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
According to State planning law, the Housing Element must be consistent with other General
Plan elements. While each of the elements is independent, the elements are also interrelated
to a degree. Certain goals and policies of each element may also address issues that are
primary subjects of other elements. This integration of issues throughout the General Plan
creates a strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and achievement of
community goals. The Housing Element is most closely tied to the Land Use Element as
residential development capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated into
the Housing Element.
This Housing Element builds upon other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent
with the policies and goals set forth by the General Plan. When an element in the General
Plan is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified if necessary to ensure
continued consistency among the various elements.
Pursuant to new State law requiring the inclusion of flood issues in the General Plan upon
the next Housing Element update, the General Plan includes a Safety and Noise Element to
address flood hazards and flood management policies.
CONTEXT AND STRATEGIES	
The City of West Hollywood is well recognized as one of the most progressive and inclusive
communities in the region. As a leader in many aspects relating to the provision of housing,
the City takes pride in its proactive efforts in addressing the needs of all socioeconomic
segments of the community.
Changing Housing Needs
West Hollywood is a dynamic community with extensive and changing housing needs.
The elderly, persons with disabilities, and persons living with HIV/AIDS and other medical
conditions continue to represent significant components of the population. However,
these residents often have limited incomes and are therefore less equipped to compete
in the market for decent housing. Providing affordable housing and alternative housing
arrangements (e.g., assisted living, residential care) for the seniors to age in place and for
other persons with special needs to remain in the community is an important goal of the
City.
In recent years, the City has also seen a relatively steady number of families in the
community. Providing suitable housing for families requires a diversification of the City’s
housing stock. Through new construction, the City will facilitate a range of housing options
to meet the varied needs of all residents.
                                                                                  Housing 11-3

Aging Housing Stock
Almost 90 percent of the City’s housing stock is at least 30 years of age, a threshold when
housing generally shows signs of aging, requiring major upgrades to the physical structures
and systems (such as electrical and plumbing). Specifically, close to half (48 percent) of the
housing stock is at least 50 years old. In a tight housing market where the demand for
housing is high, there is little incentive to make improvements to the properties. Many of the
City’s rental housing developments have not gone through any major upgrades.
In addition to maintenance and upkeep issues, the age of the housing stock also means that
the City has a large number of soft-story structures that would present safety concerns in the
event of an earthquake.1 A typical soft-story building in West Hollywood is an apartment
building with “tuck-under” parking. Seismic improvements to upgrade these structures can
be costly.
The City should also consider a comprehensive strategy to address the aging of the housing
stock. The strategy would explore incentives, financial and technical assistance, and
monitoring efforts to facilitate rehabilitation of the City’s aging housing stock. In addition,
acquisition/rehabilitation of deteriorating housing and housing at risk of opting out of the
rental market (being Ellised) represents a key strategy that works to improving the quality of
the housing stock while providing long-term or permanently affordable housing.
Loss of Affordable Housing
West Hollywood has extensive needs for affordable housing. Appropriately 60 percent of
the City’s households earn low and moderate incomes. As of 2010, West Hollywood has
approximately 16,550 rent stabilized units and 1,000 publically assisted rental housing units.
In addition, close to 1,000 households in the City are recipients of Section 8 Housing Choice
Vouchers. With rising housing costs in the region, the City must make all feasible efforts to
protect its affordable housing stock. Upward market pressures (until recently) and creative
mortgage financing schemes have resulted in the removal of rent-stabilized units from the
rental housing market through the Ellis process. In replacement are typically large, luxury
condominium units. While this development trend has expanded housing options for upper
income households in the community, housing options available to the City’s workforce,
elderly, persons with disabilities, lower income families, and other persons with special needs
have remained limited. Ownership housing is beyond the reach of most lower and moderate
income households in the community.
To provide permanent affordable housing in face of diminishing housing funds from the
federal and state levels, the City relies heavily on its locally generated funds. The City’s
Inclusionary Housing program plays a key role in creating permanent affordable housing
that meets the needs of the community. However, as one of the most densely developed
communities in the southland, the City must balance the need for new housing with the
need to protect the quality and integrity of existing neighborhoods.

  required for stability as a matter of earthquake engineering design.
11-4 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Neighborhood Integrity
Many neighborhoods in the City are developed with a mix of uses and underdeveloped
properties face development pressure to be redeveloped into higher intensity uses. In recent
years, the high sale prices of newly developed housing have made it feasible for developers
to purchase and demolish single-family homes and other underdeveloped properties to make
room for condominium developments that do not necessarily address the demographics of
the community.
The City values its residential neighborhoods. As a strategy to facilitate new construction,
the City will direct future housing development away from the residential neighborhoods.
Mixed-use and transit-oriented developments in commercial areas along transportation
corridors will be encouraged through land use planning and incentives.
                                                                               Housing 11-5

HOUSING PROGRAMS
The goals and policies presented earlier are implemented through a series of housing
programs offered primarily through the City’s Rent Stabilization and Housing Department,
Community Development Department and Redevelopment Agency. Housing programs
define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve the stated goals and policies.
Preservation of Existing Housing
1. Code Compliance
Code compliance is a means to ensure the character and quality of neighborhoods and
housing is maintained. The City implements an active code compliance program to identify
properties in violation of the City’s Property Maintenance Code to work with property owners
to rectify substandard conditions. However, many multi-family rental housing properties in
the City have not undergone any major systems upgrade, and many substandard conditions,
such as aging electrical and plumbing systems, are not visible without in-depth inspections.
Moreover, in most cases (smoke detectors being a notable exception), the City cannot
mandate that property owners upgrade building systems to current standards.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Continue to implement the Code Compliance program to ensure routine property
          maintenance and eliminate substandard building conditions.
     •	 Explore the feasibility of establishing a Rental Housing Inspection program that
          focuses on physical/structural conditions. (This program will work hand-in-hand
          with Housing Programs 2 and 3 described below, which both focus on multi-family
          rehabilitation.)
          -	 Identify soft-story buildings in the redevelopment area by 2010-2011.
          -	 Revise proactive inspection program to include identification of mechanical and
             electrical deficiencies (based on consultants’ reports) by 2013.
Funding Sources:
     Departmental budget
Responsible Agencies:
     West Hollywood Rent Stabilization and Housing
                                                                                Housing 11-9

2.     Housing Conditions Survey/Multi-Family Rehabilitation Study
Aging housing stock is a major housing concern in the City. Preserving the City’s existing
housing requires an understanding of the extent of the issues and the feasibility and costs of
preservation, and then devising an appropriate strategy to address the issues.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Conduct a citywide multi-family housing conditions survey to identify the number of
         soft-story structures and properties with rehabilitation needs, including electrical and
         mechanical systems.
        •	 Identify soft story buildings in the redevelopment area by 2010-2011.
        •	 Hire structural engineer to develop options for seismic rehabilitation by 2010-
             2011.
        •	 Hire consultant to evaluate mechanical and electrical needs of typical buildings
             built at different periods by 2010-2011.
     •	 Conduct a study to determine the feasibility of providing seismic upgrades to
         soft-story structures and making electrical and mechanical system improvements
         to deteriorating multi-family structures by 2012. The study will evaluate the
         cost-effectiveness of various prototypical ways to perform upgrades and identify
         potential funding sources, including 80 percent tax increment funds.
     •	 Establish a multi-family housing rehabilitation program by 2013 that incorporates
         green building standards and offers incentives and financial/technical assistance to
         encourage participation.
     •	 Provide financial assistance to nonprofit housing providers to upgrade the City’s
         affordable housing stock with green building improvements by 2010. (The
         City recently provided $500,000 to the West Hollywood Community Housing
         Corporation (WHCHC) to make improvements to several WHCHC buildings.)

3. Multi-Family Rehabilitation and Acquisition/Rehabilitation
The acquisition and rehabilitation of deteriorated residential properties or properties at risk
of being Ellised is a key program in West Hollywood’s overall strategy to provide long-term
affordable housing for lower income families (particularly those of extremely low incomes)
and/or special needs households, including seniors, disabled persons, persons with HIV/AIDS,
single parents and large families.
Under this program, the City provides funds and/or regulatory incentives to non-profit
housing providers to purchase deteriorated properties or properties at risk of being
demolished or otherwise removed from the rental housing market, for example, through
the Ellis process. The non-profits in turn coordinate the rehabilitation, maintenance, and
management of the projects as long-term affordable housing for special needs and/or
lower income households. As an example, the City is currently facilitating the acquisition/
rehabilitation of 1234 Hayworth Avenue by WHCHC. This property was Ellised, with
tenants being evicted, and the property was left abandoned for five years. The City has
committed $10.3 million in Housing Trust Funds and $1.5 million in HOME funds to assist
in the acquisition/rehabilitation of this project. The City has also approved converting this
commitment into permanent financing for the project in exchange for an extension of the
affordability covenant to 55 years.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Through the Code Compliance program and Housing Conditions Survey/Multi-
          Family Rehabilitation Study program, identify apartment complexes in need of
          rehabilitation and support non-profits in acquisition and rehabilitation.
     •	 Educate the public (both tenants and landlords) through brochures, City newsletters,
          and City website, etc., regarding the rights and responsibilities of maintaining
          housing quality standards.
     •	 Acquire approximately 50 units for rehabilitation, with a portion of the units
          targeted for extremely low income households and persons with special needs.
          Projects that provide the largest proportion of housing units for extremely and very
          low income households will receive priority for funding from the City.
     •	 Annually explore funding availability from State and federal sources for acquisition/
          rehabilitation activities.
     •	 Promote the incorporation of universal design features in residential rehabilitation,
          particularly in City-assisted projects.

4. Homes and Gardens Program
The City’s residential façade rehabilitation program, known as Homes and Gardens, provides
owners of single- and multi-family dwellings with financial and technical assistance to
address code violations and make façade and landscaping improvements. The goals of the
program are: (1) to preserve and upgrade the City’s housing stock; and (2) to revitalize,
stabilize and improve the appearance of the City’s residential neighborhoods. Only
residential properties located in the City’s East Side Redevelopment Project Area are eligible
for the Homes and Gardens program. The property owner must enter into an agreement
with the City to conform to the City’s Property Maintenance Standards.
The Homes and Garden Program is divided into two components:
      •	 Façade Rehabilitation Grant. This component of the program provides up to
          $20,000 per residential property in financial assistance through a five-year vanishing
          loan and technical assistance from architects and city staff. For each year that the
          property owner is in compliance with the City’s maintenance standards, one fifth of
          the loan is forgiven. Types of work that might be funded are painting, stucco work,
          replacement of windows, fencing and landscaping improvements.
      •	 Residential Rehabilitation Loans. This component of the program provides loans
          of up to $20,000 per residential property to address health and safety issues. The
          loans bear zero percent interest and payments are deferred until the end of the
          20-year term, or at sale, transfer or refinance of the property. The loan will also
          become due if the property owner does not comply with the City’s maintenance
          standards or program guidelines are violated. Eligible types of work include seismic
          bolting, roof repair, plumbing and electrical system upgrades and bathroom and
          kitchen upgrades.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Provide rehabilitation assistance to improve 20 homes over the planning period.
      •	 Continue to market the program online and at public counters, and coordinate with
          code enforcement staff to provide assistance to eligible property owners.

5. Home Secure Program
Offered as a component of the case management services through the Jewish Family Services
at the Senior Center, the Home Secure Program offers free security devices and home
protection measures, including door locks, grab bars, peep holes, and smoke detectors, to
lower income residents, especially seniors and persons with disabilities.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Assist 50 households annually.
      •	 Continue to advertise the availability of this program on the City’s website and
          provide brochures at public counters.
      •	 Continue to conduct community outreach and make referrals to promote use of the
          program.
Funding Sources:
      General Fund
Responsible Agencies:
      Jewish Family Services
6. Mills Act Contracts
Mills Act contracts are offered to owners of properties, which are designated as Cultural
Resources within the City. Under these contracts, the basis for property tax assessments is
changed from last sale price to an analysis of the income stream of the property for rental
units (or a presumed income stream for owner-occupied units), in recognition of the higher
maintenance costs for historic properties. In exchange for lowered property taxes, the
property owner agrees to a ten-year maintenance plan for the building.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Conduct outreach efforts to owners of historic properties annually.
      •	 Continue to advertise the availability of this program through brochures at public
          counters.
Funding Sources:
      Departmental budget

      West Hollywood Community Development/Planning Division
                                                                              Housing 11-13

Preservation of Affordability
7. Rent Stabilization Ordinance
The City enacted the Rent Stabilization Ordinance in June 1985 to maintain the affordability
of rental housing in West Hollywood. The Ordinance regulates residential rent levels, requires
that rental units meet specific maintenance standards, and protects tenants from eviction
except in specified circumstances. Under the Ordinance, the Maximum Allowable Rent
(MAR), the most a landlord could charge, is the initial rent charged for the tenancy plus any
intervening general adjustments allowed by the City that the landlord charged to the tenant.
In 1995 the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act was passed to enforce gradual Statewide de-
control of rent-controlled housing as vacancy occurs. Full implementation of Costa-Hawkins
began in 1999. Between 1999 and 2008, the average rent of the stabilized units increased
35 percent.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Continue to maintain a Rent Stabilization program, and work towards alleviating
          the effects of State mandated vacancy decontrol through legislative action and local
          incentives to maintain affordable rents.

8. Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)
The Housing Choice Vouchers (formerly known as Section 8 Certificates) are designed
to assist extremely low and very low income households in making their monthly rental
payments by providing a rent subsidy directly to the participating property owner in the
private sector. The objective of the program is to provide the means for decent, safe, sanitary
rental housing for families who might not otherwise be able to afford this type of housing.
The Los Angeles County Housing Authority administers the Section 8 program for the City of
West Hollywood. As of January 2010, approximately 1,000 households in West Hollywood
were receiving Housing Choice Vouchers. The vast majority of these recipients were seniors
and/or persons with disabilities. Based on HUD regulations, 70 percent of the new voucher
recipients must be extremely low income households.
11-14 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to participate in the Housing Choice Vouchers Program and encourage
          local landlords to accept rental vouchers.
      •	 Include information in annual mailings to property owners outlining the benefits of
          the Section 8 program.
      •	 Undertake proactive measures to ensure the continued availability and usefulness
          of Housing Choice Vouchers for West Hollywood residents. Specifically, work with
          the Los Angeles County Housing Authority to maintain and increase the payment
          standards for vouchers to reflect the actual cost of renting in West Hollywood and
          to pursue additional allocation for the City.
      •	 Meet annually with the County Housing Authority to review analysis of market rents
          and Section 8 payment standards.
Funding Sources:		
      HUD funds
Responsible Agencies:
      Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles
9. Preservation of Publicly Assisted Housing
In addition to the City’s rent stabilized housing stock, the City has an inventory of affordable
housing that is assisted with local, state, and federal housing funds. There are 959 publicly
assisted units in multi-family developments in West Hollywood, consisting of 266 WHCHC
units, 365 County-managed housing units, and 328 units owned by other housing providers.
Of these units, three projects totaling 295 senior units have project-based Section 8 contracts
that require renewal periodically. Pursuant to Housing Element definition, these projects are
technically considered at risk of converting to market-rate housing. However, two of the
projects (800 Kings Road and Fairfax Tower) have already applied for renewal of the Section
8 contracts and the third project (1123 Fuller) has also affirmed its intention to renew the
contract. Furthermore, HUD has assigned priority for funding to renew Section 8 contracts
for senior housing. Therefore, the conversion of these projects to market-rate housing is
highly unlikely. Nevertheless, for purposes of the Housing Element law, these projects are
technically defined as “at-risk” due to the expiring Section 8 contracts.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Monitor At-Risk Units. Semi-annually monitor the at-risk projects by continuing to
          maintain close contact with the property owners regarding their long-term plan for
          the projects.
      •	 Conduct Tenant Education. Educate the public regarding “at-risk” housing. It
          has been a long-established City strategy to create permanent affordable housing
          in the City. Virtually all affordable housing units in the City are available either in
          perpetuity or for a very long term. For the three projects that require short-term
          renewal of subsidy contracts, communicate to the public regarding the limited
                                                                                 Housing 11-15

          potential for and required process of conversion and available tenant protection and
          assistance. In the unlikely event that the owners decide not to renew the Section
          8 contracts, work with tenants of at-risk units and provide them with education
          regarding tenant rights and conversion procedures. Hold tenant meetings one year
          prior to expiration of any Section 8 contracts to educate tenants of their rights and
          options.
      •	 Work with Potential Purchasers. Should the property owners be interested in
          selling the properties, provide financial and technical assistance to the WHCHC or
          other non-profit organizations interested in purchasing and/or managing the units
          at risk.
      •	 Pursue State and Federal Funding. Assist non-profit organizations in pursuing
          State and federal funds for the preservation of at-risk units.

10. Condominium Conversion Ordinance
Apartment projects proposed for conversion to common interest developments are subject
to the City’s condominium conversion regulations. These regulations require a permit
for conversion, and substantial compliance with current zoning requirements for newly
developed condominiums, including parking requirements. The Ordinance further makes
provisions for protecting the rights of tenants currently residing in the units that are approved
for conversion. These provisions comprise specific purchasing rights for the tenants as well
eviction clauses to which they must adhere.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to enforce the Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
      •	 Monitor conversion activities annually to ensure the ordinance continues to work
          effectively in the protection of the City’s rental housing stock and tenant rights.

11. Residential Referral List
As an attractive, diverse urban community, West Hollywood has a tight rental market,
with very low vacancies and high rent levels. To assist those seeking rental units in West
Hollywood, the City publishes and updates weekly a list of residential units available for
rent. The list is compiled based on information provided by local landlords and apartment
management companies. The list is available online and emailed to persons registered to
receive the updates.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to make available and update weekly the residential referral list of rental
         units.
      •	 Continue to encourage landlords to participate in this program to expand access to
         information by prospective tenants.

12.      Mixed Use and Transit-Oriented Development
A key policy direction of the City’s General Plan is to ease the development pressures from
residential neighborhoods, while providing opportunities for new housing construction
by encouraging mixed use and transit-oriented along commercial corridors. Mixed
use development standards in the commercial areas are flexible, with the intention of
accommodating a range of unit types and sizes.
As part of this General Plan update, the City proposed rezoning and upzoning portions of
La Brea Avenue, Santa Monica Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue, Robertson Boulevard, Beverly
Boulevard to encourage commercial, mixed use, and transit-oriented developments (where
existing high levels of transit services are provided, and where future transit enhancements
are anticipated). The General Plan update also created the Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay
zone, which identifies certain locations where a mix of residential and commercial uses is
encouraged. The Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay zone is intended to focus residential mixed-
use projects in high priority nodes, focused on commercial corridors and including locations
with high transit levels of service and major intersections. New development with a mix of
residential and commercial uses in this overlay zone may receive an additional 0.5 FAR and
ten (10) feet in height. The additional height and FAR may be used in conjunction with any
incentives provided by the Transit Overlay Zone where both are allowed.
                                                                               Housing 11-17

Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Encourage mixed-use development in the Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay Zone.
     •	 Assist interested developers in site identification and as appropriate, support
          developers in funding applications such as the Infill Housing Grants from the State
          Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).

13. Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requires residential developers to set aside a portion of
units in each new housing development for lower and moderate income households. This
set-aside is 20 percent for projects with over ten units and one unit for projects with ten
or fewer units. For projects with ten or fewer units, however, the City allows the option
of paying an in-lieu fee that is deposited into the City’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund. In
addition, under certain circumstances, projects of any size can apply to provide inclusionary
units off site.
To encourage the construction of affordable housing, the City provides developers who
include inclusionary units in their projects with density bonuses. In addition to the standard
bonus (per State density bonus law), bonuses can allow density increases up to 100 percent
above the maximum density permitted by the underlying zone, if certain provisions are
met. The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance also provides the following regulatory incentives:
reduced requirements in the form of “concessions” or modifications to development
standards (height, setbacks, open space), and permit lower minimum parking requirements.
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance should be periodically monitored for full conformance
with the State density bonus requirements.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Continue to implement the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
     •	 Review the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance within one year of Housing Element
          adoption to confirm that it fully addresses the requirements of the State density
          bonus law.
     •	 Monitor market conditions and development trends by 2012 to ensure that the
          Ordinance works effectively to provide affordable housing in the community but
          does not unduly constrain housing development in general. If constraints are
          identified, the City will make necessary improvements to the ordinance to enhance
          its effectiveness in facilitating the development of housing for all income groups.
     •	 Continue to prioritize inclusionary housing units for tenants displaced due to Ellis.

14. Affordable Housing Development through Partnerships with
Non-Profits
WHCHC plays a major role in providing affordable housing in West Hollywood. Established
in 1986, the WHCHC was formed to build, rehabilitate, and manage affordable housing
developments for lower income and special needs households in the City. WHCHC has
been recognized for its attractive developments and high standard of property management.
WHCHC leverages local funds provided through the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and
redevelopment set-aside with other outside funding, such as Low Income Housing Tax
Credits (LIHTC). In addition to financial assistance, WHCHC receives regulatory incentives
from the City, including reduced parking requirements and waiver of development fees for
affordable projects.
In addition to WHCHC, the City has worked with other non-profits including Menorah
Housing, Los Angeles Housing Partnership, and Alternative Living for the Aging, and is
interested in continuing to support non-profits in the provision of affordable housing.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Continue to support WHCHC and other non-profit organizations in the
          development of affordable and special needs housing through the provision of
          financial and regulatory incentives. Projects with the largest proportion of units
          set aside for extremely low and very low income households will receive priority for
          funding.
     •	 Facilitate the development of 100 affordable units over the planning period, with a
          portion of the units targeted for extremely low income households and persons with
          special needs.

15. Workforce Housing, Family Housing, and Ownership Housing
Opportunities
The City provides affordable rental housing for lower income households through its Rent
Stabilization Ordinance; Inclusionary Housing Ordinance; partnership with nonprofits
to develop, acquire, and rehabilitate affordable housing; and housing choice vouchers.
Homeownership remains out of reach for most of the City’s lower and moderate income
households. Housing options for young families and the City’s workforce are limited in the
community.
In the past, the market conditions had made it financially infeasible to provide affordable
ownership opportunities. With the current market situation, the City is providing eight
affordable ownership units at the pending Ramona project and will continue to pursue
additional opportunities through the City’s Inclusionary Housing program.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 As appropriate and feasible, pursue a portion of the inclusionary housing units as
          affordable ownership units. The City Council will conduct a discussion and provide
          direction on affordable ownership units as part of the inclusionary housing program
          by 2012.
     •	 Encourage the use of Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC) by including a
          presentation on MCCs in the first-time homebuyers educational program annually.
          This program is administered by the County Community Development Commission.
          The qualified homebuyer who is awarded an MCC may take an annual credit
          against their federal income taxes paid on the homebuyer’s mortgage. The credit is
          subtracted dollar-for-dollar from his or her federal income taxes. The qualified buyer
          is awarded a tax credit of up to 15 percent with the remaining 85 percent taken as a
          deduction from the income in the usual manner.
     •	 Annually explore funding potential for homebuyer assistance from other State
          programs that can complement the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.

16. Commercial Development Impact Fee
In conjunction with the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, the City has established
a Commercial Development Impact Fee to mitigate the impact of new commercial
development on the need for affordable housing and generate additional revenues for
affordable housing activities. Under this program, new commercial developments in West
11-20 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Hollywood are required to provide housing affordable to employees or pay an in-lieu impact
fee, which is placed in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be used for a variety of housing
activities, including rehabilitation and new construction.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to implement the Commercial Impact Fee program.
      •	 Study the effectiveness of the Commercial Impact Fee Program by 2013.

17.       Green Building
West Hollywood adopted one of the nation’s first mandatory Green Building Ordinances
and it became effective on October 1, 2007. The ordinance ensures that new buildings
will be healthier for residents, and use energy and resources more efficiently. Flexibility,
responsiveness to local conditions, and cost-effectiveness are key features of the ordinance.
The City has created a Green Building Manual to help guide developers through the process.
The Green Building Requirements and Incentives for Private Development Ordinance focus on
the following:
      •	 Establishes new development standards that apply to all development, including
          all new residential and commercial projects, as well as remodels and tenant
          improvements;
      •	 Develops a point system for new construction with incentives for projects that
          achieve “exemplary” status; and
      •	 Implements “green building” education and outreach program.
The “green” development standards are green building requirements for remodels, tenant
improvements, additions and new construction. These standards were incorporated into
the Zoning Ordinance so that all projects incorporate elements such as drought-tolerant
landscaping, low-flow plumbing fixtures, and energy efficient appliances.
The green building point system is applied to all new structures, with incentives for projects
that go above and beyond minimum requirements. The requirements are structured
as a point system to allow for maximum flexibility and the points allowed reflect West
Hollywood’s unique opportunities and constraints. Specifically, the point system was designed
to emphasize locally-available materials, encourage green elements to be incorporated early
into project design and provide flexibility to alter green elements as the project evolves.
                                                                               Housing 11-21

 Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to implement the Green Building program that offers incentives and
          flexibility for compliance.
      •	 Promote green building standards in the City’s affordable housing stock by providing
          financial assistance for improvements.

18. Potential Sites for RHNA
The City will continue to use specific plans and zoning to ensure that adequate sites are
available (as defined by state housing element law, Government Code section 65583) to
accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for all income groups.
Each year, as part of the City’s annual evaluation of its implementation of the General Plan,
the City will monitor the City’s progress in meeting the RHNA with production and remaining
capacity in development potential in relation to the City’s remaining RHNA. As of January
2010, the City has already met the majority of its RHNA, with a remaining need of only 14
very low income units.
Specifically, the City met a portion of its RHNA through the acquisition/rehabilitation of the
48-unit project at 1234 Hayworth Avenue. This project has been Ellised and the tenants
were evicted; the project has been abandoned for five years. The City has committed $10.3
million in Housing Trust Funds and $1.5 million in HOME funds from the County is available
to assist in the acquisition/rehabilitation of this project. The City has also approved converting
this commitment into permanent financing for the project in exchange for an extension
of the affordability covenant to 55 years. Funding from the AHTF and HOME program has
already been provided to WHCHC in 2009 via a Disposition and Development Agreement for
the acquisition and rehabilitation of 1234 Hayworth. WHCHC has owned the property since
2009 and will commence rehabilitation in the fall of 2010.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Ensure that adequate capacity exists to accommodate the remaining RHNA of 14
          very low income units. As part of this Housing Element update, the City identified
          an inventory of potential sites where higher density residential and mixed use
          developments are appropriate to further the City’s housing goals. The City will
          maintain this inventory and provide information to interested developers.
      •	 Encourage mixed-use in the Commercial Neighborhood 1 and Commercial
          Community zones, and within the Transit Overlay.
11-22 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

      •	 To receive credits against the RHNA, the 1234 Hayworth Avenue project must meet
          the following timeline and requirements:
          –	 Conduct a public hearing and commit financial assistance ($10.3 million in
             Affordable Housing Trust Funds and $1.5 million in HOME funds) for the
             acquisition/rehabilitation of 1234 Hayworth Avenue by June 30, 2010. (The
             Council approved the project and its funding in 2009.)
          –	 Deed restrict the project as affordable housing for at least 20 years.
          –	 Rehabilitation of 1234 Hayworth Avenue is underway; the City will continue to
             monitor project progress.
          –	 Document the implementation of the 1234 Hayworth Avenue project and its
             compliance with the requirements of State law (Government Code Section
             65583.1c(7)) in the Annual Report to HCD on Housing Element Implementation
             by July 1, 2011.
          –	 Prior to occupancy of the rehabilitated units, the City will issue a certificate that
             finds the units comply with all local and State building and health and safety
             requirements.
      •	 Annually monitor the City’s progress toward meeting the RHNA and evaluate the
          land availability to meet the remaining RHNA. If there is a shortfall in sites, the City
          will identify additional sites to replenish the sites inventory to fully accommodate the
          remaining RHNA.

19. Accessory Dwelling Unit
Accessory dwelling units can be an important source of affordable housing for the elderly,
persons with disabilities, single individuals, or single parents. In the City of West Hollywood,
an accessory dwelling unit is defined as a unit accessory to a primary dwelling on the same
site. An accessory residential unit must include complete, independent living facilities for
one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
sanitation, and parking. An accessory dwelling unit cannot exceed 750 square feet and
may be rented. However, given the small lots in the City’s single-family neighborhoods,
the existing requirements for parking and setbacks constrain the development of
accessory dwelling units on most eligible lots. The City is in the process of evaluating new
development standards to promote accessory dwelling units. Recommended standards
include the following:
                                                                                   Housing 11-23

     •	 Maximum size of 500 square feet
     •	 Must be located behind the main house
     •	 Single-story building with a maximum height of 15 feet
     •	 Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.5:1 for the entire site
     •	 Maximum width of 50 percent of lot width
     •	 Must comply with all current codes
     •	 Reduced side yard setbacks from five feet to three feet
     •	 Reduced rear yard setbacks from 15 feet to five feet
     •	 No additional parking required for the accessory unit
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Revise Zoning Ordinance to establish new development standards for accessory units
         within one year of Housing Element adoption.
     •	 Provide technical assistance to homeowners by developing prototypical site designs
         that can be used on typical R1A properties.

Removal of Governmental Constraints
20. Zoning Ordinance Update
Extremely low income households and households with special needs have limited housing
options. Housing types appropriate for these groups include: emergency shelters, transitional
housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units. Pursuant to State law,
the City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to make provisions for such housing.
Timeframe and Objectives:
Pursuant to State Law, the Zoning Ordinance will be amended, within one year of the
adoption of the 2008-2014 Housing Element, to address the following:
     •	 Emergency Shelters. Pursuant to State Law, amend the Zoning Ordinance to
         permit homeless shelters with a ministerial permit within an overlay zone to
         be created over the City’s Community Commercial district along Santa Monica
         Boulevard. Pursuant to State law, the City may establish standards such as:
         o	 The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly;
         o	 Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking
            requirements for other residential or commercial uses in the same zone;
11-24 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

   o	 The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake areas;
   o	 The provision of onsite management;
   o	 The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are
      not required to be more than 300 feet apart;
   o	 The length of stay;
   o	 Lighting; and
   o	 Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
   The overlay zone will encompass at least 100 properties to include areas with older
   structures that can be renovated to accommodate an emergency shelter. The City will
   ensure that standards established will be the same as for similar uses in the same zone.
•	 Transitional Housing. Pursuant to State law, amend the Zoning Ordinance to
   address transitional housing and differentiate the different forms transitional
   housing can take (group quarters versus regular housing developments). For
   transitional housing facilities that operate as regular housing developments, meeting
   the Health and Safety Code definition, such uses will be permitted by right where
   housing is permitted.
   For transitional housing facilities that operate as group quarters, such facilities will
   be permitted as large residential care facilities. Potential conditions for approval
   of transitional housing for more than six persons in a group quarters setting may
   include hours of operation, security, loading requirements, noise regulations, and
   restrictions on loitering. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses
   and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities.
•	 Supportive Housing. Pursuant to State Law, amend the Zoning Ordinance to
   address supportive housing and differentiate the different forms supportive housing
   can take (group quarters versus regular housing developments). For supportive
   housing facilities that operate as regular housing developments, meeting the Health
   and Safety Code definition, such uses will be permitted by right where housing is
   permitted.
   For supportive housing facilities that operate as group quarters, such facilities
   will be permitted as residential care facilities. Potential conditions for approval of
   transitional housing for more than six persons in a group quarters setting may
   include hours of operation, security, loading requirements, noise regulations, and
   restrictions on loitering. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses
   and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities.
•	 Single Room Occupancy (SRO). Pursuant to State Law, amend the Zoning
   Ordinance to conditionally permit SROs in the R3 and R4 zones. Criteria that would
   be used to review CUP applications for SROs pertain to performance standards
   and will be specific to the proposed use. Potential conditions for approval of
   these facilities may include hours of operation, security, loading requirements and
                                                                           Housing 11-25

          management. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses in the
          same zones and would not serve to constrain the development of such facilities.
     •	 Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance. The City of West Hollywood does
          not have a formal procedure for a reasonable accommodation request. A formal
          procedure would include a specified process that would be determined based on the
          following factors:
          o	 Special need created by the disability;
          o	 Potential benefit received by the modification;
          o	 Potential impact on surrounding uses;
          o	 Physical attributes of the property and structures;
          o	 Alternative accommodations that may provide equivalent benefits;
          o	 Whether the targeted accommodation would place an undue financial or
             administrative burden on the City; and
          o	 Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration
             in law, policy or procedure of the City.
          The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include a formal procedure that utilizes
          administrative procedures to provide for reasonable accommodation requests.

21. Streamlined Processing
Residential development in West Hollywood requires permits and/or approvals from various
City departments, such as a permit to remove rental units from the Rent Stabilization and
Housing Department, and Planning Commission approval of a subdivision map and site plan.
In order to streamline project processing, the City requires Planning Commission review of
apartments and projects with five or more units in R1, R2, and R3 zones, or nine or more
units in R4 zones.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     •	 Review the City’s permit processing procedures to further streamline the review and
          approval process by 2012 in conjunction with the Zoning Code update.
     •	 Provide a development handbook to guide developers through City processes and
          requirements by 2013 upon completion of the Zoning Code update.

22. Fee Waivers for Affordable Housing
The City levies various impact fees on new developments to address deficiencies in
community amenities, such as parks, transit-related facilities, and art. To ensure that impact
fees do not constrain affordable housing development, the City exempts WHCHC projects
and residential developments with more than 25 percent affordable housing units from the
art, park, and transportation fees (per Section 9594.f of the Zoning Ordinance). In addition,
the City has adopted a policy waiving all City-imposed plan check and other fees for non-
sponsored projects that are 100 percent affordable.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to waive art, park, and transportation fees for WHCHC and projects with
          25 percent or more affordable units.
      •	 Continue to waive all City-imposed plan check and other fees for nonprofit-
          sponsored projects are 100 percent affordable.
      •	 Annually review the City’s various planning and development fees to ensure they are
          reasonable and do not unduly constrain housing development.

Equal Housing Opportunity
23. Fair Housing Program
As a participating jurisdiction in the Los Angeles County CDBG program, fair housing services
are coordinated by the County Community Development Commission on behalf of the City.
The County contracts with the Housing Rights Center, a non-profit organization, to identify,
mediate, investigate, and if necessary, prosecute landlords and property owners in violation
of fair housing laws. The Housing Rights Center also provides information to the public
about housing discrimination and landlord/tenant rights and responsibilities.
Timeframe and Objectives:
                                                                              Housing 11-27

      •	 Continue to provide fair housing information to the public via the public counters,
           message boards, City website, and neighborhood watch, and in response to
           telephone inquiries.
      •	 Continue to provide referral to the Housing Rights Center, State Fair Employment
           and Housing, HUD Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity division, and other legal
           services as appropriate.
      •	 Coordinate with the Apartment Owners of Association of Greater Los Angeles,
           Realtor Associations, and other housing organizations to provide education and
           outreach on fair housing issues.

24. Tenant/Landlord Mediation
Mediation is an informal and voluntary way of resolving disputes between tenants and
landlords. The City offers a mediation program as an alternative means to settle disputes
regarding maintenance, housing services, and other tenant/landlord issues. Mediation is
free, voluntary, and informal. Mediation is conducted by the Legal Services Division in a
neutral setting. The City also contracts additional service from Dispute Resolution Services.
The mediator is an impartial third party who serves to facilitate the discussion and focus on
all the issues. The tenant and landlord have the opportunity to communicate openly and
directly with each other to arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to offer the mediation program and provide information on City website
           and program brochures at public counters.
Funding Sources:	
      Departmental budget
Responsible Agencies:	
      West Hollywood Human Services Department and Dispute Resolution Services
25. Tenant Eviction Protection Program
The City’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance limits the grounds on which a tenant may be evicted
to the following: nonpayment of rent; creating a nuisance or using a rental unit for illegal
purposes; subleasing without a landlord’s permission; failure to provide the landlord with
reasonable access; violating the rental agreement; and failure to renew a rental agreement.
Tenants may also be evicted when the owner seeks to withdraw the entire property from the
rental housing market pursuant to the Ellis Act. Certain of these evictions entitle the tenant
to receive relocation assistance from the tenant’s landlord.
11-28 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to prevent unlawful eviction and fund legal aid organizations that provide
          tenant education and representation regarding landlord/tenant disputes.
      •	 Renew contracts with mediation service providers annually.
      •	 Annually review current laws and recommend any needed modifications to ensure
          protection of tenants to the maximum extent legally possible.

26.	 Services for Special Needs Populations
The City financially supports various non-profit services providers that help meet the
supportive services needs of West Hollywood residents, including lower income households,
seniors, disabled persons, persons with HIV/AIDS, and the homeless. Major non-profit
service providers active in West Hollywood include Alternative Living for the Aging,
Menorah Housing, Being Alive, and AID For AIDS. Services currently offered through
these organizations include roommate referrals, senior nutrition sites, home improvement
assistance, health center, in-home supportive services, peer counseling, short-term financial
assistance for rent and utilities, and legal services.
To assist in meeting the special housing needs of the homeless, the Human Services
Department provides shelter referrals to various facilities, including: PATH (People Assisting
the Homeless); and the Year-Round Emergency Shelter Hotline. Referral is also provided for
medical needs, food distribution, case management, and counseling.
The Human Services Department publishes on-line a social services directory to provide the
community with detailed information on assistance or services available, including food and
shelter, AIDS education, pre-school, job placement, legal services, mental health services, and
homeless services. These services are provided by contracts with local non-profit agencies
and by in-house programs. The directory can also be obtained by contacting the Human
Services Department.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to provide financial support to non-profit services providers that help meet
          the supportive services needs of West Hollywood’s diverse community, especially
          those with extremely low incomes.
      •	 Annually update the social services directory, and make it available to residents at
          public counters and on City website.
                                                                               Housing 11-29

The Enhanced Management Program is administered by WHCHC at all of its projects. This
program combines standard property management practices with referral to community
service agencies, information about supportive services and community building activities. At
each WHCHC development, a Resident Services Coordinator is available and responsible for
maintaining contact with residents and monitoring their need for social services.
Timeframe and Objectives:
      •	 Continue to coordinate with WHCHC to continue the Enhanced Management
           Program at all current and future housing projects.
      •	 Encourage other nonprofit housing providers to follow the WHCHC model.

02 GOVERNANCE
This chapter of the General Plan describes the system of governance in the City and provides
goals and policies for West Hollywood to continue its positive relationship with residents,
businesses, and visitors. Implementation actions are contained in a separate chapter.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
The State of California does not require that a city’s general plan address governance.
However, the City of West Hollywood views this as a critical topic for its community, so it is
included as an optional element.
CONTEXT
Since its incorporation as a City in 1984, the City of West Hollywood has established itself on
the cutting edge of important social movements both as a community and as a municipality.
Called “the creative city” for its collection of art, design and architecture, it is also creative
in its personal and compassionate approach to city government. Since its incorporation, the
City has prioritized excellence in governance and positive, constructive relationships with its
residents, business owners, visitors, and neighbors. Some of the key accomplishments in 25
years of Cityhood include:
  •	 Adopting landmark legislation such as the City’s comprehensive Rent Stabilization
     Ordinance, Ordinance Prohibiting Discrimination Against People with HIV and AIDS,
     Domestic Partnership Ordinance, and the Ordinance Prohibiting Discrimination in
     Employment based on Sexual Orientation. Many of the City’s landmark ordinances have
     been duplicated throughout the United States and other countries.
  •	 Providing millions of dollars in grants to fund social service programs for people in need.
     The City’s social services funding remains among the highest per capita in the nation.
  •	 Sponsoring one of the first AIDS Awareness campaigns in the country in October 1985.
     The City’s response to the AIDS crisis has been largely recognized as a model for other
     cities both nationally and globally.
  •	 Adopting a Domestic Partnership Ordinance which provides equal rights for domestic
     partners and married couples in the City (1985).
  •	 Establishing a non-profit housing development corporation, the West Hollywood
     Community Housing Corporation (WHCHC) (1986).
  •	 Establishing the West Hollywood Marketing and Visitor Bureau to promote and market
     West Hollywood as a premier global travel destination (1986).
  •	 Creating the CityLine Shuttle service which transports tens of thousands of persons
     a year (1992).
2-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

  •	 Adopting the Sunset Specific Plan (SSP) to control growth and ensure development
     consistent with protecting the landmark street’s legacy (1995).
  •	 Establishing the East Side Redevelopment Project Area (1997).
  •	 Completing the Santa Monica Boulevard Reconstruction Project, a two-year roadway
     improvement and beautification plan for the 3-mile stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard
     between La Brea Avenue and Doheny Drive (2001).
  •	 Hosting some of the most popular special events in Southern California including the
     internationally-renowned West Hollywood Halloween Carnival, Christopher Street West
     LGBT PRIDE Festival and Parade, West Hollywood Book Fair and the Sunset Strip Music
     Festival. Each year hundreds of thousands of people visit West Hollywood to attend
     special events.
  •	 Adopting the Green Building Ordinance (Green Building Requirements and Incentives
     for Private Development Ordinance) for both residential and commercial development
     in West Hollywood. It was one of the first mandatory Green Building programs in the
     country (2007).
Civic Engagement
The West Hollywood community prides itself on being highly active in its own governance,
and the City is committed to actively seeking public participation. The City strives to create
an open process through which it can respond to its constituents’ needs while balancing
competing interests and opposing views. It is also committed to treating all individuals with
respect and dignity, and providing courtesy and thoughtfulness in all interactions. West
Hollywood values the artistic richness, idealism, and creativity of its community members.
These qualities are an invaluable source of input to City staff and elected officials as
they work with community members to create a more vibrant, socially rich, economically
successful, and beautiful place to live, work, and play.
City Council and Staff
West Hollywood is a general law city governed by the City
Council/City Manager form of government. The City Council
is elected by the community to provide leadership and policy
direction and make important decisions on behalf of the City.
City Council members serve for a term of four (4) years and
are elected at large by the residents of West Hollywood. The
Council selects a different Council member each spring to serve
as Mayor and Mayor Pro Tempore. City Council establishes and
makes direct and at-large appointments to the City’s various
Commissions and Advisory Boards. City Council hears appeals
of Planning Commission decisions and reviews certain Historic
Preservation Commission decisions. In addition, the City Council
selects and formalizes on an annual basis the issues it feels          City Hall is located at the corner

budgeting process. The City Council appoints the City Manager to implement the City
Council’s direction and to oversee City staff, who carry out the City’s daily functions and
operations.
City Council proceedings are open to the public. The City of West Hollywood posts
current agendas and maintains an extensive on-line archive of previous meetings and
Council Minutes. The City also provides live and archived streaming video of City Council
Meetings on-line and on the City’s cable television channel.
Community Representation
The City has a variety of Commissions and Advisory Boards that represent various community
interests and perspectives. These bodies, which address a range of topics of importance
to the City, are comprised of community members – residents, businesses representatives,
and other stakeholders. The Commissions and Advisory Boards represent the community by
making recommendations and/or decisions that guide City policy and actions. From time to
time, the City also forms ad-hoc committees to address topics of current importance. The
committees are typically formed to address a specific topic or issue and then, once resolved,
are disbanded.
Advisory Boards
City Advisory Boards provide advice to City Council regarding the unique interests and needs
of West Hollywood. Members of Advisory Boards must either: (1) be a resident of West
Hollywood; (2) be an owner of a legitimate business entity in the City; or (3) work in the City
of West Hollywood or for a business or agency that serves West Hollywood. Each member of
the Board serves a two-year term, and can be reappointed by City Council. Advisory Boards
are not required by state or local laws. The City Council may add, alter, or disband advisory
boards in its discretion. Topics addressed by City Advisory Boards have included: matters of
interest to women; the Russian, lesbian and gay, transgender, and senior communities; and
persons with disabilities.
Commissions
The City’s various commissions make recommendations to the City Council, and in some
circumstances have approval authority, for a range of topic areas important to the City’s
services, operations and development over time. It is within the purview of the City Council
to establish the composition, work, and responsibilities of any Commission. Typically, the
following requirements apply to the City’s commissions:
  •	 Commissions typically consist of five (5) members, appointed by individual Council
     members, and two (2) members appointed by the Council as a whole (at-large).
  •	 Each member of a commission serves a two-year term commencing June 1st following a
     general municipal election.
2-4 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

  •	 Members must have a significant interest in the City such as residency, business or
     residential ownership, economic involvement or some other valid link to be determined
     by the City Council.
  •	 Members of each commission may not be officers or employees of the City.
Commissions have been formed to address topics including: arts and cultural affairs, business
licensing, human services, public facilities, public safety, transportation, rent stabilization,
redevelopment, and historic preservation.
The Planning Commission is a permanent commission of the City. It is the only Commission
that is required to be enacted under State law. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to
review and act on certain matters related to planning and development. The project or
application types addressed by the Planning Commission are detailed in the City’s Zoning
Ordinance. For certain types of development applications, the Planning Commission is
required to review and either approve or deny, with the City Council only reviewing if the
Planning Commission’s decision is appealed.
Certain planning and development decisions are required by state law to be reviewed and
either approved or denied by the City Council at a public hearing, subsequent to a review
and recommendation by the Planning Commission. This occurs anytime any of the following
are part of a development application:
  •	 Specific Plan
  •	 Development Agreement
  •	 Zone Map Amendment
  •	 Zone Text Amendment
  •	 Cultural Resource Designations
  •	 General Plan Amendment
  •	 General Plan Map Amendment
The Planning Commission includes both standing and ad-hoc subcommittees. Over the years,
these subcommittees have addressed topics including design, long-range planning, and
signs. The Subcommittees do not vote, nor do they take any other legal action, and are not
required by law.
                                                                                Governance 2-5

Regional Partnerships
Part of the City’s decision-making process involves having strong partnerships and
relationships with outside agencies and organizations. This is due to both a desire to have
good relations with the City’s neighbors and out of necessity, since West Hollywood is
bordered by other jurisdictions and receives many services from outside agencies. The City
commonly works on issues of mutual interest with the adjacent cities of Los Angeles and
Beverly Hills. The City’s police and library services are provided by Los Angeles County, and it
is part of Los Angeles County’s Consolidated Fire Protection Service District.
In addition, a variety of outside agencies provide services to the City’s residents and
businesses. These include the Los Angeles Unified School District, the City of Beverly Hills
and the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for water service, wastewater
collection from the City of Los Angeles, and energy form Southern California Edison. City
staff and members of the City Council regularly participate in the regional decision-making
process. Elected officials and staff are actively involved with the Westside Cities Council
of Governments, the Southern California Association of Governments, Metro, and other
regional agencies.
E-Governance
The City recognizes and supports the need to maintain a high level of service to the
community. It further recognizes the need to pursue and engage various informational
technologies to make communications more efficient and accessible. The City’s Public
Information Office regularly updates its New Media Strategy, which includes use of social
networking, streaming video, photo-sharing, and other technologies as they evolve. In order
to continue to improve the ease of doing business with the City, additional services including
online permitting services for certain types of development or building projects, and
streamlined processing of general requests for service or information are being explored.

Goal LU-12: Enhance Santa Monica Boulevard West as a
destination for nightlife and entertainment, a focus of the LGBT
community, and a center for neighborhood-serving retail and
restaurants.
Intent: To expand Santa Monica Boulevard West, from Doheny Drive to Havenhurst
Drive (just west of Crescent Heights Boulevard), as a center of West Hollywood’s local
nightlife and entertainment scene. The General Plan envisions this area retaining its
identity as a regional destination for nightlife and entertainment – a place where
residents of the greater Los Angeles area come to dine and socialize – and as a focus
of the LGBT community. It should continue to have a vibrant street environment
with outdoor dining and high volumes of pedestrian activity. It should also support
neighborhood-serving uses that benefit local residents and encourage pedestrian
activity during both day and evening. Land use policies in this General Plan
incentivize new higher intensity, mixed-use residential development in three nodes
in this sub-area. These nodes are near the intersection with Doheny Drive, along
Santa Monica Boulevard east of San Vicente Boulevard and near the intersection
of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard. Land use policies shall not
permit residential development on certain parcels on Santa Monica Boulevard, and
certain parcels adjacent to those fronting on Santa Monica Boulevard, generally
between Almont Drive and Larrabee Street, where such uses may be incompatible
with existing entertainment uses.
The policies in LU-12 apply to Area 2 shown in Figure 3-7.

           a.	 Locate buildings on or near the sidewalk edge to create an attractive and
                interesting pedestrian environment.
           b.	 Support pedestrian activity and business vitality – and the overall experience
                of the streetscape – through active and transparent ground floor frontages
                with main entries that face the street.
           c.	 Encourage projects to incorporate landscape elements into the design of
                building frontages or courtyards to continue the greening of the City’s public
                spaces and streetscapes.
LU-12.8	 When appropriate, require that development projects adjacent to West Hollywood
           Park take into consideration the West Hollywood Park Master Plan and provide
           connectivity to the Park.
LU-12.9	 Require development projects to incorporate combinations of setbacks, scale
           transitions, and buffers, as appropriate, in relation to existing residential areas and
           to maintain physical compatibility between new and existing buildings.
LU-12.10	      Seek to create a park-once district for this area that allows for centralized,
           shared parking facilities from which customers and employees can then walk to
           and between multiple destinations.
LU-12.11	 Consider the requirement for transit station sites to include a public open space
           (such as a plaza) and uses that support high-volume pedestrian activity such as
           retail and restaurants for development projects immediately adjacent to the station
           entrance.
Goal LU-13: Support a vibrant, high-density transit-oriented
commercial district centered around the intersection of Santa
Monica Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.
Intent: To expand the area’s mix of multi-family residences and commercial uses and
to support an evolution over time into a more intense mixed-use transit node that
capitalizes on high levels of bus ridership, potential future transit enhancements, a
cluster of rehabilitated historic buildings, and artistic and educational institutions.
Allowing parcels near and at the intersection of Santa Monica and Fairfax to
intensify over time with mixed-use buildings will accommodate a wide variety of
neighborhood-serving retail uses within walking distance of residences and regional
transit lines.
The policies in LU-13 apply to Area 3 shown in Figure 3-8.
LU-13.1	       Support the location of a transit station near the intersection of Santa Monica
           Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.
LU-13.2	       Allow residential uses on the upper floors of all buildings in Area 3.
LU-13.3	 Focus and encourage new mixed-use developments to locate in the Mixed-Use
           Incentive Overlay Zone. These parcels are located near the intersections of Santa

                                    Goal LU-14: Encourage a high-intensity, lively and vibrant transit-
                                    oriented commercial area centered around the intersection of
                                    Santa Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue.
                                    Intent: To create a high-intensity, lively and vibrant transit node with an active
                                    sidewalk scene and an identifiable sense of place, marking a major eastern entry
                                    to the City. It is physically defined by the presence of the Gateway retail center and
                                    nearby film and media facilities, and can capitalize on high levels of pedestrian
                                    activity and bus ridership, as well as potential future transit enhancements. Over
                                    time, the area is intended to transition into a pedestrian-oriented district with a
                                    diverse mix of neighborhood and regional retail stores, jobs, and transit-oriented
                                    housing.

          a.	 Retail uses that activate the street should be encouraged.
          b.	 Primarily neighborhood-serving uses are encouraged on the north side of
               Santa Monica Boulevard.
          c.	 Primarily regional-serving retail should be encouraged along La Brea Avenue
               and on the south side of Santa Monica Boulevard.
LU-14.4	 Encourage an increase in the amount and diversity of multi-family residential uses
          in this area.
LU-14.5	 Continue to enhance the La Brea/Santa Monica intersection as a major gateway to
          West Hollywood through building architecture, streetscape design, and signage.
LU-14.6	 Encourage the design of new buildings that emphasize this area as a unique point
          along the Santa Monica Boulevard corridor and within the City.
LU-14.7	      Seek to create a park-once district for the area that allows for centralized,
          shared parking facilities and that enables visitors to park once and then walk to
          their destinations.
LU-14.8	      Enhance pedestrian activity along Santa Monica Boulevard through the
          following building and public realm activities:
          a.	 Improve the streetscape with tree plantings, landscaping and public amenities
               such as benches.
          b.	 Locate buildings at or near the sidewalk edge to create an attractive
               pedestrian environment.
          c.	 Encourage projects to incorporate landscape elements into the design of
               buildings to enhance green space in the City.
          d.	 Support pedestrian activity and the experience along the streetscape through
               active and transparent ground floor frontages.
LU-14.9	      Consider the requirement for transit station sites to include a public open space
          (such as a plaza) and uses that support high-volume pedestrian activity such as
          retail and restaurants for development projects immediately adjacent to the station
          entrance.
LU-14.10	 Encourage new mixed-use development in Area 4.
LU-14.11	 Apply the Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay Zone to all parcels in area 4, with the
          exception of parcels designated with the Movietown Specific Plan designation.
                                                            Land Use and Urban Form 3-45
Goal LU-15: Maintain Sunset Boulevard as a regional, national,
and international destination for entertainment, and the primary
economic engine of the City.
Intent: To enhance Sunset Boulevard as the highest intensity area of West
Hollywood, a popular and iconic national and international destination for
entertainment, and the primary economic engine of the City. Also known as The
Sunset Strip, the area will continue to have a diverse mix of entertainment, retail,
office and hotels that support the entertainment and destination-oriented character
of the area. This will include a vital and varied streetscape with a diverse mix of
architectural styles, building heights, and uses. General Plan polices call for continued
varied land use as well as an enhanced pedestrian environment to promote walking
between destinations. To further activate the pedestrian environment, additional
ground-floor retail uses are encouraged and parking is called for in centralized
locations, thus encouraging people to park once and walk to their destinations.
The policies in LU-15 apply to Area 5 shown in Figure 3-10.

03 LAND USE AND URBAN FORM
This chapter of the General Plan provides goals and policies to guide the continuing
evolution of West Hollywood’s urban form and land use patterns. In coordination with the
Mobility and Historic Preservation chapters, it defines how the City’s buildings and public
spaces – homes, stores, offices, parks, streets, and sidewalks – should organize and shape
the community in the future. By establishing a vision for the built environment, the City
is inviting property owners, business owners, and community members to invest private
funds into the development, preservation, and rehabilitation of buildings, land uses, and
infrastructure.
The outreach process for the creation of this General Plan found that most members of
the West Hollywood community already consider it a great place to live, socialize, shop,
work, and do business. Most take pride in the City’s unique character and the quality
of its physical fabric. At the same time, many residents and business owners feel that
targeted improvements to urban form and land use activity could improve the quality of
life and enhance the City’s standing as a world-class community. With this in mind, the
overall strategy of this chapter is to propose targeted enhancements while preserving the
City’s many diverse assets. The goals and policies in this chapter are designed to maintain
and enhance the City’s residential neighborhoods and to focus future development along
commercial corridors served by existing and potential future transit.
This chapter begins by describing the statutory requirements for addressing land use and
urban form in a general plan. Next is a description of the City’s existing urban form and
land uses. This sets the stage for the Land Use Designations section, which both defines
the different designations used in the General Plan and provides a map showing where the
different land use designations apply. Finally, the chapter concludes with goals and policies
organized according to the following topics:
   •	 Urban Form and Pattern
   •	 Urban Design
   •	 Public Spaces and Streetscape
   •	 Residential Neighborhoods
   •	 Commercial Areas

3-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
California law (Government Code Section 65302(a)) requires that a city’s general plan
include:
      “. . . a land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and
      general location and extent of uses of the land for housing, business, industry and open
      space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic
      beauty, public buildings and grounds, solid waste disposal facilities and other categories
      of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of
      the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various
      districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The required land use element has the broadest scope of the required elements of a general
plan, regulating how all land in a city is to be used in the future. To fully reflect the range
of physical attributes that are important for West Hollywood’s success, this chapter also
contains goals and policies to guide urban form and design.
CONTEXT
West Hollywood’s urban structure and land use pattern reflects its history of development
and social policy over time. At the time of its incorporation as a City in 1984, West
Hollywood was already a dense, urban community in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles
County surrounded on all sides by other cities – the City of Los Angeles to the east, north
and south, and Beverly Hills to the west.
A more detailed history of development patterns in the City can be found
in the Introduction Chapter.
West Hollywood is physically a “corridor city” with its
major east-west corridors Santa Monica and Sunset
Boulevards connecting the City of Los Angeles with
Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and the ocean, and
major north-south corridors of La Brea Boulevard,
Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard connecting
Hollywood and the Hollywood Hills with the rest of
the Los Angeles basin south of West Hollywood. In
between the corridors is a rich variety of residential        Sunset Boulevard is a bustling commercial

neighborhoods, each containing a mix of residential
building types, architectural styles and public spaces.
The land uses within West Hollywood’s various neighborhoods and commercial areas include
residential housing, public spaces like parks and streets, a small amount of industrial activity,
and commercial activities such as restaurants, retail stores, offices, hotels, services, and
                                                                Land Use and Urban Form 3-3

entertainment. Some areas within the City’s commercial areas have a mix of uses, including both
residential and commercial uses within the same building, on the same parcel, or on neighboring
parcels. Table 3-1 identifies the total distribution of existing land uses in West Hollywood as of
January 2008. All acres are based on the net buildable land in the city, which does not include
streets, roads or alleyways. Overall, 316 acres in the city, or 26 percent of the total gross land
area, is used for streets, alleys, and other public rights-of-way. A discussion of each category is
included below.

Neighborhoods
West Hollywood’s different neighborhoods contain residential land uses with a limited amount
of commercial and public uses. At approximately 66 percent of the total land area (excluding
streets), residential land uses occupy the most acreage of any category in West Hollywood, with
24,814 housing units in 586 acres.
Many neighborhoods are predominantly multi-family, including historic or modern apartments,
while some neighborhoods are predominantly single-family. Figure 3-1 identifies the City’s single-
family and multi-family areas. The buildings within the neighborhoods vary in their form and
architectural style, in the scale and design of their open spaces, and in their role in the overall life
of the City. The majority of the City’s housing stock (63% of residential units) was built between
the 1950s and 1970s. By comparison, approximately 10% of existing residential units have been

built in the years since (1980 – 2009). This indicates that some of the residential buildings
in West Hollywood are aging and may be in need of significant maintenance, repair or
replacement during the time horizon of the General Plan. Single-family and multi-family
neighborhoods are described in succession below.
In the 20 years since 1990, the City has grown by an estimated 739 dwelling units and 1,462
people. Compared to most other cities in California, this is a very slow rate of growth and is
due to the fact that there is little vacant land for development. Nearly all development that
has occurred in the past decade consists of the replacement of existing buildings with new
ones, and this trend is likely to continue to occur into the future.
The majority of residential housing units are renter-occupied (78 percent)
and a relatively small percentage is owner-occupied (22 percent).
Multi-family Neighborhoods
Nearly 80 percent of the City’s housing stock is multi-family housing, featuring a multitude
of architectural styles. Architectural styles range from early 20th century courtyard
apartments to striking mid-Century buildings, to complexes built in the 1960s and 1970s,
to contemporary apartments and condominiums. The eclectic character of the residential
streets, generally high quality of nearby public spaces, and the proximity to a remarkable
array of employment, commercial, and entertainment opportunities makes these
neighborhoods a desirable regional address.
Single-family Neighborhoods
The City has a number of medium density single-family
residential neighborhoods that are physically unique
from the other residential areas of the City. They
feature small urban parcels with eclectic single-family
homes and walkable neighborhood streets. Some
of these single-family neighborhoods include classic
early 20th century bungalows, and most have well
landscaped residential street design.
                                                             A variety of architectural styles, including

Commercial Sub-Areas                                         neighborhoods.
West Hollywood’s commercial and other non-residential land uses are mostly located along
the City’s main thoroughfares and serve the surrounding neighborhoods as well as the
region. There are five commercial areas identified for purposes of this General Plan: the
Melrose/Beverly District, Santa Monica Boulevard West, the Santa Monica/Fairfax Transit
District, the Santa Monica/La Brea Transit District, and Sunset Boulevard. These areas are
described below and illustrated on Figure 3-2. About 23 percent (or 212 acres) of the City’s
land area (excluding streets) is occupied by commercial uses. The City’s commercial areas
contain a few industrial parcels as well as some vacant land and parking lots, which account
for about 5 percent of the land area of the City.

Melrose/Beverly District
The Melrose/Beverly District, also known as “The Avenues,” is
composed of segments of Melrose Avenue, Robertson Boulevard,
and Beverly Boulevard and surrounds the landmark Pacific Design
Center (PDC). The PDC is a national and international center for
the arts, fashion, design, and furnishings businesses. The District is
characterized by the contrasts between the small, closely-packed
scale of the commercial buildings and streetscape along Melrose
and Robertson and the monumental scale of the PDC and nearby
                                                                           Robertson Boulevard is known

Santa Monica Boulevard West
Sometimes referred to as “Boystown”, this section of
the City’s 3-mile Santa Monica Boulevard corridor is a
local and regional commercial destination with a large
concentration of LGBT-oriented businesses, offering
a variety of restaurants, retail, and entertainment
businesses, as well as neighborhood-serving uses, within
a walkable urban district.

Santa Monica/Fairfax Transit District
This section of the corridor supports diverse commercial
uses that fulfill the needs of the adjacent neighborhoods
and transit users. It is the current location of a significant
number of transit routes and transfer points. The area
is characterized by service and retail businesses oriented
to the local community, including a number of Russian-
oriented businesses.
                                                                Santa Monica Boulevard features a mix of

Sunset Strip
Sunset Boulevard, also known as The Sunset Strip, is a
renowned urban corridor, tracing the southerly foothills of
the Santa Monica Mountains. Its entertainment, restaurant,
shopping, and hospitality destinations attract visitors from
around the country and abroad.
Public Spaces                                                       The Sunset Strip has a vibrant nightlife
                                                                    scene.
The City’s public spaces – its streets and streetscapes,
parks and plazas, and public buildings – create much of its urban character. They
also provide an important amenity for residents, workers, and visitors to socialize,
recreate, circulate, rest, and gather. The City’s public spaces are its public face, and
are often the areas that visitors and residents most readily remember and associate
with the City. The different types of public spaces in the City are described below
and are shown in Figure 3-3.
Streets and Streetscape
The great majority of West Hollywood’s public space is in the form of streets and
sidewalks. As is stated above, the streets, sidewalks and alleyways account for over
a quarter of the total land area in West Hollywood. The character and appearance,
or “the streetscape,” defines the experience for those who use the street. This is
especially true of pedestrians, for whom the level of safety, comfort, and aesthetic
quality is a major attractor or detractor. Most residential neighborhoods in the
City have tree-lined streets and sidewalks. In the commercial areas, most streets
have interesting retail frontages along sidewalks, with amenities such as benches,
landscaping, and street trees. Santa Monica Boulevard, in particular, has been
improved with a comprehensive streetscape program. At
the same time, there are locations that could benefit from
targeted improvements to sidewalks, crossings, landscape,
building frontages, and streets.
Parks and Open Space
The City has a number of parks and other open spaces that
act as central meeting and gathering points for community
life. Overall, there are approximately 15 acres of parks
throughout the City, with the majority of acreage in two
parks – West Hollywood Park, on the western side of the
City, and Plummer Park, on the eastern side. Master plans for
these parks, already being implemented, will add more than
three acres of green space within the parks. There are also
                                                                    The Crescent Heights Triangle on Santa
several smaller parks, pocket parks, green spaces designed for      Monica Boulevard offers a generous open
traffic-calming, and plazas located throughout the City.            space, lush plantings, and seating areas.

Parks and community facilities are described in more detail in the Parks and
Recreation and Infrastructure, Resources and Conservation Chapters of the
General Plan.
Public and Quasi-Public Facilities
Public and quasi-public facilities provide indoor and
sometimes outdoor space for community gathering and
social interaction, and are the site of day-to-day activities
as well as important community and personal events.
These facilities include City Hall, Sheriff and Fire Stations,
a Metro bus facility, public library, and public and private
schools. Two public schools, owned and operated by the
Los Angeles Unified School District, are located within the
City: West Hollywood Elementary and West Hollywood                 Santa Monica Boulevard is filled with
                                                                   revelers during the annual Halloween
Community Day School. In terms of total area, there are            celebration.
almost 18 acres of publicly owned and operated facilities,
including City parks, and there are approximately 17
additional acres of schools and religious institutions.
Signage
High quality signage contributes to a pedestrian-friendly
urban environment that reflects the values of both the
City’s residents and the business community. The City
encourages quality signage to promote its image as a
creative center. Signage plays an important role in the
City’s overall ambition to be on the cutting edge of
culture in the region, and has both cultural and economic
impacts.
                                                                  Sunset Boulevard is known for its
The most iconic signs in West Hollywood are the                   concentration of creative signage and
                                                                  billboards.
billboards, large screen videos, and tall walls of Sunset
Boulevard. The curving boulevard, varied topography,
and landmark architecture combine to create a legendary urban landscape. Located in a
thriving center of hospitality and entertainment, the advertising on the Strip continues to
evolve with changes in media, culture and technology. Because of the prestige and exposure
of these billboards, they also have the capacity to provide public benefits through development
agreements, and to make high-quality new development possible. At the same time, billboards,
tall walls, and other large off-site signage can have impacts such as light, glare, and motion that
must be carefully controlled.
West Hollywood is also home to exciting and imaginative on-site signs. The City is famous for
its innovative hospitality, design and retail businesses that often communicate their individuality
through unique high quality signage. The City encourages the creation of this special signage
through its Creative Sign Ordinance, which gives additional flexibility and incentives for more
imaginative signage that makes a positive contribution to the cityscape.

Land Use and Urban Form 3-13

GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Land use designations indicate the intended use of each parcel of land. Land use
designations are policy statements with the force of a regulation. They are developed to
provide both a vision of the organization of uses in the City and a flexible structure to allow
for changes in economic conditions and community visions. The land use designation map is
shown in Figure 3-4 and a table of the acres of each land use designation are presented in
Table 3-2.
In West Hollywood, the land use designations and locations are compatible with the zoning
districts found in the Zoning Ordinance. For each land use designation, the uses allowed
and the standards of dwelling unit density for residential designations (as measured in
dwelling units per acre) and building intensity for commercial designations (as measured
in Floor Area Ratio, or FAR) are specified. While the General Plan land use designations are
broad, the zoning districts include specific allowances and prohibitions of uses, dimensional
requirements such as building setbacks, parking standards, and more refined heights
compared to the General Plan.
The land use designations are divided into three broad categories – residential, commercial
and public. The designations are intended to protect residential areas from incompatible
development while also allowing for the maintenance and replacement of the aging housing
stock. The commercial designations are generally located along the City’s corridors and
are designed to allow for the existing lower-scale development to evolve into more transit-
supportive commercial and mixed-use development. The public designations allow for a wide
range of public facilities including parks, schools, City Hall and other public uses.
The following is a summary of the proposed General Plan Designations. The maximum base
allowable densities, intensities and heights are presented in Table 3-2. New development
beyond the base height or density must provide tangible benefits for the community, and
may be allowed subject to any applicable bonuses described in the Zoning Ordinance.
Development standards described in the General Plan are to be considered in conjunction
with the Zoning Ordinance, Zoning Map and applicable State laws.
Residential
Single-Family and Two-Family
Residential (R1)
This designation provides for the retention,
maintenance, and development of existing single-family
residential neighborhoods. This designation identifies
areas of the City characterized by single-family homes
on smaller parcels, together with other low density
residential development in specific neighborhoods. The
intention of the designation is to preserve and maintain         Many of West Hollywood’s neighborhoods
                                                                 were first developed in the 1920s.

the single family residential character and to ensure that new development is
compatible with existing character. There are three sub-categories within the Single-
Family and Two-Family designation: R1A, R1B, and R1C (see Table 3-2).
  •	 R1A allows 1 dwelling unit per lot and has a maximum height of 25 feet and 2 stories.
  •	 R1B allows for
      •	 2 units per lot of less than 8,499 square feet
      •	 3 units per lot between 8,500 and 11,999 square feet

         excess of 11,999 square feet
  •	 R1C allows for 1 dwelling unit per lot and has a maximum height of 15 feet and 1
     story.
Low Density Residential (R2)
This designation provides for the retention, maintenance,
and development of the existing neighborhoods that
contain a mix of single-family, duplex and small scale
(one and two-story) multi-family residential buildings. The
designation ensures that new development complements
the scale of existing structures and the existing pattern of
development. All buildings in the Low Density designation
have a maximum height of 25 feet and 2 stories (see
Table 3-2). The number of units that may be built on each
                                                                     Small-scale multi-family buildings

  •	 2 dwelling units per lot for lots of less than 4,000
     square feet
  •	 3 dwelling units per lot for lots between 4,000 and 7,999 square feet
  •	 4 dwelling units per lot for lots between 8,000 and 9,999 square feet
  •	 1 additional dwelling unit for each 2,000 square feet in excess of 9,999 square
     feet of lot area.
Medium Density Residential (R3)
This designation provides for the retention,
maintenance, and continued development of multi-
family units in areas which are characterized by a
significant mix of two- and three-story buildings,
including apartments and condominiums. There are
four sub-categories of Medium Density Residential
Designations: R3A, R3B, R3C and R3C-C. The
                                                                     New multifamily residential buildings

This designation provides for the retention, maintenance,
and continued development of a wide range of high-
density multi-family housing, including apartments and
condominiums. The designation allows for a variety
of high density building types that are compatible in
scale and character with existing structures and the
development standards. This designation has three sub-
categories: R4A, R4B and R4B-C. The designation allows

General Plan Overlay Districts
Transit Overlay Zone
The Transit Overlay Zone (TOZ) identifies sites close to major transit nodes for which modifications to
parking requirements, or other development standards may be considered when individual projects
provide specified supplemental Transportation Demand Management programs. The TOZ designation
is intended to encourage mixed-use development in locations with adequate transit service to reduce
the need for auto trips.
Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay Zone
The Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay Zone identifies certain locations where a mix of residential and
commercial uses is encouraged. The Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay zone is intended to focus
residential mixed-use projects in high priority nodes, focused on commercial corridors and including
locations with high transit levels of service and major intersections. New development with a mix
of residential and commercial uses in this overlay zone may receive an additional 0.5 FAR and ten
(10) feet in height. The additional height and FAR may be used in conjunction with any incentives
provided by the Transit Overlay Zone where both are allowed.
Zoning Overlay Districts
The Overlay Districts described below are detailed in the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map, and are
included here for informational purposes.
Parking Overlay District
The Parking (PK) Overlay District is intended to identify sites within residential zoning districts where
nonresidential parking lots and parking structures may be established or maintained. The PK district
may only be applied to a residentially zoned property contiguous to a commercially zoned site.
Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District
The Neighborhood Conservation Overlay (NC) District is used to identify sites and areas within
the City that represent clearly defined neighborhoods with predominantly consistent historic or
architectural character.
Development Agreement
The Development Agreement (DA) overlay zoning district identifies sites and areas within the City
that are subject to the requirements of adopted development agreements. For all development
agreements in effect at the time of adoption of this general plan, the development standards set
forth in the agreement will control until the expiration of the agreement or any extension thereto, at
which time the standards in this plan shall govern, except as to any building as to which a common
law vested right has been acquired.
Emergency Housing Overlay District
The City will adopt an emergency shelter/transitional housing overlay district in accordance with State
law, as described in the Housing Element.

Footnotes Table 3-2: Land Use Designations
Where multiple possible bonuses are indicated in a particular designation, individual projects may be able
to cumulatively apply each bonus, as described in the Zoning Ordinance. The City may adopt or modify
height or density bonuses in the future to further the goals and policies of this General Plan. As of 2011,
height and density bonuses are as follows, and are further detailed in the Zoning Ordinance:
1.	Green Building (projects that achieve a minimum of 90 points on the West Hollywood Green Building
   Point System Table may select from incentives including an additional 0.1 FAR for commercial or mixed-
   use)
2. Affordable Housing (up to 35% per State Law on top of base project FAR or density, or in the R3, R4,
   CN1, CC1, CC2, CA, and CR designations a density bonus equal to the percentage of units permanently
   dedicated to low and moderate income persons if these total at least 50% of all project units and the
   structure is maintained and operated for a not-for-profit organization)
3. Avenues (an increase of up to 10 feet in height and .5 FAR for projects in the Commercial
   Neighborhood 2 designation that enhance the arts, fashion and design focus of this district. An increase
   of up to 20 feet in height and .75 FAR may be allowed for projects in the Commercial Neighborhood
   2 designation on the north side of Melrose Avenue between Robertson and San Vicente Boulevards,
   immediately adjacent to the West Hollywood Park Library and Parking Garage)
4. Gateway Mixed-Use (an increase of up to 15 feet in height and .5 FAR for Residential Mixed-Use
   projects in the Commercial Community 2 designation located on the parcels bounded by Santa Monica
   Boulevard, Almont Drive, and Melrose Avenue that provide exemplary architectural design elements;
   maintain at least 20% of the total site area as open space, of which 40% must be maintained as
   pedestrian open space or pedestrian walk-throughs open to the sky; and provide for a double row of
   street trees along Santa Monica Boulevard. Portions of the site exceeding 55 feet in height must be
   within 250 feet of the centerline of Santa Monica Boulevard.
5. Mixed-Use Incentive Overlay Zone (an additional 0.5 FAR and ten [10] feet in height for residential
   mixed-use projects that are located in certain areas of the City including major transit nodes. This
   Overlay Zone applies only to certain parcels within the designations of CC1, CC2, CA and CR. Specific
   parcels where the overlay applies may be found in Figure 3-4: General Plan Designations.)

GOALS AND POLICIES
This section of the General Plan contains goals and policies for land use and urban form.
Given the importance of this chapter, these goals and policies are organized according to
sub-topics that reflect the values and unique characteristics of West Hollywood. The sub-
topics of the goals and the information discussed in each are presented below:
     •	 Urban Form and Pattern. This section includes goals on the overall urban form
          and structure of the City including policies related to the overall land use pattern
          and mix of uses.
     •	 Urban Design. Topics covered in this section include creating an urban environment
          to support the pedestrian network and high quality design and architecture.
     •	 Public Spaces and Streetscape. This section includes goals and policies on
          landscaping, street trees, and the pedestrian network.
     •	 Residential Neighborhoods. This section includes goals and policies to preserve
          and enhance existing single and multi-family neighborhoods.
     •	 Commercial Areas. Goals and policies for each of the five commercial sub-areas are
          presented in this section.
Urban Form and Pattern
Goal LU-1: Maintain an urban form and land use pattern that
enhances quality of life and meets the community’s vision for its
future.
Intent: To provide housing, employment, retail and services, recreation, culture and
arts, education, and entertainment for the City’s residents and businesses in an urban
environment that promotes health, safety, prosperity, and well-being and improves
the quality of life for the community.
LU-1.1	       Maintain a balanced land use pattern and buildings to support a broad range of
          housing choices, retail businesses, employment opportunities, cultural institutions,
          entertainment venues, educational institutions, and other supportive urban uses
          within the City.
LU-1.2	 Consider the scale of new development within its urban context to avoid abrupt
          changes in scale and massing.
LU-1.3	       Encourage new development to enhance the pedestrian experience.
LU-1.4	       Continue to maintain regulations that encourage preservation of existing
          housing and development of new housing that accommodates households that are
          diverse in size, type and income.
LU-1.5	 Encourage the retention and success of existing, and the incubation of new,
          commercial establishments that serve the needs of residents.
                                                             Land Use and Urban Form 3-25

LU-1.6	      As practical, encourage the retention of existing buildings for new uses by
         allowing for reductions or alternatives to the City’s parking standards.
LU-1.7	 Where appropriate, allow for the reconstruction or replacement of nonconforming
         commercial buildings with an equivalent FAR and number of parking spaces to what
         was previously developed on the same parcel even if that FAR is greater than the
         maximum permitted density.
LU-1.8	      Promote the establishment, retention, and expansion of businesses that provide
         employment for West Hollywood’s residents and the surrounding region.
LU-1.9	 Allow City management of land use designations through the use of overlay
         districts.
LU-1.10	Encourage new non-residential land uses that contribute to a strong and diversified
         local economy.
LU-1.11	     Prohibit new land uses that harm the physical health and well-being of the
         community.
LU-1.12	Prohibit new industrial and heavy manufacturing uses within the City.
LU-1.13	     Seek to reduce the demand for motorized transportation by supporting land use
         patterns that prioritize pedestrian, bicycle, and transit mobility options, and mixed
         use development.
LU-1.14	     Support the continuation of existing and new uses that enhance the social and
         health needs of residents.
LU-1.15 Prohibit new drive-through commercial land uses.
LU-1.16	     Encourage the continuation and expansion of farmers’ markets in West
         Hollywood.
LU-1.17	     Encourage public and private schools serving West Hollywood residents to
         develop edible gardens.
LU-1.18	     As financially feasible, seek opportunities to increase the network of community
         gardens throughout the City.
LU-1.19 Update the City’s CEQA thresholds of significance to ensure conformance with the
         vision identified in this General Plan.
LU-1.20 Allow for the collection of development fees from new development that accurately
         reflect the cost and impacts to the City’s infrastructure and public facilities.
LU-1.21	Provide for the expansion and recruitment of commercial uses that provide
         economic and fiscal benefits for the City, including entertainment businesses, music
         and entertainment venues, bars and night clubs, hotels and hospitality, and design
         and creative arts.
3-26 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Goal LU-2: Maintain a balanced mix and distribution of land uses
that encourage strategic development opportunities and mobility
choices within the City.
Intent: To encourage specific types of new development in key areas of West
Hollywood to help diversify the economy, support a high level of social services,
achieve climate change reduction goals, promote transit, walking, and biking as
viable transportation modes, and help improve the physical health of residents.
LU-2.1	      Direct the majority of new development to the City’s commercial corridors served
         by high levels of existing or future public transit, with an emphasis on developing
         transit-supportive land use mixes and intensities near high frequency transit stops
         such as Santa Monica Boulevard near Fairfax Avenue, La Brea Avenue, and San
         Vicente Boulevard.
LU-2.2	 Consider the scale and character of existing neighborhoods and whether new
         development improves and enchances the neighborhood when approving new infill
         development.
LU-2.3	      Allow residential mixed-use development in commercial corridors, including as
         described in adopted specific plans, except in the Commercial Neighborhood 2 land
         use designation and in the parcels on and near Santa Monica Boulevard shown in
         Figure 3-5.
LU-2.4	      Implement a Transit Overlay Zone that allows for modifications to the
         development standards to encourage mixed-use development near major
         transit nodes. Transit Overlay Zones are indicated on the General Plan Land
         Use Designations map and are generally located along commercial boulevards
         and adjacent multi-family zoned parcels within 1/3 mile of major bus transfer
         points. Individual development projects in a Transit Overlay Zone may be allowed
         modifications to development standards, excluding height and density, for providing
         certain amenities in addition to any Transportation Demand Management measures
         required by the Mobility Chapter of the General Plan or by the Municipal Code,
         including one or more of the following:
              i. Contribution to City transit programs;
              ii. Pedestrian improvements as appropriate;
              iii. On-site shuttle program for seniors and persons with disabilities, group trips,
                    subway shuttle, or other purposes;
              iv. Accommodating bus stops or taxi stands on-site;
              v. Bicycle facilities including storage, maintenance, showers, and related services;
                    and/or
              vi. Other improvements that meet the intent of this policy.
LU-2.5	      Allow increases to permitted density/intensity and height for projects that
         provide affordable housing.
                                                              Land Use and Urban Form 3-27

         average unit size and minimum density requirements.
LU-9.5	 Where appropriate, allow for the reconstruction or replacement of nonconforming
         residential buildings with an equivalent number of units and parking spaces to what
         was previously developed on the same parcel even if that number of units is greater
         than the maximum permitted density.

that are well maintained and landscaped, and include a diverse
range of house sizes and architectural styles.
Intent: To encourage single-family homes to engage the street and integrate with
the neighborhood.
The policies in LU-10 apply to the R1 and R2 areas identified in Figure 3-1.
LU-10.1	 Consider the building scale, form, and setbacks within the block when approving
          new single-family dwellings and additions to existing housing.
LU-10.2	 Design new carports and garages to be subordinate in scale to the primary
          dwelling, to minimize views from the street, and to not occupy the majority of the
          street frontage of buildings.
LU-10.3	 Continue to allow secondary units as regulated by the Zoning Ordinance.
LU-10.4	 Encourage new homes to be individually designed to integrate with the
          neighborhood.

          neighborhood.
LU-10.7	 Where appropriate, allow for the reconstruction or replacement of nonconforming
          residential buildings with an equivalent number of units and parking spaces to
          what was previously developed on the same parcel as long as the number of units
          is within the maximum permitted density.

04 HISTORIC PRESERVATION
Historic preservation is an important component of West Hollywood’s urban landscape
and culture. This chapter addresses the goals and policies of the City of West Hollywood in
preserving and protecting its historic resources.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
Although not required by the California Government Code, the City of West Hollywood has
chosen to include a Historic Preservation element in its General Plan. This topic is included
because the City values and seeks to recognize its built environment, its history, and its
culture. West Hollywood has been an important site both for the generation of culture
and innovation in entertainment and the arts, and for leadership in political and social
movements.
CONTEXT
Overview of Historic Preservation
In the United States, the concept of preserving a community’s past emerged during the
decades preceding the Civil War, concentrating on Colonial buildings and other structures
connected with important figures in American history. Public concern over the possible loss
of important parts of the nation’s heritage prompted Congress to adopt the Antiquities Act
of 1906, offering protection to prehistoric and historic sites located on Federal properties. A
policy of preserving cultural resources of national significance for public use and inspiration
was established by the Historic Sites Act of 1935, which established the National Historic
Landmark Program. The legislation empowered the Secretary of the Interior, acting through
the National Park Service, to use the Historic American Building Survey to document,
evaluate, and preserve archaeological and historic sites.
Historic preservation efforts in California began in the nineteenth century with the formation
of the Association for the Preservation of Missions in 1889 and the founding of the
Landmarks Club in 1895. Preservation in the Los Angeles region was rooted in early battles
to save landmarks such as Irving Gill’s Dodge house, once located on King’s Road in West
Hollywood, in 1965, and the founding of the Los Angeles Conservancy in 1978 in response
to the threatened demolition of the Downtown Central Library. An important event in the
history of historic preservation in West Hollywood was the failure of the County of Los
Angeles to save the oldest house in the City, the Eugenio Plummer house on its original site
in Plummer Park. In 1983, a year before West Hollywood’s incorporation as a city, the house,
badly damaged from neglect and fire, was moved to the grounds of the Leonis Adobe
Museum in Calabasas.

There are many benefits of historic preservation to West Hollywood, in addition to the
more traditional goals of preserving buildings for architectural or cultural reasons. With the
tourism, interior design, and film industries playing important roles in the economy, West
Hollywood’s cultural resources create an inviting and attractive built environment for the
business community. Familiar landmarks also establish a sense of permanence and well-
being for residents. Preservation begins with cultural resources and the effect they have on
our lives. History comes alive through the built environment, which is a tangible reminder
of the past. The history of buildings and cultural resources in West Hollywood provide its
diverse population with a common history. Knowledge of the community’s past helps in
understanding emerging patterns and future expectations. In a fully built community such
as West Hollywood, preservation planning is a key approach to reviving or maintaining the
viability of the City. A greater knowledge of the community’s cultural resources provides a
stronger base for better planning and more informed decision-making.
Historic preservation projects increase community pride. Such projects are an important
component in ensuring community cohesiveness, which in turn improves the quality of life
for West Hollywood residents. Cultural resources, with their charm and character, make
West Hollywood an appealing place to live and work. Many of the major landmarks that
distinguish West Hollywood from surrounding communities are cultural resources.
The adaptive reuse of historic buildings often provides environmental benefits through
conservation and reuse of existing resources. Reuse of existing buildings is often far less
material- and energy-intensive than demolition and new construction. One of the main
environmental benefits of reusing buildings is the retention of the original building’s
“embodied energy.” New buildings require new concrete, wood, and steel to be produced
and transported to the site. By reusing buildings, their embodied energy is retained, making
the project much more environmentally sustainable than entirely new construction.
Throughout the country, rehabilitated historic buildings and districts have become focal
points for economic development. Other economic benefits include the prestige that
recognition and restoration of historic buildings bring and the attendant interest for tourists
and business patrons. Recycling older structures can sometimes be more cost effective than
demolishing them and replacing them with new buildings. Because historic buildings can
be exempted from some code requirements (under the State historical Building Code), the
reuse, rehabilitation, and restoration of existing buildings can sometimes be cheaper and
the value per square foot greater.
                                                                     Historic Preservation 4-3

Cultural Resource Designation
Cultural resource designation is a good way of elevating specific resources that deserve
recognition. Designations can be made through federal, state, and local cultural resource
programs. As is the case in West Hollywood, resources are often designated under more than
one cultural resource program.
National Register of Historic Places
The National Register of Historic Places is an authoritative guide used by federal, state, and
local governments, private groups, and citizens to identify the nation’s cultural resources
and to indicate which properties should be considered for protection from destruction or
impairment. Buildings, districts, objects, structures, and sites may be placed in the National
Register. To be eligible for listing in the National Register, a property must generally be over
50 years old and meet a number of specific criteria.
Listing in the National Register is primarily honorary and does not—in and of itself—provide
protection of a cultural resource. While state and local laws provide protection, National
Register properties are eligible to use certain financial incentives including the Federal
Rehabilitation Tax Credit and conservation easements. In West Hollywood, there are 17
buildings and one historic district listed in the National Register.
California Register of Historical Resources
The State Historical Resources Commission designed this program for use by state and local
agencies, private groups and citizens to identify, evaluate, register and protect the state’s
significant historical and archeological resources.
The California Register program encourages public recognition and protection of
architectural, historical, archeological and culturally significant resources. Additionally, the
program identifies historical resources for state and local planning purposes, determines
eligibility for state historic preservation grant funding and affords certain protections under
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
West Hollywood Cultural Preservation Ordinance
The City of West Hollywood’s Cultural Preservation Ordinance provides a high level of
protection to designated cultural resources. Districts, as well as groupings of structures
related by common characteristics or uses, may be designated under the Ordinance. Under
the City Ordinance a property may be designated a cultural resource if it meets one of
the designation criteria including distinctive architectural character, reflecting important
geographic patterns, or association with significant persons or events.
As of 2010, 77 buildings have been individually designated as West Hollywood Cultural
Resources and there are six historic districts and groups.

Referencing Information on the History
of West Hollywood
Although West Hollywood has a rich and colorful history, there is limited information
available on the City’s past. There is no exhaustive and complete published history of the
City and no single place to conduct historic research. The sources of information that do
exist are usually found in one of many histories of Hollywood or in architectural histories of
Los Angeles. Historically, the West Hollywood Branch Library, operated by the County of Los
Angeles, did not have a significant collection of information or documents on the history
of West Hollywood, but with the establishment of the West Hollywood Room in the new
and larger library building (scheduled for completion in 2011) more resources may become
available.
Existing Historic Districts in
West Hollywood
West Hollywood has a number of historic districts, most of which were designated in the
1990s. These districts include clusters of buildings from the first part of the twentieth
century, with modern, craftsman, and Spanish influences, among others.
Harper Avenue National Register District
(designated in 1992)
This District contains excellent examples of the 1920s and 1930s styles of period revivals,
many built around courtyards. These elegant apartment houses catered to the growing
movie industry and were home to many Hollywood stars. These buildings were also among
the first designed to accommodate automobiles. Several of the structures were designed
by the architect/design team of Arthur and Nina Zwebell, whose innovations helped set the
precedent for courtyard design in Southern California.
Courtyard Historic District (designated in 1992)
Courtyard housing is an important multi-family dwelling type both in Southern California
generally and in West Hollywood in particular. It responds to the region’s mild climate by
extending interior spaces into the outdoors and integrates the desire for individual housing
and a yard with the practical need for higher density development. Historically, the courtyard
building derived from Spanish architecture, but it is also expressed in many different
revival styles. Fireplaces, benches, water elements, and landscaping, as well as distinctive
craftsmanship such as tile work, iron grilles, and carved wood, give courtyard spaces a
unique character. The higher density of the buildings in this district reflects the increasing
demand for housing that accompanied the rapid growth of the Los Angeles region in the
1920s. The district’s location between Hollywood and Beverly Hills and its adjacency to
the developing Sunset Strip made it a highly attractive area for such luxurious residential
development.
                                                                     Historic Preservation 4-5

Plummer Park Apartment Grouping (designated in 1991)
In 1929, several parcels of land were purchased from Eugenio R. Plummer on the western
border of what is now Plummer Park. These brick buildings share a common architectural
vocabulary, inspired by the Andalusian region of Spain. Character-defining features include:
stucco, wood balconies and shutters, red clay tile roofs, arches, casement windows,
abbreviated towers, and three-bay facades.
Craftsman District (designated in 1993)
The Craftsman bungalow was one of the most prominent residential styles in Southern
California. In the early 1910’s, the Craftsman bungalow replaced the hip-roofed cottage as
the housing type of preference in West Hollywood. The Craftsman district comprises the
largest concentration of this building type in West Hollywood. Built on the gently sloping
foothills between Beverly Hills and Hollywood, these homes fused nature (by incorporating
porches, large windows, garden spaces) and modernity (driveways and garages for
automobiles).
Lingenbrink Commercial Grouping (designated in 1995)
A rare example of commercial buildings by early Modern architect Rudolph Schindler for
William Lingenbrick, this complex juxtaposes works by Schindler ten years apart.
Old Sherman District
The Old Sherman District contains some of the original residences of West Hollywood, then
known as Sherman. Built between 1899 and 1907, these dwellings were homes for many
of the workers at the Pacific Electric Railway. The buildings contain common architectural
elements including hipped roofs, narrow wood clapboard sidings, simple endboards, and
window trim, front porches and simple floor plans. Known as the “Plains Cottages,” these
homes pre-date the craftsman-style dwellings, which were built after 1910. They reflect
the housing styles familiar to the Midwestern emigrant workers that settled in Sherman.
The homes in this Old Sherman District are representative of West Hollywood’s birth as a
distinctive city and evoke its modest beginnings.

Mechanisms and Incentives for
Historic Preservation
A number of mechanisms and incentives are available to the City and to property owners
in West Hollywood. These include surveys, tax credits, and other funding mechanisms, as
described below.
Historical Context Statements
An historical context statement is “a body of information about cultural resources organized
by theme, place and time.” The historic context statements developed by surveys conducted
in 1986 and 2008, along with the 1998 Historic Preservation Element of the General Plan,
helped significantly to fill in missing historical gaps. Likewise, the information gleaned from
these surveys will assist in the future evaluation of cultural resources.
Cultural Resource Surveys
Cultural resources surveys are the most common method of identifying, quantifying, and
evaluating the relative significance of cultural resources. The City of West Hollywood
received a grant from the California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) in 1985 to conduct
an historic resources survey. The survey was completed in 1986 and documented 118
potential resources. In a City of only 1.9 square miles, it might be assumed that all cultural
resources have been recognized. However, as more research is conducted and as time passes,
additional historic resources come to light. For example, some post-World War II buildings
have been designated as cultural resources. Properties associated with gay and lesbian history
or more recent architectural movements may also become eligible for listing as cultural
resources. The 2008 update of the Historic Resources Survey examined all properties in the
R2, R3, and R4 zones built prior to 1961. A total of 61 additional properties were determined
to be eligible cultural resources.
The primary mechanism for the protection of cultural resources from demolition,
inappropriate alteration, and neglect is through cultural resources designation programs.
While listing in the National Register and California Register may dissuade demolition and
inappropriate alterations, such listings also trigger environmental review through Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the California Environmental Quality Act.
Designation under the West Hollywood Cultural Heritage Preservation Ordinance offers the
strongest protection. Buildings may only be demolished if their preservation will result in
economic hardship for the owner. Alterations to these cultural resources are reviewed by the
Historic Preservation Commission.
Educating the public is the key to creating a lifelong appreciation for cultural heritage and
expanding the base of support for historic preservation activities. With its many layers of
history the cultural landscape of West Hollywood is complex. Recognizing this landscape and
how it has evolved is essential in interpreting the City’s history for the public. There are many
creative ways to build public awareness of the City’s history and cultural resources through
education, public art, websites and community awareness programs.
                                                                        Historic Preservation 4-7

Use of the State Historical Building Code (SHBC) in conjunction with prevailing codes can
provide flexibility to owners of historic structures in meeting code requirements. A major
problem that historic property owners face when making improvements to mechanical or
structural systems, for example, is compliance with prevailing building codes. The SHBC
provides alternative mechanical, plumbing, and electrical requirements for qualified historical
buildings.
Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credits
The historic rehabilitation tax credit is the nation’s largest federal incentive promoting urban
and rural revitalization through private investment in reusing historic buildings. The credit
allows the owner of a certified historic structure to receive a federal income tax credit equal
to 20% of the amount spent on qualified rehabilitation costs. Since it was enacted in 1976,
the credit has been widely used as an effective tool for transforming vacant and underutilized
buildings into safe, decent, and – in many cases – affordable places to live and do business.
Mills Act
West Hollywood is currently one of the local communities in California using the Mills Act to
its full advantage. The Mills Act is a state law allowing cities to enter into contracts with the
owners of historic structures. Such contracts require a reduction of property taxes in exchange
for the continued preservation of the property. Property taxes are recalculated using a formula
in the Mills Act and Revenue and Taxation Code. Each Mills Act property has a plan by which
the property tax savings are reinvested back into the property through appropriate preservation
and maintenance, which is often more expensive than conventional maintenance.
Mills Act properties must be privately owned, not exempt from taxation, and: (a) listed in the
National Register of Historic Places; (b) located in a National Register historic districts; or (c)
listed in any state, city, or county official register of historical or architecturally significant sites,
places, or landmarks. As of 2010, the City of West Hollywood has approved a total of 83 Mills
Act contracts.
Other Incentives
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) is permitted under the Cultural Heritage Preservation
Ordinance but has yet to be used. The ordinance allows owners to sell unused density from
designated Cultural Resources for use in the development of another parcel. TDRs are widely
used in many cities. However, this program may not be as beneficial in a city the size and scale
of West Hollywood. Many of the historic buildings do not have any development rights to sell
because they are larger than would be currently allowed by zoning regulations.
Permitting changes of use, granting variances, and relaxing other codes have been used
effectively as rehabilitation incentives in West Hollywood. Some cities have created loan and
grant programs to assist the owners of historic buildings. Grant programs usually require a
matching contribution by the property owner and loan programs feature low interest rates or
offer disappearing loans (effectively becoming grants); A percentage of the transient occupancy
tax and a cultural resources bond initiative are two of several ways such programs are funded.

05 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
This chapter describes the existing conditions, key issues and long-term strategies related
to economic development in West Hollywood. This chapter addresses both the economic
and fiscal health of the City. The economy of West Hollywood is diverse, and is centered on
the tourism and nightlife, arts and design, and entertainment media industries, as well as
general retail and services.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
The State of California does not require that a city’s general plan address economic
development. This topic is addressed by the City because it reflects West Hollywood’s
commitment to promote a diverse economy and maintain fiscal stability for the benefit of
the community. Economic prosperity and fiscal stability are keys to providing a high quality
of life.
CONTEXT
Since its incorporation in 1984, the City has evolved into a vibrant cultural and civic center.
Its vibrancy and cultural diversity is reflected in its populations of young professionals,
families, seniors, Russian immigrants and LGBT individuals. West Hollywood has a long
history of entrepreneurship, innovation, and progressive governance. Today it is one of the
most desirable locations in the Los Angeles region. This chapter will address how to manage
the challenges and opportunities facing the community over the next 25 years. But before
establishing a future direction, it is important to examine the City’s current economic and
development environment.
West Hollywood’s commitment to maintaining its retail diversity, civic viability and cultural
identity, coupled with its unprecedented commercial success over the last decade, has
raised specific economic concerns. These concerns include maintaining neighborhood-
serving businesses; enhancing major industries such as entertainment, tourism, fashion,
and arts and design; and in general enhancing economic competiveness. In response, the
City has developed a broad economic development strategy that will allow the community
to respond to changing economic conditions while striving to maintain fiscal and economic
stability.
West Hollywood businesses can be categorized into major categories: tourism and nightlife,
arts and design, entertainment media, neighborhood-serving, or independently owned
businesses. The following section will describe each of these business groups and identify
potential issues and opportunities within each.
5-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Tourism and Nightlife
Tourism is a main driver of the local economy and a vital component of West Hollywood’s
fiscal health. From the high-end retail on Robertson Boulevard and Melrose Avenue to
the nightclubs and restaurants on the Sunset Strip, there are many attractive destinations
for visitors. In addition, West Hollywood’s historic role at the forefront of the gay rights
movement offers a culturally significant and historic experience centered in the Santa Monica
West district.
West Hollywood has long had a reputation as one of the most popular nightlife destinations
in the Los Angeles region. The sales per establishment of West Hollywood nightlife venues
are 50 percent higher than the average for all venues in California. In addition, many of the
nightlife destinations are located along Sunset Boulevard creating synergy with nearby hotels
and restaurants. West Hollywood nightlife destinations face competition from other cities for
clubs and nightlife destinations. Despite the competition the nightlife sector of the economy
is still performing well. Looking forward, the City’s nightlife should continue to evolve to
meet the needs of an evolving demographic.
Arts and Design
West Hollywood, anchored by the Pacific Design Center and The Avenues - Arts, Fashion and
Design District, is the hub of the design industry in Southern California. Almost 70 percent of
the design businesses in the City are focused in the Arts, Fashion and Design District with the
remaining 30 percent located in commercial districts throughout the City. With the addition
of fine dining, art galleries and luxury retail, the neighborhood has become one of the most
vibrant and desirable in the region. Despite the fear that high-end retail would push out the
smaller, locally-owned businesses, they are actually boosted by additional luxury retail. The
area continues to function as an incubator for new designers and small businesses. This
symbiotic relationship should be nurtured and monitored to ensure the continuing success
of this industry.
West Hollywood is known for its furniture and design  The City’s unique hotels attract national and international
showrooms.                                            visitors.
                                                                       Economic Development 5-3

Entertainment and Media
West Hollywood sits at the center of region known worldwide as “the entertainment
capital of the world.” The entertainment and media industry is an important part of West
Hollywood’s identity as well as its economy. Innovative companies are drawn to West
Hollywood’s creative workforce as well as its high quality of life. However, the City’s proximity
to other cities with significant concentrations of entertainment and media companies also
means that the City will need to monitor the trajectory of this industry to ensure it remains a
competitive hub.
Neighborhood-Serving
While West Hollywood is known for its high-end and boutique retail offerings, access to
neighborhood-serving businesses is a key component of the high quality of life in the City.
These types of businesses include both retailers selling tangible goods, such as grocery stores,
drug stores and hardware stores, and businesses offering services, such as hair salons, shoe
repair, dry cleaning and auto repair shops. The number of small neighborhood-serving stores
had declined over the last ten years, due mainly to increased competition and not retail
gentrification, as many local residents feared. As more neighborhood-serving retail stores
flock to West Hollywood, those that are unable to compete go out of business. Although
the number of neighborhood-serving services in West Hollywood fell from 1997 to 2006,
those that remain are performing better than ever, with higher sales growth than their large
counterparts. Declining sales of tangential retail goods suggest that a decline in overall
revenues may play a role in the loss of service businesses.
The Sunset Strip is a vibrant destination for nightlife and The East Side of West Hollywood contains many
entertainment.                                              neighborhood-serving Russian businesses.
5-4 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Independently-Owned Businesses
The City strives to include a broad range of independently-owned businesses that cater to a
variety of needs, whether high-end boutique or neighborhood serving. These businesses are
generally able to cater to the specific needs of their customer-base. For instance, the City has
businesses that cater to the LGBT community and others that cater to the Russian-speaking
community, providing products and services of particular interest to these types of customers
whose interests or needs are unique. Independently-owned businesses also offer many of
the boutique and luxe experiences that customers seek. As the City’s economy evolves, it
will be important to ensure that these types of businesses continue to have a place in West
Hollywood.
Goals and policies designed to enhance the economic development climate for key and
emerging industries are discussed below.
                                                                Economic Development 5-5

06 MOBILITY
Throughout the General Plan public process, community members cited traffic congestion
and a lack of parking as among their greatest concerns, and indeed, levels of traffic
congestion in and around West Hollywood are high. While some congestion results from
auto travel generated by the City’s residents, businesses, and entertainment venues, much
of it comes from pass-through traffic by non-residents. These sources of pass-through traffic
are largely due to outside forces that the City cannot control, such as its central location in
the Los Angeles region and the region’s vibrant and growing economy. In fact, even if no
additional development took place within the City over the next 25 years, continued growth
outside of West Hollywood’s boarders, in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and other parts of Los
Angeles, would continue to put pressure on traffic, parking, and the transportation system in
West Hollywood.
Many conventional approaches to addressing traffic congestion, such as “improving”
intersections through widening, are not feasible and could negatively impact the character
of the City’s streets and sidewalks, which are one of the community’s most important assets
and serve as meeting and gathering places. The City of West Hollywood’s mobility strategy
is to create a balanced and multi-modal transportation system that meets the needs of the
community, and to improve the quality of life within West Hollywood while also serving
as an active participant in regional strategies to address regional transportation issues.
Therefore, this chapter includes strategies for many different components of the multi-modal
transportation system: enhancements to the pedestrian and bicycle network, improvements
to public transit, land use strategies to improve transit use, transportation demand
management, and innovative parking solutions. Together, these strategies are intended to
reduce traffic congestion by discouraging the use of single occupancy vehicles on city streets
while creating a more efficient and healthy transportation system.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
Government Code Section 65302(b) requires a “circulation” element in all general plans,
which is described in the statute as follows:
     A circulation element [will consist] of the general location and extent of existing
     and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals and
     facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.
Additional state requirements inform the content of this circulation element. The recently-
passed SB375 (2009) requires metropolitan regions to adopt land use, housing, and
transportation plans that reduce vehicle miles traveled. Local governments have an important
voice in that process. In addition, AB32 (2006)—as interpreted by SB97 (2007) and the
California Attorney General’s Office—requires local governments to consider the greenhouse
gas emissions impacts of their land use and transportation policies, and to develop a plan
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet pending California Air Resource Board (CARB)
Regional Target Advisory Committee (RTAC) thresholds for GHG emission reductions.
6-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Supporting these concepts, the California Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB 1358) requires
circulation elements as of January 1, 2011, to accommodate the transportation system from
a multi-modal perspective, including public transit, walking and biking, which have been
marginalized in comparison to autos in contemporary American urban planning.
The 2004 Congestion Management Program for Los Angeles County (CMP) was developed
to meet the requirements of Section 65089 of the California Government Code. The CMP
requires that, when an environmental impact report is prepared for a project, traffic and
transit impact analyses be conducted for select regional facilities based on the quantity
of project traffic expected to use these facilities. According to CMP guidelines, local
jurisdictions are responsible for “assisting in monitoring the CMP highway and transit system,
implementing a transportation demand management ordinance, implementing a program
to analyze the impacts of local land use decisions on the regional transportation system, and
participating in the Countywide Deficiency Plan.”
WEST HOLLYWOOD’S PHILOSOPHY ON
MOBILITY AND ACCESS
West Hollywood is committed to enhancing mobility and access and improving the quality
of life of its residents, businesses, and visitors. The foundation of West Hollywood’s mobility
and quality of life is its multi-modal transportation network—including its sidewalks and
crosswalks, bikeways, roadways, parking facilities, and public transit routes. Strategically
enhancing and dynamically managing this network is critical to improving the City’s vibrant
commercial areas, its eclectic neighborhoods, and its diverse job and employment uses.
In addition to serving as a means of accessing homes, stores, offices, and entertainment
venues, the multi-modal transportation network is the largest and most abundant public
space in the City and a primary component of the City’s open space network and recreation
system. In fact, public rights-of-way such as streets, alleys and sidewalks make up 26% of
the City’s total land area, far more land area than parks, schools, open spaces, and public
property combined. The City’s streets and sidewalks can be thought of as outdoor “living
rooms” for the community. That is, streets and sidewalks are one of the primary places for
West Hollywood residents and visitors to meet, recreate and enjoy the outdoors.
Since incorporation in 1984, the City has had as a primary stated goal the creation of
a pedestrian community. Specific strategies have included creating pedestrian-friendly
storefronts, limiting ground floor uses to pedestrian-friendly uses, widening sidewalks,
encouraging outdoor dining, and encouraging neighborhood-serving uses.
The quality, comfort, safety, walkability, liveability, and bikeability of the City’s streets,
sidewalks and multi-modal transportation system are of utmost importance to the future of
the City. The City’s goal is to maintain and enhance these characteristics while still addressing
auto traffic and parking issues.
                                                                                       Mobility 6-3

Auto Congestion in West Hollywood
Auto congestion is a significant issue and topic of concern in West Hollywood. The City
is situated in a region where the automobile is dominant even though the City itself is
relatively compact and amenable to alternative modes of transportation. Furthermore, West
Hollywood’s roadway system is often at or near capacity during peak travel periods, and this
will likely continue to be the case in the future, due mostly to trends that are outside of the
City’s direct control.
Congestion in West Hollywood is a reflection of the City’s economic vitality and location
in the region. The City has several major east-west roadways, including Santa Monica
Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard, Fountain Avenue, and Melrose Avenue.
These streets carry a significant volume of traffic through the City to reach points east and
west. In addition, West Hollywood attracts visitors and employees from outside the City
because of its employment, arts and cultural destinations, entertainment venues and its
vibrant commercial corridors. Traffic congestion is often a good indication of a vibrant local
economy. The most severe traffic congestion problems occur during commuting hours, which
brings local and pass-through regional traffic to West Hollywood. Tourism and nightlife also
attract high volumes of traffic to West Hollywood on nights and weekends, times when
streets in many other cities are quiet.
Reliance on single occupancy vehicles also creates a demand for parking. This is especially
true around West Hollywood’s commercial corridors, where tourism, nightlife, and
commercial activity attract local and regional traffic. As a result, traffic and parking intrusion
into the adjacent residential areas is a concern.
Due to the City’s regional context, it is anticipated that auto congestion may continue to
increase because of growth in other places in the Los Angeles region, even if no new growth
occurs within West Hollywood. This is partly because new housing development many
miles from the City will continue to attract more individuals interested in spending time or
seeking employment in West Hollywood, or who simply pass through the City to reach other
destinations.
The single-occupancy passenger vehicle is the default mode of travel in the City and the
region, so encouraging the use of other modes requires a combination of incentives and
management strategies. Making other modes more convenient, affordable, or comfortable
in comparison to driving and parking will increase their viability. Conversely, placing demand
constraints on driving through a variety of disincentives such as demand-responsive parking
pricing, will make walking, biking and transit more attractive. These Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) strategies are a core component of the West Hollywood General Plan.
While creating wider roads is a typical response to traffic congestion that has been practiced
in the United States for the last several generations, such solutions would be infeasible in
West Hollywood due to the built-out nature of the City. Further, while West Hollywood
cannot independently solve the region’s congestion problems, it can actively advocate for
regional, multi-modal transportation solutions. The City can address the amount of its own
6-4 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

auto congestion and parking demand resulting from new and existing activities by enhancing
a multi-modal transportation system and shifting travel patterns away from the automobile
to alternative modes of transportation, including public transit (both regional and local),
walking, and biking.
Managing Parking in West Hollywood
The City of West Hollywood recognizes that parking is crucial to residential quality of life
and commercial vitality in the City. An appropriate quantity of well-managed automobile
parking is necessary for the success of West Hollywood businesses, and for the quality of
life of its car-owning residents. Parking also plays an important role in City efforts to make
West Hollywood even more pedestrian-, bike-, and transit-friendly. The City’s goal is to
price and manage the parking system in such a way that motorists can easily find a parking
space when they need one, while at the same time seeking to reduce congestion, increase
housing affordability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the streetscape and public
realm through urban design, and create “park-once” neighborhoods where drivers can visit
numerous destinations by foot after parking.
Benefits of a Multi-Modal Transportation System
A comprehensive multi-modal transportation system is critical in West Hollywood’s urbanized
environment. In addition to the direct transportation-related benefits, there are many
related co-benefits to a multi-modal transportation system and reduced auto use. These are
discussed below.
Public Health. In recent years, there has been
significant research about the links between
health and mobility. Walkable communities
generally have lower rates of obesity and
heart disease, fewer air quality issues, and
higher levels of physical activity by residents.
Bicycling also brings significant health impacts.
Active transportation options are especially
important for seniors and children, two groups
particularly vulnerable to health complications
related to a sedentary lifestyle.
                                                     Multi-modal transit networks offer a diverse range of
Affordability. Multi-modal transportation            options for local and regional trips.
options help reduce household costs. They
increase the ability to get around without a car, cutting down on fuel costs, and may even
allow households to own fewer cars or no car at all, thereby saving on car payments,
insurance, and registration. In addition, multi-modal transportation makes it feasible to lower
housing costs by unbundling parking from housing. This means that residents pay for parking
separately from what they pay for housing, and housing costs for those who need less
parking (or no parking at all) are discounted by the cost of the parking space(s).
                                                                                           Mobility 6-5

Environment. Less auto use means less air pollution, soil and water pollution, and
greenhouse gas emissions. Today and into the future, autos and trucks will continue to emit
significant amounts of pollutants. These pollutants undermine our air quality, flow into our
storm drains, and coat our streets, buildings, and open spaces. In addition, transportation
is responsible for the greatest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in the City (62% as
of 2008). By getting people out of their cars, West Hollywood can reduce its impacts on the
environment, both locally and globally.
Economic Vitality. There is a connection between a multi-modal transportation system
and the economic vitality of a place. People are attracted to environments that are walkable,
bikeable, and accessible by public transit. For example, creating attractive and pedestrian-
friendly shopping areas draws people to commercial corridors and into the public realm that
might otherwise drive through without stopping. Studies show that commercial districts with
walkable and bikeable streets have higher real estate values and sales than comparable auto-
oriented districts.
Quality of Life. A diversified transportation system increases the quality of life for West
Hollywood residents, businesses, and visitors. It gives users the option to walk, bike, or take
transit, rather than sit in traffic. It leads to a higher quality urban environment where people
can spend time outside and be physically active on streets that aren’t dominated by auto
traffic and parking, including the noise, pollution, and stress that comes with driving.
Public Safety. Getting people out of their cars and driving less means that more people will
be walking and biking. Cyclists and pedestrians mean more eyes on the street which, in turn,
keeps West Hollywood safer from crime.

The 4D’s of a Multi-Modal Transportation
System
Four primary strategies under the influence of West Hollywood will help reduce travel
demand and enhance the multi-modal transportation system by encouraging people to
walk, bike and take transit instead of driving. These are sometimes referred to as the 4D’s of
travel—density, diversity, design, and destinations. The 4D’s encompass both improvements
to the physical form of the transportation network and policies, programs, and services
that sustainably and equitably meet the travel needs of all users and support a multi-modal
transportation system.
Density. Generally, the closer that people are geographically to where they work, live, and/
or shop, the shorter distances they have to travel to meet their daily needs, and the more
origins and destinations that are within walking distance. In densely populated environments,
people are more likely to access their daily needs by walking, for example, because the
distances are accessible to pedestrians. West Hollywood is a relatively compact urban
environment, which means there is a high potential for people to have access to essential
services without reliance on the automobile.
Transit can be a great alternative to auto travel for longer trips when it is accessible and
competitive with the automobile in terms of reliability and convenience. Most pedestrians
are willing to walk up to ¼ mile to a bus stop and up to ½ mile to a rail stop. People are
also more likely to use transit when service is frequent, safe and reliable. While the majority
of West Hollywood residents are located within walking distance of transit, according to the
2000 Census, only about 6% of City residents took transit to work (approximately another
6% walked or biked). Specific programs and policies to improve local and regional transit
service and ease of use to and within the City will help to increase transit use by residents.
Given the increased traffic and congestion pressures that the City of West Hollywood
and the surrounding region will face in the coming years, working to improve local and
regional transit facilities will make transit a more attractive option compared to the private
automobile. In addition, the City is actively encouraging increased development near transit,
thereby ensuring that new residents and businesses are transit-accessible.
Diversity. People need not travel as far and as frequently when they are in proximity to a
diversity of land uses, such as housing within walking and biking distance of jobs, services
and stores—including the essential grocery store, coffee shop, neighborhood eatery,
hardware store, schools, childcare, and other everyday goods and services. West Hollywood’s
commercial areas have a variety of retail, services and employment options a short distance
from the City’s residential neighborhoods. West Hollywood continues to promote a mix of
land uses that meet residents’ daily needs within walking distance.
Design. The design of the street network is critical for facilitating the use of alternative
modes of transportation. Whether the urbanized landscape is oriented toward pedestrians,
is supportive of bicyclists, and provides comfortable access to and waiting areas for transit
significantly influences whether people are willing to get out of their cars. Scale and
                                                                                    Mobility 6-7

aesthetics also matter, as well as noise levels, thermal comfort, perception of safety, and
other factors. People feel most comfortable when streets and buildings are articulated at
a human scale along the public realm, when trees and vegetation provide shade and an
interesting environment, and when vehicles and parking lots are physically separated and
buffered from the pedestrian network.
The West Hollywood community has worked to improve the pedestrian experience by
investing in good urban design along its commercial corridors. West Hollywood continues to
make design improvements throughout the City to facilitate walking, biking, and transit use.
Destinations. Some places are regional magnets, and serve as regional destinations for jobs,
entertainment, tourism, recreation, and/or other activities that draw residents out of their
homes. Residents who live near these destinations generally travel much less than other
residents because the attractions that come from urban living are in their back yards. West
Hollywood is a regional destination for entertainment, nightlife and the design industries,
among others.

CONTEXT
Transportation in West Hollywood encompasses the street network, pedestrians, bicycles,
automobiles, public transit, commercial vehicles and goods movement, and emergency
access. Their conditions are described below.
Street Network
The City’s street network includes approximately 45 miles of roadway within the City’s 1.9
square miles. Streets are classified by the primary function they serve for motorized traffic—
generally either as carriers of regional trips and through traffic (arterials), streets that connect
neighborhoods and districts to the arterials (secondary/collectors), and local streets that are
designed and intended to provide access to individual parcels (local or residential streets).
West Hollywood’s streets also accommodate other users and uses including buses, trucks,
bicycles and pedestrians.
The current roadway functional classification system is presented in Figure 6-1 and is defined
as follows.
  •	 A local street is a roadway that primarily serves the residential neighborhood. These
     include most of the City’s residential streets.
  •	 A secondary/collector street is a roadway that generally carries vehicular traffic to and
     from the residential neighborhood. In West Hollywood these also often carry regional
     and local traffic seeking alternative routes to avoid congestion. These include Robertson
     Boulevard, Romaine Street, Genesee Avenue, Doheny Drive, Melrose Avenue, Fountain
     Avenue, Vista Street, Holloway Drive, parts of La Cienega Boulevard, Crescent Heights
     Boulevard (south of Santa Monica Boulevard) and San Vicente Boulevard (north of Santa
     Monica Boulevard).
  •	 An arterial street is a roadway that primarily serves regional as well as local vehicular
     traffic along commercial corridors. These include Santa Monica Boulevard, Crescent
     Heights Boulevard (between Santa Monica Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard), Sunset
     Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard, La Cienega Boulevard, La Brea Avenue, Fairfax Avenue and
     San Vicente Boulevard (south of Santa Monica Boulevard).
Public Transportation
The City is part of a growing public transit network. This includes regional transit carriers, the
City’s own public transit services, and private services. The primary regional transit carrier is
the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), which provides local
and rapid bus lines throughout the City.
Metro operates 16 local and four rapid transit lines that operate on major streets including
Sunset Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue, La Brea Avenue, San Vicente
Boulevard, Crescent Heights Avenue, and La Cienega Boulevard. Metro operates the Red
Line, a regional subway connector with the nearest location at the Hollywood/Highland
                                                                                      Mobility 6-9

station. West Hollywood continues to work with Metro to
identify and encourage regional rail transit extensions to the
City.
In addition, the City of Los Angeles Department of
Transportation (LADOT) Community DASH also offers
shuttle service to key destinations, such as to and from
Metro rail lines. The City of Los Angeles operates two
community shuttles in the area: the Fairfax DASH operates
a circular route running north-south on Fairfax Avenue,
east-west on Melrose Avenue, north-south on La Cienega
Boulevard to Cedars Sinai Hospital, and east-west on 3rd
Avenue to the Farmer’s Market; and the Hollywood DASH
operates a circular route primarily running east-west on
Hollywood Boulevard and Fountain Avenue between
Highland Avenue and Vermont Avenue. As of 2010, LADOT
                                                                     Improvements made to Santa Monica

West Hollywood’s CityLine shuttle service is the City’s fixed
route transit service providing general public transportation
from the Gateway project on La Brea Avenue to Cedars Sinai
Hospital. It makes stops at destinations throughout the City,
including at parks, social service providers, the Library and
shopping centers. Key public transit services in the City are
illustrated in Figure 6-2.
The City also operates dial-a-ride and taxi-subsidy programs.
These are coordinated with the City of Beverly Hills and

Services, Inc. as part of the coordinated paratransit plan for Los Angeles County.
In addition, “for hire” automobile service (taxicabs, limos, airport shuttles, and charter buses)
is an important transportation option in the City that meets a variety of needs, including
mobility for tourists and visitors, basic mobility for short discretionary trips, and general
transportation for non-drivers. The vast majority of these trips are taken via taxicabs which
provide over 20,000 trips monthly.

6-14 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	
Pedestrian Environment
West Hollywood has many of the important
foundational elements that make it a great
walkable City, which is one of the things
that makes it unique and draws visitors from
throughout the greater Los Angeles area. Its
compact size and diverse mix of uses within
a short distance of each other make many
of the City’s most important and interesting
destinations accessible to pedestrians. The City
has a comprehensive pedestrian network that is
served by approximately 87 miles of sidewalks. A Ample sidewalk widths, street trees, and active
significant proportion of the streets have street       storefronts create a comfortable walking environment
                                                        for pedestrians.
trees and, in commercial areas, wider sidewalks
enhance the pedestrian experience. All residential
neighborhoods are within walking distance of commercial areas. Further, in commercial areas
such as Santa Monica Boulevard and Melrose Avenue, the pedestrian experience is supported
by the presence of active, street-level retail and restaurants, and buildings constructed to or
near the edge of the sidewalk.
At the same time, there are opportunities to improve the City’s pedestrian environment
that will be important to address in the future. These include improved street crossings and
signaling at some intersections, and limiting new curb-cuts or garage frontages on some
sidewalks. The General Plan provides general policies to address some of these issues, while
the West Hollywood Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility Plan (2003) sets forth specific strategies
for increasing pedestrian-oriented design features within the street network.
Bicycles
There are currently 5.4 miles of existing bicycle lanes
and routes within West Hollywood, which represents
approximately 12% of the City’s street network. Dedicated
bike lanes are located along Santa Monica Boulevard
between Almont Drive and Kings Road. Class III bike routes
on San Vicente Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard, Melrose
Avenue, Fairfax Avenue, and Fountain Avenue between
Fairfax Avenue and La Brea Avenue are signed bike routes
                                                                        Dedicated bike lanes make travel by
without dedicated lanes. The City also has an adopted
                                                                        bicycle more competitive with other
ordinance which allows bicycles to operate on sidewalks in              modes of transportation.
areas where there are no bike lanes.
Most bicycle travel in West Hollywood occurs on streets without bikeway designations.
However, the lack of designated bike lanes and an incomplete regional bike network can be
a hindrance to fully exploiting bicycling as a means of commuting, shopping, and recreation
                                                                                          Mobility 6-15

within the City. For this reason, West Hollywood adopted a Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility
Plan (2003) to further develop its own bike network. It identifies an additional 11.3 miles
of bike lanes and routes for implementation, which would represent approximately 37% of
the street network. In 2011, the City convened a Bicycle Task Force of community members
and bicycle experts to recommend improvements to bicycle infrastructure and programs. In
addition, the 2010 Sunset Boulevard Beautification Project included installation of bicycle
detection traffic signals pursuant to state requirements. The City actively collaborates with
regional partners to improve regional connectivity and coverage for bike routes.
Automobiles
The City of West Hollywood is a dense community situated in the midst of a highly urbanized
area. In addition to local residents, drivers from throughout the region are attracted to
West Hollywood’s jobs, entertainment, and shopping amenities. As a result, congestion is
experienced in West Hollywood not just during the traditional morning and evening peak
commute periods, but for extended periods throughout the day and night. Commute trips
account for roughly 20% of West Hollywood’s daily total traffic. During morning commuting
hours, commute trips account for up to 44% of all traffic. Evening automobile trips are
mostly associated with retail, restaurants, and nightlife (West Hollywood Travel Demand
Model, 2010).
The City of West Hollywood adopted traffic impact thresholds of significance that address
the potential impact of development projects on traffic congestion. The General Plan’s
Environmental Impact Report identifies a number of intersections that would be significantly
impacted under projected growth under the General Plan. Future buildout of the General
Plan would create 22 a.m. peak hour impacts and 26 p.m. peak hour impacts. Mitigating
these impacts through conventional roadway widening is not feasible as doing so would
conflict with established City policies and goals. However, the proposed General Plan places a
strong emphasis on multimodal circulation, transit-oriented development, and Transportation
Demand Management (TDM), which are measures intended to provide additional
transportation choices and reduce impacts on local and regional facilities. The strong TDM
program and purposeful clustering of land uses around major corridors and transit nodes
leads to superior performance in nearly all documented metrics and would improve mobility
within the City.
Regional Auto Access
Because West Hollywood’s arterials connect to other regional destinations and the freeway
system, cut-through regional traffic trips, with neither a beginning nor an end in the City,
account for a sizeable portion of vehicle trips in West Hollywood. Daily traffic volumes on the
City’s streets in 2010 are presented in Figure 6-3.
West Hollywood is linked to the Los Angeles Metropolitan Region by a series of key vehicle
corridors. Major east-west vehicle arterials within the City include Santa Monica Boulevard,
Sunset Boulevard, and Fountain Avenue, providing for not only local trips but a significant

provisions for a right-of-way along Santa Monica Boulevard that may ultimately allow for up
to six lanes of traffic east of the West Hollywood border.
The San Diego Freeway (I-405), the major north-south link between the San Fernando
Valley in the north and San Diego in the south, is located approximately five miles west of
West Hollywood and is accessed by Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard. Sunset
Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard also provide access to the Hollywood Freeway
(U.S. 101) about two miles east of West Hollywood. Crescent Heights and Laurel Canyon
Boulevards also connect to the 101 Freeway five miles north of the City. About five miles to
the south of West Hollywood is the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), which is accessed by La
Cienega Boulevard, Fairfax Avenue, and La Brea Boulevard.
Traffic Calming
The City has an existing neighborhood traffic calming program designed to promote livable
neighborhood streets for area residents. Traffic calming is based upon the concept of
passive speed reduction measures that include everything from raising public awareness to
enforcement of speed limits in residential areas and the physical installation of traffic control
devices such as medians and landscaped traffic circles.
Automobile Parking
Automobile parking is a coveted resource in West Hollywood. The City’s commercial corridors
generate demand for parking, and when it is too difficult to find, drivers are tempted to
park in the City’s residential areas. Conversely, many of the residential areas were built when
people did not own as many cars and thus parking in some residential neighborhoods,
especially those areas with many multi-family residential buildings, is in short supply. In
response to the situation, the City has developed a multi-faceted approach to addressing
parking supply and demand for on- and off-street parking in both residential and commercial
areas.
For residential areas, the City has created 11 preferential parking districts to manage parking
supply in residential areas. The timing restrictions vary by district. In all areas, parking is
restricted at night and in some areas parking is also restricted during the day.
                                                                                     Mobility 6-19

In commercial areas, there is a mix of public and private parking. According to a 2010 study
by the City, the total amount of parking in some commercial areas is sufficient for existing
businesses, but it is either not available to the public (because it is in private lots) or the
parking is not convenient for visitors. This creates a situation where the parking supply does
not match the demand patterns, so that visitors may perceive that there is no parking near
their destination while just a few blocks away there could be numerous spaces available. To
address the parking situation and to help balance supply and demand, the City charges for
on-street parking at certain places and at certain times of day. The City also operates a public
valet program to expand parking opportunities in commercial areas of the City. The City’s
Zoning Ordinance addresses off-street parking in commercial and residential areas.
The City also owns and operates several public parking facilities in commercial areas
throughout the City. Future development projects will add an additional 600 parking spaces
for public use.
 Transportation Demand Management
The City of West Hollywood has adopted a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
ordinance. Its purpose is to reduce automobile trips, increase the use of other modes
of transportation, and improve multimodal connections, which will result in less traffic
congestion and improved air quality.
As part of the ordinance, major new development projects are required to develop and
submit a Trip Reduction Plan as part of the development review process in order to receive a
final certificate of occupancy. In addition, the ordinance requires all employers of five or more
employees at a worksite located in the City and in a development of 10,000 or more square
feet of enclosed space to develop and submit a Trip Reduction Plan. Important strategies that
must be addressed in Trip Reduction Plans, which must seek to achieve a vehicle ridership
goal of 1.5 people per vehicle, are as follows:
  1.	Offer parking cash out to employees if the employer subsidizes or provides free parking
     for employees
  2.	Install preferential parking spaces for carpools and bicycles where feasible
  3.	Distribute alternative transportation information to encourage employees to use
     alternative modes of transportation
  4.	Provide incentives that help reduce trips
  5.	Encourage new technologies that support trip reduction
  6.	Participation in groups such as a Transportation Management Organization
6-20 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Enhancements to the existing TDM program are described in the policies of this chapter. TDM
strategies provide incentives to optimize the use of transportation resources. They make the
most efficient use of transportation capacity by emphasizing modes that use the least space
per person: walking, bicycling, and transit and result in lesser environmental impacts. They
often reveal the hidden costs of transportation so travelers can make informed decisions
and reduce their impacts on congestion and the environment. They improve alternative
transportation choices so that residents do not need to use their cars for every trip. And they
rely more on pricing, as opposed to congestion, for allocating street and parking resources.
Commercial Vehicles and Goods Movement
Commercial vehicles generally travel unrestricted throughout the City. The majority of
commercial goods are transported along Santa Monica Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, La Brea
Avenue, Fairfax Avenue, La Cienega Boulevard, San Vicente Boulevard and Doheny Drive.
Alley ways located behind some commercial streets provide access for loading and unloading
of commercial vehicles.
While there are no officially designated truck routes in the City, all east-west and north-
south arterial streets in the City of West Hollywood are implied truck routes. This is because
“heavy vehicle” designated streets in adjacent Beverly Hills (which continue through West
Hollywood) are Santa Monica, La Cienega, and Beverly Boulevards. In addition, all roads
classified as major and secondary in the City of Los Angeles (to the south of West Hollywood)
are truck routes unless specifically restricted by the posting of weight limit signs.
The City does actively manage construction traffic, on the other hand, through the
submission of project specific construction management plans. These are required of
development projects and approved by the City Engineer. The construction management
plans include the movement, staging, and loading/unloading of trucks and construction
materials.

07 HUMAN SERVICES
Providing progressive, high-quality human services for those who need them has been
central to the City’s mission since its incorporation in 1984. This core mission is rooted in
West Hollywood’s diverse populations, which include seniors, the LGBT community, Russian-
speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, people living with HIV and AIDS and
other disabilities, families with children, and people who are homeless. Many of these
residents call West Hollywood home because they find support, acceptance, and others who
share their cultural or social background and interests.
This chapter organizes polices and background information into the following sections:
  •	 Social Services
  •	 Arts and Culture
  •	 Schools and Education
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
State of California law does not require that a city’s general plan address social services, arts
and culture, or schools and education. These topics are addressed in this chapter because
they promote West Hollywood’s health, safety and welfare, and because they reflect the
City’s core mission to support and serve its diverse population. West Hollywood was one of
the first cities in California to incorporate a human services element into its General Plan in
1988.
The City sponsors an annual Senior Health Fair.

SOCIAL SERVICES
This section addresses social services within West Hollywood.
Context
Upon incorporation in 1984, one of West Hollywood’s initial priorities was to provide social
services for residents in need. One year later, the Department of Human Services was formed.
Since its incorporation, the City has taken an innovative, active, and humanistic approach
to identifying community needs and providing human services. The City provides services by
contracting with local non-profit service providers.
Some social services are geared specifically toward the city’s LGBT community. In the 1970s,
West Hollywood, then an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, became a haven
for a newly vocal and out-of-the-closet gay community. Today, most estimates put West
Hollywood’s LGBT community at over 40 percent of the City’s population. Some of the City
services particular to the LGBT community include counseling, legal services, employment
placement, dispute resolution, medical services, and HIV prevention education. Local non-
profit organizations also provide an important social network for LGBT youth, seniors, and
people living with disabilities.
The City works closely with many groups to promote HIV prevention and provide services
for those living with HIV/AIDS. This includes coordinating HIV/AIDS testing and running an
ongoing public education campaign for HIV prevention. Moreover, the City coordinates with
a number of non-profits that provide legal, mental health, financial, dental, medical, and
substance abuse treatment support services for those living with HIV/AIDS.
The City provides many social services for seniors. According to the City of West Hollywood
Community Study (2006), seniors comprise about 21 percent of West Hollywood’s
population. A network of social services helps to provide support so that seniors can
remain independent in their own homes. Home-delivered meals, case management, in-
home supportive services, mental health counseling, and handy worker services are some
of the programs available. The City provides transit services to this population, including a
subsidized taxi coupon and bus pass program, a fixed-route shuttle service, and Dial-a-Ride.
Further, the City provides ongoing outreach to its Russian-speaking community, composed
largely of immigrants from countries of the former Soviet Union. According to the 2000
Census, 18.6 percent of West Hollywood residents reported Russian or Ukrainian ancestry,
with many Russian-speakers concentrated in West Hollywood’s East Side. The City-supported
social services are culturally competent to work with the Russian-speaking residents, and
some programs target this population specifically with citizenship preparation, language
training, and social programming.
The City also provides a number of programs for the community at large, including mental
health and medical services, services for people living with disabilities, legal and financial
                                                                            Human Services 7-3

assistance, food and nutrition programs, outreach and housing services for people who
are homeless, employment services, substance abuse services, assistance to families, and
counseling and recreation services for children and youth. The City also sponsors social-
services-related transportation programs.
Local elementary school students contributed to In Our Global
Village, a book documenting West Hollywood through the eyes of
its youth.

ARTS AND CULTURE
West Hollywood is a community known for arts and culture. It has strong social networks, a
rich sense of community, cross-cultural interaction, and diverse physical spaces for art of all
kinds. The section below provides specific policies and a description of the existing context
for arts and culture in the City.
                                                    Works of art created under the Urban Art program can be
                                                    found citywide.

Context
West Hollywood is a thriving commercial art hub for film, music, art, fashion, design and
architecture. Three areas of the City function as key cultural centers: The Sunset Strip,
which has a long history as one of the nation’s centers of live popular music; The Avenues
Arts Fashion and Design District, the West Coast’s premier concentration of interior design
studios, art galleries, showrooms, specialty shops, and restaurants; and The Pacific Design
Center, the West Coast’s leading resource for furniture and interior design. In addition, the
City is home to several non-profit art and cultural organizations. These include: Celebration
Theatre, which focuses on the LGBT experience; Classical Theatre Lab, a resident company of
actors focusing on the classical theatre repertoire; Greenway Arts Alliance, which focuses on
community-building through arts; MACHA Theatre, which advances women’s culture, history
and art; The Rudolf Schindler House, which holds art and cultural events and exhibitions;
and MOCA PDC, a satellite exhibition space for the internationally known Museum of
Contemporary Art of Los Angeles.
The City itself facilitates arts and culture in many ways. The Arts and Cultural Affairs
Commission encourages broad participation in arts and culture, oversees City-sponsored
arts, and administers an arts grant program. It also oversees the Art on the Outside program,
which brings art out into the public realm to enhance the City’s pedestrian-friendly culture.
The City’s Urban Art Program requires developers of certain projects to contribute one
percent of the development valuation to public art. The City plays host to a number of
community cultural events, including the Russian Cultural Festival, Pride Month activities,
Summer Sounds concerts, Shakespeare in the Park, the Book Fair, and other ad hoc
performances and exhibitions.
Partially because West Hollywood is such an attractive and successful hub for arts and
culture, there is a lack of affordable and usable space for community-based theatre,
exhibitions, and rehearsal space. The City is committed to ongoing efforts to provide space
where possible.
                                                                          Human Services 7-7

SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION
West Hollywood supports high quality schools that are competitive with other schools within
the region. The following section provides specific policies and a discussion of the existing
context for schools and education in the City.
Context
The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) provides public school services to West
Hollywood. Many students attend schools that are outside of the City limits but in close
proximity, and some students from outside of West Hollywood attend schools in the City.
Two public schools are located within City limits: one elementary school and one alternative
high school. LAUSD provides a pre-kindergarten family literacy program and several early
education and daycare programs. There are also a number of private schools in West
Hollywood and the surrounding area.
Because the schools used by West Hollywood are operated by LAUSD, the City does
not control school programming or facilities. However, the City supports educational
programming through regular collaborative meetings, grant making, a youth scholarship
program, afterschool homework clubs, arts programming, school gardens, and support for
school libraries. The City also has opportunities to coordinate with school operators on joint
use of facilities.
Goal and Policies
HS-4: Support and collaborate with LAUSD and other educational
providers.
Intent: To have high-quality schools.
HS-4.1	 Collaborate with the Los Angeles Unified School District to maximize educational
          quality.
HS-4.2	 Work with the Los Angeles Unified School District to provide technical expertise, and
          to provide donated materials from the West Hollywood community such as books,
          equipment, computers and software for student use, as feasible.
HS-4.3	 Seek to continue the West Hollywood Scholarship program to provide opportunities
          for local students to continue their education after high school.
HS-4.4	       As appropriate, support local schools’ efforts at greening of schoolyards, and
          improvements such as xeriscaping, rainwater retention, and fruit/vegetable gardens.

08 PARKS AND RECREATION
Beautiful, accessible, and well-maintained parks, open space and recreation facilities, and
quality recreational programs are essential amenities for an urban city like West Hollywood.
They help create community and make the City more livable and attractive, provide a place
of relaxation and relief from the urban environment, encourage physical activity and health,
provide a forum for gathering and interaction, and reduce urban heat islands. Many urban
areas – including West Hollywood – have both high demand for these amenities and limited
options for providing them. This puts these elements at a premium and reinforces their
importance for the overall success and health of the City.
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
This Parks and Recreation Chapter meets State of California requirements for an Open
Space element of the general plan (California Government Code (CGC) Section 65561 and
65302(e)). The purpose of the required Open Space element is “to assure that cities and
counties recognize that open space land is a limited and valuable resource which must be
conserved whenever possible” (CGC Section 65561(a)).
The State requires that several types of open space be addressed in a general plan. These
are identified as open space for 1) the preservation of natural resources such as habitat, 2)
the managed protection of resources, 3) outdoor recreation, 4) public health and safety, 5)
supporting the missions of military installations, and 6) the protection of certain places or
features (CGC Section 65560). Of these types of open space land, West Hollywood’s open
space is primarily used for outdoor recreation, provided by its park system as well as various
landscape areas, medians, parkways, and memorials.
Over and above the State requirements for an open space element, this chapter also
contains policy guidance about recreation services and facilities in the City.
8-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035

CONTEXT
West Hollywood’s parks and recreation facilities and programs are operated and managed
by the City. In addition, a seven-member Public Facilities Commission, created in 1996,
oversees parks, landscaping, streetscapes, medians, community buildings and facilities.
The Commission makes recommendations to the City Council regarding repair, capital
improvements, and policy priorities for this infrastructure.
City Parks
At the time of incorporation, the City of West Hollywood contained only three parks and
limited other green open space. Since that time, the combination of increasingly high land
prices and a limited amount of vacant land has continued to make park acquisition and
development challenging. Nonetheless, the City found creative ways to add new parks
and public space, including long-term leasing of public pocket park sites as part of private
development projects.
As of 2010, the City contains a total of six parks, including two large community parks, two
neighborhood parks (including a dog area), and two pocket parks. The City also has a variety
of open spaces and community facilities used for recreational purposes. These are shown in
Figure 8-1 and described in Table 8-1.
Plummer Park and West Hollywood Park are the two largest parks in the City. They each
serve as recreational and cultural focal points for the community at large.
As of 2010, Plummer Park (8.5 acres) contains a community center which includes a Teen
Center, Social Services Center for seniors and people living with disabilities (comprehensive
services center), and meeting spaces. The park also contains an auditorium, a playground,
picnic areas, fitness area, tennis and basketball courts, a tennis pro shop, and a preschool.
Seniors, especially from the Russian-speaking community, are some of Plummer Park’s most
active users, often playing chess, walking, and socializing in the Park. The Helen Albert
Certified Farmers’ Market is held at Plummer Park once a week. The Plummer Park Master
Plan, originally adopted in 1994 and updated in 2004, is guiding a major rehabilitation
project at Plummer Park. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2011, and will add over
one acre of additional park space.
Plummer Park offers a playground and the Plummer Park Community Center, among other amenities.

8-6 West Hollywood General Plan 2035
West Hollywood Park (5.3 acres) provides an auditorium, outdoor sports facilities, a
swimming pool, a tiny-tot facility, playground areas, picnic areas, and the West Hollywood
Library. A rehabilitation project is under construction as of 2010 and includes a new library,
active open space, three lighted tennis courts, and the addition of off-street parking. The
project is being completed in alignment with the West Hollywood Park Master Plan, which
describes the park as “an oasis of green within a dynamic city” and will add approximately
2.5 acres of additional park space. The Library project is scheduled to be completed in 2011.
Kings Road Park (.50 acres) is a neighborhood park that provides public gathering space in
an atmosphere surrounded by mature trees, an open turf area, water features, public art, a
children’s playground area, a community meeting room, and restrooms. Hart Park (.75 acres)
is a neighborhood park that is owned by the City of Los Angeles. The park is leased to and
maintained by West Hollywood and includes a theatrical arts studio and learning center, an
off-leash dog area, a water feature, and passive recreation areas.
The two most recent additions to the
City’s park system are Havenhurst Pocket
Park (6,000 sq. ft.) and Formosa Pocket
Park (4,600 sq. ft.). The parks have been
designed as passive recreation areas and
include water features, drought tolerant
plantings, artwork, benches, and walking
paths. The parks are unique as they are
each situated over a subterranean parking
garage and were developed through a
public/private partnership with a residential
development. The City retains use of the            Pocket parks are a creative way to develop additional park
                                                    space in a dense urban environment.
sites as parks through a lease arrangement
with the property owners.
As of 2010, the City is considering a plan to open a small pocket park at 1343 Laurel Ave.
that will add approximately 10,000 square feet of passive park space for public use. The
site is intended to preserve and enhance the character of the existing site and is envisioned
primarily for passive enjoyment for use by the surrounding neighborhood.
Small, passive, pocket parks, like Havenhurst and Formosa Parks, may be some of the most
feasible parks to add to the City in the future. There may also be opportunities throughout
the City to develop additional pocket parks and public plazas on underutilized lots or as part
of new development projects. With proper landscape design that includes amenities such as
shade trees and seating, pocket parks can be highly utilized community gathering spaces.
                                                                         Parks and Recreation 8-7

City Open Space
The City has developed and identified various strategies that offer a framework for residents,
businesses, developers, civic leaders, and City staff to improve West Hollywood’s quality of
life. The Greening West Hollywood document (2006) identifies and supports a broad range
of greening strategies to occur on an ongoing basis. Since this requires active City and
community efforts, the Greening West Hollywood document encourages public and private
participation in creating and improving open space.
Landscape areas such as the street medians, parkways, and other green areas throughout
the City provide valuable public space. These areas provide wildlife habitat, reduce the heat
island effect, sequester carbon, produce oxygen, and provide community gathering places
during various special events.
The City has developed three “Wellness Walking Routes” along various City streets and
sidewalks. The primary route runs between West Hollywood Park and Plummer Park and
offers open space access and views along the way. Each route provides interpretive signage
and route maps, along with directional indicators at key intersections. The Greening West
Hollywood document, as well as other development standards, actively encourages the
creation of more walking routes.
The Sal Guariello Veterans’ Memorial and the Crescent Heights Triangle, both located along
Santa Monica Boulevard, offer more intimate green spaces amidst the hustle and bustle of
the surrounding urban environment. They provide a place of remembrance and reflection,
increase the amount of public green space in the City, and highlight the City’s cultural and
civic heritage.
                                                The City also oversees a Community Garden
                                                Program that creates connections between
                                                community members and provides open space
                                                for residents and local businesses. Community
                                                gardening is expected to continue to play an
                                                important role within the community, though
                                                the shortage of available land within the
                                                City limits the program’s size and number of
                                                participants. The ability to provide community
                                                gardening space is strongly susceptible to
                                                land values and real property development,
                                                and the current location of the Community
                                                Gardening Program is not permanent.
                                                Because of this, the City is developing
                                                initiatives to promote additional gardening
                                                elsewhere in the City, such as on private
                                                property balconies and rooftops and in soil-
                                                less gardens.

09 INFRASTRUCTURE, RESOURCES,
AND CONSERVATION
Though often unnoticed and in the background, public infrastructure and services –
utilities, water and wastewater services, stormwater treatment, recycling and solid waste
management, City buildings and facilities, and transportation infrastructure – are essential
to West Hollywood’s high quality of life. They require regular maintenance and upgrading
both to meet the demands of a growing population and to improve their environmental
performance. Resources such as energy, water, and clean air can often go unnoticed as well,
but are essential components for modern life, and their use or damage can have widespread
environmental and economic effects. This chapter of the General Plan provides background
information and policy guidance for these topics, organized as follows:
  •	 Water supply and conservation
  •	 Energy supply and conservation
  •	 Green building
  •	 Climate change
  •	 Air quality
  •	 Wastewater infrastructure
  •	 Stormwater management
  •	 Recycling and solid waste
  •	 Transportation infrastructure
  •	 Facilities for City operations
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
State law requires all general plans to contain a conservation element, which addresses the
“conservation, development and utilization of natural resources” (California Government
Code §65302(d)). Natural resources identified by statute include waters, forests, soils,
wildlife, minerals, and other resources. This chapter addresses the conservation of natural
resources through goals and policies targeting water conservation, energy conservation,
stormwater management, green building, air quality, and recycling and solid waste.
The chapter also includes goals and policies relating to climate change, which seek to reduce
ecologically disruptive greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere through numerous
energy and resource conservation measures. The climate change section also addresses
evolving state requirements regarding greenhouse gas emissions regulation.
9-2 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

According to state law, general plans must include information on “the proposed general
distribution and general location and extent of land uses for … solid waste and liquid
disposal facilities,” and requires information on “the general location and extent of existing
and proposed public facilities and services” (California Government Code §65302[a]). While
state law recommends that these topics be covered in the land use element, the West
Hollywood General Plan addresses the topics in this separate element to highlight their
importance and role in supporting the community vision.
CONTEXT
Water Supply and Conservation
West Hollywood’s existing potable water service is provided entirely by two outside agencies
– by the City of Beverly Hills in western portions of the City and by the City of Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power (LADWP) in eastern portions of the City. The City of Beverly
Hills imports 90 percent of the water used in its service area from Northern California
through the Metropolitan Water District (MWD). Based on historic agreements, the City of
Beverly Hills has a preferential right to 1.01 percent of all MWD water. The remaining 10
percent of the water it provides is pumped by way of groundwater rights in the Hollywood
Basin and the La Brea subarea of the Central Basin.
LADWP, which provides the remainder of West Hollywood’s current potable water needs, is
the largest municipal utility provider in the United States. It provides water to over 4 million
people in the City of Los Angeles, as well as portions of West Hollywood, Culver City and
unincorporated Los Angeles County. The primary sources of LADWP’s water supply include
water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD)
(which imports water from Northern California through the State Water Project’s California
Aqueduct and from the Colorado River through the Colorado River Aqueduct), the Los
Angeles Aqueduct (which brings water directly from the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains),
and local groundwater.
Water supply from MWD is more uncertain now than in the past, given potential climate
change impacts and variable hydrology and environmental issues in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta, among other factors. The water conservation and management policies
within the General Plan 2035 are designed to reduce water consumption in the City of West
Hollywood, and help manage water uncertainty.
Energy Supply and Conservation
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides electricity to West Hollywood residents and
businesses. SCE, a subsidiary of Edison International, serves approximately 180 cities in 11
counties across central and Southern California. SCE administers various energy efficiency
and conservation programs that may be available to residents, businesses, and other
organizations in West Hollywood.

Company’s service territory encompasses approximately 20,000 square miles and more than
500 communities. A Gas Company service yard is within the City limits, adjacent to the West
Hollywood Gateway Center, on Formosa Avenue at Romaine Street.
Green Building
West Hollywood adopted one of the nation’s first
mandatory green building ordinances, effective
October 1, 2007. The Green Building Ordinance
established development standards that apply to
all development, including all new residential and
commercial projects as well as remodels and tenant
improvements.
The Green Building Ordinance addresses construction
and demolition waste, requires new buildings
to anticipate future solar panel installations,
regulates use of materials with volatile organic
compounds, requires Energy Star appliances, requires
transportation demand management strategies
                                                             The Green Building Resource Center on the

builds upon California Title 24 standards for energy
performance.
The Green Building Ordinance also includes a point system for new construction with incentives
for projects that achieve “exemplary” status. Specifically, the point system was designed to
emphasize locally-available materials, encourage green elements to be incorporated early into
project design, and provide flexibility to alter green elements as the project evolves. A Green
Building Resource Center, located on the second floor of City Hall, provides a sampling of green
building materials, practices, and additional information for community members and developers.
Climate Change
Climate change poses a threat to the safety, health
and welfare of the West Hollywood community,
and the City is committed to addressing it. This
includes both reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and planning for the effects of climate change.
The following section provides specific policies and
a discussion of the context for addressing climate
change in West Hollywood.
                                                             The City’s vehicle fleet includes many hybrid
                                                             vehicles.
9-4 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Climate change is a global environmental issue. The warming of the earth’s climate results
when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth towards space. Certain gases in the
atmosphere act like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight to pass into the greenhouse,
but blocking the heat from escaping into space. While some amount of greenhouse effect is
essential to life on earth, emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other causes
have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases to ecologically disruptive levels.
Models predict that world temperatures will rise by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius (2.5
and 10.4 degrees F) during the 21st Century, depending on the level to which atmospheric
concentrations of GHGs rise and the eventual effect of such rises. These global changes
would affect residents of West Hollywood in a variety of ways, including:
  •	 Rising sea levels, which would threaten nearby coastal infrastructure such as the Port of
     Los Angeles, beaches, and development near the ocean and coastal ecosystems
  •	 More extreme weather events such as storms and floods
  •	 More frequent heat waves and increased drought
  •	 Increased potential for tropical insect-borne diseases
Concerned about the impact of climate change, California has adopted a wide variety of
legislation and policies aimed at reducing the state’s GHG emissions. The California Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) requires the state as a whole to reduce GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Further statewide targets to reduce emissions by 80%
from 1990 levels by 2050 are established by Executive Order S-03-05.
The California Air Resources Board finalized a statewide Climate Change Scoping Plan
(Scoping Plan) in 2008 describing the various strategies California will use to reduce
statewide greenhouse gas emissions by about 28% from projected 2020 emission levels.
While most elements of the Scoping Plan fall under the jurisdiction of state government,
local governments are identified as “essential partners” in achieving statewide GHG
reduction goals, and are advised to take on reduction targets for their municipal operations
and communitywide activities.
Furthermore, in 2007, the California legislature passed Senate Bill 97, which acknowledges
that climate change is an environmental impact under the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). CEQA requires analysis and mitigation of significant environmental impacts and
applies to the adoption of most land use policies and approval of discretionary development
projects within the City’s jurisdiction. The 2010 CEQA Guidelines require greenhouse gas
analysis and mitigation of significant cumulative environmental impacts of greenhouse gas
emissions.
As a result, local governments must now incorporate GHG reduction policies within their
General Plans, as well as other implementing planning and design documents. This General
Plan is subject to analysis and mitigation under CEQA as well, and considers climate change.
                                            Infrastructure, Resources, and Conservation 9-5

Within this context, the West Hollywood City Council has called for aggressive measures in
the General Plan to address climate change. This includes preparation of a greenhouse gas
inventory, setting a greenhouse emissions reduction target, and preparing a Climate Action
Plan concurrently with the General Plan. This will continue to establish West Hollywood as a
regional leader in addressing the effects of climate change.
In 2010, the City prepared a greenhouse gas emissions inventory as part of its Climate
Action Plan. The inventory measures greenhouse gas emissions released as a result
of activity in the City of West Hollywood in the year 2008. Table 9-1 summarizes the
magnitude and relative contribution of municipal greenhouse gas emissions from various
sectors. In the base year 2008, West Hollywood emitted approximately 583,200 metric
tons of CO2e. The transportation sector was the largest emitter of greenhouse gas
emissions (62%), followed by electricity use (17%), non-residential natural gas use (8%),
and residential natural gas use (7%).
The inventory is a baseline against which the community can track its progress in lowering
greenhouse gas emissions. The inventory also allows the City and community members to
understand where the highest percentages of emissions originate, and consequently, where
the greatest opportunities for emissions reductions exist.

This chapter includes specific goals and policies to guide the City’s approach to climate
change, including emissions reductions targets, guidelines for preparing inventories or plans,
and general reduction strategies. Since climate change is a cross-cutting issue impacted by
topics throughout the General Plan, this section also references goals and policies for topics
like land use and mobility, found elsewhere in the General Plan. A separate Climate Action
9-6 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Plan, completed in 2010, provides specific GHG reduction measures applicable
to various sectors of the community and the City’s municipal operations. The
Climate Action Plan as a whole is considered an implementation measure for the
policies described in this section.
Air Quality
West Hollywood is located in the Los Angeles Basin,
a valley surrounded by ocean and mountain ranges.
The Los Angeles Basin historically has had some of
the worst air quality in the U.S. The surrounding
mountains act as a wind-break, and the Basin
is highly susceptible to a build-up of particulate
matter and ozone, which have a tendency to
remain trapped and stagnant over the area. Though
regional air quality has improved since its low point
in the 1960s and 1970s, it still falls below state and
federal standards several times per year. Local air
quality within West Hollywood varies from place to
place and depends on both regional wind patterns
and proximity to local pollution sources. However,            The Sierra Bonita Apartments feature solar
                                                              collectors on the roof and west façade.
it is a well-documented fact that poor air quality
can contribute to respiratory health problems such as asthma, lung cancer, and
respiratory diseases, so improving local air quality is an important public safety
and health priority for the City.
Activities within the City of West Hollywood have an effect on air quality both
within the City and in the wider Los Angeles Basin. Improving air quality will
require collaboration with other agencies and neighboring jurisdictions as
well as innovative local strategies to reduce air pollution, particularly “criteria
pollutants,” from both stationary and mobile sources. The South Coast Air
Quality Management District is the air pollution control agency with jurisdiction
over the urban portions of San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties,
including the City of West Hollywood.
Wastewater Infrastructure
The City of West Hollywood collects wastewater generated within its boundaries
and transmits it through the City of Los Angeles sewer system. Sewer
infrastructure within West Hollywood is made up of City-owned local sewers and
County sewer lines.
The sewer system within the City consists of 39 miles of gravity piping. This
gravity sewer system includes over 850 pipe reaches and manholes, providing
local sewer service to every parcel within the City. Approximately 75% of the
                                            Infrastructure, Resources, and Conservation 9-7

Citywide sewer system was constructed in the 1920s; the other 25% was constructed
in the 1960s. Since the mid 1990s, the City has installed vinyl liners to resolve structural
deterioration to sewers and manholes in portions of Sunset Boulevard, Santa Monica
Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, Robertson Boulevard, and some neighborhood streets. By
inspecting 10% of the City’s sewer network each year, deficient sites can be identified for
vinyl lining projects that would be implemented approximately every four years. In 1992,
the City prepared a comprehensive Sewer Master Plan. One component of the Master Plan
includes a computer model to analyze the operation and capacity of the sewer system going
forward.
The City of West Hollywood budgets for capital improvements to provide capacity upgrades
to accommodate the increased sewage generation. Increased demand for sewer capacity
results from both new development as well as revitalization of existing areas within the
City. The City of West Hollywood requires developers to pay a wastewater mitigation fee
to offset any net increases in wastewater flow from new construction. The City also has
an annual assessment for a sewer service charge. This funds the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the sewer system. These services include routine cleaning, root and grease
control, and spot repairs, as well as 24-hour emergency call-out service for line blockages.
The City is under contract with the County of Los Angeles to provide routine and emergency
sewer maintenance services. Also, the City uses private contractors for specialized sewer
maintenance services such as root control and video inspection.
Stormwater Management
The storm drain infrastructure in the City is jointly
owned and operated by the City of West Hollywood
and the County of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles
County Flood Control District maintains the backbone
flood control system, a network of catch basins and
underground storm drain pipes. The City owns and
maintains a few catch basins and small storm drain
pipes that directly flow into the Los Angeles County
Flood Control District system. On an annual basis,
the City performs maintenance to clean catch basins       New catch basins were installed as part of the
                                                          Santa Monica Boulevard Reconstruction Project.
(storm drain inlets); the City also stencils no-dumping
logos, and installs debris excluder devices to prevent
entry of trash into the storm drains.
Current and future on-site stormwater management facilities such as retention basins,
swales, or vegetation planted for stormwater filtering and containment operate
independently of the storm drain system. However, these systems help reduce drainage loads
through the storm drain system, and are supported through the General Plan 2035 policies.
9-8 West Hollywood General Plan 2035	

Recycling and Solid Waste
The City of West Hollywood contracts with a private company for the collection, transport,
and disposal of solid waste and recyclables from all business and residential uses in West
Hollywood. Waste generated within the City is driven to a materials recovery facility near the
City of Industry and then disposed of primarily in the Puente Hills Landfill in unincorporated
Los Angeles County, next to the City of Whittier in the San Gabriel Valley. The Puente
Hills Landfill is scheduled to close in 2013. After closure, solid waste will be transferred by
rail from Puente Hills to the Mesquite Regional Landfill in Imperial County and the Eagle
Mountain Landfill in Riverside County. The Mesquite Regional Landfill is located on 4,245
acres of land in Imperial County. The landfill will provide capacity for approximately 600
million tons of residual municipal solid waste (approximately 100 years of capacity).
Waste management within the City of West Hollywood is subject to California law, including
the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB939) and amendments found
in SB 1016 (2007). The Integrated Solid Waste Management Act of 1989 required local
jurisdictions to meet waste diversion goals of 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000.
AB 939 also established an integrated framework for program implementation, solid waste
planning, and solid waste facility and landfill compliance. The SB 1016 amendments updated
the 50% diversion requirement; waste diversion is now measured in terms of pounds per
person per day, instead of by total volume within a given jurisdiction.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) sets a target for
resident and employee per capita per day disposal rates. The target for residents is 5.8 and
7.7 for employees. West Hollywood’s waste generation rates were slightly below both the
resident and employee targets set by CalRecycle in both 2007 and 2008. West Hollywood is
committed to diverting additional landfill waste through the solid waste policies within this
General Plan.
Transportation Infrastructure
The City is responsible for the upkeep and
maintenance of the circulation infrastructure – the
roads, alleys and sidewalks. The City’s circulation
infrastructure consists of approximately 45 miles of
public roads. Of this, more than half are residential
streets and the remaining amount are arterial and
collector streets. The maintenance of streets is
addressed in this chapter, while the City’s multi-modal
transportation system is addressed in the Mobility
chapter.
The City regularly assesses the condition of roadway
pavement in the City. Based on the City’s assessment,
almost 75 percent of the roadway miles are classified          The City’s ongoing improvements to roads
as Very Good or Good condition while only 10 percent           have resulted in good conditions citywide.
                                            Infrastructure, Resources, and Conservation 9-9

are in Poor and Very Poor condition. The high quality of the pavement condition is due in
part to the City’s steady rehabilitation and resurfacing of a large percentage of the City’s
roads since incorporation.
In addition to the streets, the City operates 56 signalized roadway intersections as of 2010.
There is also an extensive sidewalk network in the City that supports the pedestrian-oriented
character of the community. These 87 miles of sidewalks, curbs, and gutters are operated
and maintained by the City’s Public Works Department.
Facilities for City Operations
The City owns and/or operates a variety of buildings and other facilities that provide locations
for its day-to-day activities and service to the community. City Hall, at 8300 Santa Monica
Boulevard, is the site of many of the City’s most central and basic functions. It houses the
office of the City Manager and most of the City’s various departments and divisions, and is
one of the main places of contact between residents and the City government.
The City has a Field Services Maintenance Facility at 7317 Romaine Street, as well as
an additional storage facility at 6439 Santa Monica Boulevard. These facilities provide
the Facilities and Field Services Division with storage space and a location to carry out
maintenance, repairs, and other important public works and maintenance functions.
The City owns and maintains several parking facilities. These are: the Kings Road Parking
Structure; the Orange Grove Surface Lot; the Spaulding Surface Lot; and Sunset Surface
Lots Number One and Number Two. A new City parking facility is attached to the West
Hollywood Library. The City also leases from Los Angeles County and maintains the La Jolla/
Havenhurst parking facility and the Melrose Avenue Surface Lot.
City-owned community facilities such as the teen center, the library, senior service facilities,
and recreational facilities are described in the Parks and Recreation Chapter.
The Kings Road parking structure provides parking for area
businesses, visitors, and City staff.
