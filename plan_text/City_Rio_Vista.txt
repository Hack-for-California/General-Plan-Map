July 18, 2002
Chapter 4                   Land Use
A.        Introduction
As prescribed by State law, the purpose of the Land Use element is to designate “the proposed
general distribution and general location and extent of uses of land.” Given this considerable
task, the Land Use element has the broadest scope of the General Plan elements and plays the
central role in correlating all land use issues into a set of coherent development policies. The
goals, policies and implementing actions of the Land Use element relate directly to the other
elements of the General Plan. Although all General Plan elements carry equal weight, in
practice, the Land Use element is the most visible and often used element in the General Plan.
A city’s land use distribution and pattern are influenced by several factors. These include
projected capacity of local and regional infrastructure and services, maintenance of desired
service levels, natural and environmental constraints, market opportunities and constraints,
social considerations, and physical hazards. In addition, land uses are influenced by—and
affect—less measurable considerations, including the character and identity of the community.
Rio Vista, along with the entire County of Solano, is presently experiencing significant growth.
This has led to a transition of the City from a small Delta community into a place of increasingly
urban/suburban character, with growing appeal to new businesses, retirees, and Bay Area
émigrés. The City is now faced with the challenge of accommodating and providing for both
residential and job growth, while attempting to maintain its small-town character.
The land use policies in this element establish the limits concerning where and how much
housing, businesses, industry, schools, community facilities, and open space are to be provided
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      4-1                                       Land Use
July 18, 2002

within the urban area throughout the planning period (1999–2020). Land use policies direct
new development to locations that may beneficially or negatively affect environmental quality
and may require new or expanded facilities, such as roads, recreation facilities, and utilities. The
City’s ability to provide these facilities and the natural systems’ capacity to absorb growth, in
turn, help to shape how much and where development should occur.
Land use decisions affect many aspects of a community’s health and well-being. The rate of
growth and the pattern in which growth occurs can significantly alter the character of a
community. In the Planning Constraints & Boundaries element, the City states its intention to
develop in an orderly, compact, and efficient manner and to provide adequate municipal
services while minimizing the impacts of urban development on agricultural operations.
The design aspect of land use plays a critical role in a community’s “character,” referring to the
physical characteristics that lend shape, form, and identity to a city. Concepts such as “small
town,” “quality of life,” “living environment,” “neighborhood,” and “community” are, to a
large extent, expressions of familiar physical characteristics—landmarks, streets, buildings,
parks, and natural features that create a unique identity in every community. This aspect of
land use is described fully in the Community Character & Design element, which provides
design guidelines and performance standards for various land uses.
The Economic Development element also is linked closely to land use. This element establishes
land use policies that seek to maintain and enhance economic development opportunities
within the City and to define a long-term framework for the City’s sustainability.
Chapters 8, 9 and 10 of the General Plan also are related to the Land Use element in that they
respectively address the City’s approach to sustaining a quality of life through sound policies in
the areas of (1) circulation and mobility, (2) parks and open space, and (3) agricultural and
natural resource conservation.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      4-2                                         Land Use
July 18, 2002

B.        Purpose and Authority
Land Use is one of the seven mandatory General Plan elements required by California law. As
mentioned above, the law requires the Land Use element to designate the “general distribution
and location of various types of land uses.” The element also is required to provide “standards
of population density and building intensity” for the various districts discussed. The Land Use
element is intended to be the basis for all regulations of how land is used within the
community.
A Land Use Map shows the general locations and relationships of various land uses to each
other geographically. It is important to remember that a Land Use Map is intended to illustrate
the goals and policies as described in the text. The Land Use Map is one implementation tool of
many; in and of itself, the map is not the entirety of land use policy. The map cannot be used
without considering the analysis, policies, and reasoning that it represents. The Land Use Map
and text together specify the locations, number of people, and buildings that would be allowed
to develop or redevelop on properties with a planning area. The map and text also specify the
locations of parks and community facilities, schools, institutional uses, agricultural uses, and
lands intended to remain undeveloped as open space for environmental protection and other
reasons.

     C.       Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
Citizens expressed the desire to retain the characteristics that define Rio Vista as a rural, small-
town community, despite growth projections and the need for growth to sustain a healthy local
economy. The local concerns that relate to land use are embodied in the Rio Vista Principles
below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     Farmland and nature are important elements of the community. A clear edge between urban
     development and agriculture should be maintained.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.
     New development should create complete neighborhoods rather than a series of subdivisions that are
     indistinguishable from those in other communities.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
     The existing downtown and waterfront should be strengthened and retained as the central focus of
     the community. Cultural, civic, entertainment, and specialty retail uses—and supporting uses and
     activities should be located in the downtown and adjacent areas.
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
     Commercial development along the Highway 12 corridor should not displace or preempt investment
     from the downtown or along the existing developed corridor.
CREATE AND MAINTAIN ECONOMIC VITALITY; PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE, WORK,
AND SHOP IN RIO VISTA
     The Rio Vista community should be planned for a balance of jobs and housing. Rio Vista should not
     become another bedroom suburb like so many neighboring communities.
     A broad range of housing should be available throughout the community to match job opportunities
     and community needs. No one style or price range of housing should take precedence over any other,
     so long as an adequate supply is available for each.
     Commercial development should occur in locations and configurations that complement existing
     business. New retail projects should:
     •    Provide goods and services not currently available or for which an unmet demand clearly exists,
          and
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           4-4                                       Land Use
July 18, 2002

     •    Be sized in proportion to market demand.
ENSURE EASE OF MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, AND BUSINESSES
     The development of the connecting trail system suggested by the above principles should be pursued
     as a key circulation facility, as well as a natural resource opportunity.
     Many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance of each other. This design allows
     independence and safe movement for those who do not drive, especially seniors and young people.
     Schools should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them. Interconnected
     networks of streets should be designed to encourage walking and reduce the number and length of
     automobile trips.
     The needs of automobiles and pedestrians should be balanced. It is a fact of modern life that
     development must adequately accommodate automobiles. However, pedestrian accessibility should
     not be sacrificed or made less important than automobile accessibility.
     Streets, thoroughfares, and public spaces should be:
     •    Safe, comfortable, attractive, and interesting to the pedestrian and motorist alike; and
     •    Free of barriers and designed with multiple connections to various parts of the community.

     D.       Setting
EXISTING PLANNING AREA
The City of Rio Vista is characterized as a small, waterfront town situated on the west bank of
the Sacramento River. Its historic downtown serves as the City’s core district with historic
residential, commercial, recreational, and government services. Extending from its downtown
core, the City encompasses newer (post-World War II) residential neighborhoods, highway
commercial and industrial uses. Two new subdivisions—Trilogy and Homecoming—exemplify
the changes that Rio Vista is undergoing as a result of rapid growth in Solano County. The
remainder of land within the city limits is largely devoted to agricultural uses, with natural gas
wells dotting the landscape. Although the Land Use element calls for urbanization of the land
within Rio Vista’s boundaries, the rural, agricultural lands surrounding the City will continue
to influence the City’s land use decisions.
          CITY LIMITS
Nearly 43 percent of Rio Vista’s planning area lies within the city limits. The 4,800± acres of
incorporated land represents a doubling of the City’s area since 1991, when approximately
2,509 acres of public and private lands were annexed to the city.
The City of Rio Vista has authority over land use and development within its jurisdiction.
Exceptions include lands within the city limits that are owned or managed by the State of
California, such as the Delta Protection Commission’s Primary Zone of the Delta; Highway 12,
which is under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans); and
submerged lands along the banks of the Sacramento River, which are controlled by State Lands
Commission. State agencies dictate the planning efforts on State lands, but the City is likely to
provide input on any proposed projects.
          SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
Approximately 6,455 acres of land within the City’s sphere of influence (SOI) but outside the
city limits are included in Rio Vista’s 11,255-acre planning area are. While not within the
incorporated boundaries, they bear on Rio Vista’s planning efforts. These lands, which are
almost exclusively devoted to agricultural use and natural gas production, are considered likely
to be within the ultimate physical boundaries and service area of Rio Vista. Although the City is
not required to annex the unincorporated lands, these areas probably will be considered for
annexation in the future.
In general, cities do not have the jurisdiction or ability to control projects within their SOIs but
do receive notices of proposed development activity and may comment on any such projects.
Since most of Rio Vista’s SOI is coterminous with its incorporated boundaries, future
expansions into these undeveloped areas will be determined largely by the City in accordance
with its growth management policies (as described in the Planning Constraints & Boundaries
element). Any annexations of unincorporated land within the SOI are subject to approval by the
Solano County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).

EXISTING LAND USES
          RESIDENTIAL
Approximately 1,974 housing units are within the City of Rio Vista ( ABAG, 1999 ). The
majority of these are close to the downtown core. The recent development of Trilogy and
Homecoming, however, has resulted in the construction of nearly 820 homes to the north and
west that are separated from the rest of the City by large tracts of vacant land. While the
Homecoming subdivision has recently reached buildout of its planned phases, Trilogy has been
approved for 3000 additional homes, construction of which is ongoing. Annexations over the
last decade have resulted in a capacity of approximately 8000 residential units on
approximately 2200 acres north and south of Highway 12; development has not yet begun on
several large parcels within this area.” Residential development outside the incorporated
boundaries but within the City’s SOI is limited to a relatively small number of homes on large
agricultural parcels. The Solano County General Plan identifies most of the area surrounding
the City as Agricultural (40-acre minimum building sites).
          COMMERCIAL
Commercial development in Rio Vista occurs primarily along Main Street between Fourth
Street and the Sacramento River, along Front Street, and along Highway 12. The City’s
commerce traditionally has been conducted in the historic central business district (CBD) and
has been focused primarily on local services, river-oriented services and, to a lesser extent,
tourism.
Downtown Rio Vista remains the hub of activity in the community. City Hall, public safety
offices, the senior center, the library, the post office, and private and public office uses are
currently located there.      Downtown Rio Vista presently includes about 70 business
establishments. Several governmental agencies, including City Hall, and other community-
based organizations maintain their offices in the downtown.
Highway 12 between Drouin Drive and the Rio Vista Bridge has developed primarily with
highway commercial services. Fast food restaurants, gasoline stations, motels, grocery stores,
and convenience retail have given this commercial area of the City a classic “strip” character.
There is substantial underutilized space at prime locations within the area. The PG&E and
Caltrans’ vehicle and equipment maintenance yards comprise the major portion of this
underutilized land.
The Rio Vista General Plan Retail Market Analysis (Economic & Planning Systems, 1998) indicated
that about 75 acres of vacant, commercially designated land currently are available in Rio Vista.
Approximately 55 acres (73 percent) of the commercial land are located at Highway 12 and
Church Street; 6± acres are in the interior of the Trilogy project; an additional 8± acres are along
the waterfront between Highway 12 and the downtown; and 6± acres lie along the commercial
stretch of Highway 12.

July 18, 2002

          INDUSTRIAL
Industrial uses in the vicinity of Rio Vista include both manufacturing and service companies.
Approximately 567 acres within the city limits currently are zoned for industrial uses, including
light industrial, general industrial, and warehousing. This amount includes 273 acres devoted
to the Rio Vista Airport and its industrial park, as well as 160 acres set aside for a planned
wastewater treatment plant.         Most of the industrial development is situated north of
Highway 12 in areas along the waterfront, at the Rio Vista Business Park, and along Airport
Road.
The area north of Highway 12 along River Road and west to St. Francis Drive was the first area
of industrial development. The development that began in the unincorporated county is now
entirely within the city limits. Storage, industry, and service commercial dominate the area,
with a range of uses from office to junkyards, a materials yards, gravel/sand quarries, and
residential uses are mixed in near Airport Road. There are large partially developed or
underutilized parcels in this area, particularly south of Airport Road.
Lands in the vicinity of Airport Road are the primary employment-generating areas in the
planning area. Approximately 180 acres in this are include 100 acres of manufacturing (MG)
north of Airport Road and east of Church Road, along with 80 acres south of Airport Road,
north of Harris Road, and east of Church Road. Access to the area is possible from Airport
Road, Church Road, and Harris Road.
On approximately 5-10 acres across Airport Road from Church Road (on the north side of the
airport) trucking operations, storage, and some industrial uses are situated. This area of the
City also has approximately 10 acres currently occupied by a pipe and gas well drilling
materials yard on the east side of Church Road approximately 0.25 mile south of Airport Road.
In addition, use of a small, 6-acre parcel on the edge of Gibbs Ranch is limited to service
commercial and low-intensity industrial uses due to its proximity to the airport.
Rio Vista has converted its former municipal airport site of 14 acres to a publicly owned,
privately leased industrial park. Currently, the site is partially developed with agriculture/
processing, industrial, storage and service uses, and a concrete batch plant. An old airport
hangar is being renovated to convert the hangar into a business incubator facility for startup
businesses.
          AIRPORT
Since the 1950s, Rio Vista has had a municipal airport. The former airport was relocated to a
new facility that opened in 1992. New infrastructure and building sites for businesses recently
have been added; therefore, the facility is both a public asset and an economic development
opportunity, although it has not yet achieved fiscal self-sufficiency.
The Rio Vista Airport is located north of Airport Road and west of Church Road. The facility
has a helipad and two runways, one 4,200 feet and the other 2,200 feet. The 10-year-old facility
recently was upgraded with water, sewer, and additional utility improvements; an improved
12-acre business park; and a new office/administration building. Several “fixed base
operators” (FBOs) are located onsite, including a mechanic. The City operates a fuel concession
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       4-8                                     Land Use
July 18, 2002

at the site, as well as hangars of various sizes for rent. Approximately 50 aircraft are located at
the site. A private company not related to airport operations recently occupied the new office
building and one hangar building. The business park can accommodate up to 100,000 square
feet of building development sites or “pads.” With the major residential subdivision growth
that is presently occurring, more hangar space is planned for corporate and business users who
are either relocating or expanding their businesses in the Rio Vista area. In addition, the future
Fire Station No. 2 will be located here.
          RECREATION
The City of Rio Vista provides public recreational areas for its residents, including
approximately 25 acres of parkland, a boat launch ramp, public fishing and docking facilities, a
swimming pool, a baseball field, and play fields. The 10-acre Sandy Beach Regional Park is
located in unincorporated Solano County immediately south of the City’s wastewater treatment
plant; the park contains a two-lane boat launch ramp, parking area, picnic tables, campsites, and
a swimming beach available to the entire City.
Private recreational facilities include the Trilogy golf course that is accessible to the public and
the Rio Vista Marina, a privately owned and operated marina facility on the Sacramento River
south of the downtown area. The marina provides docking, boat storage, and related
commercial services.
          STUDY AREAS
For two key areas in Rio Vista studies have been repaired to determine their suitability for
various kinds of development: (1) the downtown Waterfront, an underutilized area between
Main Street and the Rio Vista Bridge; and (2) the former Army Reserve Base, which will be
transferred to the City of Rio Vista through the Department of Defense. These areas provide
unique opportunities for enhancement through development.
The 8-acre Waterfront area has been considered for comprehensive planning for economic
development activities since the 1970s. This area is presently zoned as a “Study District” in
which individual development projects are to be part of a larger, more comprehensive plan.
The City has undertaken preparation of a Waterfront Plan that includes a conceptual design for
the promenade/boardwalk and suggests areas for placement of commercial building envelopes.
A 28-acre former Army Reserve Base site lies on the bank of the Sacramento River just south of
the Rio Vista city limits. A flat lower terrace contains most of the existing structures, while the
upper terrace, about 15 feet higher and set back from the river, consists primarily of open areas.
A range of potential uses has been explored in the Rio Vista Army Base Reuse Plan (Economic &
Planning Systems, 1998) that was prepared in December 1998. The Plan envisions using the
majority of the former Army Reserve site for public recreational uses, ranging from tennis and
basketball courts to regulation soccer, softball and baseball fields, and a multi-purpose
community center building. If developed as proposed, the facility would become a community-
wide park facility.

July 18, 2002

HISTORICAL GROWTH TRENDS
As growth rates have increased in the region, the City has captured an increasing share of the
growth. Nevertheless, Rio Vista remains a small, rural community relative to other Solano
County cities.
          RESIDENTIAL/POPULATION
According to the Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Projections 2000, the City’s
population (within its SOI) increased between 1990 and 2000 by nearly 46 percent, from 3,496 to
5,100.
Coinciding with this growth, two large-scale residential subdivisions have been under
construction over the last several years, with little or no lapse between each phase of
construction. Trilogy (formerly known as Summerset), a senior housing project in the
northwestern portion of the City, has resulted in the construction of 492 homes since 1996—
with 2,500 to 3,000 units expected at buildout. This project also includes a nine-hole public golf
course and clubhouse/restaurant. The second major residential development currently under
construction is Homecoming, located between Church Road and the Rio Vista Business Park.
This phased 294-unit project, which began in 1997, has recently completed construction of its
final phase.
          NONRESIDENTIAL/EMPLOYMENT
During the 1990s, Rio Vista has experienced new nonresidential growth including commercial,
office and industrial development. ABAG projections reported that, between 1990 and 2000, the
number of jobs within the Rio Vista planning —area grew from 1,850 to 1,980—representing a
7 percent increase in employment over the decade.
          JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
While the City currently maintains a healthy jobs/housing balance, with 0.9 job/employed
resident and about 1.1 jobs/household, the ABAG projections show the community falling far
short of an acceptable balance as growth occurs. It also should be noted that the Bay Area
regional average currently is approximately 1.04 jobs per employed resident and 1.51 jobs per
household.
BUILDOUT UNDER THE 1985 GENERAL PLAN
The Rio Vista General Plan 1985, and its associated amendments, allows a variety of dwelling
types and residential densities. The current Land Use Diagram, shown in Figure 4-1, provides
for a variety of land uses, including residential estates; low-, medium-, and high-density
residential development; and commercial, industrial, recreational, and public uses.
Based on projections of housing demand in 1985, the City expected to add approximately 50
new dwelling units per year, adding approximately 500 dwelling units and 1,150 residents to
the City through buildout of under the 1985 General Plan.

However, the 1985 Plan also designated large unincorporated tracts of land in the vicinity of Rio
Vista as areas appropriate for future annexation and development. By doing so, the City stated
its intention to grow, but in a logical and orderly pattern of development. Its urban limit line
solidified the City’s decision to prevent Rio Vista from becoming a “bedroom” community for
other nearby municipalities such as Antioch, Pittsburg, or Fairfield.
Subsequently, the City approved the 1991 General Plan Amendments (GPA), resulting in the
annexation and change in land use designation/zoning of 2,509 additional acres. This action
added the potential for construction of 6,450 housing units on 1,334 acres, commercial
development of 135 acres, industrial development on 173 acres, and the remaining 837 acres to
be devoted to public uses.
Buildout under the 1985 General Plan would allow the City’s population to increase by as many
as 19,440 persons as a result of residential development of the Esperson property (formerly
known as Del Rio Hills), Trilogy and adjacent parcels (formerly known as Summerset and
Marks Ranch), the Gibbs Ranch, the Waterfront, and other City lands. The majority of housing
units approved as part of the GPA were in the low-density residential category, including 42
acres of Estate (1.0 units/acre); 1,179 acres of Low-Density Residential (4.3 units/acre); 96 acres
of Medium-Density Residential (10 units/acre); and 17 acres of High-Density Residential
(20 units/acre).
This annexation and redesignation/rezoning of lands within the City’s SOI was approved with
the intent to encourage economic activities and development, and to provide opportunities for
local employment by providing affordable housing for employees, population support for local
businesses, and sites for job-producing new industries.

July 18, 2002

E.        Outlook
The land use districts, definitions, and standards in this element identify the types of land uses
proposed for the City and the level of intensity or density to which they can be developed.
These designations, in conjunction with the Land Use Map, serve as a guide for the City’s
planned development pattern.
The Land Use element is intended to go a step beyond the identification of land uses and the
rules and regulations for their development. Goals and policies related to community form
address the more intangible aspects of how a City is developed and defined. Issues specific to
the City’s character and design, and the relationship between land uses and concepts, such as
pedestrian mobility, multi-modal transportation, and mixed uses, are addressed in the
Community Character & Design element of this General Plan.
The success in enacting a form and pattern of development that embraces the concepts
articulated in this element and in the Community Character & Design element depends on
implementation. The identified implementing actions include future specific plans/planned
unit developments, community design guidelines, and development review.
GROWTH PROJECTIONS
The timing of Rio Vista’s buildout under this General Plan will affect the City’s land use
inventory, infrastructure and resource needs, and service calculations. Estimates of projected
growth vary from source to source, depending on the method and assumptions used. Under all
scenarios, however, Rio Vista—along with the remainder of Solano County—is anticipated to
remain attractive to both residential and nonresidential growth.
The General Plan does not specify a maximum growth rate. In general, growth rates mirror
national economic trends, increasing during periods of economic expansion and slowing during
economic downturns. Periods of rapid growth are frequently followed by slower periods.
          RESIDENTIAL/POPULATION
For planning purposes, the City assumes that, based on economic conditions and available land
use, growth rates between 1999 and 2020 will exceed those experienced between 1990 and 2000:
As mentioned in the previous section, ABAG’s growth projection for this period was
approximately 46 percent. The growth rate assumption used to anticipate when buildout will
occur under this General Plan is 5.8 percent. Although Rio Vista will experience significant
growth over the next 20 years, it is not likely to experience buildout of its residential land use
allocation due to the large amount of vacant land within the city limits.
          NONRESIDENTIAL/EMPLOYMENT
Over the 20-year planning period, Solano County will have the largest percentage of jobs
growth of any county in the Bay Area. Its location between the fast-growing Sacramento area
and the northern portion of the Bay Area gives it a strong long-term economic development
advantage. Over the entire forecast period, ABAG projects that Rio Vista will be among the
communities experiencing the most significant percentage of growth. However, between 1999
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    4-13                                         Land Use
July 18, 2002

and 2020, the number of employed residents in the City is expected to grow at a faster pace than
jobs, reinforcing the City’s residential character.
          JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
The increase in current ratios of jobs per employed resident by 2020 is projected to be the same
as the increase for Solano County as a whole. Rio Vista is expected to decline from a position
that currently is healthier than the County’s and about on par with the region, to a much less
balanced position than either the County or the region. The numbers forecast for job growth in
the region is not expected to significantly affect Rio Vista. A detailed discussion of the
jobs/housing balance is included in the Economic Development element of this General Plan.
Policies in the Land Use element promote a reasonable jobs/housing balance. The desired
balance depends on a number of factors, including commute distances, job income, housing
prices, and desired land use inventories for economic development purposes.
Striving for an equal number of jobs and employed residents in an area is a worthwhile
objective, although it does not necessarily ensure that a jobs/housing balance will be achieved.
Planning the relationship between jobs and housing is not only a mathematical exercise but also
requires a quantitative and qualitative analysis of commute behavior, employment
opportunities by occupation and wage, housing needs and income type, and the rate of both
jobs and housing growth.
In addition, the relationship between jobs and housing must be considered in a regional context.
In the Housing element of this General Plan, the intent for land use within the city limits is
reinforced by policies that will assist in achieving a jobs/housing balance. The economic
development policies contained in the Economic Development element also direct land uses to
be developed in a balance between jobs and housing to ensure a healthy local economy.
AREAS OF LAND USE CHANGE
With the City’s approval of the 1991 General Plan Amendments to the Rio Vista General Plan
1985, and subsequent development agreements on those annexed lands, residential densities
and non-residential development intensities are expected to remain largely unchanged during
the time frame of this General Plan. Consequently, the changes proposed in this Land Use
element do not anticipate significant changes in population increases or employment
projections. The changes proposed for the element focus on a new configuration of land use
districts (i.e., land use designations) rather than any significant change in, or reallocation of,
allowable land uses.
What is expected to change as a result of this General Plan update is the integration of various
land use types within a single district. The Neighborhood Core and Neighborhood Service/
Mixed Use districts proposed with this element are intended to allow and, in fact, encourage
flexibility in community design so as to foster the City’s desire for traditional neighborhood
character and facilitate a more pedestrian-friendly living environment.
Within the range of proposed land use districts of this General Plan are all the land use
designations of its predecessor. Allocation of land uses, including Estate Residential; Low-,
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      4-14                                     Land Use
July 18, 2002

Medium-, and High-Density Residential; Commercial; Industrial; Recreational; and Public Land
uses are allocated in generally the same proportion as in the previous General Plan. These uses
may, however, be distributed among more than one land use district where residential units
and compatible, job-generating uses are expected to develop in proximity to one another.
Due to the flexibility of land use mixes and ranges of density and intensity within various
districts, this Land Use element does not (and cannot) compare quantitatively the buildout
scenarios under the old General Plan with the proposed Plan. It is not anticipated, however,
that this updated General Plan will result in a significant reallocation of the various land use
types when compared with the 1985 Plan and its 1991 amendments.
PLANNING AREA
The land use policies of the General Plan focus on the City’s Planning Area, as defined in the
Planning Constraints & Boundaries element. Rio Vista’s planning area and sub-planning areas
are shown in Figure 4-2. The sub-planning areas are described below.
          SUB-PLANNING AREAS
Within the overall planning area, six distinct sub-planning areas were derived from examining
the location and range of existing and potential uses, and the unique characteristics of various
portions of the overall planning area. The acreages for each of the sub-planning areas are
included in Table 4-1. The common geographical and development characteristics of each sub-
planning area are discussed below.

          SUB-PLANNING AREA 1—EXISTING DEVELOPED CITY NEAR THE SACRAMENTO RIVER
Sub-Planning Area 1 is comprised of the existing developed city near the Sacramento River,
including the highway commercial development alongside Highway 12, the historic downtown,
prewar and postwar residential neighborhoods developed prior to 1990, various infill sites, and
the still-developing industrial and service commercial lands near the river that are north of
Highway 12.
          SUB-PLANNING AREA 2—ESPERSON PROPERTY, RIVER WALK, AND HOMECOMING
          NEIGHBORHOOD
Sub-Planning Area 2 is formed by the proposed Esperson and River Walk master plan project
sites and the existing Homecoming single-family residential subdivision. Homecoming consists
of 290 single-family homes in moderate price ranges; the subdivision is expected to be complete
by late 2001. The 500± acres south of Highway 12 are owned by the Esperson family; 230± acres
north of Highway 12 that abut the Homecoming subdivision are referred to as River Walk and
owned by the A. D. Seeno Development Company (SEECON). Conceptual plans that would be
suitable for this Sub-Planning Area and consistent with the goals and policies of the General
Plan are included in Appendix 4-1 at the end of this chapter.
          SUB-PLANNING AREA 3—INDUSTRIAL/EMPLOYMENT AND SERVICE COMMERCIAL LANDS
          NORTH OF HIGHWAY 12
Sub-Planning Area 3 consists of the newly developing industrial and employment lands located
alongside Airport Road west of the river. Existing and anticipated uses are primarily
industrial/employment, service commercial and warehousing, and related business uses. The
lands south of Airport Road and west of St. Francis Road include the former airport business
park site and other City-owned lands. North of Airport Road along River Road, the existing
land use mix is predominantly storage, salvage, and some industrial/employment uses.
          SUB-PLANNING AREA 4— NORTHWEST AREA NEIGHBORHOODS
The large parcels (Marks, Gibbs, and Brann Ranches) that constitute the majority of the future
residential and commercial growth extend from Church Road westerly to the city limits and
north of Highway 12. This area contains several specific plan areas under previously adopted
development agreements, including the Trilogy (formerly Summerset) planned development,
Gibbs Ranch, and Brann Ranch. The Trilogy senior housing project is the only one of the three
developments that has begun construction and made substantial progress. In addition to
residential, the anticipated mix of uses includes neighborhood retail, commercial, service
commercial, and limited industrial/employment uses.
          SUB-PLANNING AREA 5— AIRPORT, PUBLIC, AND RESTRICTED LANDS
Sub-Planning Area 5 contains the new municipal airport (Baumann Field) and a large area
owned by the City and restricted to predominantly open space, agricultural, and natural habitat
uses under the jurisdiction of the Delta Protection Commission (DPC), a State agency. The
DPC’s jurisdiction includes all of the lands north of Airport Road. State law requires the City’s
General Plan policies to be consistent with the DPC’s policies in these areas; however, lands
previously annexed and zoned for urban uses or projects for which an EIR was certified prior to
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    4-17                                      Land Use

1993 are allowed. This exception includes the airport, the proposed Northwest Waste Water
Treatment Plant (NWWTP), and the industrial/employment uses in Sub-Planning Area 3. The
DPC’s jurisdictional boundary is shown on the map in Figure 4-3. The DPC is further discussed
in Chapter 3, “Planning Constraints & Boundaries”; the NWWTP is discussed in Chapter 12,
“Public Facilities & Services.”
          SUB-AREA 6—AGRICULTURAL AND OPEN SPACE LANDS
Sub-Planning Area 6 is comprised of large tracts of agricultural and open space lands beyond
the city limits and within the unincorporated boundaries of Solano and Sacramento Counties.
These lands constitute the balance of the planning area and are expected to remain in non-
urban, predominantly agricultural uses throughout the time period covered by the Rio Vista
General Plan 2001.
LAND USE DISTRICTS
The General Plan designates nine land use “districts” (often referred to in general plans as “land
use designations”) within the Rio Vista planning area. Several of these districts have two or
more designated subcategories. Figure 4-3 represents the overall Land Use Map, graphically
portraying the location and boundaries of each land use district; Figure 4-4 illustrates the
detailed subcategories of land use that make up the Existing City Districts.
Table 4-2 provides a breakdown of the land use districts and their subcategories within the
overall planning area. The table provides corresponding acreages (gross acres) for each district
and subcategory, along with the percentage of the total planning area that each land use district
represents. These figures should be considered approximations, to be used in estimating the
amount of development that could conceivably occur on all parcels less roadways, easements,
and other encumbrances. The exact number of “built” or net acres for undeveloped land cannot
be accurately determined until project-specific plans have been approved.
The mix of land use over time is expected to change, with residential uses becoming a greater
percentage of all land uses. As a result, Rio Vista is likely to have a larger amount of residents
in proportion to its employment and service uses than currently exists.
LAND USE DISTRICT DESCRIPTIONS AND FEATURES
The land use districts described in Tables 4-3 through 4-10 correspond to those shown in
Figures 4-3 and 4-4, which together constitute the Land Use Map. Descriptions, design
characteristics, and performance standards have been developed for these land use districts to
ensure compatibility between land uses or categories of uses as projects are developed.
Figures 4-5 through 4-7 provide a graphic representation of the City’s intent for the
Neighborhood Core and Neighborhood Service/Mixed Use districts, respectively. (Note: Public
Facilities is the only land use district that is not reflected in these tables—the design guidelines and
performance standards vary widely with each type of public facility, and are often dictated by State and/or
federal requirements).

July 18, 2002
The following general guidelines will be applied to all districts:
          •   Intensity, compatibility, and potential for conflicts should be the appropriate
              measures of compatibility, not simply the type of use or density.
          •   The potential for positive interaction and support between uses should be
              emphasized.
          •   Barriers between uses and districts should be minimized to encourage non-auto use
              for convenience, errands, and close-to-home or close-to-location trips.
          •   The intensity and mix of compatible uses should be increased near locations that are
              natural focal points of activity (for example, major intersections, and commercial and
              employment centers).
Tables 4-3 through 4-10 provide specific criteria for each district: description and location,
allowable uses, intensity/density, mix of uses, design characteristics and performance
standards are outlined for each category of use. Throughout the development review process,
these criteria are consistent, and will be used in combination, with the design criteria outlined in
the Community Character & Design element to evaluate specific plans and individual
development projects in each land use district. The following descriptions have been
incorporated into Tables 4-3 through 4-10.
          LAND USE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
The general location of each district is described (as shown on the Land Use Map) along with a
description of the district (e.g., existing entitlements, extent of development, environmental
characteristics, etc.) and its relationship to surrounding land uses.
          PURPOSE/USES ALLOWED OR REQUIRED
This section describes the intent and focus of each land use district; it suggests the principal
uses that the district could accommodate and what complementary or supporting uses would
be appropriate. Circulation and access concerns may be noted, and lot sizes may be
qualitatively described. The allowable and/or required uses are consistent with any existing
entitlements that may be in place within these districts.
          MIX OF USES
Land uses or types of activities are typically grouped according to their common functional
requirements. Rio Vista’s Land Use element assigns several districts a percentage range, as to
distribution of various land use types, in order to achieve the proper balance of land uses that
will maximize ease of mobility and efficiency within neighborhoods, and will minimize
potential environmental impacts of land development. This mixed-use approach is intended to
provide flexibility in performance and design rather than mandate a prescriptive zoning-type
approach. Among the types of land uses that may be considered in the mix are:
          •   Residential
          •   Local-serving commercial/office/retail/personal services

          Dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The number of homes, apartments, condominium
          units, or other types of living unit on an acre of land. Most references for General Plan
          purposes are gross density, or the number of units on all residential land area within the
          project or district, including streets, parks, and other open space.
          Net density. The number of units per acre after deducting the area set aside for public
          streets, parks, easements, and nonresidential land uses from the overall site.
          Base density. The base is an average density that each development project is expected
          to achieve. Each district has a base density range within which the overall average for
          the project is expected to fall.
          Site density. The density of a type of housing on a particular site or lot within a
          development project.
Nonresidential Intensity
The following terms describe nonresidential intensity:
          Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The FAR is expressed in a percentage or decimal; this measure
          indicates the amount of building floor area on a parcel of land or area. The higher the
          FAR, the greater the range of activities possible and the more likely that multiple
          shopping tasks or errands will be accomplished with one auto trip (“park once”).
          A typical single-story suburban shopping center has a FAR of 0.2–0.25, or 20-25 percent
          of the total site. A 10-acre parcel (435,600 sq. ft.) would yield about 80,000–100,000 sq. ft.
          of commercial space.
          A small downtown shopping district may have FARs on individual parcels as high as
          2.0, or 200 percent of the site area, since parking is often in public lots or onstreet and
          most of the parcel is covered by two or more floors of building.
          Net, Base, and Site Intensities. These definitions are the same as for residential, except
          that the intensity measure is floor area ratio for nonresidential development, rather than
          dwellings per acre.

Performance Standards for Residential or Nonresidential Density/ Intensity
Each district has a range of acceptable densities and intensities for individual sites, with which
each development project is expected to comply. A base or average density also is required for
the entire project. The base is a minimum standard, which is expected to be reached or
exceeded.
Example: A residential development of 10 acres is proposed in the Neighborhood Residential
District (NR). The NR density standards are a range of 1.0 to 7.5 du/gross acre and a base
average of 5 du/acre. The project might consist of fifty 5,000–6,000 sq. ft. lots, for an average of
5.0 du/acre, the base for the project. The site also might be developed with 2 acres of
townhomes with 20 units (10 du/acre) on the townhome site, with the remaining 8 acres
developed in 30 larger lots averaging 3 du/acre, for an overall project average of 5/acre. Or, the
project may be developed in any combination of larger or smaller lots or even apartments, so
long as the base average of 5.0 is achieved for the project and any portion or site within the
project is not developed at less than 1.0 du/acre or more than 20 du/acre.
Design Characteristics
This category establishes design characteristics for site layout, building location, architectural
character, amenities, parking, pedestrian connections, bicycle and/or transit capability, loading
and service ability, buffering, interface of potentially incompatible uses, mass, scale, and
character of surroundings.

F.        Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions
The implementing actions associated with each policy are fully described at the end of this
chapter.
GOAL 4.1           TO CONTINUE A COMPREHENSIVE, LOGICAL LAND USE PLANNING PROCESS
                   RATHER THAN AN INCREMENTAL, PIECEMEAL APPROACH.
The City will implement the following land use policies in accordance with the discussion of
planning constraints, boundaries, and the associated policies contained in Chapter 3 of this
General Plan.
  Policy                                                 Implementing Action
  4.1.A        Growth shall provide a strong             LU-1    Specific Plans
               diversified economic base and a           LU-2    Public Participation
               reasonable balance between                LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
               employment and housing for all
               income ranges.
  4.1.B        Growth shall occur on the basis that      LU-1    Specific Plans
               projected revenue should be sufficient    LU-2    Public Participation
               to meet public costs.                     LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
  4.1.C        Growth shall be managed to ensure         LU-1    Specific Plans
               that adequate public facilities and       LU-2    Public Participation
               services, as defined in the Public        LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
               Facilities & Services element, are
               planned and provided in a manner that
               protects the public’s health, safety, and
               welfare.
  4.1.D        The City shall accommodate projected      LU-1    Specific Plans
               population and employment growth in       LU-2    Public Participation
               areas where the appropriate level of      LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
               public infrastructure and services are
               planned or will be made available
               concurrent with development.
  4.1.E        The City shall ensure a comprehensive,    LU-1    Specific Plans
               logical growth process as areas           LU-2    Public Participation
               develop, particularly where significant   LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
               changes in land use are being
               considered.

               is achieved within the city limits.
  4.1.G        The City shall, through its land use and  LU-1    Specific Plans
               facilities planning processes, coupled    LU-2    Public Participation
               with its Capital Improvement Program,     LU-3    Intergovernmental Coordination
               provide for a land use allocation that
               could permit construction of at least
               11,000 dwelling units.
GOAL 4.2           TO ENSURE THAT THE USE AND CHARACTER OF ALL LANDS WITHIN THE CITY’S
                   PLANNING AREA ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THIS GENERAL PLAN.

               Ensure that all property improvements
               are sensitive to their surroundings and
               protect the public health, safety, and
               welfare. Do not apply inappropriate or
               overly restrictive “modern” zoning and
               development standards to districts or
               neighborhoods that were constructed
               under a previous era’s regulatory
               climate.

GOAL 4.3           TO PROVIDE FOR AN APPROPRIATE RANGE OF LAND USES TO MEET THE
                   COMMUNITY’S NEEDS.
The long-term community well-being and quality of life will be enhanced by maintaining a mix
and pattern of land uses that are environmentally sensitive; complement adjacent uses; and
allow for planned growth and adequate opportunities for employment, housing availability,
services, and recreation. A balance between jobs growth, housing opportunity, and services not
only will support stable economic growth in Rio Vista but also will reduce vehicle trips for
work, shopping, and services—enhancing the overall quality of life for Rio Vista residents.
  Policy                                                 Implementing Action
  4.3.A        The City shall adopt Tables 4-3 through   LU-4  Land Use Map

July 18, 2002

G.        Implementing Actions for Land Use (LU)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Land Use element.
LU-1               SPECIFIC PLANS
                   (Proposed)
The City will ensure that specific plans, some of which may include planned unit
developments, proposed for future development areas are consistent with the goals and policies
of the General Plan, and with Section 65451 of the Government Code. Specific plans will
incorporate implementation measures that include standards and design criteria for which
development will proceed, provisions for public facilities and services, and financing measures.
The City will use development agreements to secure implementation and financing provisions
for these specific plans and planned unit developments (PUDs).
LU-2               PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
                   (Existing)
The City will continue and improve its public participation process, actively solicit public
participation through public hearings and the development review process, and provide
opportunities for early consultation for major development proposals. In addition, the City will
expand public involvement and information programs, such as providing information to
affected residents and other stakeholders when public improvements are being planned.
LU-3               INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
The City’s efforts to achieve managed growth that ensures adequate public facilities, provides a
jobs/housing balance, and preserves agriculture at the city limits will require
intergovernmental coordination. The City will work with State and local agencies including
Caltrans, the Delta Protection Commission, Solano and Sacramento Counties, the Airport Land
Use Commission, River Delta Unified School District, and other affected agencies, particularly
during planning and development review of proposed development projects. As part of the
General Plan adoption process, the City will inform these agencies of urban growth boundaries
(discussed in detail in the Planning Constraints & Boundaries element), the newly adopted land
use districts, and City policies regarding land use in agricultural areas and the legal Delta.
LU-4               LAND USE MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The Land Use Map shown as Figures 4-32 and 4-4 will work in conjunction with all other
elements of the Rio Vista General Plan. The Land Use Map will be the starting point for
determining appropriateness of land use in terms of location and density/intensity. The Land
Use Definitions and Standards, along with key policies in Chapters 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 will be
used in conjunction with the Land Use Map to reinforce and implement the City’s land use
policies, particularly in the areas of urban growth limits, community character, jobs/housing
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          4-46                                   Land Use
July 18, 2002

balance, and traffic and circulation—and in the preservation of open space, agricultural lands,
and environmentally sensitive areas.
LU- 5              DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement its development review process in accordance with the
statutory requirements contained in such documents as the Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance,
Subdivision Ordinance, and the Subdivision Map Act; specific plan policies and design
guidelines; the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); the Permit Streamlining Act; and
other statutes. The process will promote flexibility and innovation in residential and other land
uses through the use of specific plans, planned unit developments (PUDs), development
agreements, mixed-use projects and other innovative development and planning techniques.
The City will continue to provide for public participation and coordination with other
jurisdictions in the review of development proposals.
LU-6               DESIGN GUIDELINES
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City will implement the Design Characteristics and Performance Standards, presented in
Tables 4-3 through 4-10 of this element; the Design Criteria specified in Section G of the
Community Character & Design element; and various design-related performance standards
contained in other elements of this General Plan. Collectively, they constitute the City’s Design
Guidelines and will serve as evaluation criteria during the review of proposed development
applications. These guidelines will be considered the minimum standards to achieve
compatibility between land uses; to provide sufficient opportunities for alternative modes of
transportation and pedestrian access; and to meet the City’s overall community design goals in
the areas of aesthetics, signage, circulation and mobility, and environmental resources.
Modifications to these design criteria may be made by the Planning Commission and City
Council during the course of development application review and be adopted as conditions of
project approval, provided such conditions are found to be consistent with the policies which
the criteria were intended to implement.
LU- 7              ORDINANCE AND REGULATIONS REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City’s ordinances and related regulations will be reviewed and updated to bring them into
consistency with the General Plan, including the policies of this element. The current
ordinances and regulations that will be subject to this effort include, but are not limited to, the
following:
          •   Zoning Ordinance (comprehensive update)
          •   Subdivision Ordinance
          •   Natural Gas Ordinance
          •   CEQA local regulations, including thresholds of significance
          •   Franchise and licensing procedures
          •   Nuisance regulations
          •   Development Agreement Ordinance
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          4-47                                 Land Use
July 18, 2002

          •   Planned Unit Development Ordinance (zoning)
          •   Sign Ordinance (zoning)
          •   Site and architectural review procedure and criteria (zoning)
The City’s current regulatory framework does not provide for the mixed-use and performance-
driven land use districts established by this element. The first priority of the ordinance and
regulation review is the creation of new mixed-use zoning districts that are consistent with the
policies and intent of the proposed land use districts, including the following:
          •   Neighborhood Core (including commercial and residential sub-districts)
          •   Neighborhood Residential
          •   Existing City Districts near the Sacramento River (Downtown/Waterfront and
              Historic Residential)
          •   Special Districts
LU- 8              REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement and refine its Redevelopment Plan. Redevelopment
policies will be designed to make the downtown and waterfront areas more economically
viable, preserve their historic character, encourage a more pedestrian-friendly atmosphere, and
integrate access to the Sacramento River waterfront from surrounding development. The City
will coordinate the Waterfront Master Plan with redevelopment efforts. (See the Economic
Development element for further discussion.)
LU-9               STATE HISTORICAL BUILDING CODE
                   (Existing)
The State Historical Building Code is Part 8 of Title 24 (State Building Standards Code) and
applies to all qualified historic structures, districts, and sites designated under federal, state,
and local authority. The code provides alternative building regulations for the rehabilitation,
preservation, restoration, or relocation of structures designated as qualified historic buildings.
Enforcement of this code will help to maintain the historic character of the downtown and
avoid incompatible design and construction.
LU-10              DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
                   (Proposed)
As appropriate, the City will use the development agreement process established under State
law and the Zoning Ordinance. This process provides for specific requirements of the
developers of the major new neighborhoods to ensure compliance with the policies of this
General Plan and provides for other benefits to the City in exchange for land use entitlement
certainty for developers and property owners.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     4-48                                     Land Use
July 18, 2002

LU-11              AIRPORT/LAND USE COMPATIBILITY PLAN
                   (Existing)
The Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (Solano County Airport Land Use Commission, 1988)
sets forth the criteria that the will use in evaluating land use plans and proposed development
in the vicinity of the public-use airports. The airport/land use safety compatibility criteria are
used to minimize risks associated with the operation of aircraft to and from the airport. These
criteria are intended to minimize risk to people on the ground and in the aircraft, largely
through density reduction and maximizing the amount of open land within the vicinity of the
airport.
LU-12              AIRPORT MASTER PLAN UPDATE
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement and update the Airport Master Plan, as needed. The airport
is both an economic development benefit as a capital facility that many communities do not
have and a location for businesses needing or desiring to be near the airport facilities. A 12-acre
business park and locations for commercial and industrial businesses (Fixed Base Operators
[FBOs]) are included on airport grounds. The Master Plan provides for these businesses and
their necessary support facilities.
LU-13              DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION
                   (Existing)
The Delta Protection Commission was charged with preparation of a regional land use and
resource management plan for the Primary Zone of the Delta, which was adopted in February
1995. Rio Vista’s general plan is required to conform to the Commission’s regional plan. The
Commission’s plan acknowledges the planned construction of the Northwest Wastewater
Treatment Plant in the Primary Zone near the airport—the final environmental document for
the wastewater treatment plant was approved prior to the Commission’s adoption of the plan.
LU-14              TRAILS AND PATHWAYS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City will reference the Trails and Pathways Map (Figure 8-4) in the Circulation & Mobility
element), to ensure that new development will, wherever feasible, include trails and pathways
that connect to, or become a part of, the pedestrian and bicycle system shown on the map. The
Park and Recreation Commission will periodically review the map and advise staff and the City
Council on needed improvements. The City will require design review of any development
within or alongside of a proposed trail as identified on the adopted Trails and Pathways Map.
LU-15              RIO VISTA WATERFRONT PLAN
                   (Existing)
The Rio Vista Waterfront Plan (David Evans & Associates, Santina and Thompson,
Singer/Fukishima, 2001) prepared in March 2001, addresses the public access and development
potential of the downtown waterfront. This portion of the waterfront includes the area bisected
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          4-49                                  Land Use
July 18, 2002

from north to south by Front Street, along the Sacramento River edge from City Hall to the
Helen Madere Bridge (referred to as the Rio Vista Bridge).
The City will undertake a major planning effort, not only for the waterfront but also for much of
the rest of the historic downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. The result will be a
Waterfront Specific Plan that will establish land uses and design guidelines for private
development, public facility and infrastructure needs, funding sources and a Capital
Improvement Program for the entire downtown. (See related implementing action ED-12 in the
Economic Development element.)
LU-16              RIO VISTA DOWNTOWN MARKETING AND DESIGN STUDY
                   (Existing)
To implement Land Use element in a manner that will strengthen the overall health and quality
of the downtown, the City has prepared the Rio Vista Downtown Marketing and Design Study
(Jeffrey Eichenfeld & Associates, Aja Preliasco, David Evans, Planning & Design, 1999). The
goal of the study is to identify activities that will make downtown a fun, attractive, and
entertaining place where residents shop more frequently and visitors stay longer. It includes
marketing recommendations, business retention and attraction strategies, building and
streetscape designs for a downtown “demonstration block”, architectural design guidelines,
and recommendations for implementing these activities.

July 18, 2002

H. APPENDIX 4-1: Esperson and Riverwalk Concept Plans
Two significant properties, the Esperson and Riverwalk parcels, are critical to the future of Rio
Vista and are referenced in several Elements of this document. Proponents of both properties
have submitted conceptual plans that provide a land use and circulation framework that define
the general direction of the desired development and future entitlements. These planning
concepts for the respective properties were presented to the General Plan Steering committee
and are depicted in the maps attached in Appendix 4-1. Future entitlement applications will be
expected to adhere to these general “frameworks” and to further incorporate the principles,
policies, implementation measures and design guidelines established by the various Elements
of this General Plan, into the specific project features and designs that will be the subject of the
applications. The purpose of including these Exhibits into the General Plan document is to
provide the following direction to future decision makers considering proposed entitlement
applications for these properties:
1. Plans and maps that reflect the general land uses and circulation framework indicated in the
     Exhibits should be deemed to be consistent with the Land Use and Circulation Element
     policies with respect to general land uses and patterns of circulation.
2.              Specific design issues and conformance with other policies and provisions of the various
                General Plan Elements such as Community Character and Design, Open Space and
                Recreation, Resource Conservation and Management and all others, can not be determined
                until such lime as specific applications, grading and development plans, proposed
                agreements, environmental analyses and other detailed information are submitted for
                review.

Chapter 5                    Community Character & Design
A.        Introduction
“Community character” refers to the physical characteristics that lend shape, form, and identity
to a community. Concepts such as “small town,” “quality of life,” “living environment,”
“neighborhood,” and “community” are, to a large extent, expressions of familiar physical
characteristics—landmarks, streets, buildings, parks, and natural features that create a unique
identity in every community. “Community design” or “urban design” refers to the architectural
and engineering design principles that create the shape, form, and appearance of both new
development and the redevelopment of existing districts and neighborhoods. Community design
principles and policies are intended to ensure that the community character of the future reflects
the vision and goals of residents and decision makers.

B.        Purpose and Authority
Community character and design are critical to the decisions that determine the shape and form
of growth and development. This element is not one of the seven “mandatory” elements under
California law governing general plans. However, many general plans statewide contain design
elements and policies. Aesthetics and design have long been recognized by California law and
upheld by the courts as legitimate public policy issues within the regulatory authority of
municipalities.
As described below, community character and design issues are integral to implementation of
the vision articulated by the community in the General Plan Town Hall meetings, upon which
this General Plan is based. The policies and implementing measures in this element reinforce
and complement those in other elements, particularly Land Use (physical character of the
various land use districts), Circulation & Mobility (street and block design standards), Public
Facilities & Services (park and recreation siting, and access within neighborhoods and districts),
Open Space & Recreation (environmental design), and Resource Conservation & Management
(conservation and management of sensitive local resources).         The community design goals,
policies, and implementing actions articulated below reinforce each element in the relationship
of their subject matter to the desired physical form and characteristics of Rio Vista throughout
the planning period (2000 – 2020).

C.        The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
Preservation of the existing physical characteristics that define Rio Vista and the desire for new
growth to reflect those characteristics are primary issues in the community. The community
vision and planning principles that most directly relate to the Community Character & Design
element are listed below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     Farmland and nature are important elements of the community. A clear edge between urban
     development and agriculture should be maintained.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.
     New development should create complete neighborhoods rather than a series of subdivisions that are
     indistinguishable from those in other communities.
     Parking lots should not dominate street frontage, public spaces, or buildings.
     Community identity should be strengthened with attractive entryways on Highway 12, Main Street,
     and River Road.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
      The existing downtown and waterfront should be strengthened and retained as the central focus of
     the community. Cultural, civic, entertainment, and specialty retail uses—and supporting uses and
     activities should be located in the downtown and adjacent areas.
     Redevelopment of Rio Vista’s downtown and waterfront should create economic vitality and an
     atmosphere for walking and shopping. Historic building facades should be restored, and new projects
     should be linked to their surroundings.
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
     Commercial development along the Highway 12 corridor should not displace or preempt investment
     from the downtown or along the existing developed corridor.
PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES THAT DEFINE RIO VISTA
     New development should accommodate and showcase natural features as community amenities. New
     development should respect the contours of hillsides, valleys, and drainageways as important
     recognizable features of Rio Vista. Key hilltops to be preserved for public use and vistas should be
     identified.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          5-3                        Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002

     The community should seek to connect the existing town to new developments and the Sacramento
     River waterfront by an extensive and interconnecting trail system. The natural drainageways, hills,
     and sensitive vegetation areas should be the basis for designing such a system.
ENSURE EASE OF MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, AND BUSINESSES
     Accessible, easy, and convenient circulation systems for autos, pedestrians, and bicyclists alike should
     be designed into all new developments.
     Convenient and accessible truck routes for delivery and shipping of goods and services should be
     provided, while minimizing the impact to residential neighborhoods and sensitive districts.
     The development of the connecting trail system suggested by the above principles should be pursued
     as a key circulation facility, as well as a natural resource opportunity.
     Many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance of each other. This design allows
     independence and safe movement for those who do not drive, especially seniors and young people.
     Schools should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them. Interconnected
     networks of streets should be designed to encourage walking and reduce the number and length of
     automobile trips.
     The needs of automobiles and pedestrians should be balanced. It is a fact of modern life that
     development must adequately accommodate automobiles. However, pedestrian accessibility should
     not be sacrificed or made less important than automobile accessibility.
     Streets, thoroughfares, and public spaces should be:
     •    Safe, comfortable, attractive, and interesting to the pedestrian and motorist alike; and
     •    Free of barriers and designed with multiple connections to various parts of the community.

D.        Setting
Rio Vista as a community is unique in the Bay Area and in the Sacramento Delta. Its position on
the edge of the Sacramento River—tucked into the Montezuma Hills—with long views to Mt.
Diablo and the Helene Madere Bridge (commonly known as the Rio Vista Bridge) from State
Route 12 (commonly referred to as Highway 12) are distinct physical features of the City. The
historic drawbridge spanning the Sacramento River is known throughout northern California
and is visible from miles away. The tugs and barges that tie up at the river's edge, and the
enormous freighters that move up and down the river, add to Rio Vista's distinctive character.
The downtown that still maintains its historic feel and the shaded, walkable residential areas
contribute to Rio Vista’s identity.
The Montezuma Hills, occupying the majority of the area south of Highway 12 to the western
City boundary, are the highest lands in Rio Vista. These rolling grasslands offer outstanding
views to the existing neighborhoods, the river and bridge, and Mt. Diablo. The hills capture the
cooling breezes blowing up from the Sacramento River and, in combination with the valleys,
support a significant raptor population and related ecosystem.
When in Rio Vista, one has the sense of being in a special place. It is not highly suburbanized or
modernized. One can smell the river and feel the cooling breezes blowing up from the Bay. The
community is imbued with an honest small-town American charm. Activities such as the
annual Bass Derby, football games at the high school, and breakfast at the bakery on Main
Street reinforce the character and identity of the community. The urban structure and a
collection of identifiable features add to Rio Vista’s distinct character as a settlement.
HISTORIC CHARACTER AND DEVELOPMENT
The original urban plan of Rio Vista is similar to the Spanish colonial design principles referred
to as the “Law of the Indies.” The character of the street and alley grid, the public square sited
one block off Main Street, and the orientation of the streets—so that a line connecting north and
south on the compass diagonally bisects a city block—are similar to “Law of the Indies” design
principles followed by the Spanish during the colonial era.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     5-5                         Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002

The City retains its original urban structure—a grid system comprised of 250-foot square blocks,
with 20-foot-wide alleys bisecting the block in both directions. The grid is oriented 45 degrees
west of north, with a strong orientation to the edge of the Sacramento River. Main Street leads
directly to a landing and ferry dock at the edge of the river, and a public square is located one
block south of Main Street. The original road and alley structure provide an accessible and
pedestrian-friendly urban environment, where residential neighborhoods are well connected to
the commercial activities along Main Street and the river edge. The ease of movement
throughout the downtown core is a function of scale, combined with the road and alley grid
that allows an opportunity to change direction every half block. These numerous intersections
and rights-of-way contribute to the well-integrated residential and commercial activities.
Today, as in the early years of Rio Vista, the primary commercial activities are located along
Main Street, the edge of the Sacramento River, and Highway 12.
By 1903, the majority of the original urban plan was complete, and the grid extended to its
current limits. The original grid supported the modest growth of the town between the early
1900s and the end of World War II. After the war, several annexations were approved that
began a process of urban expansion influenced by the widespread use of the automobile.
Highway 12 created a barrier between the developing residential areas to the north and the
existing urban core along Main Street. Residential development after World War II was oriented
toward the automobile. Developers often stretched blocks into long rectangular patterns to
reduce road construction and increase lot yield. Some cul-de-sacs appeared, and the character
and inter-connectedness of the urban structure began to change, although the new
neighborhoods remained relatively compact and well connected internally. The relatively few
neighborhoods that were developed in Rio Vista between 1950 and 1990 are isolated from older
areas, largely due to the bisection of the community by Highway 12. The edge of this pre-1990
community remains well defined in most areas.
The traditional grid provides the shortest trip lengths and the largest number of route choices
(and therefore the most convenient pedestrian travel) of any street layout, due to the multitude
of interconnections available within a 250– to 300-foot block length. Like most American
communities, Rio Vista began to deviate from the traditional grid street system after World
War II. A return to the pre-1900s grid is not necessarily the solution for Rio Vista or any
developing American city. The future may lie in a hybrid of development patterns that seeks to
balance the need for connectedness with current development strategies and consumer
interests.
Conventional suburban neighborhood streets also have changed in character and shape. A
typical historic residential street section was from 24 to 28 feet curb-to-curb, with a “parkway
strip” or “tree lawn” between the sidewalk and the property line. Typically, street trees were
planted in the parkways, providing shade and definition to the street edge and separating
pedestrian from vehicular traffic. The typical post-war street is at least 36 feet wide at the curbs,
with a “monolithic” sidewalk that is adjacent to the curb and no parkway. If street trees are
planted, they occur in public utility easements or front yards, where they are much less likely to
survive. Most modern neighborhoods do not produce the tree canopy that was commonplace in
historic residential neighborhoods. Notable exceptions are the 1950s neighborhoods north of
Highway 12. Here, monolithic sidewalks exist but street trees were planted close to the walks; a

number of mature trees survived to the present. Figure 5-1 shows the difference in lot and
building patterns since 1900.
RECENT CHANGES TO DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
In 1991, the City approved several large annexations and development agreements. These
annexations expanded the City’s undeveloped area by approximately 2,500 acres. The locations
of these annexations and development project boundaries are shown on Figure 5-2. These
developments were approved for conventional suburban curvilinear street layouts and design,
typical of the Bay Area in the 1980s.
          ESPERSON PROPERTY AND RIVER WALK
Two of the approved annexations are large properties immediately surrounding the pre-1990
development edge—neither is developed. The largest of these is the Esperson property, located
south of Highway 12 and bordering both the newer and the historic neighborhoods to the west
and south, respectively. The other large parcel, known as the River Walk property, borders the
post-war neighborhoods on the north side of Highway 12 and is a potential link between the
existing neighborhoods and Trilogy. Both properties extend from the existing urban edge to
Church and Amerada Roads, which is the location of the Neighborhood Core District described
in the Land Use element. Both projects have conceptual plans included in the Land Use element
of this General Plan.
          TRILOGY
Trilogy is an “active-adult” (senior) community, originally called Summerset, and is the largest
of the parcels targeted for development and the only one developed so far. Located about
1 mile from the westernmost development edge of the pre-1990 community and extending from
the west side of Church Road to Liberty Island Road, the development’s character is defined by
its stately gated entrance, private streets, a central loop and curvilinear street pattern, a public
golf course, and recreational amenities for use by Trilogy residents. The primary site consists of
approximately 800 acres, with an approved development agreement allowing up to
3,600 single-family homes and multi-family or assisted-care units.
Elsewhere in the vicinity of Trilogy are commercial businesses to serve area residents. A 15±-
acre site at the northwest corner of Highway 12 and Church Road is planned for a
neighborhood-community shopping center; service commercial and warehouse uses are
planned on the northeast side of Trilogy adjacent to Airport Road.
          GIBBS RANCH
Originally approved as part of the Summerset/Trilogy project, the 300-acre Gibbs Ranch may
be developed with as many as 1,129 senior dwellings or 959 conventional single-family units.
The property is restricted to a great extent by the airport overflight zone in the southwestern
third of the parcel.

Allowable uses under the Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUP) include a golf course,
other open space uses and industrial and warehouse (see discussions in the Land Use and Safety &
Noise elements). The City has approved development agreements for predominantly residential
projects with some neighborhood and community-serving commercial uses. Included are
significant areas of low-intensity open space or golf course uses due to floodplain and airport
flight zone constraints.
Unlike areas to the east, Gibbs Ranch (along with Trilogy) is relatively flat and unrestricted,
except for some floodplain areas around Liberty Island and Canright Roads. Most of the
undeveloped lands are still in grazing or dry land agricultural uses, pending future
development.
          BRANN RANCH
The 300-acre Brann Ranch, which lies west of Liberty Island Road and north of Highway 12, is
also approved as an unrestricted residential development (i.e., not senior housing). The project
was approved in the early 1990s as a conventional suburban, predominantly single-family
subdivision with curvilinear streets—development has not commenced to date. Development
is restricted by the airport, but less so than for the Gibbs Ranch. A relatively large open space
area is provided that is primarily floodplain. A small creek channel meanders through the
middle of the parcel, adjacent to Canright Road. The approved tentative map includes a
conventional, modern street layout that features long blocks, curvilinear pattern, and standard
widths.
          HOMECOMING
A smaller subdivision, known as Homecoming, is located north of Highway 12 and River Walk;
east of Trilogy; and adjacent to the Rio Vista Business Park (former airport). The subdivision is
characterized by conventional, post-war streets and contains approximately 290 single-family
homes that are near completion.
          NATURAL GAS WELL SITES
A number of natural gas well sites exist throughout the undeveloped portion of the Planning
Area—most are located on the Esperson property. Several wells are currently in production in
or around this area south of Highway 12. Presently, the gas well sites in Trilogy are not in
production. Until they are drilled and begin producing, the sites are being used for private
open space facilities to serve neighborhood open space needs. Gibbs Ranch also has five such
sites, several of which are located in the residential areas and provide the same open space
opportunities. Brann Ranch has only a few gas well sites, most of which are located in areas
proposed for larger open space uses.

E.        Outlook
Rio Vista's relationship to the land is at the center of its character as a city. The environmentally
sensitive and beautiful Montezuma Hills, which roll through much of the Planning Area,
should be the primary shaper of the community’s future form. To both protect and develop the
landscape of the Montezuma Hills is the fundamental purpose and challenge for which this
element was developed. Figure 5-3 identifies the general locations of key hilltops, valleys, and
ridgelines.
LANDS EAST OF CHURCH AND AMERADA ROADS
This portion of the Planning Area is the highest and most steeply sloped land within the city
limits. The Montezuma Hills extend into these lands and display their most significant features,
including natural drainageways, hillsides, and view opportunities. The preservation of
landforms can create places for extensive views, natural drainage flows, public open space, and
protected habitat. The edge between the existing (pre-1990) urban neighborhoods and this
portion of the Planning Area has few road stubs or open space connections to roads that could
be used for pedestrian, bicycle, or emergency access. This element and the Circulation &
Mobility element seek to take advantage of the few opportunities to connect the existing
community to future development. Hilltops create opportunities for visual connections to the
existing urban center and regional landscape. The use of natural gas well sites for open space
amenities, implementation of a comprehensive parks and trails system, and the application of
street standards to achieve the desired balance between motorized and non-motorized travel
are objectives that can be achieved to help meet community character goals for this portion of
the Planning Area.
The system of natural gas wells and transmission line easements is both an opportunity for
public open space and a constraint to development. The gas well drill sites require a 150-foot-
radius clear zone around the well. Although the drill site itself is typically a fenced enclosure,
40 by 40 feet or less, the clear zone constrains development and provides potential for public
open space. The even distribution of the well sites within the study area presents an
opportunity to develop an equal distribution of neighborhood parks with convenient access to
surrounding neighborhoods. To provide sufficient community or active park space that meets
park and recreation standards (for example, for regulation fields), these clear zones will need to
be expanded or supplemented in various areas. Although the gas transmission line easements
are usable as public trail corridors or perhaps street locations, the easements divide the area into
oddly shaped sections that are more difficult to subdivide. It may be possible to move these
transmission lines as a part of the development process.

 Rio Vista General Plan 2001 5-12 Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002
Opportunities exist in the area for a diverse public park and trail system. The scale of the plan
area, the distribution of the natural gas system, and the location of the main drainage corridor,
create an opportunity to enhance the recreational potential of the site and provide an important
addition to the entire City’s circulation system. The parks and trails can connect the existing
urban center and the Planning Area, and aid in the preservation of habitat. The Circulation &
Mobility and Open Space & Recreation elements identify a pedestrian and bicycle trail and
pathway system, linking the Sacramento River to existing neighborhoods and downtown, as
well as future neighborhoods, parks, and commercial centers. These opportunities are further
developed in the Land Use, Resource Conservation & Management, and Public Facilities &
Services elements.
LANDS WEST OF CHURCH AND AMERADA ROADS
The lands west of Church and Amerada Roads are generally flatter and have less sensitive
natural resource areas than the lands east of Church Road. Only a small portion of the lands
south of Highway 12 are within the city limits or urban growth boundary (UGB) (see the
Planning Constraints & Boundaries element). The lands south of the highway therefore are
expected to remain in agricultural uses for the duration of the planning period. Lands north of
the highway that are within the UGB consist of Sub-Planning Areas 4 and 5 on the Rio Vista
General Plan Area and Sub-Planning Areas Map (see the discussion on “Planning Areas” in the
Land Use element). Sub-Planning Area 4 consists of the 820±–acre Marks Ranch, the site of the
Trilogy senior housing development and commercial lands, plus the 320-acre each Gibbs and
Brann Ranches—expected to be developed as family residential neighborhoods. The Brann and
Gibbs Ranches should be designed and developed to function in an integrated manner. An
elementary school and community park site, as well as potential employment, retail and
commercial development, and other community facilities will be located there. (See Land Use,
Housing, Economic Development, Open Space & Recreation, and Public Facilities & Services elements,
respectively.) Sub-Planning Area 5 consists of the airport, public and restricted lands, and the
future Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant site (see the Planning Constraints & Boundaries,
Land Use, and Safety & Noise elements).
The same conditions, opportunities, and expectations exist in Sub-Planning Area 4 as in the
lands east of Church and Amerada Roads. The entire area contains pre-sited existing and future
natural gas wells and mineral reserve areas that provide both challenges and opportunities for
neighborhood open space and landscaping. By virtue of its private streets and recreation
system, the Trilogy project uses and maintains these sites as neighborhood open spaces through
the homeowners’ association.
This area is expected to utilize the same neighborhood street system and standards as the area
east of Church and Amerada Roads, in family housing neighborhoods, where public streets are
expected. Private streets may vary from public streets in most locations.
HIGHWAY 12 CORRIDOR
Through much of Rio Vista, Highway 12 is a high-speed, two-lane roadway without pedestrian
access, turn lanes, or road shoulders to provide a measure of safety. The existing commercial
uses adjacent to the highway lack adequate landscaping, traffic or turn movement controls,
pedestrian crossings, and even sidewalks in numerous locations. Handicapped access to
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    5-13                     Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002

sidewalks is practically nonexistent. Although the highway is the City’s “front door” and near
Rio Vista’s historic downtown and waterfront, few linkages connect the downtown residential
and commercial uses and the highway commercial “strip.”
During the series of Town Hall meetings that initiated the General Plan effort, Highway 12 was
identified as one of the most significant concerns of Rio Vista residents—particularly in the
areas of safety, access, and more efficient traffic movement. The General Plan update process
also has identified a strong interest in providing a pedestrian and bicycle trail and pathway
system, linking the Sacramento River to existing neighborhoods and downtown, as well as to
future neighborhoods, parks, and commercial centers. Highway 12 often acts as a barrier
between the two “halves” of Rio Vista; pedestrian crossings are particularly hazardous. This
hazard poses one of the most serious obstacles to the realization of a trail system linkage. A plan
must be developed for crossing Highway 12 at key locations between signalized intersections.
The environmental and aesthetic character of the Highway 12 corridor varies in different places
throughout the City. From the east, the character is still largely rural as one enters the city
limits; rural character is found on the south frontage, with a rural-suburban design on the north
frontage next to Summerset/Trilogy. Continuing east beyond Church Road, Highway 12
traverses a series of hills and drainages before reaching Drouin Drive near the edge of the
developed area. From Drouin Drive to the bridge, the existing highway commercial district
dominates both sides.
Highway 12 will continue to serve as the principal bicycle corridor, as shown in the Solano
Countywide Bicycle Master Plan. The Circulation & Mobility element of this General Plan
shows this bicycle lane on its pedestrian and bicycle trail and pathway system (Trail and
Pathways Map). Currently, the community is not linked by bicycle paths. As development
proceeds, the City intends to provide trail connections along Highway 12 from the Sacramento
River to existing neighborhoods and downtown, as well as to future neighborhoods, parks, and
commercial centers.
CHARACTER OF STREETS
Modern street standards typically are oriented toward safe and efficient automobile travel and
easy emergency vehicle access. Generally, street standards are less concerned with pedestrians,
bicycles, street character, and microclimatic issues. Because streets occupy the majority of the
public domain, they can be designed to serve the whole community. Traditional (narrower
roadways, parkways, and street trees) rather than modern street standards should be used
wherever possible. Private streets may vary from public streets in some locations. The
Circulation & Mobility element establishes a performance-based public street system for future
neighborhoods. Within the performance-based street system, layout can vary considerably,
based on desired density or aesthetic and engineering issues. The “grain” (the overall urban
character or the combined impact of block, street, lot, and house size) of the existing urban
center is a model for the desired grain of the future neighborhoods. The Circulation & Mobility
element includes a full discussion of street standards.

DOWNTOWN/WATERFRONT AND HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Rio Vista’s historic urban structure is a point of reference as the City grows and develops new
streets and neighborhoods, particularly for those lands immediately adjacent to the pre-1990
urban edge. It is important to identify what works best about the existing community and how
that knowledge can be applied to current issues and concerns. It is also important to emphasize
that even Rio Vista’s postwar neighborhoods exhibit several of the distinguishing characteristics
of the historic pattern—they are compact, and generally grid-based neighborhoods. Some of
these neighborhoods also retain the traditional tree canopy. Only the largest and most recent
project, Summerset/Trilogy deviates significantly from this context—in terms of its isolation
from other neighborhoods and the downtown, and in the character of the community (i.e., a
gated, largely self-contained community that provides recreational facilities to its occupants).
The goals and policies of this element seek a balance between successful historical patterns and
the realities of current development trends—emphasizing the need for connection between new
areas and old, and building on the desirable characteristics of the existing community.
Figure 5-4 shows the historical development pattern of Rio Vista. The structure of the City,
particularly its historic core, is clear and easy to travel. The historic grid is oriented to the River
and facilitates access to its banksMain Street leads directly to the River’s edge.
Commercial activities are organized along Main Street and the river, and the grid provides easy
access to the adjacent residential areas. The recognition of landmarks also adds to the structure
of the City. The continuity of the river edge, the historic drawbridge, the landform and
gradients up from the river, and the panoramic views of Mt. Diablo are all part of the structure
of the City.
Figure 5-5 shows the historic lot patterns in the historic residential neighborhoods. Most of
these neighborhoods contain mixed uses, with single-family homes, duplexes, small multi-
family units, civic buildings, churches, and schools existing side-by-side—often within the same
block. Conventional zoning standards do not fit well in these neighborhoods. The Land Use
element takes the first step to correcting this problem by recognizing existing neighborhood
characteristics through the Existing City Districts. (See Figures 4-2 and 4-3 in the Land Use
element.)
The City has recently completed its City of Rio Vista Downtown Marketing and Design Study
(Jeffrey Eichenfeld & Associates et al., 1999) that recommended specific streetscape
improvements along Main Street and historic building rehabilitations. Grants totaling $900,000
recently have been confirmed from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)
Transportation for Livable Communities (TLC) Program and the Solano Transportation
Authority (STA) to implement the streetscape improvements along Main Street. Completion is
scheduled for 2001. The project will consist of street trees, lighting, pavement reconstruction,
street furniture, and curb improvements. Design guidelines for the historic structures currently
are being formulated from these recommendations.
The downtown waterfront south of the Rio Vista Bridge provides an opportunity for public
access and redevelopment. The areas between the river and Front Street, and from the Bridge to
Main Street, are currently the subject of a design and development planning study that will
produce a recommended development plan for the area.

F.        Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions
Community Character & Design goals, policies, implementing actions, and design criteria stem
from, and are directly intended to achieve, the related Rio Vista Principles and vision
statements described in Section C above. Because policies of this element primarily are
concerned with design, implementing actions are presented in the form of design criteria. These
criteria are specific design statements
intended to give direction for carrying out the
policies with respect to various site and
building issues.            Many of the criteria
eventually will be incorporated into a
separate design standards or guidelines
document. Because the design criteria are
consistent with the goals and policies of the
General Plan, they can be used as a tool by
staff and the Planning Commission to
evaluate new development proposals.
The Community Character & Design element focuses on 15 policy areas:
          •   Environmental design.
          •   Entryways, identity features, and focal points in new developments.
          •   Highway 12.
          •   Streets and blocks.
          •   Residential housing.
          •   Ancillary or second units (carriage units).
          •   Multi-family attached housing.
          •   Nonresidential building siting, orientation, and access.
          •   Neighborhood core district.
          •   Highway and convenience commercial.
          •   Business park and airport commercial.
          •   Lighting and signage.
          •   Existing city districts.
          •   Reconstruction and new additions.
          •   Rehabilitation and remodeling.
The implementing actions associated with each policy are described fully at the end of this
element.
ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN
Rio Vista is a visually interesting and vibrant city, with its built environment enveloped in a
naturally beautiful one. Extending along the banks of the Sacramento River, the City’s riverfront
remains natural in areas that extend beyond its working waterfront and active recreation spots.
The hilltops of Rio Vista, dotted with natural gas wells, are familiar landmarks that are open to
outstanding views and connect the existing historic community to the larger regional landscape.

The valleys form an effective natural drainage system that manages storm runoff and provides
corridors for public trails and wildlife. Preservation of key hilltops and valleys allows this
natural system to become a useful and beneficial public resource, benefiting the overall health
of the community.
The preservation and development of habitat is central to a healthy, low-maintenance open
space system. Natural drainage corridors have a greater carrying capacity. By slowing runoff,
these corridors reduce erosion and the risk of flooding. Native, drought-tolerant plants fit the
character of the landscape, reduce maintenance and irrigation costs, and contribute to the
habitat value of the open space system.
Goals, policies, and implementation measures, including design criteria, that relate to these key
resources and the opportunities they represent, are stated mainly in three Elements: Chapter 5,
Community Character and Design; Chapter 9, Open Space and Recreation; and Chapter 10,
Resource Conservation and Management.

              network that serves the whole
              community.
ENTRYWAYS, IDENTITY FEATURES, AND FOCAL POINTS IN NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Rio Vista gains its identity largely through the views that are perceived by its residents and
visitors to the City. The community recognizes the importance of its identity and is committed
to creating a special environment. Several distinctive features define Rio Vista, such as the Rio
Vista Bridge, the waterfront, the historic downtown, and the City’s traditional neighborhoods.
These features, along with numerous other landmarks and unique areas, can be preserved and
enhanced through a comprehensive approach to community design.
The City can continue to build a strong, appealing image by providing policy direction that
emphasizes enhancing the community’s inherent physical qualities and values. The policies
presented below will facilitate creation of a memorable City image by defining the entries to Rio
Vista, preserving City landmarks, and encouraging distinctive private development. An
opportunities map for community entryways, identity features, and landmarks is shown in
Figure 5-6.
GOAL 5.6           TO CREATE A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY IDENTITY.
 Policy                                                 Implementing Action

              commercial areas in the Existing City
              and Neighborhood Core Districts.
 5.7.B        The City shall ensure that structures at   CD-5    Community Design Criteria
              corners of major intersections,
              dominant buildings in a cluster or
              complex, and central gathering places
              become community landmarks. The
              City shall ensure that these structures
              are designed to provide definition and
              identity to the community and
              individual neighborhood through the
              use of significant building features and

HIGHWAY 12
Highway 12 is the principal corridor through the City of Rio Vista. This highway serves as the
entrance from the east—over the Rio Vista Bridge, and from the west— through the Montezuma
Hills. Since most travelers pass through the City on Highway 12, facilitating well-designed
development along this corridor is key to establishing a desirable community image.

              sensitive areas adjacent to Highway 12.
STREETS AND BLOCKS
The guiding principle of the City’s circulation system is linking the community. Streets should
be designed to unite the areas targeted for new development with the existing urban center. The
street system should safely and efficiently link the neighborhoods, public facilities, and
commercial uses of the Plan area in a manner that will serve the entire community.
Some of the older neighborhoods of Rio Vista are good models for street design. Traditional
grid patterns, alleys to the rear of residences, and the scale of streets promote a pedestrian-
friendly environment while also allowing efficient movement of motorized vehicles throughout
a neighborhood.
Deciduous street trees create shade in summer, keep the pavement cool, and allow solar access
during colder winter months. Trees soften the street and define corridors of use. Street trees are
essential in making streets beautiful and livable.
These traditional neighborhood street design concepts are a key component of the General
Plan’s vision for future development. To the extent practicable, the City seeks to preserve and
promote this circulation concept throughout the urbanized area.

RESIDENTIAL HOUSING
The community characteristics of the historic residential neighborhoods (i.e., their overall
proportions and the combined impact of block, street, lot, and house size) are a model for the
desired character of the new growth areas. The placement and orientation of residential
buildings on a lot or building site and their relationship to the public street are crucial to
achieving the City’s desired community character.
“Conventional” or modern subdivision design includes placement of the garage in front of the
house toward the street, with the rest of the structure behind or to the side of the garage. Often,
the garage accounts for more than half the visible house frontage or lot width, and sometimes as
much as 80 percent or more. The garage thus becomes the primary visual element of the
streetscape, with the living areas becoming secondary. This “conventional” garage placement
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        5-28                  Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002

reduces the driveway length, forcing cars to be parked closer to the street, adding further to
automobile dominance of the streetscape.
Coupling these features with the widths for two- and three-car garages and driveways—in
addition to wide streets—creates an environment that limits pedestrian comfort or convenience
and discourages street use for any purpose other than driving or parking motor vehicles. The
public realm of street and neighborhood become remote and out of sight; family living and
recreation activities take place behind closed doors and in back yards, away from the street.
This design reduces community interaction and contact with neighbors.
On blocks with relatively small lots, garages should be recessed or pushed back at least 15 feet
behind the front living area or porch so that cars parked in the driveway do not dominate the
streetscape. By locating the garage toward the rear of the site and by reducing the driveway cut
to one lane, the continuity of street edges and the public landscape are enhanced. Pulling the
house forward on the site and recessing the garage improves street character and increases the
private rear yard area.
A shift away from conventional residential subdivision design toward more traditional
neighborhood design will help to promote community interaction, increase efficiency in
movement throughout the community, and retain the City’s small-town flavor. The General
Plan’s policies and design guidelines for residential housing are intended to guide development
in this direction.

ANCILLARY OR SECOND UNITS (CARRIAGE UNITS)
Ancillary units are second dwelling units on the same lot as a single-family home, variously
known as “carriage houses” and “granny flats.” Carriage houses are ancillary units, typically
built over detached garages. Carriage houses and other ancillary units help to provide
affordable housing opportunities. These units support both pedestrian activity and transit use,
by increasing the overall density of an area while maintaining its single-family character and
ownership patterns. “Granny units” can be rented to offset housing costs for the primary unit,
they can provide needed space for teens or elderly family members, and they can furnish
additional studio or office space. As a source of affordable rental housing, these units avoid the

Multi-family attached housing may include more than one family
unit in the same building, occupied without restrictions on
property ownership or the relationship of occupants.

NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDING SITING, ORIENTATION, AND ACCESS
Siting and orientation are as important for nonresidential buildings as for residential structures.
Proper placement of office and commercial structures in relation to the surrounding
development and roadways can facilitate pedestrian activity and reduce dependence on the
automobile. In traditional neighborhoods and downtowns, the placement of businesses on the
street—adjacent to a wide sidewalk—encourages easy pedestrian access from nearby
neighborhoods and businesses, as well as access by vehicle. By contrast, modern centers
typically turn unattractive “back doors” to the street and sidewalk, while their storefronts face
internally toward the parking lots. They are located at intersections of arterials or major
collector streets with few, if any, direct connections to adjacent neighborhoods. Even though
strip centers and individual commercial uses frequently abut each other, direct connections do

not exist between them. Consequently, cars are forced to back out onto the frontage street in
order to access an adjacent center.
The General Plan policies and design criteria recognize that modern commercial centers need
high visibility, necessitating locations at major intersections. However, the Nonresidential
Design Criteria encourage the internal creation of a “Main Street” appearance, requiring
building fronts to be oriented toward at least one street or plaza and away from parking lots.
Linkages for both vehicles and pedestrians are to be created between commercial uses and
residential neighborhoods, multi-family buildings, and plazas.

EXISTING CITY DISTRICTS
As described in the Land Use element, the Existing City Districts land use designation includes
the Downtown/Waterfront, Historic Residential, Multi-Family Residential, and Edgewater
Neighborhood. The City envisions the commercial core area
within this district to be developed in a manner consistent with
the recommendations of the Rio Vista Downtown Marketing and
Design Study (Jeffrey Eichenfeld & Associates et al., 1999) The
plan emphasizes attractive storefronts in a pedestrian-friendly
environment.
GOAL 5.16          TO DEVELOP AN ATTRACTIVE COMMERCIAL CORE WITHIN EXISTING CITY
                   DISTRICTS THAT ENCOURAGES PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY AND PROVIDES MULTI-
                   MODAL ACCESS FROM NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS AND BUSINESS CENTERS.
 Policy                                                  Implementing Action
 5.16.A       In order to foster pedestrian activity     CD-12   Neighborhood Core District
              and linkages, the City shall require that          Design Criteria
              commercial buildings either are            CD-13   Downtown Marketing and
              oriented to an adjacent street or create           Design Study
              an internal street orientation.
 5.16.B       To the extent feasible, the City shall     CD-12   Neighborhood Core District
              ensure that commercial parking lots are            Design Criteria
              located to the rear of buildings rather    CD-13   Downtown Marketing and
              than the front, although storefronts               Design Study
              may face both a street and a parking
              area.
 5.16.C       The City shall incorporate street trees,   CD-12   Neighborhood Core District
              arcades, and plazas into street and                Design Criteria
              building designs to create a pleasant      CD-13   Downtown Marketing and

 5.16.E       The City shall consider reducing           CD-12     Neighborhood Core District
              parking requirements for individual                  Design Criteria
              uses that demonstrate the existence of
              an overlap of parking demand for the
              overall commercial complex.
 5.16.F       Where commercial centers or office         CD-12     Neighborhood Core District
              complexes abut each other, the City                  Design Criteria
              shall require both vehicular and
              pedestrian connections between
              parking areas and buildings in order to
              minimize vehicle turn movements onto
              major streets.
HIGHWAY AND CONVENIENCE COMMERCIAL
Several small commercial centers are located at major intersections of Highway 12 and along
arterials, adjacent to or behind residential or office and industrial areas. It is expected that these
smaller commercial centers will accommodate small commercial uses, such as convenience
markets, cafes or coffee shops, dry cleaners, gas stations, office service and support, video
stores, and other service-oriented businesses. The General Plan provides design guidelines to
avoid random placement and design of highway and convenience commercial structures, to
facilitate non-motorized access to businesses, and to create aesthetically pleasing commercial
corridors along heavily traveled routes through town.
GOAL 5.17          TO PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS
                   FOR SAFE AND CONVENIENT ACCESS.
 Policy                                                  Implementing Action

              adjacent to or within residential
              neighborhoods are compatible with the
              pedestrian scale and orientation of the
              neighborhood.
 5.17.D       The City shall require that primary and   CD-14     Highway and Convenience
              main entrances are oriented toward the              Commercial Design Criteria
              highway or arterial street on which it is
              sited.

              businesses adjacent to sites where
              commercial, office, or multi-family
              residential development is planned or
              existing.
 5.17.F       The City shall establish controlled       CD-14     Highway and Convenience
              pedestrian crossings on Church Road                 Commercial Design Criteria
              as part of the overall Core Commercial
              entry area.
BUSINESS PARK AND AIRPORT COMMERCIAL
Large areas of nonresidential uses are located generally on both sides of Airport Road and in
the Liberty Island and Canright Road areas. These businesses combine office, airport-related
commercial, and limited industrial uses. In some areas, the intensity of these uses is
significantly affected by the Rio Vista Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (Solano County Airport
Land Use Commission, 1988). In various land use districts in the Planning Area, sites may be
developed for public and quasi-public uses, such as churches or community centers.

              pedestrian orientation and are sited for
              ease of access.
LIGHTING AND SIGNAGE
Copying design elements that are indistinguishable from those in many other locations can
quickly erode Rio Vista’s identity as a unique place and community. Lighting and signage are
key design elements that can help Rio Vista retain its feel of an older or traditional downtown,
while continuing to function as a modern community.
GOAL 5.19          TO INCORPORATE LIGHTING AND SIGNAGE ELEMENTS INTO A COMMUNITY
                   DESIGN THAT RETAINS THE TRADITIONAL CHARACTER OF RIO VISTA.

              feasible.
DOWNTOWN/WATERFRONT AND HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
The residential structures in the downtown and waterfront and historic neighborhoods
generally are intact and relatively unchanged from the time of construction. Most structures
still exhibit the majority—if not all—of the original architectural elements and details that make
them unique. The historic character of these structures and neighborhoods should be preserved
and enhanced. Blanket or prescriptive zoning regulations that are not compatible with the
density or design characteristics of these neighborhoods should be replaced with a historic
district that provides appropriate land use and design policies and criteria. Historic character
and design issues are addressed by the following policies and criteria. (See the Land Use element
for a discussion of land use policies and actions.)
GOAL 5.20          TO PRESERVE THE CHARACTER OF RIO VISTA’S HISTORIC DISTRICT.
 Policy                                                  Implementing Action

G.        Implementing Actions for Community Character & Design (CD)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Community Character & Design element. These implementation measures
should be utilized in conjunction with the policies and implementation measures in other
Elements, particularly those in Chapter10, Resource Conservation and Management.
CD-1               ENVIRONMENTAL/VISUAL CONSTRAINTS MAP
                   (Proposed)
The City will require with each development proposal an environmental and visual constraints
map, based on the findings of the project-specific biological resources assessment and consistent
with the General Plan goals and policies. These maps should consider the potential open space
opportunities illustrated in Figure 5-3 and 10-2, showing key hilltops, valleys, and sensitive
areas.
CD-2               ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN CRITERIA
(Proposed)
The hilltops, ridgelines, valleys, drainage corridors offer a variety of outstanding community
benefits as the community develops adjacent to these sensitive environmental areas. The
preservation of these significant environmental resources presents a unique opportunity for
public access and enjoyment that is otherwise impossible to create. By protecting and utilizing
these key resources, Rio Vista can create an exceptional public and environmental benefit of
lasting significance to the community.
          1.       Where feasible the City will require developers to minimize the creation of
                   engineered drainage channels that concentrate runoff and damage natural
                   drainage patterns. Runoff should be directed into vegetated valleys to allow for
                   greater absorption of storm water into the water table.
          2.       Key hilltops (landforms), valleys, and sensitive areas are identified in Figure 5-3.
                   The City will require the development design and review process to incorporate
                   these features into the project as follows:
                   •    Key hilltops (landforms). Sufficient natural slope and contours should
                        remain to retain the view of the landform from nearby streets and public
                        areas as an easily identifiable natural landmark.
                   •    Valleys. Engineered cut or fill along banks should be avoided so that natural
                        drainage retention and opportunities remain for trails at the top of the bank.
                        The valley should not be substantially altered from its natural form and
                        direction.
                   •    Refer to Figure 5-7 for illustration of the preferred developed condition.
          3.       The City will require the submittal of vegetation protection and restoration plans
                   as part of the development review process.

          4.       Natural gas well reserve sites should be developed as usable open space or
                   neighborhood visual amenities. Opportunities for the development of natural
                   gas well sites as park facilities are discussed in the Open Space & Recreation
                   element.
CD-3               PARKS MASTER PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare a Parks Master Plan prior to or concurrent with project approvals
associated with the proposed large development projects. This plan will identify community
park sites, trails, and open space areas so that the City can work with developers to create an
integrated system well in advance of subdivision development.
CD-4               TRAILS AND PATHWAYS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
A comprehensive trails system will be developed for the entire Planning Area (also see
Circulation & Mobility, Open Space & Recreation, and Resource Conservation & Management
elements). A Trails Master Plan should provide the means of finding and setting priorities for
trail development. This General Plan has established a Trails and Pathways Map in the
Circulation & Mobility element (see Figure 8-6). The City will require design review of any
development within or alongside an area with a proposed trail as identified on the adopted
Trails and Pathways Map.
CD-5               COMMUNITY DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       Community identity features and landmarks are to be included, as shown in
                   Figure 5-6.
          2.       The primary entry points into the community will be located on Highway 12,
                   River Road, Main Street, and near the Helen Madere Bridge (commonly referred
                   to as the Rio Vista Bridge). At these entry points, distinctive landscaping and
                   identity signage will establish a unifying identity for the entire community.
          3.       Median or triangle treatments may be included as a design element for the
                   entryways.
          4.       Project identity signage should be used to provide consistent design identity,
                   with the major entry features as unifying elements.
          5.       Special identity features may be created for downtown and Old Town entries.
          6.       For major intersections of arterials, collectors, and primary streets, each entry or
                   connection into a distinct neighborhood should be given its own identity through
                   use of textured pavement, landscaped islands, and “neckdowns” (roadway
                   width reductions at strategic locations). These features will slow traffic and
                   preserve neighborhoods, as described in the Circulation & Mobility element. The

                   treatment of these intersections also will carry over the main design and material
                   elements of the community entries, reinforcing the connection with Rio Vista as a
                   community and with specific neighborhoods.
          7.       For minor street intersections and mid-block interest features, special
                   landscaping treatments, street tree accents, textured paving, roundabouts, or
                   medians should be used to create interest and provide identities to smaller
                   neighborhoods or residential clusters—without separating them and allowing for
                   free access between and through them. These features also may be used at
                   pathway crossings or in longer blocks in order to meet the requirements that
                   follow this section.
          8.       For parks and linear pathway intersections, landscaping and landform
                   treatments to call attention to the end of the street at a park or pathway and a
                   pathway crossing should be used at mid-block of a street. At these points, it is
                   critical to alert pedestrians, bicyclists, and auto drivers that the upcoming
                   intersection exists and caution is required. These intersections should be
                   landscaped and signed to maintain clear visibility to both path and roadway.
          9.       In part, landmarks will be created by the hierarchy of entries and identified focal
                   points.. Buildings occupying key locations or tending to dominate the landscape,
                   should create forms and structural elements that enhance their landmark status
                   and function.
          10.      When clock towers, cupolas, steeples and, in some cases, distinctive signage
                   structures serve the purpose of enhancing a building’s landmark status and
                   function, such treatments should be incorporated into the design. Such features
                   may be erected to a greater height than the main roof line, provided the design is
                   in keeping with the overall character of the structure and surroundings.
CD-6               HIGHWAY 12 CORRIDOR DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       The overall landscape treatment and specific entry features along Highway 12
                   should enhance the sense of arrival.
          2.       As Highway 12 is expanded, particularly east of Drouin Drive, lower design
                   speeds should be used that are consistent with the levels of service standards
                   identified in the Circulation & Mobility element.

          3.       View corridors and open space should be designed in the vicinity of the
                   proposed trail and drainageways between Church Road and Drouin Drive.
          4.       “Back-up” walls should be limited as much as possible along the residential
                   sections of the corridor. Landforms and open space should be used for noise
                   mitigation rather than walls wherever feasible.
CD-7               STREETS AND BLOCKS DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       The street sections identified in the Circulation & Mobility element should be
                   used for arterial, collector, and neighborhood (local) residential streets.
          2.       Average block lengths of 300 feet or less are encouraged; 600 feet will be
                   considered the maximum block length without a cross street or pedestrian
                   corridor intersection. The use of cul-de-sacs should be minimized, except where
                   the ends of the streets are open and connect to pedestrian corridors or pass-
                   through.
          3.       Each side of a neighborhood street should have a minimum planting strip width
                   of at least 5 feet and minimum sidewalk width of 5 feet. There should be a
                   continuity of landscaping within the planting strip, with trees spaced on average
                   at least every 30 linear feet (refer to the Circulation & Mobility element).
If access routes through parking lots, through loading and service areas, or behind residential
rear yards cannot be avoided, a convenient, attractive, and safe route should be provided—with
such features as shade, special paving, and pathway separation. Simply painting crosswalks
through parking areas is not sufficient to delineate a pedestrian route.
CD-8               RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       The living areas of the house should be kept close to the street, reinforcing
                   residents’ awareness of the neighborhood and community interaction.
          2.       Garages should be placed behind the residence, although alleyways and
                   detached garages are not required.
          3.       Residential structure and garage placement should be oriented to place living
                   areas closer to the street than garage openings.
          4.       Building entries should be emphasized and should receive special design
                   treatment to provide a balanced sense of security and privacy. Entry patios,
                   courtyards, porticoes, and porches are encouraged. Entry doors should be
                   visible from streets or other well-used public areas. In large multi-family or
                   cluster projects, units may orient toward private open space or courtyards,
                   except for units directly adjacent to public streets or the primary access way into
                   the development.

July 18, 2002

          5.         The dominant orientation of primary (front) ground-floor residential building
                     entries, regardless of housing type or style, should be toward public streets,
                     pathways, or public open space.
          6.         Secondary (rear) and upper-floor entries from the interior of a block are allowed.
                     All exterior entries to ancillary or second dwelling units are considered
                     secondary for the purpose of complying with this guideline.
          7.         A clear majority of garages on a block shall be set back a sufficient distance
                     behind the primary front wall of the structure to allow for a car parked directly
                     in front of the garage to be screened from view when looking down the street on
                     the sidewalk. A sufficient number of homes on a block should have this recessed
                     garage so that the overall appearance is one of front facades of homes, rather
                     than garages and parked cars in driveways. The typical standard for achieving
                     the intent of this measure is by the application of the following criteria. Garage
                     placement siting criteria are shown in Table 5-1. For single-family detached and
                     attached housing types with lot widths 71 feet or greater, the garage can be
                     placed anywhere on the lot, so long as other applicable setbacks and
                     requirements are met. On lots 70 feet or less in width, at least two-thirds of all
                     garages and carports are to be recessed garages, set back a minimum of 25 - 35
                     feet from the front property line of the lot. On lots where “Hollywood” or side
                     drives are used, the garage setback may be reduced to 15 feet from the front
                     property line. Garages that face side drives may be counted as recessed garages
                     when parking areas are screened by architectural features such as breezeways or
                     trellises.
                                                         TABLE 5-1
                                             Streets and Blocks Design Criteria
                                                      Garage Placement
                                 Main Building
            Lot Width              Setback                                       Garage Placement
             71 feet +              15 feet       Anywhere, so long as driveway width does not exceed 25% of lot width.
            45 - 70 feet            15 feet       67% of garages on a block set back at least 30 feet; remainder have
                                                  minimum 20’ setback (15 feet if side, “Hollywood,” or swing drive used).
         Less than 45 feet          15 feet       All garages in rear half of lot. Alley access preferred.
          8.         Driveway frontage facing a public street or private access way (front access lots)
                     should cover no more than 25 percent of the lot frontage at the curb. For instance,
                     a “standard” 6,000-square-foot lot with a 60-foot frontage width would be
                     allowed a driveway width of no more than 15 feet.
          9.         Porches, bay windows, chimneys, and similar projecting architectural features
                     are required across at least 50 percent of the front width of each house. Porches
                     must be at least 6 feet in depth.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                5-47                                   Community Character & Design

          10.      On blocks with standard or narrow lots (less than 71 feet), at least two-thirds of
                   all homes should have porches or architectural features, or the garage should be
                   recessed (set back) at least 15 feet back from the front wall of the structure.
          11.      When porches are constructed at a setback of 10 feet, a 25-foot garage setback
                   will screen most of the parked cars and allow the living areas, rather than the
                   garage and cars, to dominate visually. A 35–foot garage setback allows for more
                   driveway parking capacity and reduces the need for on-street parking, in turn
                   allowing reduction of street width. The figure below illustrates various setbacks
                   on both narrow and wide lots.
          12.      The minimum front yard setbacks for main or primary structure should be:
                   •    Living area walls – 15 feet. This amount may be reduced to 10 feet when a
                        recessed garage is used and there is at least 15 feet between the front wall or
                        porch and the garage door (if approved through development review or
                        architectural review).
                   •    Porches – 10 feet.
                   •    Bay windows, chimneys, and similar architectural features may encroach into
                        a required yard up to 2 feet.
          13.      A “tract” appearance should be avoided by incorporating significant changes in
                   massing and rooflines between elevations of the same floor plan. Where varying
                   options of the same floor plans are proposed, a significant difference in the
                   massing and composition of each option (not just finish materials) is to be
                   achieved.
CD-9               ANCILLARY OR SECOND UNIT (CARRIAGE UNIT) DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       The height of the main structure or house should be at least that of the carriage
                   house to retain an appropriate scale between them two, as shown below.

July 18, 2002

          2.       Carriage houses entries may be accessed from side-yard driveways on corner
                   lots, or from alleys or private rear drives. Examples are illustrated below.
          3.       Density bonus—As a permitted use, carriage houses may be counted as a 0.75
                   multi-family unit or a 0.4 single-family unit in density requirement calculations.
                   Table 5-2 illustrates the density bonus received when carriage houses are
                   provided—either at the time the home is built or as an option by the homeowner.
                   (Note: The space must be provided over the garage initially, with electrical and
                   plumbing service either in place or stubbed for easy access.)

CD-10              MULTI-FAMILY UNIT DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       Design qualities of depth and substance should be provided by the use of offsets,
                   recesses, columns, roof slopes, and overhangs. Architectural features should be
                   incorporated into the design of each unit.
          2.       At least one substantial architectural projection from the major building plane of
                   each elevation should be visible from a street or common open space area.
                   Examples of a dwelling’s acceptable projections are porches, bay windows,
                   dormers, gables, trellises, and chimneys.
          3.       Building design should include articulation, such as substantial changes in wall
                   plane or the use of gables, hips, or dormers. Hipped or gabled roofs covering the
                   entire mass of a building are preferable to mansard roofs or segments of pitched
                   roofs applied to the building’s edge.
          4.       Changes in materials or colors should be located at changes in plane, except for
                   articulation at the base of a building. Contrasting materials should be offset and
                   should intersect with an architectural feature. Material or color changes at the
                   outside corners of buildings should be avoided, as these give an impression of
                   thinness and artificiality. Roof color should be coordinated with walls and trim.
          5.       Children's play areas should be sited to allow for clear visibility from adjacent
                   access ways as well as kitchens and living areas within the dwelling units.
          6.       Open space amenities, including children’s play areas, should be located in areas
                   that do not require crossing large parking areas or major streets to be accessed by
                   the residents they are intended to serve.
          7.       At least 30 percent of the site should be reserved for open space, which may
                   contain plazas, pedestrian ways, landscaped greens, planting pockets, recreation
                   facilities, and roofs of structures when designed for pedestrian or recreational

                   usage. Open space should be evenly distributed.
          8.       Primary open space directly accessible from the dwelling may include yards,
                   decks, and balconies. Private usable open space should have a minimum
                   dimension of 10 by 10 feet at ground-floor level or 6 by 10 feet aboveground.
CD-11              NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDING SITING, ORIENTATION, AND ACCESS DESIGN
                   CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       Setbacks and landscaping should vary according to the use and intensity of the
                   particular nonresidential site.
          2.       Buildings should be sited to complement adjacent buildings and landscape.
                   New structures should not clash with existing structures and sites.
          3.       All loading, delivery and storage areas, and mechanical and utility equipment
                   should be screened from view from public streets and pedestrian corridors.
          4.       To ensure neighborhood compatibility, where nonresidential uses are sited close
                   to a residential area or neighborhood, the scale and character of new buildings
                   always should relate to the adjacent neighborhood. Site plans and architecture
                   should protect the privacy of adjacent developments. Landscape buffers and
                   walls are required between residential and nonresidential uses where parking or
                   loading areas abut backyards.
          5.       Pedestrian access through the parking lot should be provided for, as illustrated
                   in Figure 5-8. If the development abuts a residential neighborhood street, both
                   pedestrian and vehicular access should be provided to and from the street.
          6.       Side and rear facades of buildings should be treated with the same quality of
                   design and materials as the front elevations.
          7.       If locating a parking area or lot directly adjacent to a public street cannot be
                   avoided, cars should be screened from view by berms, walls, hedges, density of
                   plant materials, or a combination of these treatments.
CD-12              NEIGHBORHOOD CORE DISTRICT DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       The street that separates the main commercial development site from the
                   adjacent multi-family and medium-density, single-family areas should function
                   as a commercial pedestrian street (see Figure 5-8 below). The character of this
                   street is critical to ensure that the adjacent housing is integrated into, rather than
                   separated from, the commercial core. In other words, the street should invite
                   access rather than constitute a barrier.
          2.       Consistent with the traditional commercial buildings constructed in older
                   downtown business districts, large commercial structures within the
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          5-51                      Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002
                   Neighborhood Core District should create the appearance of a series of
                   individual, one- and two-story identity storefronts or building spaces with
                   vertical elements, rather than a horizontally oriented “box” typical of modern
                   shopping centers. Variations in floor level, facades, architectural details, and
                   finishes that strengthen the appearance of several smaller buildings or
                   storefronts within a longer building should be strongly encouraged. Chain or
                   franchise trademark buildings should be discouraged. Store interiors and display
                   windows should be visible from the street. Architectural styles may vary, with
                   consistency achieved through use of materials and details, light fixtures, and
                   street furniture.

          3.       The buildings on both sides of the pedestrian street should front directly onto it,
                   as shown in Figure 5-8. The two-lane configuration, on-street parking, and
                   storefronts providing pedestrian access directly to a wide sidewalk or
                   promenade should serve to slow traffic and invite pedestrian activity across the
                   street and between uses.
          4.       Providing multi-family housing over commercial businesses is encouraged in
                   this district.
          5.       The buildings in these districts’ commercial areas also may front onto street
                   plazas or a central plaza inside the site.
          6.       Except for anchor retail stores, primary building entrances should be physically
                   and visually oriented toward the “main streets,” parks, and plazas—not toward
                   parking lots or garages. Secondary entries may occur from the interior of a block
                   or parking lots. Main entries for anchor retail buildings may originate from off-
                   street parking lots; however, on-street entries are strongly encouraged. Anchor
                   stores without on-street entries should provide a landscaped pedestrian path
                   from the main street to the store entries.
          7.       Several street accesses to residences or offices on upper floors (if present) should
                   be provided. Buildings with multiple retail tenants should have numerous
                   entries to the street. Except for loading and service areas, building walls must
                   include windows or display areas, and streets lined with smaller retail shops.

CD-13              DOWNTOWN MARKETING AND DESIGN STUDY
                   (Existing)
The City will implement recommendations contained in the draft design guidelines of the 1999
Rio Vista Downtown Marketing and Design Study (Jeffrey Eichenfeld & Associates, 1999). The
guidelines list 15 elements commonly found in downtown Rio Vista buildings. Building
elements include architectural style, scale, parking, and maintenance; façade elements include
roofline, upper wall, storefronts, materials, and color; storefront elements include entrance,
display windows, bulkhead, transom windows; and storefront accessories include signs and
shading. The guidelines also contain recommendations for specific streetscape improvements
along Main Street.
CD-14              HIGHWAY AND CONVENIENCE COMMERCIAL DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       Such measures as traffic signals and textured paving, or a combination thereof,
                   should be considered to reduce traffic speeds.
          2.       Parking may be either to the rear or side of the main building. If configured in an
                   “L” shape, the building layout may actually face some of the storefronts onto the
                   parking lot. This layout is acceptable as long as most storefronts are oriented to
                   street frontage. Pedestrian access should be emphasized in a clear and
                   convenient manner.
          3.       Sidewalk widths should be at least 10 feet in front of commercial buildings with
                   storefronts. This standard may be accomplished by a combination of private
                   promenades and plazas and public sidewalks. Sidewalks on the existing
                   Highway 12 commercial district east of Drouin Drive must be at least 5 feet wide.
          4.       Whenever possible, parkways should be incorporated and shade trees should be
                   provided adjacent to the roadway.
          5.       Drive-through windows should not face onto a public street. Stacking lanes must
                   be screened from view from the street by landscaping, berms, and berm walls
                   (not simply a wall or fence).
CD-15              BUSINESS PARK AND AIRPORT COMMERCIAL DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       To the maximum extent feasible, entries to office and public space should orient
                   to streets, parks, plazas, and pedestrian corridors and pathways. Secondary
                   entrances may orient to parking lots or garages. Buildings that lay out in a “U” or
                   “L” shape and create courtyards or define the perimeter of a block are preferred
                   to those with long setbacks from the street.
          2.       Preferred materials for business park and airport commercial developments are
                   stucco, brick, masonry, and wood-siding exterior elevations. Concrete tilt-up and

                   metal construction may be used in industrial and employment districts but must
                   be designed to reflect the following the features described in the remaining items
                   in this section.
          3.       Roof elements should be pitched, not flat.
          4.       Roofing materials should be concrete, tile, slate, or metal-standing seam. Asphalt
                   shingles or tar and gravel roofing may be used when warranted by the type or
                   style of a particular building.
          5.       Elevations should be well-articulated and stress an original design, not a generic
                   or “franchise” building style. Small, boxy structures should be avoided.
          6.       Buildings should be sited to complement adjacent buildings and landscape.
                   New structures should not clash with existing structures and sites.
          7.       All loading, delivery and storage areas, and mechanical and utility equipment
                   should be screened from view from public streets and pedestrian corridors.
          8.       Where nonresidential uses are sited close to a residential area or neighborhood,
                   the scale and character of new buildings should relate to the adjacent
                   neighborhood. Site plans and architecture should protect the privacy of adjacent
                   developments. Landscape buffers and walls are required between residential and
                   nonresidential uses.
          9.       Side and rear facades of buildings should be treated with the same quality of
                   design and materials as the front elevations.
          10.      Where location of a parking area or lot directly adjacent to a public street cannot
                   be avoided, cars should be screened from view by berms, walls, hedges, density
                   of plant materials, or a combination of these treatments.
CD-16              AIRPORT/LAND USE COMPATIBILITY PLAN
                   (Existing)
Solano County Airport Land Use Commission’s 1988 Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan for the
Rio Vista Airport, adopted as a City ordinance, sets forth the standards and policies for
acceptable land uses within various restrictive zones and noise areas around the airport. The
airport and land use criteria are used to minimize risks associated with the operation of aircraft
through density reducing and maximizing the amount of open land within the vicinity of the
airport.
CD-17              LIGHTING AND SIGNAGE DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       Freestanding signs generally are not allowed except where residential structures
                   are converted to commercial uses, or new buildings are located where
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        5-56                      Community Character & Design
July 18, 2002

                   residential-type setbacks are preferred. In these cases, freestanding signs should
                   be relatively small and restrained. Pole signs are not allowed.
          2.       Colors or logos identifiable with an individual company are acceptable but
                   should not become a dominant architectural element.
          3.       Gasoline island or other open canopies should be designed to look like adjacent
                   structures, not merely flat-roofed covers. Thick columns and pitched roofs to
                   match the main structure(s) should be used. (Note: These uses generally are not
                   allowed in the areas designated as an Existing City District.)
          4.       Building mass should avoid proportionally long, flat surfaces. The architecture
                   should include pitched-roof elements, columns, indentations, overhangs, patios,
                   trellises, and surface textures on all elevations that are visible offsite. Storefronts
                   should wrap around corners to create a sense of transparency and activity at
                   intersections. Large areas of blank walls with few openings or details should be
                   avoided on facades facing streets or public spaces.
          5.       Storefronts with a traditional appearance are encouraged (and required in the
                   downtown); storefronts should be divided into horizontal bands of transom,
                   display windows, and a small (usually 1- to 2-foot-wide) base under the
                   windows. Single-story buildings should have a solid wall space extending above
                   the storefront and a cornice—with or without parapet. Multiple-story buildings
                   usually should have a horizontal band above the ground-floor windows and
                   windows on all stories above that. A cornice should be present above the
                   windows on the uppermost floor.
          6.       Windows should be organized in multiple bays wherever possible. The
                   directional expression of commercial windows should generally be vertical;
                   however, several vertical windows can be combined to create an overall
                   horizontal opening. Upper floor windows should be composed as punched
                   openings for individual windows or sets of windows, with much less glazing
                   area than the ground-floor storefront. Trim and framing should appear solid and
                   be almost as deep as the wall thickness. Residential-type window trim should be
                   avoided, unless the entire building design is residential in character.
          7.       Signage should be restrained. Freestanding signs should be the low-monument
                   type with a height and area that are proportional to the building and site. Wall
                   signage should be oriented toward pedestrians in the downtown area and visible
                   (but unobtrusive) on buildings facing Highway 12. Lighting for signage should
                   be external in the downtown. Internally lit, plastic lettering should be avoided
                   downtown but may be used elsewhere, provided that individual letters rather
                   than “can” signs are used. Neon signage may be allowed where the signage is
                   decorative and complements the building design or business theme.
          8.       Light fixtures are to be designed to cast light downward, minimizing side and
                   upper projection of light that could illuminate the night sky.

CD-18              DOWNTOWN/WATERFRONT AND HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
          1.       New structures should front directly onto the street with parking provided
                   behind the structures, on the street, or in public lots.
          2.       The height of new commercial buildings should be greater than 16 feet but not
                   more than 40 feet (as measured from the sidewalk to the top of the cornice).
          3.       Where building heights differ between adjacent properties, the adjacent heights
                   of major facade elements (e.g., storefronts, ground floors, upper floors, and sill
                   lines) and strong horizontal features (e.g., belt courses and cornices) should be
                   related.
          4.       Buildings and facades should be constructed to the property line facing the
                   adjacent street(s). Only entries and flanking display windows may be recessed
                   from the property line.
          5.       Doorways should be designed to focus on the street in order to create more
                   activity along the sidewalk.
          6.       Storefronts should be varied in design and character but continuous along each
                   block where feasible.
          7.       Canvas awnings attached above street-level storefronts and over individual
                   windows should be encouraged. Metal and glass awnings should be
                   discouraged, except when used in a specific design context. Mansard, free-form,
                   and geometric-form awnings or other sidewalk covers should be discouraged.
                   Care should be taken in choosing the size, type, location, configuration, and color
                   of awnings to ensure compatibility with the building’s architecture and the
                   character of adjacent structures.
          8.       The National Trust for Historic Preservation’s suggested guidelines should be
                   used as the basis for design criteria for rehabilitation and new construction in Rio
                   Vista’s historic residential neighborhoods.
          9.       Proposed rehabilitation of, new construction on, or addition to a structure should
                   be reviewed in the context of the architectural or historic value, the significance
                   of the site, structure or surroundings, and the visual relationship to the
                   surrounding area.

Chapter 6                   Housing
A.        Introduction
A housing element is a plan that describes how a city will address the housing needs of its
community. Specifically, the housing element describes how a city plans to preserve, improve,
and develop housing for households of all income levels within its borders. The plan includes
information on the City’s housing goals, policies, and objectives. The plan also outlines the
City’s housing needs and programs, as well as the financial resources for housing.
The City of Rio Vista is an incorporated city in Solano County, California, with an estimated
January 1999 population of 4,350 persons. Rio Vista is located just on the west side of the
Sacramento River, about 22 miles east of Suisun City and Fairfield, the county seat. In the past
decade, Rio Vista has annexed large land areas and has become a desirable place of residence
for persons of retirement age and those who commute to the Sacramento and San Francisco
metropolitan areas. The following factors affect the extent to which housing is capable of being
developed to satisfy needs in Rio Vista:
          1. Rio Vista’s location within the Bay Area (defined by the nine counties that border on
              San Francisco Bay), its proximity to the Sacramento metropolitan area, the relatively
              low cost of residential development and land in Solano County (as opposed to the
              Bay Area), its proximity to Highway 12, and the existing “small-town” feel of the
              community are primary reasons for a growing demand for housing within Rio Vista.
              The urban areas to the west and east of Rio Vista are major employment centers with
              many amenities that attract people to them. Associated with these same areas are
              higher housing costs, higher crime rates and other undesirable aspects of urban life,
              such as traffic congestion and reduced open space. By contrast, Rio Vista generally
              has lower housing costs, lower levels of crime, and less congestion than neighboring
              larger cities.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       6-1                                       Housing

          2. The recent demand for homes in Rio Vista, combined with the costs of providing
              necessary expansions in infrastructure and services, has caused the price of homes in
              Rio Vista to rise. Nevertheless, housing affordable to lower and moderate income
              households has been built since 1999, the last year for which the Association of Bay
              Area Governments (ABAG) produced housing needs projections.
          3. Both long-time and more recent Rio Vista residents are anxious to retain the small-
              town qualities that attracted them to the community. New housing development
              often has affected the character of larger communities by straining infrastructure and
              services and by constructing subdivisions with uniform houses that are
              indistinguishable from subdivisions in many other communities. Rio Vista’s
              concerns about the negative impacts of extensive, rapid growth on the community’s
              character and quality of life are the same as those faced by communities statewide.
              In an effort to balance these concerns with the need to provide for adequate,
              affordable housing, Rio Vista residents have expressed a strong preference for other
              General Plan elements to protect the local environment and establish standards for
              new neighborhoods that are appropriate to Rio Vista.
COMPONENTS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Rio Vista Housing element consists of several main sections, each of which addresses a
major subject area, as summarized below.
          SETTING
The “Setting” section describes existing conditions and addresses the following topics:
          •   Population and income characteristics include demographic and economic
              information about Rio Vista’s households.
          •   Housing characteristics includes historical and existing physical, economic, and
              affordability issues and characteristics.
          •   Housing production needs discusses the ABAG Regional Housing Needs
              Determination (RHND) process and the quantified future housing needs for Rio
              Vista that were adopted by ABAG for 1999–2006.
          •   Special housing needs discusses the special needs of the elderly, disabled, large
              families, female heads of household, farmworkers, and the homeless and others in
              need of emergency shelter.
          •   Existing housing assistance programs summarizes the state, federal, and local
              programs available to Rio Vista to help meet its housing needs.
          OUTLOOK
The “Outlook” section addresses future conditions for the following topics:
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                         6-2                                       Housing
July 18, 2002

          •   Constraints to housing production address the governmental and non-governmental
              constraints to the development of affordable housing. Potential means for reducing
              constraints are identified.
          •   Future housing assistance opportunities such as local, state, and federal financial
              programs are identified and assessed for their applicability in Rio Vista.
          •   Residential land inventory assesses the City’s residential land uses and their ability
              to supply housing for all income-level households in the community.
          GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
This section describes the City’s commitment to the actions that are necessary to address the
housing needs of current and future residents, including special needs groups; energy
conservation and equal housing opportunity also are addressed. While goal and policy
statements are general, the housing programs spell out the specific actions necessary to achieve
the goal and policy statements adopted in principle. Specific actions and programs are aimed at
meeting the City’s affordable housing needs over the planning period. The discussion quantifies
the attainment of the City’s projected needs from 1988 to 1998 (identified by the previous
Housing element), the progress toward meeting the 1999-2006 RHND through mid-2001, and
the need remaining to be met from 2001 through 2006. Specific implementing actions are
identified.
A monitoring program indicates the measures the City will implement in updating the needs
and gauging the success of its housing programs.

B.        Purpose and Authority
Housing has been and will continue to be one of the basic needs that must be provided within
the community of Rio Vista. The purpose of the Housing element is to ensure that the long-
term housing needs of all economic segments of the community are adequately met. The Rio
Vista Housing element has been designed to address the above purpose and has been prepared
to conform to the requirements of State law (Article 10.6 of the Government Code,
Sections 65580 through 65589.8).
State law requires a housing element to identify and analyze existing and projected housing
needs, and to include a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled
programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. State law also
requires that a housing element be reviewed and revised at least every 5 years. As discussed
below, the time frames for revisions and the projections for future housing production needs
have been extended several times over the past decade, such that a strict 5-year planning and
analysis period is not feasible.
This Housing element addresses Rio Vista’s quantitative housing development and program
goals for the period from 1999 to 2006, the time period of the ABAG Regional Housing Needs
Projections, as specified for Housing elements by State law. Specific objectives are identified for
1999–2006, which will identify the City’s efforts and ability to meet the regional housing needs
defined by ABAG. It should be noted that the 2006 needs projections were made retroactive to
1999 for jurisdictions in the Bay Area. For the purpose of calculating progress toward previous
housing needs, 1999 is the base year. Goals and policies also are directed at the entire planning
period of 1999–2020 covered by this General Plan.
State law requires a city’s housing element to be consistent with the remainder of its general
plan. The goals and policies of the Housing element have been reviewed and were found to be
generally consistent with other elements of the Rio Vista General Plan.
In accordance with Government Code Section 65583, the Rio Visa Housing element includes
updated technical data (e.g., population, housing, growth rates, and income levels), an
evaluation of existing policies and implementing actions, and descriptions of new programs
that were designed to effectively implement the element.

C.        The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
Housing has profound effects on the community’s economic and social well-being. The
community vision and principles that most directly relate to the Housing element are listed
below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     New development should create complete neighborhoods rather than a series of subdivisions that are
     indistinguishable from those in other communities.
CREATE AND MAINTAIN ECONOMIC VITALITY; PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE, WORK,
AND SHOP IN RIO VISTA
     The Rio Vista community should be planned for a balance of jobs and housing. Rio Vista should not
     become another bedroom suburb like so many neighboring communities.
     A broad range of housing should be available throughout the community to match job opportunities
     and community needs. No one style or price range of housing should take precedence over any other,
     so long as an adequate supply is available for each.
PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES TO ALL RIO VISTANS IN
A FISCALLY HEALTHY AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER
     Growth should pay for itself. New development should ensure that sufficient public services are
     provided without additional burden to existing residents or over-extending current capacity.
     Rio Vista should continue its tradition of cooperation with private nonprofit agencies and other
     public agencies, to provide essential services for youth, seniors, the economically disadvantaged, and
     those in crisis.
     Adequate public facilities—sewer, water, transportation, public safety, parks, recreation, education,
     and others—should be in place or assured in a timely fashion before new development projects
     proceed.
The goals, policies, and housing programs outlined in this plan represent a good faith effort by
the City of Rio Vista to provide for housing needs within the community, given the limited
resources and powers at its disposal. The attainment of many of the following goals requires
funding that is uncertain at this time. The City must recognize this fact in adopting and
implementing its housing programs and should modify portions of this element when changes
in available program funding occur.

D.        Setting
POPULATION, INCOME, AND HOUSING
Since World War II, Solano County’s population has expanded considerably. In 1940, only
49,100 people lived in the county. Between 1960 and 1980, the number of residents increased
75 percent—from 134,600 to 235,200. By 1990, the county population was 339,500 people, an
increase of almost 45 percent in only 10 years. (Association of Bay Area Governments 1999.)
Table 6-1 shows the existing demographics for Solano County and the City of Rio Vista, within
its SOI.

     The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has established household income categories based on a
     proportion of the area’s median family income, as summarized below:
            Very-low income           =    50 percent of median income or below.
                 Low income           =    50–80 percent of median income.
           Moderate income            =    80–120 percent of median income.
     Above-moderate income            =    above 120 percent of median income.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
The 1990 and 2000 Census data show a median age in Rio Vista of 36.9 in 1990 and 40.7 in 2000.
Rio Vista residents already were generally older than the County as a whole in 1990, as the
County median age was 31.0. This trend was accelerated by the development of the Trilogy
project, a housing development that is restricted to persons age 55 and older. Since the Trilogy
project likely will comprise over 50 percent of the remaining residential development
anticipated by 2020, this trend is expected to continue over the long term. For the planning
period of this Housing element (1999–2006), the trend would be reversed only if Trilogy were to
slow its rate of building compared to other new unrestricted (family) development projects.
Because the Trilogy market is seen as somewhat less subject to housing market downturns than
family housing, the trend is not expected to abate in the near term.
In 1990, 50.2 percent of Rio Vista residents were female and 49.8 percent were male, compared
to 51.2 percent females and 48.8 percent males in 2000. This trend may reflect the development
of the Trilogy project, as older households tend to have a higher proportion of females,
following life expectancy trends nationwide in which females live longer than males. Again,
should the rate of development of Trilogy slow in proportion to unrestricted projects, this trend
could slow or reverse itself in the short term.
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
          HOUSEHOLD TYPE AND SIZE
The 2000 Census data show a total of 1,881 households in Rio Vista. Of these, 1,286 (or
68.4 percent) are families, 546 (or 29.0 percent) have children under 18 living at home, and 1,051
(or 55.9 percent) are headed by married couples. Of the married couples, 402 have children
living at home. Of all households, 164 (or 8.7 percent) are single female-headed households—99
(or 5.3 percent) with children living at home. The 262 residents age 65 years or older living
alone represent 13.9 percent of all households. As stated above, this trend is expected to
continue over time.
The average household size is 2.43 persons, also significantly lower than the countywide
average (2.97). Rio Vista’s average family size is 2.92. This statistic reflects the Trilogy
development’s adding persons over 55 to the community with no children at home. The trend is
further confirmed by household size by housing tenure, with the average household size of
owner-occupied housing at 2.37, while the average size of a renter-occupied dwelling is 2.59
persons. This statistic also reflects the growing number of new homes in the Trilogy
development.
          HOUSING OCCUPANCY AND VACANCY RATE
Vacancy rates constitute one measure of the health of the housing market in a community. The
vacancy rate is the percentage of the total housing stock available for sale or rent at any one
time. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that
5 percent is a “healthy” vacancy rate for rental units and considers 2 percent for ownership
units an appropriate rate. Anything substantially less than this indicates a “tight” housing

market, which can result in inflated housing values, as competition for the limited supply bids
up the price of housing.
According to the Census, there are a total of 1,974 dwelling units and 1,881 households, leaving
93 units vacant, or a 4.7 percent vacancy rate. However, this rate may be partially due to new
homes completed but not yet sold. Rental vacancy rates are not available from the Census, but
local realtors indicate that few rentals are available—particularly single-family homes and
larger apartments.
           HOUSING TENURE
Of the 1,881 occupied dwelling units in 2000, 1,350 (or 71.8 percent) were occupied by owners,
while 531 (or 28.2 percent) were occupied by renters.
           HOUSING TYPE
Year 2000 Census data are not yet available for housing type; the latest U.S. Department of
Finance (DOF) estimate was in 1999. At that time, of the total of 1,791 dwelling units in Rio
Vista, 1,353 (or 75.6 percent) were single-family homes, 309 (or 17.2 percent) were multiple
family units, and 129 (or 7.2 percent) were mobile homes or manufactured housing.
           HOUSING VALUES
Rio Vista is the most affordable community in Solano County, which is in turn the most
affordable county in the Bay Area. Rental values are also comparably affordable. Table 6-3
shows the range of current rents for apartments and homes. The range of sale prices for homes
in the Trilogy and Homecoming developments also are shown. Currently, these are the only
new home subdivisions under construction.

As in most communities in California, the costs of owning or renting housing have increased
dramatically in Rio Vista in recent years. According to 1989 Census data, the median value of an
owner-occupied housing unit within the City was $108,100. As of 2001, the price of new homes
ranges from about $160,000 to about $320,000. A survey of new home tracts and prices
constructed since 1999 indicates that a large number of new homes have sold for under
$200,000.
          OVERPAYMENT
According to the 1990 census, 78 (or 10.8 percent of all households who owned their own
homes) were paying more than 35 percent of their incomes for housing costs. Some 212
households (or 44.1 percent of all households who rented) were paying more than 30 percent of
their incomes for housing. This is a total of 290 households (or 22.1 percent of all households)
who were overpaying for housing. The 2000 Census data on housing value and rents are not yet
available. However, if the 1990 percentage of households overpaying was extrapolated to the
2000 population and total housing units by tenure, 146 households who own their own homes
and 234 renter households (for a total of 380 households) are overpaying.
          PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BLIGHT
In 1990, the Rural California Housing Corporation conducted a “windshield” housing survey.
At that time, approximately 28 percent (about 380 units) of Rio Vista’s existing housing stock
was judged suitable for rehabilitation (the need for repairs ranged from minor maintenance to
substantial rehabilitation). The City carried out a Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) rehabilitation program in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in approximately
20 rehabilitation loans to low- and moderate-income households. Assuming that the earlier
efforts did not address all rehabilitation needs, additional rehabilitation needs are evident from
the 1990 survey, as time has elapsed and the housing stock has grown older.
Rio Vista’s housing stock was older than most of the County in 1990. According to the 1990
Census, about 24 percent of occupied housing units were constructed prior to 1940 (over 50
years old). The remaining 76 percent was constructed between 1940 and 1990. The overall age of
the housing stock most likely has declined in the intervening decade, as over 20 percent of the
current stock was built in the new subdivisions that started in 1996.
ECONOMIC TRENDS
Census data indicate that in 1990 a total of 1,500 (or 58.8 percent) of Rio Vista residents over the
age of 16 were employed, 62 (or 2.4 percent) were unemployed, and 987 (or 38.7 percent) were
not in the labor force.
The following summary is from the Economic Development element, which contains a more
detailed discussion of employment trends and jobs/housing proportions in the community.
Historically, much of the employment in and around Rio Vista has revolved around the natural
gas industry and gas exploration. For many decades, natural gas wells were abundant and so
were the supporting businesses that fed the industry. Merchants in equipment repair, sales, and
service; well drilling and some manufacturing contributed significantly to the City’s economy.

Recently, however, with an upturn in the economy and resurgence in the energy industry, Rio
Vista is beginning to experience dramatic changes in its economic growth. There is now a
strong jobs/housing balance as employment opportunities have increased and stabilized over
the years. In fact, presently there are more jobs than working residents.
It is important to note that, although the City currently maintains a healthy jobs/housing
balance, with 0.9 job/employed resident and about 1.1 jobs/household, the ABAG projections
indicate that the community will fall far short of an acceptable balance as growth occurs. Rio
Vista is expected to decline from a position that is actually healthier than the County’s and
about on par with the region, to a much less balanced position than either the County or the
region. The Economic Development element has established a policy of providing sufficient
industrial land to maintain the current jobs/housing balance at buildout and strives to provide
for a 1:1 ratio of jobs to employed residents.
PROJECTED HOUSING NEED—THE REGIONAL FAIR SHARE
The RHND process is mandated by the State and is devised to address the need for and
planning of housing across a range of affordability and in all communities throughout the State.
Each jurisdiction within the Bay Area (101 cities, 9 counties) is given a share of the anticipated
regional housing need. The Bay Area’s regional housing need is specified by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and finalized though
negotiations with ABAG. The time frame for this RHND process is January 1, 1999, through
June 30, 2006 (a 7.5-year planning period). RHND projections are available for the 1999-2006
planning period.
Since the determination of housing need often is discussed in terms of household income
categories, it is important to define the categories used in this Housing element at the outset.
HUD has established household income categories—very low, low, moderate, and above
moderate—based on a household’s earnings relative to the County’s median household income,
as defined below:
          •   Very-low income                  50 percent of median County income or below
          •   Low income                       50–80 percent of median County income
          •   Moderate income                  80–120 percent of median County income
          •   Above-moderate income            Above 120 percent of median County income
Table 6-4 shows the estimated 4-person household income for each income category, based on
Solano County’s median income for the same-size household as determined by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Table 6-5 compares the ABAG RHND income distribution for the San Francisco region, Solano
County, and Rio Vista, respectively. The Rio Vista distribution for the previous RHND period
and the 1990 Census income distribution in Rio Vista also are shown. The table demonstrates
that Rio Vista historically has provided a disproportionate share of the affordable housing in
Solano County and the Bay Area. The current methodology used by ABAG for income
distribution does not adopt a goal of moving the distribution of all jurisdictions to the regional
distributions; rather, ABAG attempts only to move jurisdictions 50 percent closer to the regional
distribution, or “half way” there. ABAG’s methodology therefore penalizes jurisdictions such as
Rio Vista for doing a good job in the past.
The methodology for distributing the total housing need among the four state-mandated
income levels has the additional effect of perpetuating an overconcentration of very low income
households, in contrast to both the region and the County. Table 6-5 illustrates this disparity.

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
State housing law recognizes that “the total housing needs identified may exceed available
resources and the community’s ability to satisfy the need” (Section 65503[b]). In such cases, the
above law requires that local quantified objectives “should establish the maximum number of
housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated and conserved over a five-year time frame.”
In the case of Rio Vista, the ABAG needs estimate calls for over one-fourth of all newly built
units to be affordable to very-low-income households and for an additional 14 percent of all
units to be affordable to low-income residents. Rio Vista has a minimal fiscal base and limited
prospects for attracting state and federal housing funds, which are cyclical and cannot be
reliably projected.
Further, it is inherently unwise to perpetuate an over-concentration of lower income households
in a particular community or neighborhood. As discussed above, the recently adopted ABAG
RHND methodology does just that by not seeking to bring all Bay Area communities to the
regional average income distribution. A more equitable distribution, if not the regional average,
would be the County average, since the median income on which the categories are defined is a
countywide measure.
To achieve a more equitable distribution that recognizes both limited resources and the need to
avoid further over-concentration of lower income households, the City’s local quantified
objectives will be adjusted as shown in Table 6-6. A further breakdown of Quantified Housing
Production Objectives by production method is presented in Table 6-7.

During the 10-year period between 1990 and 2000, the City experienced an increase in total
housing units of approximately 40.6 percent, for an average annual growth rate in new housing
units over the period of about 5 percent. The rate of growth was more rapid during the last half
of the decade, as virtually all of the new housing was constructed since 1996. The 5-year period
of 1996–2000 saw an increase of about 8 percent annually. The rate increased to over 12 percent
in 1999–2000, according to DOF data.
The previous RHND (1988–1995) projected a total need of 770 housing units of all incomes for
that period. During that time, only 134 units were produced. According to DOF figures,
occupied housing production for 1996–1998 totaled 261 units, after the initiation of construction
of Trilogy and Homecoming—the first and, to date, only projects to be constructed in the lands
annexed in 1991–1993. During that same period, 357 building permits were issued. Achieving
the Production Objectives set out in Table 6-6 for 1999—2006 would amount to twice the
projections for the previous RHND period and would require twice the current rate of housing
production on a sustained basis. This objective would result in the same proportion of newly
available affordable units in Rio Vista as in the County as a whole.
The housing policies and programs set forth in this document are intended to meet the above
local housing Production Objectives and ensure that adequate sites are available to
accommodate the RHND projected by ABAG in the 1999–2006 planning period.
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
          ELDERLY
According to the 2000 Census, in 262 households in Rio Vista at least one member is over the
age of 65. Assuming that the proportion of elderly homeowners is the same as the proportion of
homeowners in the City as a whole, approximately 72 percent of these households are owner-
occupied; however, the Trilogy development is probably increasing that proportion, as these
units are exclusively new for-sale homes for seniors. As these elderly residents age, their needs
will be related to decreased mobility and smaller living space requirements. Current
homeowners may in time seek multi-family, congregate, or assisted living facilities. Such
housing should be located near medical, commercial, and recreational facilities.

July 18, 2002

The 2000 Census data for tenure is not yet available. The 1990 Census data is therefore the most
recent data on tenure breakdown; in 1990, there were 427 householders 65 years old or older,
with 332, or 78% owners and 95, or 22% renters. This exhibits a higher proportion of owners to
renters than the general population in 1990, which was 66% owners and 34% renters. Because
the Trilogy senior housing development makes up some two-thirds of the new dwellings
constructed and occupied between 1990 and 2,000 (350 in Trilogy, 545 total), and Trilogy has so
far been almost 100% owner occupied, this proportion is expected to actually be higher when
the 2000 Census data for this category is available.
          PHYSICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED
The 1990 Census showed that 144 (or 4.3 percent) of Rio Vista residents between 16 and 64 years
of age had disabilities that prevented or may prevent them from working. Of these individuals,
66 were employed, and 22 (or 0.7 percent) had transportation disabilities. If these proportions
remained the same, based on the 2000 Census population of 4,852, 208 residents would have
work disabilities and 33, transportation disabilities. Although not all persons with work
disabilities require special housing, many need specially designed units that are located near
transportation, shopping, and services. Such facilities may be even more crucial for persons
with transportation disabilities.
          LARGE FAMILIES
Large families are defined as households with five or more persons. The 1990 Census showed
that 8.8 percent of Rio Vista households had five or more members. This proportion has
probably declined, consistent with the City’s declining average household size, although the
extent of the decline must be confirmed by the 2000 Census. Large households often have
difficulties finding suitable housing that is also affordable.
The 2000 Census data for family size and tenure is not yet available. The 1990 Census data is
therefore the most recent data on tenure breakdown; in 1990, there were 118 households with 5
or more persons, of which 85 or 72% were owners and 33, or 28% were renters. As is the case
with elderly households, large families exhibit a higher proportion of owners to renters than the
general population in 1990, which was 66% owners and 34% renters.
          FEMALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS
The 2000 Census showed the number of female-headed households in Rio Vista to be 164 (or
8.7 percent). The special housing needs of this group include low-cost and low-maintenance
housing, suitable for children and located near schools and child care facilities. Innovative
shared living arrangements, which may include congregate cooking and child care, also would
be suitable. To accommodate this type of household in Rio Vista, new forms of housing may
need to be explored, such as the innovative Muir Commons development in Davis, referred to
as co-housing or shared living housing.

          HOMELESS AND OTHER PERSONS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER
Shelters and homeless assistance programs are the main resources available to homeless
residents of Solano County. In 2000, 3 transitional housing shelters were operating in Solano
County to serve homeless families with children. In these shelters, a total of 86 beds are
available. Several more specialized shelters are located in Solano County for persons with
substance abuse problems and mental illnesses, victims of domestic violence, and veterans. Up
to 24 additional beds are available at these facilities. Finally, the Salvation Army provides cash
assistance to homeless persons. Local assistance to the homeless is limited largely to counseling
and information and referral services provided by groups such as the Rio Vista Community
Action Center (CAC) and Rio Vista Care. Churches are another source of food and temporary
assistance. Recently, several cities and the County have explored a joint effort to address the
problem. However, no specific facility has been provided.
The homeless population in Solano County has been estimated at between 500 and 2,000
persons; it is not known how many are in Rio Vista. Factors that contribute to homelessness
include lack of affordable housing, unemployment, reductions in government subsidies,
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, domestic violence, illegal drug use and addiction,
dysfunctional families, lifestyle choices, and other causes. Due to the lack of available services
and distance from urban centers and its small population the actual numbers of homeless in Rio
Vista are probably quite low. Rio Vista’s population of 4,571 is about 1.16% of the total Solano
County population. If population is used as a guide and the higher estimate of 2,000 homeless
persons in the County is correct, this would mean only about 2 homeless persons would be in
Rio Vista on a regular basis. The social service providers mentioned above (CAC, CARE) report
occasional contact with homeless persons or families but such contact appears to be irregular.
Overall, programs and shelters in Rio Vista and Solano County are probably inadequate to meet
the needs identified below. Although service providers throughout the County agree that
locating a shelter in Rio Vista would be inefficient, there is clearly a need for more locally based
assistance. Local programs providing assistance to the homeless include counseling,
information, and referral by agencies such as Rio Vista Care, and food and cash assistance
provided by churches on a case-by-case basis. Comprehensive data on the number of homeless
people in the City of Rio Vista are not available and are not provided in currently available
Census data reports.
Based on interviews with local service providers, at-risk individuals and families pose a greater
potential need for the City than persons who are actually homeless. Of particular concern are
chronically mentally ill residents, who are subject to termination of their public assistance
payments. Many such persons presently occupy single-room occupancy hotel rooms in the
downtown area. These residents comprise the largest proportion of at-risk households in Rio
Vista, according to the impressions of local service providers. There is also some evidence of
occasional camping by homeless families along the Sacramento River in the vicinity of Rio
Vista. This appears to be a seasonal phenomenon, most commonly observed during the
warmer months of the year. These reports have not been verified; there have not been any such
reports or sightings in recent months.
The above analysis suggests that while many of the City’s at-risk residents probably receive
some form of assistance, the assistance may be inadequate to fully alleviate their risk of
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     6-16                                          Housing
July 18, 2002

homelessness.           Rather than a shortage of existing programs, the City and County are
confronted by declining financial resources in the face of relatively constant housing
affordability problems. Programmatically, therefore, Rio Vista should focus on preventing
future homelessness on behalf of the at-risk population rather than establishing shelters and
programs for the small number of existing homeless residents. For this reason, Rio Vista has
chosen to provide additional assistance to existing programs and to augment existing resources
as opposed to identifying and developing additional shelter sites. Although homeless shelters
and emergency shelters, as group homes, would be permitted as conditional uses in commercial
and multi-family residential zoning districts, the consensus of social services professionals is
that such facilities should be located near support services and employment centers. The
professionals contacted for this report indicated that Rio Vista would be an inappropriate
location in view of its distance from such centers.
Homeless shelters and transitional housing are allowed in all commercial zoning districts
except C-3 (Commercial Service) and in R-3 and R-4 multifamily districts. Such housing would
be considered as hotel or motel uses in the commercial districts and as rooming houses or
boardinghouses in R-3 and R-4 districts. The latter are allowed as a conditional use; the former
are allowed as permitted uses by right. There are currently two residential hotels in the
downtown and two motels in the HC (Highway Commercial) district on Highway 12. The
County Department of Health and Social Services currently provides temporary housing for
families in these facilities as needed. A dedicated shelter facility could be developed in these
districts, or a number of rooms in an existing hotel or motel facility could also be used for this
purpose under the definitions of the Zoning Ordinance.
          FARMWORKERS
The U.S. Census indicates that 25 (or 1.7 percent) of employed Rio Vista residents 16 years or
older were employed in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in 1990. But the Census does not
provide more detailed information on the number of migrant, seasonal (non-migrant), and
permanent farm workers in Rio Vista in order to identify the extent of their special housing
needs. The 1990 Census showed that about 1,900 farm laborers resided in Solano County. It is
reasonable to expect, given the agricultural base of the local economy that a number of farm
workers live in the Rio Vista area.
According to the State Office of Migrant Education, there are approximately 95 families
participating in the Migrant Education Program on an annual basis from 1998 to the current
school year. At an average of 4.2 persons per household, this would equate to about 400 persons
in the Rio Vista area. According to the Sacramento Valley Organizing Committee, a farmworker
advocacy organization, the number of both migrant and permanent farmworker families is
approximately 150. This would mean about 630 persons in farmworker households in the Rio
Vista vicinity. There is no reliable data on how many of those reside in the City limits.
The housing needs of full-time farmworkers are no different from those of other employment
groups and consist of housing that is affordable in relation to income, meets acceptable housing
standards, and is reasonably accessible to employment. Seasonal or part-time farmworkers
who do not leave the area and have or seek year-round residency in the area have similar needs;
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     6-17                                       Housing
July 18, 2002
but their income is likely to be considerably less than year-round employees, and these
individuals may require subsidized housing or employer-based housing. Seasonal migrant
workers typically have even less income available for housing because of their need to minimize
expenses to meet off-season needs. As a result, migrant farmworkers may seek housing in a
labor camp or may rent any available and inexpensive rental unit (which may be shared among
several workers). If such housing is not available, migrant farmworkers may resort to
substandard shelters—ranging from vehicles to tents or other forms of temporary shelter.
Because migrant farmworkers need to reside near work sites, most farmworker housing needs
to be provided in the unincorporated county areas, outside the City of Rio Vista.
The Solano County Migrant Farm Labor Camp, administered by the Vallejo Housing Authority,
is the only publicly supported farm labor camp in Solano County. The camp was relocated in
1984 to a 27-acre site outside the Dixon city limits, is leased from the U.S. Navy on Radio Station
Road, and can accommodate a projected maximum population of 500. The camp is funded
through the Migrant Services Section of the State Health and Welfare Agency and through
rental charges. In addition to the Solano County camp, 1 private camp in Solano County
provides 82 family units, with no dormitories. The Solano County Division of Environmental
Health Services monitors conditions at the camps to ensure that minimum health and safety
standards are met.
          OVERCROWDED HOUSING
Overcrowded housing is defined as housing units with more than 1.01 persons per room.
According to the 1990 Census, a total of 104 occupied housing units were overcrowded,
representing 8.2 percent of the total occupied units in Rio Vista. The incidence of overcrowding
was more apparent in renter-occupied units, which accounted for 64 overcrowded units (or
62 percent of all overcrowded units in Rio Vista). Of all rental units, 14 percent were
overcrowded, compared with only 4 percent of owner-occupied units, demonstrating a need for
more rental units with a higher number of bedrooms. However, overcrowding also may occur
when two or more households share a single dwelling unit, usually as a way of reducing their
housing costs. The extent of such sharing is not indicated in Census data. If present, this factor
would indicate a need for lower-priced housing in general, rather than a need specifically for
larger units (renter or owner occupancy).
          ASSISTED HOUSING AT RISK OF CONVERSION TO MARKET RATE
The City of Vallejo Housing Authority administers the Section 8 rental assistance program.
Currently, this program subsidizes 76 units in Rio Vista.
State law requires that each jurisdiction completing a housing element consider subsidized
housing projects that may convert to market rate rentals during the planning period covered by
the element. This allows both HCD and the local community to anticipate the total number of
below-market-rate rental units that may be converted or displaced.
Currently, there is no project in Rio Vista that may convert to market-rate rents during the next
ten years. Only one assisted project has been identified, the Las Casitas del Rio apartments
located on St. Joseph’s Street. This project was constructed under the Farmers’ Home
Administration (FmHA) program in the mid-1980s; the project also contains a total of 40

July 18, 2002

assisted units under the County’s Section 8 program (administered by the Vallejo Housing
Authority). Neither the FmHA mortgage nor any of the Section 8 units are due to terminate
during the next 10 years.
Sources used to verify that no other “at-risk” affordable developments exist in Rio Vista are as
follows:
          •   HUD Section 8, Section 10, Section 213, Section 221(d)(e), Section 236, and
              Section 202 and HCD information do not indicate any projects other than Las Casitas
              del Rio.
          •   The CDBG program has no assisted multi-family developments.
          •   To date, no projects have been undertaken or assisted with local Redevelopment
              funds.
          •   No multi-family revenue bond programs exist.
          CONSERVATION OF EXISTING UNITS
Rio Vista has a valuable resource in its existing housing stock. Significant numbers of low- and
moderate-income persons currently reside in Rio Vista, and these existing units fill a need for
many of these households. It is therefore necessary to protect these units and encourage their
continued use in the housing stock.
As construction labor and material costs continue to rise, it is increasingly difficult for low- and
moderate-income homeowners to maintain their homes and keep them in a decent and safe
condition. Consequently, by deferring the maintenance of these units, the condition and
livability of the units decline and their viability is threatened. It is important that programs be
encouraged and developed to preserve the existence of units in the current housing stock.
HOUSING PRODUCTION
          AFFORDABILITY AND TENANCY
Affordability, for the purpose of Housing element analysis, is a function of two primary factors:
(1) the proportion of total income a household is able to reasonably be expected to expend on
housing costs and still meet other essential needs (e. g., the “overpayment” threshold); and
(2) the cost of housing available, in the form of mortgage payments and taxes for owner
occupants or monthly rent. For over a decade, HUD has used the 30 percent of income figure to
determine the affordable rent or housing cost for Section 8 and other direct assistance programs
for very-low-income households. The 30 percent figure also is thought to be the most reasonable
figure for the low-income group (up to 80 percent of median income) that rents, rather than
owns, their homes. In recent years, the Legislature has indicated some recognition that a higher
percentage is realistic for at least the moderate-income group, as well as those households in the
low-income group that can manage to qualify for home ownership. The definition of
affordability specified in Section 50052.5 of the State Health and Safety Code allows a higher
than 30 percent level for owner-occupied housing, in recognition of the willingness of many
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      6-19                                         Housing
July 18, 2002

people to sacrifice other disposable income for the benefits of owning a home. This criterion
applies only to the upper third of the low-income households that earn 70 percent or more of
the median income and only to owner occupants.
This analysis considers the affordability level for all very-low-income households and low-
income households that rent to be 30 percent of gross income. For low-income households that
are owner occupants, the affordability level was considered to be 35 percent. For moderate-
income households, many of whom can be expected to afford monthly payments on entry-level
for-sale housing at current interest rates, the affordability level also was set at 35 percent. As
discussed below, current housing costs place home ownership out of reach of all of the very-
low-income group and most of the low-income range. For this reason, when analyzing housing
needs met and those needs remaining, all very-low-income households were assumed to be
renters, with a maximum affordable rent at 30 percent of gross income. The low-income group
was considered to include both renters and owners. For renters, affordable rent was set at
30 percent of income, while affordable mortgage payments (including taxes and insurance) was
set at 35 percent of income. All moderate- and above-moderate income households were
assumed to be owners, at the 35 percent of income affordability level (no income limit was
assumed for the above-moderate-income households).
          NEW CONSTRUCTION—MARKET-RATE AFFORDABILITY
          HOMES FOR SALE
 As discussed previously, new homes for sale in Rio Vista during the planning period have been
sold at affordable prices to many moderate-income households. Three new subdivisions have
been constructed since 1988. The Alexander tract near White School was completed in 1991 and
consists of about 150 single-family homes. Trilogy (ongoing) has about 550 occupied homes,
with over 3,500 units projected at buildout. Homecoming, with 290 homes, is just being
completed.
Tables 6-8 and 6-9 show income and affordability levels of Rio Vista households based on the
Solano County median and housing production by affordability according to the criteria
discussed above for each of the four income groupings recognized by State law. Table 6-8
contains Solano County household incomes. Table 6-9 shows the results of a quantitative
analysis of affordability conducted by the City of Rio Vista based on HUD’s household income
guidelines for Solano County, as cited in the tables above. Table 6-9 describes the number of
units built and their prices when sold, the affordability limits of moderate-income households
in each of those years, and the resulting number of homes sold at prices affordable to the
moderate-income group in each year.

             No limit was assumed for above-moderate income households.
           MULTI-FAMILY CONSTRUCTION
Almost no multi-family construction has taken place since 1988. This follows the general trend
of multi-family construction, which declined dramatically in Solano County after the mid-1980s
until recently.
           1988–1998
The City of Rio Vista has provided information on the sale prices of new homes at the time of
their permit issuance or final inspections for the subdivisions active during the 1988–1998
period. This information can be matched with the affordability ranges for the four income
groups, using the above income limits in the year the homes were sold. Current rents for both
single-family homes and apartment complexes also can be compared against current income
and affordability limitations. This comparison allows a determination of the number of

households whose affordability requirements have been met by housing produced in Rio Vista
since 1988 and also the housing needs remaining to be met. Further, the next section considers
the impact of the Solano County Housing Authority’s (SCHA’s) direct assistance programs
(Section 8 and vouchers). Of the 395 units for which building permits were issued during the
years 1988–1998, 18 units were constructed in multi-family structures, and 48 mobile homes
were annexed; the remaining 377 units were single-family detached dwelling units.
          1999–2001
Rio Vista’s housing supply has increased since 1998, particularly in more recent years.
According to estimates by the Demographic Research Unit of the DOF), at the beginning of 1998
Rio Vista had a total of 1,628 dwelling units (1988). In January, 2001, the DOF estimated the
presence of 2,046 dwelling units in Rio Vista. Compared with 1998 DOF data, this number
indicates an increase of 418 dwelling units (or 26 percent) since January 1, 1998.
          REMAINING HOUSING NEED 2001–2006
Table 6-10 identifies the remaining housing production needs remain for the 2001–2006 period, if
the City is to meet the quantified Site Capacity and Production Objectives set forth in Table 6-6.

Table 6-9 shows affordable housing cost levels in Solano County for very low, low and
moderate income households in selected years from 1988 to 2001. The table indicates the
assumptions used in calculating the affordable sales prices for income levels above 70% of
median, and rents for low and very low income households. For each income category, the table
shows the number of units constructed at a rent or sales price that was affordable at that
affordability level or below. From 1999 to 2001, a total of 254 units affordable to moderate
income households and 22 units affordable to low income-affordable units were constructed in
the years indicated. Since no multifamily units were constructed in this period, the only
affordable units were single family homes sold at prices within the affordability limits
indicated.
There were two development projects (subdivisions) and one new house under construction
during 1999 to 2001. The Trilogy development (Shea Communities) sold homes in a price range
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                         6-23                                               Housing

of about $130,000 to $220,000 in 1999; the prices rose to a range of $160,000 to $250,000 in 2001
(base prices). During this period, 58 of the approximately 250 homes sold were in the moderate-
income affordability range for the year in which they were sold.
The homecoming subdivision (Schuler homes) was constructed between 1999 and 2001. In 1999,
the prices in this subdivision ranged from the low $120,000’s to about $180,000 and rose to
about $170,000 to $230,000 in 2001, the last year of sales. In 1999, there were 21 homes in this
subdivision that were sold at prices affordable to low income households in the 70% to 80% of
median level (less than $128,797). The rising market priced out the low income households at 70
– 80% of median in 2000 and 2001. The remainder of the 217 homes constructed during 1999 –
2001 were sold at prices affordable to moderate income households (217 – 21 = 196). In 2001,
one modular home, valued at less than $120,000, was constructed.
Due to the rapid changes in the local housing market during 1999 –2001 and the difficulty of
pinpointing new home sales prices to exact dates in the Homecoming subdivision, the 22 homes
that were most likely sold at prices affordable to lower income households will not be reflected
in the calculation of remaining housing production needs (Table 6-10). These will be moved to
the moderate income category. Because no multifamily units were constructed in 1999 – 2001,
no units affordable to very low and low income households below 70 % of median were
produced.
NON-CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS—REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY, FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE, COST REDUCTION, AND DIRECT SUBSIDIES
          REDUCED LOT SIZES AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT
On several occasions, the City has permitted the construction of homes on lots less than the
“standard” 6,000 sq. ft., either through rezoning or the Planned Development process. In areas
in the older sections of the community, the Zoning Ordinance should be changed both to reflect
the historic character of the area and to maintain the existing density mix, which is inconsistent
with single-family zoning. The Land Use element discusses this need and contains policies and
implementing actions (specific plans and zoning ordinance amendments) to accomplish these
objectives.
STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS
          STATE PROGRAMS
California Housing Finance Agency. The California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) issues
tax-exempt bonds, through its Home Ownership Home Improvement Program, to provide low-
interest financing for home purchase or rehabilitation by households in areas with a shortage of
reasonably priced mortgage money, and in areas where revitalization is necessary. Private for-
profit and non-profit sponsors of new construction are eligible to receive loan commitments
through this program. In addition, CHFA issues Redevelopment Agency Senate Bill 99 bonds
to provide long-term, low-interest loans to finance rehabilitation or new construction in
specified areas.

July 18, 2002

California Homeownership Assistance Program. The California Homeownership Assistance
Program issues funds through HCD to pay for up to 49 percent of a home in return for equity
participation. Commitments for the funds can be made to non-profit and for-profit developers
of new construction.
Rental Housing Construction Program. The Rental Housing Construction Program is
administered through HCD and provides funds to develop rental housing, primarily for low-
income groups, through local agencies or the CHFA.
Predevelopment Loan Program. The Predevelopment Loan Program provides loans through
HCD to local governments, housing authorities, or non-profit corporations for site acquisition
and preparation, fees, and bonding expenses. A separate fund is also available to the same
entities for land purchase in urban and rural areas.
State Homeownership Program. The State Homeownership Program will provide a $15,000
second deed of trust at a 3 percent interest rate to help middle-income home buyers purchase a
home.
          FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The City has pursued in the past, and is willing to pursue in the future, funding through
available state and federal programs to reduce the cost of both for-sale and rental housing,
through special development financing, tax credits, or direct subsidy of rents.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program. The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program was
authorized by Congress in the Tax Reform Act of 1984. The program issues federal income tax
credits for qualifying first-time homebuyers and thereby increases their ability to make
payments on a home. The MCC tax credit is equal to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on a
new first mortgage loan, thus enabling a higher maximum purchase price for new homes.
Because the credit is applied to 20 percent of the mortgage payment, the credit generally
increases the payment that is affordable to a particular household income, by 20 percent. In
1992, the State of California authorized issuance of up to $20,000,000 in certificates (MCCs) for
the local program (sponsored by the Solano Affordable Housing Foundation [SAHF]; the City
of Rio Vista, City of Fairfield, and Suisun City; and Solano County) for purchase of homes in
these cities and in the unincorporated areas of the county. In recent years, the amount of
funded MCCs available to Solano County has dropped dramatically. Based on the dollar
amount authorized, SAHF (the program administrators) could have issued only approximately
8 MCCs throughout the entire County over the past 3 years. SAHF has issued only 2 MCCs for
both new and existing homes in Rio Vista since the program began.
The program essentially works with existing home finance lenders and does not subsidize
down payments or mortgage payments; therefore, a minimum qualifying income is also
necessary. For example, if the MCC program provided a homebuyer with an additional $172
per month for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance payments, the buyer could afford an extra
$16,500 in mortgage than otherwise could be afforded. The MCC program may be considered
suited for moderate-income and the upper third of low-income households. However,
additional programs and subsidies are needed to make housing affordable to the remainder of
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     6-25                                      Housing
July 18, 2002
the low-income and all of the very-low-income households in Rio Vista and elsewhere in Solano
County.
Solano County Housing Authority Section 8 and Voucher Programs. The federal Section 8 and
Voucher programs provide a direct subsidy for qualified very-low-income families to ensure
that these households do not pay more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing. The
City of Rio Vista is a part of the SCHA, which contracts with the Vallejo Housing Authority to
administer these programs in Rio Vista and other locations in the county. According to Vallejo
Housing Authority staff, the number of new Section 8 certificates received by HUD and used in
Rio Vista since 1998 is about 30. To the knowledge of the Vallejo staff, no certificates were used
in conjunction with any new apartments built during this time. Rather, all 30 certificates were
used to make market-rate, otherwise non-affordable housing, affordable to these very-low-
income households.
Section 202. The Section 202 program provides long-term direct loans to private, non-profit
sponsors in order to finance new rental housing construction for elderly and handicapped
targeted income group members. It allows for reduction in the cost of new apartment
construction (and thereby the necessary rents). It may be used in conjunction with Section 8
and/or other programs.
Community Development Block Grant. The CDBG program is a major federal program
available to assist local government in the development of affordable housing. Funds are used
to encourage the construction of low-income housing, including funding non-profit
corporations in their housing construction projects to acquire or write-down the cost of land for
residential units of low- and moderate-income households and infrastructure improvements to
assist in the construction of affordable housing. In the past (late 1980s), the City has used this
funding source to obtain housing rehabilitation loans for owner-occupied lower income
households.
The HOME Program. The Home Program, administered through HCD, provides a matching
grant of up to $1 million for projects that are at least 20 percent affordable to lower income
households.
Rental Housing Tax Credits. Rental housing tax credits are available to developers of rental
housing that are affordable to households earning no more than 60 percent of median income
(the “lower third” of the low-income group and all of the very-low-income group). Tax credits
represent the federal government’s largest effort to assist in the development of housing
affordable to low-income households. The tax credits enable the owner of a rental complex that
is affordable to low-income households to take an annual tax credit equal to 9 percent of the
depreciable basis of the complex against the owner’s federal tax obligation for up to 10 years.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act is a federal program that
directs local financial institutions to develop specific financing programs for low- and
moderate-income housing.

REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The City created a Redevelopment Agency in 1988. The Redevelopment boundaries are shown
in Figure 6-1. Redevelopment is widely used in California as a tool for implementing economic
development and constructing affordable housing. The primary benefits of a Redevelopment
Agency are the ability to raise funds and finance infrastructure and other projects through tax
increment financing; and the ability to assemble sites for conveyance to private developers of
commercial, industrial, and housing projects that benefit the community. Typical
redevelopment projects are downtown revitalization, industrial park development,
infrastructure, and amenities that facilitate development and affordable housing.
          LOW/MOD HOUSING SETASIDE FUND
The Community Redevelopment Law requires that not less than 20 percent of tax increment
revenue allocated to the Redevelopment Agency from the Project Area shall be used to increase
or improve the community’s supply of very-low-, low-, and moderate-income housing (referred
to as the “Low/Mod Housing Setaside Fund”). The law also requires that at least 15 percent of
all new or rehabilitated dwelling units developed within the Project Area by public or private
entities other than the Agency be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. Of the
low- and moderate-income units, 40 percent (6 percent of the total) must be affordable to
households in the lowest income group.

          IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND 10-YEAR HOUSING PROGRAM
In September 2000, as required by Redevelopment law, the Redevelopment Agency updated
and adopted an Implementation Plan that indicates how housing will be provided over the next
10 years. To date, only administrative funds have been spent on housing, and there is a fund
balance of about $200,000 for program activities. The Implementation Plan also projects that
about $500,000 will be spent on affordable housing over the next 5 years, including a substantial
portion of the fund balance and future increment revenues. The Agency established a Deferred
Payment Assistance Loan program for lower income households in 1997; to date, however, no
loans have been made.
The primary purpose of the Agency’s housing programs is the preservation and development of
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. In addition, the Agency’s
housing programs will assist in the elimination of blight by offering residential property owners
incentives to repair or improve their property; by creating new, well-designed residential
housing projects in the community; and by ensuring, through covenants and restrictions, that
housing developments assisted by the Agency will be well maintained for their useful life.
PRIVATE PROGRAMS
California Community Reinvestment Corporation. The Community Reinvestment Act, enacted
by Congress in 1977, encourages local financial institutions to actively identify and help meet
the credit needs of their communities. The California Community Reinvestment Corporation
(CCRC) was established by a consortium of federally chartered banks in California and
provides below-market-rate financing for the development of affordable housing.
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board established the
Affordable Housing Plan (AHP), which provides grants for the development of affordable
rental housing.
Non-Profit Housing Corporations. The establishment of a strong, locally-based non-profit
housing development corporation committed to working with the City, business, and
development communities could play a significant role in successfully implementing the
affordable housing program through the development and long-term management of
affordable housing. This type of non-profit firm could perform functions that the City, business
,and development communities are either unable or unwilling to undertake on their own.
Reverse Annuity Mortgage. The creation of a home equity conversion program (reverse annuity
mortgage) would work in conjunction with local financial institutions to allow elderly
homeowners a method of extracting equity out of their homes for repairs and as supplemental
income.
REVIEW OF THE 1992 HOUSING ELEMENT
Between January 1988 and December 1998, Rio Vista added a total of 448 residential dwelling
units, based on building permits issued for new construction. This included 412 single-family
homes and 36 multifamily units. It should be noted that the original timeframe of the Housing
Element was 1988 through 1995, however, State law extended the timeframe through 1998. The
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    6-29                                         Housing
July 18, 2002

total units produced from during that time was less than half the City's total projected need of
770 as determined by ABAG in 1988. About half of these units were in the above moderate
price range, although in the Homecoming subdivision, there were models with small floor
plans that were affordable to the highest 10% of the low income household range and all models
were affordable to moderate income households (the rapid appreciation of recent years began in
1999 in Rio Vista).         The Trilogy development also sold a number of smaller floor plans
affordable to moderate income households. A third subdivision, River Country Estates, sold
from 1988 – 1991 but these were not affordable to moderate income households. The recession
in the housing market experienced from the early to mid-1990’s is considered to be the primary
reason that the total number of projected new units was not reached.
Although the goals for new construction for Very Low and Low Income households were not
met, 36 apartment units were constructed during a period which was not favorable for new
construction of rental units for any price range. All of these were affordable to low income
households; it is not known whether any were affordable to very low income households. For
the purpose of this review, it is assumed that they were not. It is anticipated that there may be
more interest in developing rental housing in the near future, as evidenced by apartment
construction during the past two years in other Solano County cities. Rents have been on the
rise since 1999, coinciding with the higher appreciation rates in single family houses.
As shown on the following tables, during the reporting period, 26 units were rehabilitated, 10 of
which were affordable to very low income households and 16 affordable to low income
households. These rehabilitated units were funded through two CDBG grants; all are subject to
rental agreements that keep the units affordable. Although the rehabilitated units did not add to
the overall inventory of units, they did have a significant impact on the inventory of units with
long-term affordability restrictions for low and very-low income households.
A total of 75 very low income households attained affordable housing through Federal rental
assistance (Section 8 Certificates and Vouchers) administered for Solano County by the Vallejo
Housing Authority.
The following tables provide summaries of the number of units achieved and the performance
of the previous Element’s goals and programs during the period January 1, 1988 through
December 31, 1998. It should be noted again that per State legislation, the timeframe for the
previous Housing Element was extended from 1995 to 1998. Therefore, units constructed from
1995 through 1998 go towards meeting the goals of the previous Housing Element. Units
produced in 1999, 2000 and 2001 are considered to be in the current period for which this
Element is concerned and will be counted as such.

E.        Outlook
POPULATION, INCOME, AND HOUSING
Despite the California recession of the early 1990s, Solano County’s population growth remains
strong. ABAG estimates that the county will add over 61,800 new residents between 1990 and
2000, making it the fastest growing county in the region. Although other counties will
experience higher absolute population increases, Solano County will experience the highest
percentage increase in population between 2000 and 2020. The County’s population will
increase by about 36 percent, or 146,100 residents in the 20-year period. (Association of Bay
Area Governments, 1999.)
Solano County, along with Santa Clara County, has the highest average number of persons per
household in the region. As in other counties, this average has increased significantly since the
mid-80s. In 1990, Solano County had an average of 2.88 persons per household. For 1995,
ABAG estimates this number at 2.94 and, as shown in Table 6-11, the estimate for 2000 is 2.97.
ABAG expects the average household size to peak at 3.03 in 2005 and then to decline to 2.96 in
2020. (Association of Bay Area Governments, 1999.)

Throughout the forecast period (2000-2020), household growth is projected to be clustered in
three major growth centers: Fairfield, Vacaville, and Vallejo. These three communities will
account for over 70 percent of the county’s 48,890 new households. Fairfield will undergo the
most growth, with 14,800 new households. Vacaville will add 11,050 households, and Vallejo
(an older community) expects to add 8,700 households. (Association of Bay Area Governments,
1999.)
Rio Vista will see the most dramatic change of the cities in Solano County. In fact, Rio Vista will
experience the largest percentage increase in population and households in the region.

In July 1994, the Solano County Board of Supervisors adopted the Orderly Growth Initiative
that restricts development on agricultural land outside cities. This action extended policies
initiated in Measure A, which were due to expire in 1995. Cities are allowed to annex
agricultural land only if it is contiguous to that city’s municipal limits. In addition, the
formation of a new town would require a vote of the electorate. Consequently, ABAG does not
project that significant development will occur outside Solano County’s existing cities.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate, safe, comfortable and affordable housing to all economic and social
segments of the City of Rio Vista is constrained by a combination of economic, social, and
institutional factors. Homebuilders, including for-profit developers, non-profit housing
organizations, and governmental agencies, require both the resources and a working
environment that is conducive to building homes according to the needs identified by each type
of homebuilder. In any community, the construction of homes is constrained by a combination
of housing standards (the regulatory requirements for housing conditions) and market demand
(the ability of households to expend resources on housing according to the supply and cost of
housing). Providing a variety of housing standards or a variety of market choices (choices other
than housing type, such as purchasing power or location) will greatly minimize these

constraints. Through this Housing element, the General Plan as a whole, and other means, the
City of Rio Vista seeks to provide this essential variety.
Governmental and non-governmental constraints to the housing supply are discussed below.

          GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental policies and regulations can constrain future residential development to varying
degrees by imposing requirements and limitations on such development. These actions in turn
can affect the cost of housing. Generally, governmental constraints include land development
controls, development processing procedures and fees, the amount of vacant land designated or
zoned for residential use in the various density categories, and requirements for the provision
of services and facilities. In addition, compliance with the regulatory requirements associated
with Air Quality Management Plans, Congestion Management Plans, the Endangered Species
Act and the Clean Water Act, contributes to increased costs of housing construction in the local
area.
In the absence of governmental controls, theoretically the free market would provide some type
of housing for everyone in need of shelter; however, community standards for health, safety
and development patterns require that housing meet certain objectives for construction. These
community standards, expressed in governmental regulations, are “popular” in that they
represent the community at large, and no substantial portion of the community desires housing
that is below these standards. Furthermore, the majority of the community “demands” that no
housing below these standards be constructed even for those whose resources are insufficient to
pay the costs of meeting these standards. In addition, the City of Rio Vista’s building code,
zoning, and other land use controls provide for a range of housing types and densities to ensure
that housing affordability and choice is maximized.
          APPROVAL PROCESS
Minor residential subdivisions are generally processed in 9-12 weeks. Larger development
applications may take between 6 and 12 months to process, depending on the nature of
environmental review required. The City’s Zoning Ordinance requires that all commercial,
multi-family (over two units), and new subdivisions be reviewed for compliance with general
community design standards for site planning concerns such as circulation, orientation of
buildings, location and visibility of common areas, and landscaping. Building architecture is
also reviewed for general principles. Individual single-family homes are reviewed at the staff
level; the City’s Planning Commission reviews other developments. Rio Vista’s process is
similar to that in other nearby communities. The process may be slightly less cumbersome than
typical in Solano County, in that there is no discretionary review body other than the Planning
Commission to increases the procedural requirements of this process. Further, the Development
Agreement and planned unit development (PUD) process has been used to establish
administrative review within these projects where more specific design criteria have been
established. This one-stop review minimizes procedural requirements and processing time. The
processing times and procedures in Rio Vista are typical of those in most Bay Area communities
and do not pose undue constraints to residential development.
The residential architectural standards described in the Community Character and Design
Element for both single and multifamily developments are for the most part, typical of Solano
County cities. Review criteria include such items as building articulation, façade elements and
details that create interest, shade and shadow, a strong sense of entry and orientation to public
streets and rights of way. Elements such as bays, porches, eaves and similar features are
encouraged.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    6-35                                        Housing
July 18, 2002

Where the Rio Vista standards are somewhat unique is their requirement for single family
front-facing garages to be set back to at least 30 feet. At the same time, front walls are allowed a
reduced setback of 15 feet and porches and design features may be placed as close as 10 feet to
the front property line. This accomplishes three objectives: a more pedestrian – friendly
streetscape is created by reducing the impact of the garage and auto domination; makes
narrower lots allowable by right, so long as overall density requirements are met; allows more
parking on the lot, thereby reducing the need for on-street parking; and thereby allows for a
narrower street right of way and less paving. The overall effect of this requirement probably
reduces cost by allowing the narrower roadway widths, which should more than offset the
additional driveway length required for the greater garage setback. The reduced roadway
widths are allowed for public as well as private streets, as long as the garage standards are met.
Overall, the standards are designed to allow higher than “typical” densities through better
design, while reducing infrastructure costs. Processing time is reduced by avoiding the need to
use private streets to take advantage of the reduced widths.
          FARMWORKER HOUSING NEEDS
While the permanent farmworker population has the same needs as other lower income
households, the migrant population is somewhat different. In particular, temporary housing is
needed for families that travel together, as well as the opportunity for workers without families
present to be housed during their seasonal employment. Boarding houses have traditionally
provided shelter for seasonal or temporary workers, as have dormitories or simple rooms for
rent in single family homes. The Rio Vista Zoning Ordinance currently allows boarding houses
in multi-family zoning districts. ‘Carriage houses” or rooms for rent without kitchen facilities
are allowed in single family districts as well. The review of the zoning and subdivision
ordinances (IM H-2) and the residential land use inventory will provide an opportunity for
assessment of appropriate locations for these types of facilities. Boarding houses or rooms for
rent may be considered in a similar fashion as group homes, with such arrangements for up to 6
(or some other number) individuals allowed in single family, as well as multifamily districts.
          ARTICLE 34 REFERENDUM
The City would request authority from City voters by means of an Article 34 Referendum if the
City’s involvement in an affordable project through liens, ownership, or management is
deemed necessary. The referendum requires that voter approval must be obtained before any
public entity undertakes programs to own, manage, or finance housing where more than 49
percent of the units are reserved for low-income affordable housing. If, during the
implementation of the City’s affordable housing programs, it became apparent that direct City
involvement would be required to successfully complete a project, the City would place an
Article 34 Referendum on the next scheduled ballot for voter approval.
          PERMITS AND FEES
Building permits must be secured before commencement of any construction, reconstruction,
conversion, alteration, or addition. Approval of permit applications is based on conformity
with the Zoning Ordinance, although the City has the power to grant variances from the terms
of the ordinance within the limitations provided in the ordinance.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      6-36                                          Housing

Development processing and permit fees and exactions add to housing construction costs.
Planning, building, and growth impact fees assessed by Solano County jurisdictions are among
the highest in the region according to a study of the Bay Area Council. In general, however,
permit fees are typically high in rapidly growing communities, as supporting infrastructure is
not in place and must be provided by new development. The City of Rio Vista fees for
construction of a typical single-family home within development agreement projects are
approximately $26,000 for transportation improvements, municipal facilities, water, drainage
and wastewater facilities, and other public facilities and services. The City of Rio Vista’s fees for
new residential development are generally lower than fees charged in other cities in Solano
County, and in most cities in growth corridors of the San Francisco Bay Area. (The average fee
for City services in central Solano and eastern Contra Costa County, not counting school fees, is
about $30,000.)
In addition to the City’s fees, Solano County charges a public facilities fee of $2,395 for public
facilities and services needed in response to rapid growth in Solano County. In addition to City
and County fees, a school impact fee is required for each residential unit, currently set by the
River Delta Unified School District at about $3.00 per square foot of habitable floor space
The total fee for new construction of a 1,500-sq. ft., three-bedroom home in Rio Vista is about
$32,000. In the neighboring communities, the equivalent fees are in the upper $30,000s and low
$40,000s. A typical two-bedroom, multi-family unit of 800 sq. ft. would be expected to require
about $30,000 in fees. Therefore, Rio Vista continues to be a bargain compared to fee structures
in nearby communities. Table 6-14 compares residential fees and taxes in Rio Vista to those in
nearby communities.

           SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
General standards for off-site improvements, such as streets, sidewalks, bikeways, and street
lighting, re established in the City’s Standard Plans and Specifications, established under the
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                6-37                                                          Housing
July 18, 2002

Subdivision Ordinance and updated periodically. The minimum width for streets in a
residential development is 36 feet from curb to curb. Exceptions are made only for existing
public alleys, which must be a minimum of 20 feet wide. This street width is a standard
requirement in Solano County and is typical of most neighboring communities (Fairfield,
Vacaville, and Suisun City).
With the advent of newer development approaches, such as “smart growth,” “performance
regulations,” and “New Urbanism,” a number of California communities are re-thinking the
conventional wisdom of these standards. Streets of the typical standard tend to accommodate
higher automobile speeds, are devoid of public landscaping or street trees, do not relate to the
density of the neighborhood or the amount of auto traffic anticipated, and place an additional
burden on low-income residents by eliminating alternatives and increasing reliance on more
expensive automobile transportation. The performance street standards proposed by the
policies of the Circulation & Mobility and the Community Character & Design elements call for
narrow streets where density and traffic considerations allow, multiple connections to
destinations, and shorter blocks to foster easier walking and transit access. The Standard Plans
and Specifications will need to be amended to provide for these alternative street standards (see
the Land Use, Community Character & Design, and Circulation & Mobility elements). In the
meantime, larger projects will be encouraged to use the performance standards through the
Development Agreement and PUD procedure.
As in most Bay Area communities, developers are expected to pay the cost of water and sewer
connections and a share of the costs of any expansion of water or sewage treatment facilities
necessitated by development. These required improvements do not exceed the standards
typically found in the Bay Area and do not constitute undue development constraints.
          LAND USE CONTROLS
Land development controls include policies and regulations contained in the City’s General
Plan, Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances, and building codes.
In 1991, the City of Rio Vista approved significant amendments to its General Plan, which
created the capacity for some 8,000 dwelling units on over 2,300 acres of newly annexed land.
The Trilogy, Homecoming, Brann and Gibbs Ranches and the Esperson property all were part
of those amendments and annexations. The River Walk property (Seeno) was annexed in 1981.
The comprehensive amendments now being undertaken do not remove or “downzone” any of
these properties from their previous land use designations or capacities for residential
development (see the Development Constraints & Boundaries and the Land Use elements).
Constraints to housing development imposed by the General Plan have been largely eliminated
as a result. To the contrary, the Plan recognizes and incorporates in the Land Use Element,
conceptual plans prepared for some of these projects.
The City of Rio Vista Zoning Ordinance designates land uses, height, bulk, density and parking
standards throughout the City. The Zoning Ordinance was designed for consistency with the
General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance provides a variety of residential use designations with
densities ranging from 0.1 to 28 dwelling units per acre. The ordinance has not been
comprehensively updated since its adoption; although a number of amendments have occurred
as required by circumstances over the years, its basic format still dates from 1966.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    6-38                                       Housing
July 18, 2002

In terms of specific requirements, Rio Vista has a minimum site area per unit of 6,000 sq. ft. in
single-family residential districts, 3,000 sq. ft. on sites zoned for duplexes and triplexes and
1,500 sq. ft. for multi-family residences. Lot coverage is limited to 40 percent in single-family
areas, 50 percent for duplexes and triplexes, and 60 percent on sites zoned for multi-family
residential use. Parcels zoned for single-family homes and duplexes require a 5-foot side yard
setback, 15 feet in the rear yard and 20 feet in the front. Triplexes and multi-family residences
require setbacks of 15 feet in the front, 10 feet in the rear yard, and 5 feet on the side. Minimum
parking requirements are one covered parking space for each single-family dwelling and one
and one-half spaces for each duplex or multi-family dwelling unit.
California Government Code Section 65915 requires cities to grant a density bonus of up to
25 percent, or provide other incentives of equivalent financial value, if the developer agrees to
construct at least 25 percent of the total units of a housing development for low- and moderate-
income families. For example, the R-1 Single-family lot size can be reduced to 4,800 sq. ft.
through the use of the 25 percent density bonus. To date, however, the City has not received an
application involving a density bonus under Section 65915. Therefore, the State density bonus
program has not provided a sufficient incentive for the construction of affordable housing. This
is at least partly due to the fact that, because of lower land costs in Solano County and
particularly in the Rio Vista area, higher densities do not increase the affordability of housing as
much as higher densities would in more central locations in the Bay Area.
The Land Use and Community Character & Design elements of this General Plan provide for
constructing second dwelling units or carriage units in single-family developments. The Zoning
Ordinance allows for such units to be constructed either as part of a PUD or with a conditional
use permit.
A number of provisions of the Zoning Ordinance need to be amended to allow more efficiency
and flexibility, particularly in the historic pre-World War II neighborhoods. Two examples are
unintended restrictions on infill projects because of the 6,000 sq. ft. minimum lot sizes and
60-foot widths required by all of the multi-family zones; many existing lots in the pre-World
War II neighborhoods are less than 6,000 sq. ft. The ordinance also prohibits rehabilitation and
other measures to bring existing second dwelling units and a number of multi-family structures
into conformity because these are located in predominantly single-family blocks zoned R-1.
These problems mainly result from applying well intended but inappropriate conventional
zoning ordinance standards in historic neighborhoods. A new zoning category and approach to
infill development and the historic neighborhoods is needed.
The solution to almost all of the above constraints on affordable housing is a comprehensive
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that will address administrative, formatting, organization,
and substantive issues as one effort.
Table 6-15 shows the minimum lot sizes for the City’s single- and multi-family residential zone
classifications under the current Zoning Ordinance, with and without density bonuses.

          BUILDING CODES
The latest edition of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) is enforced in Rio Vista. The City’s
Building Department ensures that new residences, additions, and auxiliary structures meet all
of the latest construction and safety standards. Building permits are required for any
construction work. Rio Vista has no local building or construction code restrictions beyond
those prescribed by the UBC.
          CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
The City has adopted the Uniform Building Code, 1997 version. There are no additional local
codes which place additional requirements on permitting facilities for accommodating disabled
persons. At the same time, the City has not instituted programs aimed specifically at processing
or responding to requests for accommodations. Such requests are typically made through
permit inquiries for construction purposes or to various departments if other access issues are
involved (handicapped ramps on sidewalks, parking, etc.) While there is no program or policy
in place to proactively remove constraints on development or conversion of residential facilities
for disabled persons, there has not been any such constraints specifically demonstrated or called
to the City’s attention. Generally, the building permitting process treats the construction or
conversion of residential facilities to accommodate the disabled in the same manner as any
other construction – no special permits or processes are required for such construction. Ramps
or other exterior improvements simply need to meet building and fire codes. Typically, such
“architectural features or appurtenances” are allowed to encroach into a required setback by up
to 3 feet.
The City has not specifically reviewed the Zoning Ordinance or other land use policies with
respect to ADA. No apparent conflicts between local ordinances or practices and ADA have
been identified. The zoning ordinance does not have a process in place to identify reduced
parking demand for disabled or any other facilities; this is one of the issues that will be
addressed in the comprehensive ordinance review that is called out in Implementation Measure
H-2. With respect to occupancy, the zoning ordinance does not differentiate between unrelated

individuals and related individuals in a household for the purposed of determining compliance
with “single family” zoning districts. Special needs housing such as group homes do not have
specific siting requirements called out, such as distance separators, etc. Proximity or number of
other use-permitted facilities could be a consideration for group homes for over 6 persons,
which require a conditional use permit. There is no such requirement for permitted uses such as
group homes with 6 or fewer individuals.
The City did adopt a policy and process for considering requests for designating handicapped
parking spaces in residential neighborhoods, particularly for those older neighborhoods where
houses typically do not have a driveway off the fronting street and the garage may be detached
from the house. These requests are considered on a case-by-case basis, with the Police and
Public Works Departments having authority to grant the request without special permit,
provided the applicant demonstrates the need and is willing to pay to have the signage installed
and removed when the space is no longer needed.
The Zoning Ordinance currently allows group homes and related facilities accommodating up
to 6 persons as a permitted use in all residential and most commercial zones. Such uses are not
allowed in the C-3 (heavy/service commercial), C-2A (Airport Commercial), or industrial
zones. Such facilities are permitted in the C-1 (Neighborhood) and C-2 (General) commercial
zones, which include downtown. Group homes for more than 6 persons are allowed with a
conditional use permit in the same zoning districts as the smaller facilities. No special notices
are distributed for the permitted (less than 6 persons) facilities. For homes accommodating
more than 6 persons, the standard use permit legal notice is published in a newspaper of
general circulation and mailed to property owners located within a 300-foot radius of the
subject property, as required by State law. Accessory services such as vehicles, counseling
services or commercial kitchens are not required to receive a special permit except for routine
State or County Health Department requirements. Larger facilities that serve a larger home
(more than 6 persons) would be taken into consideration at the same time as the conditional use
permit.
          PUBLIC FACILITIES
To date, water supply has not been a significant concern. The environmental impact reports for
the major annexations in 1991 identified a large capacity in the aquifer used for Rio Vista’s
wells; these data were not updated. The Public Works Department is conducting an aquifer
study that will be completed by the end of 2001 (see the Public Facilities & Services element). Water
is not anticipated to be a significant constraint.
Wastewater treatment capacity is currently limited. Both the 1991 and this General Plan call for
a new Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant to be constructed north of Airport Road adjacent
to the municipal airport. The plant will serve the majority of the Esperson and River Walk
properties; portions of the industrial/employment areas east of Church Road; and all of the
Brann, Gibbs, and Trilogy projects. Currently, Trilogy is served by a temporary plant with an
approximate capacity of 0.2 million gallons per day, or enough for about 1,200 senior-restricted
homes. At current rates, the plant will accommodate Trilogy for about 3 more years.
The City recently has completed a programming phase for the new plant. California
Environmental Quality Act clearance is underway, and design is expected to begin by the end

of 2001. The plant is expected to be operational by late 2003 or early 2004. Municipal bond
financing will be used, backed by an assessment on the properties that will be served. The
participating developers will be provided credits against future sewer hookup fees.
The old Rio Vista wastewater plant is located on Beach Drive, south of the former Army
Reserve base. The plant currently is being upgraded and will provide enough capacity for the
existing community and Homecoming, Rio Vista Business Park, Vineyard Bluffs, and parts of
the Esperson property. Construction will be complete in November 2001.
          NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
          FINANCING AVAILABILITY AND INTEREST RATES
The availability of money or capital is a significant factor that can control both the cost and the
supply of housing. Two types of capital are involved in the housing market: (1) capital used by
developers for initial site preparation and construction, and (2) capital for financing the
purchase of units by homeowners and investors. For many prospective homeowners, high
interest rates can make home ownership infeasible because incomes are not adequate to meet
required mortgage payments. For builders, high interest rates translate to higher development
costs, which must in turn be passed on to the home buyer so that the builder can make a profit
from the development. Thus, while financing considerations may not constrict Rio Vista’s
housing supply at the present time, they could directly affect the affordability of the City’s
housing.
In general, financing for new residential development in Rio Vista currently is readily available
to established borrowers at reasonable interest rates. During the 1990s, interest rates for
conventional mortgages and construction loans ranged from 8 to 9 percent. Recently, however,
interest rates remain fairly low, at around 6–8 percent, and home ownership has become more
feasible for those households unable to qualify during the 1980s. Current permanent financing
rates are around 7.0 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages.
          LAND COSTS
Prices for residential land in the Rio Vista area are slightly less than those in other urbanized
areas of eastern Solano County and Yolo County, due to Rio Vista’s greater distance from other
urbanized areas and the interstate highway. Improved single-family lots in the city are
typically sold for about $40,000 to $65,000, depending on their size and location. Prices for
single-family or multi-family residential land that is unimproved (i.e., not currently served by
water, sewer, and other public services) are approximately $50,000–$75,000 per acre, when the
land is sold in parcels of 20 acres or more.
Land costs typically comprise about one-quarter of the total costs of residential development.
Because of the better efficiency of land utilization typically realized with multi-family
development, land costs for apartments are proportionately somewhat lower than costs for
single-family development.

July 18, 2002

          CONSTRUCTION COSTS
Construction material and labor costs have risen substantially in recent years. In Rio Vista,
residential construction costs (not including the costs of permits and fees) currently range from
$70 to $85 per square foot for single-family development and from $55 to $75 per square foot for
multi-family units. These figures are roughly comparable to construction costs in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
          MARKET RENTS AND THE PROJECTED COST OF NEW MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING
As noted in Table 6-16, low-income households that are renting are considered to be able to
afford up to $1,114 in monthly rent (including an allowance for utilities of $75 for a typical two-
bedroom unit). Typical rents for single-family homes range from around $1,000 to $1,300 for
standard homes and up to $1,600 for a “move-up” home. Clearly, most market-rate rental
housing is affordable to at least the upper third of the low-income group of households, even
considering the projected rent for new apartments (Table 6-16). Table 6-16 shows that the
projected new apartment rent is affordable to a household earning 50.4 percent of median
income. Almost all existing two-bedroom apartments ($800/month + $75 utilities) are
affordable to households earning 55 percent of median income.
Rio Vista existing multi-family rental rates and affordability are shown in Table 6-16. Table 6-17
shows the cost of development and required rent for a typical two-bedroom, 700-sq.-ft. new
unit. Allowing an additional $75 per month for utilities, the rental amount of $910 is affordable
to a low-income household earning approximately 71 percent of median income ($985 / 30% x
12 = $39,400 / $55,700 = 71%).

          REHABILITATION
Rehabilitation of deteriorated housing can achieve several objectives:
              Conserve affordable housing stock when the program is targeted to low- and
              moderate-income households.

              Preserve and strengthen neighborhoods; often, only a few or even one deteriorated
              house or apartment building dramatically affects the economic viability of a
              neighborhood. Allowing the problem to remain leads to further deterioration, while
              correcting the problem initiates revitalization.
              Preserve historically significant properties that are owned or occupied by low- and
              moderate-income households.
              Foster homeownership by low- and moderate-income households                   when
              rehabilitation programs allow participation by owner occupants.

Rio Vista received two CDBG grants and operated a rehabilitation program in the mid-1980s
through 1991. A goal in the Redevelopment Agency’s Implementation Plan is to pursue
rehabilitation efforts again, funding the program through local housing set-aside funds.
          UNIT CONSERVATION
Conservation is achieved when affordable units that would otherwise be lost to the housing
stock are retained through rehabilitation of structures that have begun to deteriorate;
replacement of demolished structures; prevention of rental units converting to owner
occupancy; and subsidy or other assistance to affordable units that are due to be sold or
refinanced, or which simply become unaffordable due to market pressures on rents. Rio Vista
used CDBG funds to rehabilitate about 20 single-family homes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Rehabilitation is a viable program for use of the Redevelopment Agency’s mandated housing
set-aside fund and possibly future CDBG grants. To date, there have been no requests for
conversion from rental properties to condominiums for the purpose of sale. The Subdivision
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                   6-44                         Housing
July 18, 2002

Ordinance contains requirements for such conversions; this ordinance should be reviewed and
revised, as needed.
Conservation of housing stock also can be achieved by removing regulatory barriers and other
constraints that threaten the viability of existing affordable housing. Rio Vista’s older and
historic neighborhoods, as well as downtown, contain a number of currently non-conforming
second dwelling units, multi-family structures, and mixed-use housing that is not allowed
under the current Zoning Ordinance. Some of these units were constructed prior to current
codes and ordinances; others were “bootlegged” or constructed illegally and do not meet
current building or safety codes, as well as zoning. Not only are these units threatened by
prevention of rebuilding in the future, but also the owners of the units constructed illegally do
not even have the option of making them legal by repairing or upgrading to correct safety
violations. The Zoning Ordinance will be revised to be consistent with the General Plan in a
number of areas. These existing units should be allowed by right and encouraged to be brought
into compliance with health and safety codes.
RESIDENTIAL LAND INVENTORY
Table 6- 18 shows the potential capacity of vacant infill sites and undeveloped lands that are
currently zoned or entitled, and are expected to continue or begin development within the
period covered by this Housing Element. Table 6-19 shows the capacity for multi-family units in
the Town Center District (Trilogy, Esperson, and River Walk) and in the Gibbs Ranch.
          OTHER HOUSING SITES/CAPACITY
Affordable housing needs may also be met by other means, such as second units, manufactured
housing or mobile homes, or single-family homes on smaller lots (including duplex lots and
attached units and especially where these are for rent). The same number of rehabilitated
single-family homes and second dwelling units in the downtown and historic area are expected
to be completed in the remainder of the planning period as has occurred over the past several
years (around 20 total).
RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION
 Energy conservation can be encouraged by a variety of measures, including simply continuing
to enforce State energy efficiency measures currently required by the State of California
(Title 24). Other measures include using CDBG or other grant funds and local Redevelopment
funds for weatherization for low-income households, and encouraging solar orientation and
passive solar measures during subdivision and architectural review.
EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
Although the City discourages discrimination of any kind, a formal policy statement
prohibiting discriminatory and unfair housing practices within the City should be adopted. A
procedure should be developed to provide for a mechanism through which aggrieved parties
can notify the City of unfair housing practices and through which the City can in turn contact
the appropriate local, state, or federal agencies.

Infill sites with constraints rating “A” (no zoning change necessary, land use conflicts unlikely),
will have priority for targeting housing assistance programs to facilitate development, as these
have the most immediate potential for development. Infill sites rated “B” will have priority for
rezoning as land use conflicts unlikely and these sites would be consistent with other General
Plan elements with the proposed rezoning. Larger development parcels are all rated “A” and
development is expected to be initiated during the planning period. Sites 10, 11 and 14,
Esperson, Riverwalk and Trilogy, are the sites within which the NC, Neighborhood Core
District is located. The NS, Neighborhood Service, district is located in Site 13, the Brann Ranch.
(Refer to Policies 6.1.B, D. and E., 6.3.C., D. and F.,6.5.A. and B., 6.6.A., and 6.7.E. and
Implementation Measures H-2 and H-11.)
All of the infill sites together have the potential to accommodate up to 385 multiple family units
when necessary rezonings are accomplished. The new development sites (10 – 14) are able to
accommodate between 787 and 1,125 multiple family units. The multifamily sites are most
likely to accommodate the City’s regional share of low and very low income households, as
multiple family housing is expected to be necessary to reach these affordability levels.
Zoning categories most likely to accommodate multifamily development on infill sites are the
R-3 and R-4 zoning districts. Although R-2 accommodates duplexes and other “medium
density” housing, the maximum density allowed in this zone is 14/acre, typically less than can
be achieved with 2- or 3-story apartment development. R-3 and R-4 are identical in residential
requirements (density, setbacks, etc.) The difference is that R-4 is used in limited locations in the
downtown area where mixed uses (small office, etc.) can be accommodated with a conditional
use permit. Multifamily development at up to 29.1 DU/acre is allowed by right in both R-3 and
R-4 zoning districts.
In the new development areas (sites 10 – 14), large tracts have been approved through the PUD
(planned unit development) process. These sites have been given a base zoning designation that
reflects this, along with the density of the total site, regardless of the types of housing allowed.
For example, the Marks Ranch PUD and Development Agreement (Trilogy) allow for several lot
sizes, detached and attached housing (including multifamily), recreation, nonresidential and
open space uses, all within the single R1/PUD designation. The “R1” part of the abbreviation
only indicates that the total units developed on the 800+ acre site will not exceed the maximum
allowed in R-1 (7 DU/acre or up to 5,600+) for the entire project. The development agreement
specifically calls for at least 10 acres to be developed for multifamily uses (up to 291 multifamily
apartments). The R-1/PUD designation therefore allows for more multifamily to be constructed
without the need for a zoning change. The other sites that have this designation are similar; all
can develop multifamily without a zone change. The Gibbs Ranch development agreement also
requires at least 10% of the total units to be multifamily.

For conservative estimates, the projected net densities shown in Table 6-19 represent the
potential for several housing types and a combination of both R-2 and R-3 zoning densities.
Actual densities and zoning will be determined as development proposals come forward.
Under the requirements of the Land Use Element, at least 25% of the land area within the NC,
Neighborhood Core District must be developed as multifamily housing, with a minimum gross
density of 12 DU/acre for the entire residential portion of the NC district.
MONITORING PROGRAM
           ANNUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Housing element policies and implementation programs will be effective only if their progress
is routinely reviewed and analyzed. OPR now requires an annual evaluation of the General
Plan. It would be a small additional step to include a review of the progress toward achieving
Housing element objectives. Such an analysis should include a review of progress of responsible
agencies and departments toward meeting timing and funding commitments for implementing
actions, as well as the number of housing units provided or other measurable indicators
achieved for each measure that has been put into place. For example, if the objective for
rehabilitation is completing 5 homes by year 2 and only 2 have been completed, the analysis
should attempt to evaluate the reasons for the lack of performance and the potential for
achieving its goals in future years.
           MONITORING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
It is anticipated that development agreements will be a key tool to foster affordable housing in
future projects, particularly for the undeveloped lands in large property holdings. Monitoring
will be critical to ensure that the requirements of the agreements are being met as these
developments proceed. The monitoring should take place as a part of the development process;
for example, final maps should reflect phasing schedules spelled out in the agreements for a
variety of housing types and lot sizes.

              completed, the properties will be
              redesignated to their permanent zoning
              districts, consistent with R-3 densities.

G.        Implementing Actions for Housing (H)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Housing element. As a requirement of State Housing Law, each of the
implementing actions is assigned “Responsibility, Time Frame, and Funding Source(s)” within
the Housing Element.              Also included are the City’s Quantified Objectives for each
implementing action, as appropriate. The responsibility, time frame and funding source(s)
assigned to implementing actions in all other elements are identified in the Summary Matrix of
this General Plan.
H-1                GENERAL PLAN REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will ensure that residential development projects are consistent with the goals and
policies of its General Plan. The availability of residential land can be ensured by periodically
reviewing the City’s urban growth boundary and sphere of influence as designated in the
General Plan. (Note: The current city limits affords sufficient land for complete buildout of the
Association of Bay Area Governments’ 20-year growth projections to the end of this General
Plan horizon [2020]. It is not anticipated that additional annexations will be needed within this
Housing element’s planning horizon [2006].)

H-2                ZONING ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
To ensure that the Zoning Ordinance works in conjunction with General Plan policies to achieve
housing and other City objectives, the City will review and modify its Zoning Ordinance on an
ongoing basis. The review and revisions will be completed by mid- 2003.
The Zoning Ordinance update will include such modifications as revisions to the conventional
zoning ordinance districts within the historic neighborhoods; recognition of second dwelling
units and multi-family structures, and revisions to setbacks and design standards for historic
structures. These criteria would provide for adequate living conditions and “fit” with
neighborhood character. Modifications also would remove the “non-conforming” status of
existing second dwelling units, multi-family buildings on corner lots, or infill sites that
otherwise could accommodate affordable housing units that are appropriate to these
neighborhoods.            Specific accommodations will be made for farmworker housing
(boardinghouses, dormitories, “rooms for rent” and incentives for such housing in multifamily
districts). These facilities may be considered in a similar fashion as group homes. The Ordinance
will be reviewed for consistency with California Health and Safety Code Section 17021.6.
Upon completion of the Residential Land Use Inventory Update (H-11), the City will rezone any
single-family-zoned vacant infill lots for potential redevelopment or additional development of
affordable “cottage single-family” or multi-family units. The infill sites identified in Table 6-18
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          6-61                                   Housing
July 18, 2002

as having the potential for accommodating multifamily residential with rezoning (“B”
constraints rating) will be assigned first priority for review and rezoning.
The ordinance will be reviewed for compliance with SB 520, to ensure that potential
impediments or constraints on disabled-accessible housing or facilities are revised or removed.
Other revisions to the Zoning Ordinance will be made, as appropriate, to promote flexibility in
densities and uses.
Consistency rezoning will be initiated in the NC and NS districts immediately upon completion
of the General Plan. At least 25% of the land area in these districts (approximately 35 acres total)
will be rezoned to R-3. The balance of the residential land in these districts will be rezoned to R-
2.
The City will rezone or revise existing C-2 zoning to encourage upstairs or “back of the store”
living units in downtown commercial areas, where vacant or underutilized space exists,
consistent with the Land Use element.
The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to define those conditions under which the conversion
of rental units to condominiums would be permitted. The City will prohibit the conversion of
rental units to condominiums unless the City’s vacancy rate is greater than 5 percent.

H-3                SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
By mid-2003, the City will complete its review and update of the Subdivision Ordinance. With
properly developed and updated subdivision standards, the ordinance can help reduce the
costs of development while balancing basic environmental, health, and safety needs. Since the
high cost of land is a major factor in the overall cost of housing development, reducing
allowable lot sizes can contribute substantially to a reduction in total housing costs (i.e., lower
per-unit land and infrastructure improvement costs due to higher densities).
The City will include requirements and criteria in the Subdivision Ordinance for converting
rental apartments into condominiums or cooperative projects (e.g., maintaining a minimum
percentage or number of rental units and a minimum vacancy rate before conversions can
occur).

H-4                STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS
                   (Existing)
The City will pursue and continue to participate in the state and federal programs listed below.
(See the discussion under “State and Federal Programs” in the “Setting” section for a description of these
programs.) The City will consider additional programs, depending on the availability of
funding, Rio Vista’s eligibility for such funding, and the identification of eligible projects. State
and federal programs include:
          Community Development Block Grant (federal): The City will apply for additional
          funding for multifamily new construction and single and multifamily rehabilitation
          funds, on an annual basis, as funding availability is announced. The applications will be
          submitted under the Small Cities program administered by the Department of Housing
          and Community Development (HCD). The City will also pursue, with Solano County
          and other cities in the county, the potential for combining to reach entitlement funding
          status, so that an ongoing, reliable CDBG funding can be achieved.
          Section 8 (federal) : The City will continue to work with Solano County and the Vallejo
          Housing Authority to expand the number of Section 8 certificates and vouchers
          available to Rio Vista residents. The Community Development Department will
          coordinate with the Solano County Department of Environmental Management, the
          disseminating of information about the availability and procedure for accessing Section
          8. The City will establish an information clearinghouse and referral service for Section 8
          and other County housing assistance programs.
          State Home Ownership Program (state) : The Community Development Department
          will identify potential project(s) eligible for this program and apply for funding when
          and if a project is identified. This funding source will be combined with others if
          possible. The Community development Department will encourage both for-profit and
          non-profit developers to structure projects that are eligible for funding under this
          program, as development review proceeds. Likely projects for participation are
          Riverwalk (Seeno), Esprerson property, Brann and Gibbs Ranch. Applications will be
          developed within one year of tentative map approvals.
          Residential Energy Conservation (state): The Community development Department will
          identify opportunities for participation in this program by 2003. Projects and
          applications to be developed by 2004.
          Residential Energy Conservation (state)
          Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) (federal) : The City will encourage local banks
          (Bank of Rio Vista and Bank of Stockton) to participate with the City in providing the
          private financing in conjunction with public funds, for affordable housing in all City
          neighborhoods. For example, CDBG and/or Redevelopment housing setaside funds
          may be used to write down interest rates, provide down payments, or otherwise assist
          affordable housing. In order for such programs to work, the resources of local banks are
          needed to fund and administer the private portions of the loans or mortgages that will
          allow construction to proceed. By participating with such programs, the local banks will
          be taking steps to meet their CRA lending obligations.

Private and Redevelopment set-aside housing subsidies will be made available to sites in
neighborhoods throughout the City to avoid over-concentration of low-income housing. The
City will pursue and continue to participate in the following local programs (for a description of
these programs, see discussions in the “Setting” section under “State and Federal Programs,
“Redevelopment Agency,” and “Private Programs”):
          •   Mortgage Credit Certificate

H-6                CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop a 5-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for all City public capital
projects. The CIP will identify priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction,
and operations. The City will use the CIP to ensure that adequate public facilities are provided
in order to accommodate the projected housing production anticipated in all elements of the
General Plan. One of the first priorities of the CIP will be to provide for construction of the
Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant, projected to be operational by the 2003-04 fiscal year.
The CIP will be developed in conjunction with the City and Redevelopment Agency budget,
and will cover a period of 5 years from its inception. The CIP will be reviewed, amended, and
adopted with the budget on an annual or biannual basis, as applicable. The CIP will include
Redevelopment and grant-funded projects, as well as projects funded from local revenue
sources.

The City will use development agreements for all housing projects that are subject to
affordability requirements. These agreements will identify (1) the number of affordable units to
be constructed, (2) the unit sales or rental price, (3) the income group to whom the units will be
affordable, and (4) the length of time the units will remain affordable.

              Four bedrooms              8.0 persons per household
If adequate subsidies are not available to assist in achieving the 20 percent affordable housing
requirement at the time of project construction, additional time may be given for the City and
the developer to assemble the necessary financing.
In all cases where in-lieu fees are used as an alternative to producing affordable units, the
Community Development Department will review the projects based on (1) good faith effort by
the owner to use all available subsidies, and (2) the type of project and its ability to absorb the
affordable units.
The City will annually review all development agreements for compliance with affordability
provisions. Any property owner who fails to comply with the requirements of a development
agreement may be found by the City Council to be in default of the agreement.
Financial incentives for developers to enter into affordable housing agreements include
Redevelopment housing funds (H-12), other local programs (H-5), State and Local programs (H-
4). Regulatory incentives include the vesting of land use rights and development standards
accorded to the development for a long period of time (usually 10+ years) and the application of
those rights to all parts of the project, both assisted and market rate.

development agreements (see H-7 above) will identify programs that will be implemented to
meet the 20 percent affordable housing requirement goals (for projects with ≥400 dwellings).
Development agreements will provide for mixed-use development, wherever applicable, to
help achieve the City’s affordable housing objectives. The agreements will specify the type of
units, income ranges, and parcel-by-parcel obligations. The agreements will describe strategies,
including landowner obligations, funding, and subsidies. A provision for payment of in-lieu
fees may be included, if appropriate.

          The City will develop and implement a density bonus program to help create affordable
          housing units without a direct cash outlay by the local government. This program will
          provide a property owner with the ability to increase the income and, therefore, the
          value of a property by allowing the developer to build more income-producing units
          than allowed under the base zoning. This increased income then can be used to help
          subsidize below-market rental rates for very low- and low-income households and to
          purchase housing for middle-income households. The City will also allow additional or
          equivalent incentives as allowed by State law when it is demonstrated that such
          incentives are necessary to make the project financially feasible and/or the project’s
          physical or social characteristics warrant such incentives. Such incentives include but are
          not limited to the following:
              Reductions or modifications in setbacks, lot dimensions or area, coverage, height,
              parking, street standards, etc.;
              Density bonus of more than 25%;
              Reductions, deferral or modifications of City and County impact fees or assistance in
              payment of such fees;
              Direct financial assistance through public funds such as redevelopment housing
              setaside funds, CDBG funds, Section 8 or other sources.

such as downtown and the historic residential neighborhoods between Highway 12 and
Bruning Avenue. The City will use all potential sources of public and private housing funding
for repairs and upgrades. Twenty percent of the tax increment generated by the Redevelopment
Agency’s program will go into the Redevelopment Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund.
The fund will be utilized to assist the production of 15% of all units produced in the boundaries
of the Agency as affordable to lower income households. This ratio (at least 15% affordable to
lower income households and 6% affordable to very low income households) will be provided
in each major development site, particularly the Riverwalk project and other large infill sites
subject to Agency authority.

H-18               MONITORING PROGRAM
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City of Rio Vista will implement its monitoring program, as described in greater detail in
the “Monitoring Program” section. The Monitoring Program provides mechanisms by which
the City can periodically assess housing needs. The Annual Housing Supply Report, which is a
part of this program, will annually evaluate the City’s residential vacancy rate to determine
whether the rate is contributing to decreased housing affordability. The Monitoring Program
also includes an annual Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Fund review (part of the annual
City audit); annual housing price/rental rates survey; annual affordable housing performance
analysis (part of the annual General Plan progress report required by Govt. Code
Section 65400); and biannual specific plan area, planned unit development, and development
agreement monitoring reports.

H-19               PUBLIC AWARENESS/EDUCATION PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will educate its citizens regarding the necessity of providing the affordable housing
needed to support the job growth occurring in Rio Vista. Specifically, this information will focus
on the need to provide affordable housing close to jobs—in an effort to reduce the traffic and air
quality impacts that result from long commutes.
In addition, programs will target community opposition to affordable housing projects—in an
effort to remove negative perceptions. Education will occur through public hearings;
presentations to various service organizations and other community groups; and articles
published in the local newspaper, the City’s newsletter, and the Chamber of Commerce
newsletter.

H-20               PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
                   (Existing)
The City will work closely with the business and development communities toward achieving
the City’s affordable housing goals, including housing for special needs groups. The City has
identified the following specific roles in this partnership to provide affordable housing:
          City of Rio Vista - The City will maximize potential funds available through existing
          state, federal, and local programs for its affordable housing program.
          Development Community - The City will encourage private developers and property
          owners to cooperate in financing sewer plant construction as a means of facilitating
          development. The City will also allow additional or equivalent incentives as allowed by
          State law when it is demonstrated that such incentives are necessary to make the project
          financially feasible and/or the project’s physical or social characteristics warrant such
          incentives. Such incentives include but are not limited to the following:
              Reductions or modifications in setbacks, lot dimensions or area, coverage, height,
              parking, street standards, etc.;
              Density bonus of more than 25%;
              Reductions, deferral or modifications of City and County impact fees or assistance in
              payment of such fees;
              Direct financial assistance through public funds such as redevelopment housing
              setaside funds, CDBG funds, Section 8 or other sources.
          Business Community - The City will assist local non-profit housing corporations or
          other such entities, as appropriate, to acquire and maintain privately owned,
          government subsidized housing that could convert to market rate under existing loan
          agreements.

July 18, 2002

          Housing Development Corporations - The City will work with non-profit and for-profit
          housing development corporations specializing in housing for various special needs
          groups, including adults 55 years of age and above, to accommodate housing that meets
          the needs of these groups. Emphasis will be on development of multi-family rental
          housing for older adults and the disabled with varying services and amenities, as
          identified in the City’s housing needs assessment. Examples include apartments with
          common areas designed specifically for social events of interest to older adults,
          independent living with common dining facilities, assisted care facilities, and skilled
          nursing facilities that will provide a continuum of care for senior residents of Rio Vista.
          The City will utilize many of the implementation measures discussed above to assist the
          development of both disabled-accessible and senior housing, including but not limited
          to, applying for state and federal funding and encouraging local banks to make private
          financing available (H-4), local funding, including Redevelopment housing setaside
          funds (H-5 and H-12), development agreements (H-7), and applying density bonuses
          and equivalent incentives to proposed projects (H-10).
          The City will contact local advocates, the California Housing Development Corporation,
          the Solano County Agricultural Commissioner and the Farm Bureau to identify sites and
          revise ordinances to facilitate construction of farmworker housing. Farmworker housing
          will be specifically designated as an allowed use in the Agricultural zoning district
          (Implementation Measure H-2).

H-22               DESIGN REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City will consider building orientation, ceiling height, street layout, lot design, landscaping,
and street tree configuration in subdivision review for the purposes of solar access and
energy/water conservation. The Design Review process also will be used to encourage
innovative housing types and design, and to allow mobile homes and factory-built housing
with permanent foundations that also meet all design review requirements to be placed on
residentially zoned parcels, pursuant to zoning and design review requirements. Finally, design
reviews will be used to ensure that historic structures are retained. The Planning Commission
will create a historic buildings and sites listing so that the design review process can be applied
to the identified structures and to allow for the application of the State’s Historic Building Code.

H-23               SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS GUIDELINES
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop guidelines to ensure that rental housing developments contain an
appropriate percentage of three- and four-bedroom dwelling units, as well as units which meet
the needs of farmworkers and other special needs groups identified in this Element. The
citywide goal for special needs groups will be based on the percentage of farmworkers, female
heads of households, persons with disabilities and large families as reported by the 1990 and
2000 Census (2000 will be used when the applicable data becomes available). To make the
development of such units financially feasible, the City will assist developers in applying for
available state and federal programs and redevelopment housing set-aside funds, if available, to
provide development subsidies (low-cost financing, land write-downs, or other incentives.). The
City also may provide density bonuses and consider fee reductions for developers who include
large-family units in rental housing developments. Any large-family and farmworker
requirements will be tied to the availability of these subsidies. The City’s large-family and
farmworker goals will not be applied as an absolute percentage requirement for each individual
development.

Chapter 7                    Economic Development
A.        Introduction
The Economic Development element establishes policies to maintain and enhance economic
development opportunities within a city and to define a long-term framework for sustainability.
This element addresses how Rio Vista can direct local resources to: (1) retain and assist local
business, (2) attract new industry, (3) focus efforts of the City on industrial sectors that are most
beneficial and attainable, and (4) use limited industrial land capacity effectively to maximize
jobs and services. The element identifies actions that will increase the City’s tax base and
support efforts to strengthen and diversify the local economy.
If Rio Vista is to sustain its community character, new economic development must be sensitive
to the environment and compatible with existing and planned land uses. Since the Sacramento
River provides a special area for commercial activity, services, and employment, maintaining
this working waterfront is essential to the economic vitality of the City.
Preserving Rio Vista’s sense of community and small-town character has been identified as a
core planning principle. Economic development provides residents the opportunity to live,
work, and shop in their community while reducing the amount of travel time in the family car.
The current character of Rio Vista also includes a large proportion of residents that are generally
concerned about the well-being of the community and involved and knowledgeable about civic
issues. This essential base of civic involvement is present and highly visible in today’s Rio Vista.
In many communities where high proportions of residents commute long distances to jobs, a
lower proportion of citizens are active in civic or community life. “Bedroom communities,”
where housing greatly outnumbers jobs within a reasonable distance, often are characterized by
a lower level of civic pride, neighborliness, and involvement in the community. As a result,
such communities also tend to have fewer essential services, institutions, and amenities—both
public and private—and may be perceived to be a less desirable place to live than more
balanced communities. These and other “quality of life” issues, such as environmental quality
and physical setting, in turn influence private sector employers when considering relocation or
expansion.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     7-1                               Economic Development
July 18, 2002

Economic development also creates revenues for the City’s use in providing public services.
Industrial, commercial, and office development affects the community’s fiscal health in the
following two ways:
     1. Cost. Generally, providing necessary public services for nonresidential development is
          substantially less costly because schools and most emergency service needs are directly
          related to 24-hour residents. In addition, housing typically takes up three to ten times
          more land area than required for nonresidential uses (depending on density).
     2. Revenues.           Commercial, office, and manufacturing development generates the
          following revenues to local government:
          •   Property tax. Property taxes for commercial, office, and manufacturing uses usually
              are higher than those for residential because of the greater expense, size, and
              complexity of commercial and industrial buildings.
          •   Sales tax. Taxable sales are associated with both retail and industrial businesses.
              Industrial sales tax may depend on whether the sale is actually recorded in the Rio
              Vista location or whether the company’s offices are elsewhere.
          •   Indirect revenues and additional business attraction. Industrial jobs pay wages
              and salaries that are spent, at least in part, in the local economy. Manufacturing
              supports and attracts other businesses needed for support goods and services, which
              in turn pay wages and salaries, and make purchases from other local businesses—
              both new and existing. This “multiplier” effect results in several times the
              purchasing power of the first dollar spent on wages eventually being spent on other
              goods and services, many of which are taxable.
The General Plan Land Use Map in Chapter 4 and the City’s Redevelopment Area (shown as
Figure 7-1) identify sites for commercial and industrial development at appropriate locations in
the planning area. Because of the need to minimize land use or environmental conflicts,
development costs at some sites will be higher than those at unconstrained alternative locations.
One purpose of the Economic Development element is to ensure that additional costs are not
imposed on new development because of unnecessary governmental constraints. In this
context, the City will act as a “development partner,” facilitating the approval process while
ensuring that environmental resources are protected, consistent with the General Plan.
To sustain its ability to provide public services for existing and future residents, the City will
need to enhance its revenue base through new retail, commercial, office, and industrial
development. Concurrently, the City must help local businesses grow and provide employment
for existing and future residents. A healthy, vital community can be sustained with a strong and
diverse local economy.

B.        Purpose and Authority
The Economic Development element is an optional element of the General Plan under
Government Code Section 65302, which states: “The General Plan may include any other
elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to
the physical development of the county or city.”
The Land Use element establishes the physical framework for development and addresses the
land use decisions that will help to achieve a jobs/housing balance, while the Circulation &
Mobility element provides for circulation system improvements that will serve new
development. The Circulation & Mobility element also includes policies for the Rio Vista
Airport, shipping, rail, and goods movement. Finally, the Housing element includes policies
and programs for affordable housing, which is also a vital component of economic
development.

C.        The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
The community vision and planning principles that most directly relate to the Economic
Development element are listed below.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
     The existing downtown and waterfront should be strengthened and retained as the central focus of
     the community. Cultural, civic, entertainment, and specialty retail uses--and supporting uses and
     activities should be located in the downtown and adjacent areas.
     Redevelopment of Rio Vista’s downtown and waterfront should create economic vitality and an
     atmosphere for walking and shopping. Historic building facades should be restored, and new projects
     should be linked to their surroundings.
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
     Commercial development along the Highway 12 corridor should not displace or preempt investment
     from the downtown or along the existing developed corridor.
CREATE AND MAINTAIN ECONOMIC VITALITY; PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO LIVE, WORK,
AND SHOP IN RIO VISTA
     The Rio Vista community should be planned for a balance of jobs and housing. Rio Vista should not
     become another bedroom suburb like so many neighboring communities.
     A broad range of housing should be available throughout the community to match job opportunities
     and community needs. No one style or price range of housing should take precedence over any other,
     so long as an adequate supply is available for each.
     Commercial development should occur in locations and configurations that complement existing
     business. New retail projects should:
     •    Provide goods and services not currently available or for which an unmet demand clearly exists;
          and
     •    Be sized in proportion to market demand.
PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES TO ALL RIO VISTANS IN
A FISCALLY HEALTHY AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER
     Growth should pay for itself. New development should ensure that sufficient public services are
     provided without additional burden to existing residents or over-extending current capacity.
     Rio Vista should continue its tradition of cooperation with private nonprofit agencies and other
     public agencies, to provide essential services for youth, seniors, the economically disadvantaged, and
     those in crisis.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          7-5                                Economic Development
July 18, 2002

     Adequate public facilities—sewer, water, transportation, public safety, parks, recreation, education,
     and others—should be in place or assured in a timely fashion before new development projects
     proceed.
     The Rio Vista Airport is a vital public facility and economic resource; new residential development
     must take steps to ensure that its viability is not threatened.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           7-6                             Economic Development
July 18, 2002

D.        Setting
Economic development is critical to most communities for the following purposes: the creation
of employment opportunities, the availability of an increasing choice of goods and services in
the community, and the creation of revenues to support local government services. In Rio Vista,
there are limited opportunities to physically accommodate commercial, service, and industrial
activities (land uses). The Land Use element focuses on regulatory requirements; this discussion
concentrates on vision and the type of economic activities desired in various locations, as well
as factors such as infrastructure that influence the overall climate for business attraction and
retention within the community. The map in Figure 7-2 illustrates lands with existing or
potential commercial and employment activities for the following types of development: retail
and commercial, highway commercial, service commercial/industrial, industrial,
redevelopment, and waterfront and the former Army Reserve Base area.
JOBS
          SOLANO COUNTY
During the 1980s, Solano County added 32,800 jobs—for an average annual growth rate of 3
percent. While the 1980s contained periods of expansion and contraction, overall job growth
was strong. The national recession of 1981 and 1982 substantially affected the County’s short-
term job growth. Only 2,100 jobs were added between 1981 and 1983. The economy recovered
rapidly from the recession. In only 2 years (1984 and 1985), the County added 7,300 new jobs.
This recovery clearly indicated the vitality and broadening base of the County’s industrial and
commercial businesses. (Association of Bay Area Governments, 1999)
          CITY OF RIO VISTA
Historically, much of the employment in and around Rio Vista has revolved around the natural
gas industry and gas exploration. For many decades, natural gas wells were abundant and so
were the supporting businesses that fed the industry. Merchants in equipment repair, sales and
service, well drilling, and some manufacturing contributed significantly to the City’s economy.
In the 1980s, the natural gas sector began to decline due to deregulation and changes in the
energy sector. Local companies closely tied to the gas industry were forced to shut down, and
most have not returned. The City experienced little growth in employment during the decade
that followed. Since most employers in Rio Vista were small, local firms serving a local or
regional market, the absence of substantial population growth in and around the City
hampered employment for these businesses. The lack of large parcels of land suited to
industrial and heavy commercial uses also hindered the City’s ability to attract firms serving a
regional, or larger, market area.

                             7-9 Economic Development
July 18, 2002
Recently, however, with an upturn in the economy and resurgence in the energy industry, Rio
Vista is beginning to experience dramatic changes in its economic growth. There is now a
strong jobs/housing balance as employment opportunities have increased and stabilized over
the years. In fact, presently there are more jobs than working residents.
HOUSING
Housing availability in all income ranges is crucial to attracting employment-generating
businesses. The Rio Vista Principles emphasize a range of housing types to accommodate all
income groups. The recent Homecoming subdivision provides for moderate-range single-
family housing. Also needed are opportunities for management/executive housing and housing
affordable to lower income families, especially quality rental units. Apartment or condominium
housing also may be appropriate for those who choose not to maintain a single-family home.
(Note: A much more detailed discussion of housing needs is found in the Housing element.)
RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
          DOWNTOWN
Due to Rio Vista’s geographic isolation from other communities (no other cities are within 10
miles), the City’s commerce traditionally has been conducted in the historic central business
district (CBD) and focused primarily on local services, river-oriented services and, to a lesser
extent, tourism. Downtown Rio Vista remains the hub of activity in the community where City
Hall, public safety offices, the senior center, library, post office, and private office uses are
currently located. At present, downtown Rio Vista has about 70 business establishments.
Several governmental agencies, including City Hall, and community-based organizations
maintain their offices in the downtown.
The City has received grants from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s
Transportation for Livable Communities Program and the Solano Transportation Authority for
streetscape improvements on Main Street. The project is expected to be completed by 2003.
          HIGHWAY 12/CHURCH ROAD
Highway 12/Church Road is a key intersection at the west end of Rio Vista. Three corners of
the intersection are within the city limits. This 55±-acre section of the City has been targeted for
mixed-use development.
          BRANN RANCH/CANRIGHT ROAD
The development area in the vicinity of the Brann Ranch/Canright Road intersection consists of
10± acres located in the northwest corner of Canright/Liberty Island Road. From a marketing
point of view, this is considered a poor location for a retail site.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      7-9                               Economic Development
July 18, 2002

HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
          HIGHWAY 12 (DROUIN DRIVE TO THE RIO VISTA BRIDGE)
Since World War II, the segment of Highway 12 between Drouin Drive and the Rio Vista Bridge
has developed with highway commercial services. Fast-food restaurants, gasoline stations,
motels, grocery stores, and convenience retail, have given this commercial area of the City a
classic “strip” character. Recent developments are McDonald’s/Chevron and Taco Bell/
Kentucky Fried Chicken.
There is substantial underutilized space at prime locations in this area. Pacific Gas and Electric
Company (PG&E) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) vehicle and
equipment maintenance yards comprise the major portion of this land. Together, these yards
could create a highly visible commercial development site at a prime location near the bridge.
SERVICE COMMERCIAL / INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
          RIVER ROAD / ST. FRANCIS DRIVE
The service commercial/industrial development area consists of approximately 200 acres
located north of Highway 12 to the city limits and west to St. Francis Drive. This first area of
industrial development began in the unincorporated County and now is entirely within city
limits. Storage, industry, and service commercial dominate the area, with a range of uses from
office to salvage and materials yards, gravel/sand quarries and even residential uses mixed in
near Airport Road. Some of the residential uses are incompatible with the nearby service or
salvage uses and exhibit characteristics typical of that situation (poorly designed or
inadequately maintained); other residences have mixed in with the industrial uses while
maintaining a reasonable living environment.
Large partially developed or underutilized parcels are found in this area, particularly south of
Airport Road. Former General Plan land use designations and the City’s Zoning Ordinance
considers River Road a “scenic corridor” because of its proximity to the river.
          AIRPORT ROAD / CHURCH ROAD
Approximately 5-10 acres across Airport Road from the Church Road intersection (on the north
side of Airport Road) serve as service commercial for the City. Currently, trucking operations,
storage, and some industrial uses are located at the site. This area of the City also provides
approximately 10 acres of service commercial land, currently occupied by a pipe and gas well
drilling materials yard on the east side of Church Road, approximately 1/4 mile south of
Airport Road. Residential development is planned for south of the area and east to Harris
Road, with City light industrial land to the north. The Trilogy development will provide
service commercial land to west across Church Road.
          MARKS RANCH / AIRPORT ROAD
Approximately 40 acres of service commercial land in a pie-shaped parcel extends from Church
Road west along Airport Road for approximately 1/2 mile; this site contains parking for Trilogy

recreational vehicles. The airport approach zones constrain the site to low-intensity commercial
or service uses.
A small 6-acre parcel adjacent to the boundary of the Gibbs Ranch near Liberty Island Road
also is limited by the airport to service commercial and low-intensity commercial/industrial
uses.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
Some new residential areas are near industrial lands or the Rio Vista Business Park, creating the
potential for land use conflicts.
          RIO VISTA BUSINESS PARK
In its efforts to expand economic opportunities within the City, Rio Vista has converted its
former municipal airport site to a publicly owned, privately leased industrial park. Initial
improvements to the 100±-acre site have included street, water, sewer, storm drainage, and
lighting improvements to serve 14 acres. All land and infrastructure improvements are owned
by the City. The utilities and roads in place serve about two-thirds of the site. Currently, four
parcels are developed with agriculture/processing, industrial, storage and service uses, and a
concrete batch plant. Primarily metal buildings have been constructed to date, with one
concrete tilt-up building (California Vegetable Specialties). Landscaping is minimal, and
construction meets basic architectural standards.
Businesses locating at the Business Park require large amounts of relatively inexpensive space,
with minimal up-front investment. Most of the businesses produce or assemble low-value
products in relation to the space they require and are not able to pay large up-front costs to
locate in Rio Vista. The development parcels must be conveyed through ground leases, due to
deed restrictions imposed in legislation that conveyed the site to Rio Vista from the State. This
makes long-term financing for new buildings more difficult than for sites conveyed in fee title
(ownership). Therefore, the ground lease rates and up-front development costs need to be
affordable.
          AIRPORT ROAD
Lands in the vicinity of Airport Road are the primary employment-generating areas in the
planning area. Approximately 180 acres comprise these areas—100 acres of existing
manufacturing (MG) north of Airport Road and east of Church Road, and an additional 80 acres
south of Airport Road, north of Harris Road, and east of Church Road. There is access from
Airport Road, Church Road, and Harris Road. Large parcels are readily available, with better
access than the former airport business park. A local road system is needed to create smaller
parcels.
          RIO VISTA MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
Rio Vista Municipal Airport has ample acreage for use as an Airport Industrial Park. This 12-
acre industrial or “airport commercial” park is ready to meet the current demand for office,
hangar, manufacturing, and storage space for business operations—with 4,100 square feet of
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                   7-11                             Economic Development
July 18, 2002

office/retail space available for lease. There is aircraft access to the runway and vehicular
access to Airport Road. Until recently, the airport has not been able to accommodate these
requests because of the lack of infrastructure. In addition, with the major residential
subdivision growth that is presently occurring, more hangar space is needed for corporate and
business users who are either relocating to or expanding their businesses in the Rio Vista area.
In response to this demand, the City has applied for and obtained $1.5 million in state and
federal grants to construct infrastructure improvements needed to attract and retain businesses
at the Airport. These include two new hangars, taxiway improvements, a 6,000 + square-foot
office building, building pads and utilities.
          GIBBS RANCH
Triangular -shaped parcel located northwest of Liberty Island Road, as designated by the Gibbs
Ranch Planned Unit Development (PUD) and Framework Plan. Access is provided from Liberty
Island Road. The property is approximately 20 acres, located in the “B” and “C” zones of the
Airport Land Use Plan (suitable for industrial and low-intensity commercial uses). The area
currently is designated for private open space/recreation uses but may be used for
commercial/industrial uses under the PUD and Development Agreement.
          BRANN RANCH
Access to Brann Ranch is provided from Liberty Island Road and Canright Road. The property
bisected by Canright Road contains areas that are restricted from residential uses by airport
zones but may have potential for industrial/employment uses. Some portions of this property
are restricted by floodplain, but a relatively large developable area (25—50 acres) remains.
Canright Road has been designated as a collector street in the Circulation & Mobility element.
          HIGHWAY 12/SUMMERSET DRIVE
A small industrial/storage/equipment yard was developed in the County some years ago. It
remains in operation. It is now part of the City but is not proposed for further development.
REDEVELOPMENT AREA
The City created a Redevelopment Agency in 1988. The redevelopment district boundaries are
shown in Figure 7-1. Redevelopment is widely used in California as a tool for implementing
economic development. The primary benefits of a Redevelopment Agency are the ability to
raise fund and finance infrastructure and other projects through tax increment financing; and
the ability to assemble sites for conveyance to private developers of commercial, industrial and
housing projects that benefit the community. Redevelopment activities focus on areas where
“blight” exists in the form of impediments to economic activity, such as lack of infrastructure,
disparate ownerships creating parcels that are difficult to develop, and lack of supporting
economic activity. Typical redevelopment projects are downtown revitalization, industrial park
development, infrastructure and amenities that facilitate development, and affordable housing.

July 18, 2002

Rio Vista previously used its redevelopment bonding capacity to facilitate the relocation of the
airport from its former site to the new airport, with the former site developed as a business
park.
WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT
Approximately 8 acres that extend along the Sacramento River on the east side of Front Street
between Main Street and Highway 12 define the Waterfront development area. The properties
along this stretch of the waterfront comprise two separate and distinct planning sections: one is
undeveloped (a large portion of which is City-owned); the other consists of aging, occupied
structures on private property with multiple owners.
The waterfront area has been considered a priority for comprehensive planning and
improvement since the 1970s. The General Plan 1990 for the Southeastern Solano County Planning
Areas (City of Rio Vista and Solano County Planning Commission, 1974) identified the area for
further study to determine suitable waterfront access and potential economic development
activities. This area is presently zoned as a “Study District” in which individual development
projects are to be part of a larger, more comprehensive plan. At every community forum,
including the General Plan update process, this riverfront area has been identified as a priority
for public access and improvements. Of particular concern are pedestrian access; community
identity opportunities; and a linkage between Main Street, Highway 12, and the Rio Vista
(Helen Madere) Bridge.
Consequently, the City began preparation of a Waterfront Plan that includes a conceptual
design for the promenade/boardwalk and suggests areas for placement of commercial building
envelopes. The plan also recommends specific capital improvement projects eligible for
funding with state and federal sources in an effort to expedite development of public
improvements.
FORMER ARMY RESERVE BASE
The U.S. Army Reserve Base in Rio Vista, an installation owned and operated by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers since 1911, was designated for closure under the Base Realignment and
Closure Act of 1995 (BRAC). The 28-acre site lies on the bank of the Sacramento River just south
of the Rio Vista city limits. A flat lower terrace contains most of the existing structures; the
upper terrace, about 15 feet higher and set back from the river, consists primarily of open areas.
The property will be transferred to the City of Rio Vista through the Department of Defense
under special federal legislation outside the BRAC process. The area represents a unique
community resource and amenity. A range of potential uses has been explored in the Rio Vista
Army Base Reuse Plan that was prepared in December 1998.
The Rio Vista Army Base Reuse Plan envisions using the majority of the former Army Reserve
site for public and recreational uses, ranging from a waterfront lodge and meeting center to
tennis and basketball courts; regulation soccer, softball, and baseball fields; and a multi-purpose
community center building. Public uses also include an environmental education and
interpretive center devoted to the Delta ecosystem. If developed as proposed, the facility would
become a prominent community-wide park and educational facility. This major amenity would

help to attract businesses to the area. As described in the “Outlook” section, a portion of the site
has the potential to become a significant regional scientific research center, operated by a
consortium of state and federal agencies conducting research on the Delta.

E.        Outlook
Estimated projections for population; housing; and retail, commercial, and industrial
development assume a buildout year of 2020. A number of factors affect whether these
assumptions are realistic. Private market conditions strongly influence future conditions. To
reach buildout of the existing city limits at the previously approved densities and land use mix
would require constructing almost 400 houses per year for the next 20 years. This rate of
construction appears unlikely for several reasons:
          •   Rio Vista is somewhat removed from “major” transportation corridors (Interstate 80
              [I-80] and Highway 12).
          •   Historically, Suisun City has averaged construction of approximately 300 homes per
              year since the early 1970s. Suisun City parallels Rio Vista in that its 1970 population
              was about 4,000; currently, the city’s population is approximately 26,000. The current
              population of Rio Visa is approximately 4,000 and is expected to increase to between
              22,000 and 24,000 during the planning period. Suisun City differs from Rio Vista in
              that the community is adjacent to Fairfield and I-80, 20 miles closer to the Bay Area
              employment centers.
          •   The presence of a larger community “next door” strengthened the local markets in
              the Solano County cities of Fairfield, Suisun, and Vacaville over the last 20 years.
              Such a neighboring larger community does not strengthen the local market in Rio
              Vista.
At present, housing construction in Trilogy and Homecoming total about 250 homes a year
during a very strong economic period for the building industry.
JOBS
          SOLANO COUNTY
Over the 20-year forecast period, Solano County will have the largest percentage of jobs growth
of any county in the Bay Area. The county’s location between the fast-growing Sacramento area
and the northern portion of the Bay Area affords a strong, long-term economic development
advantage. The closure of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard (in Vallejo) in the mid-1990s caused
significant employment reductions at the beginning of the forecast period. The County lost
about 9,500 jobs directly associated with Mare Island, and the impact of its closing will continue
to be felt throughout the decade. The closure of Mare Island resulted in a significant, but
localized, effect on the southern portion of the County’s economy. In the north, Vacaville and
Fairfield are already in a period of significant economic expansion. As a result, the County will
add about 6,000 jobs between 1995 and 2000 despite the losses due to Mare Island. (Association
of Bay Area Governments 1999.)
Between 2000 and 2010, Solano County will add almost 42,500 jobs. Nearly 40 percent of these
jobs will be in the service sector, and 16 percent will be in retail. Most of the growth in these
sectors will be located in Vacaville, Fairfield, and Vallejo—with Vallejo’s growth tied to the
reuse of Mare Island. (Association of Bay Area Governments 1999.)

July 18, 2002

Over the entire forecast, the county will add almost 81,300 jobs. Fairfield, Vallejo, and Vacaville
account for the majority of that growth, with over 64,000 jobs between the three areas. On a
percentage basis, Suisun City, and Rio Vista will see the most significant growth. (Association of
Bay Area Governments 1999.)
Between 2000 and 2020, employed residents will grow at an even faster pace than jobs. The
county will add 13,100 more employed residents than jobs during this period, reinforcing the
county’s residential character. (Association of Bay Area Governments 1999.)
Table 7-1 shows Solano County projections for jobs by industry type.
          CITY OF RIO VISTA
Table 7-2 summarizes employment information for Rio Vista, including employed residents,
total jobs, and types of jobs.
If current industrial development patterns and intensities continue, the industrially zoned lands
within the existing city limits will accommodate approximately 2,900 jobs. The number of
projected households at buildout with at least one employed person is estimated at
approximately 3,200 (not including Trilogy). This projection is slightly less than one job per
household (0.91). Limited manufacturing and office or service businesses may generate
additional employment in the downtown area. The industrial lands are assumed to
accommodate primary industries that manufacture or assemble goods for “export” out of the
community, bringing in revenues from outside sources that would not otherwise be spent here.
Many professional and office jobs support industries or households already in the community.
Table 7-3 shows projected demographic and employment changes for Rio Vista during 2000–
2010 and 2000–2020. Representative percentages for these changes also are indicated.
It is important to note that, although the City currently maintains a healthy jobs/housing
balance, with 0.9 job/employed resident and about 1.1 jobs/household, the ABAG projections
show the community falling far short of an acceptable balance as growth occurs. It also should
be noted that the Bay Area regional average currently is approximately 1.04 jobs/employed
resident and 1.51 jobs/household. These ratios are projected by 2020 to increase to 1.05 and 1.65,
respectively. The jobs/housing balance for Solano County as a whole is also expected to
increase, from 0.7 job/employed resident and 0.99 job/household currently to 0.75 and 1.18,
respectively. Therefore, Rio Vista is expected to decline from a position that currently is
healthier than the County’s and about on par with the region, to a much less balanced position
than either the County or the region. In other words, the rich jobs growth forecast for the region
is not expected to make its way to Rio Vista.

It should be the community’s goal to at least maintain the current balance of jobs/employed
residents and strive for the ideal ratio of 1:1. The number of jobs per household is not as
significant a measure, because the Trilogy development likely will result in at least one-third of
the City’s projected households without a working member. Both the regional and County
average number of employed residents per household is 1.56. Discounting Trilogy, Rio Vista is

projected to have about 5,000 households in 2020. Applying the regional/County average
employed residents/household ratio to the non-Trilogy households, about 7,800 employed
residents would reside in Rio Vista in 2020. Thus, Rio Vista should strive to create and retain
7,800 jobs by 2020.
RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Given the expected size of the City at buildout, the amount of retail development possible is
limited. The City will not attain the population thresholds needed to attract large retail uses
such as Walmart and Home Depot. The City’s existing downtown retail core needs
strengthening. Greater intensification of the existing Highway 12 corridor also could occur.
A 1998 retail market analysis conducted by Economic & Planning Systems, Inc. (EPS) (1998)
revealed the market conditions facing the City now and in the future. The analysis was
undertaken to ensure that an appropriate amount of developable land is available for future
retail development.
The Rio Vista General Plan Retail Market Analysis (Economic & Planning Systems, 1998) found
that existing retail in Rio Vista is surviving, but not thriving, on current resident traveler and
tourist expenditures. Modest growth in business is being realized from new housing
construction.
The EPS study recommends that the General Plan identify three distinct retail areas in the City:
(1) the existing downtown, (2) existing Highway 12, and (3) new development at the
intersection of Highway 12 and Church Road. These three areas, along with the Brann
Ranch/Canright Road area north of Highway 12, will provide sufficient retail opportunities to
meet the majority of retail demand under buildout of this General Plan. The EPS study
recommended considering retail in other areas as a secondary use, such as new restaurants
along the waterfront or at the former Army Reserve base.
          DOWNTOWN
The face of commerce in Rio Vista is likely to undergo significant changes over the next decade.
Several new large subdivisions located in the west and northwest portion of the City (the largest
of which is a senior community) will quadruple the City’s population, bringing increased
demand for goods and services. Trilogy, the senior community, will account for about one third
of the projected population growth to 2020.
Although the types of businesses that now exist are quite diverse, with a low vacancy rate
among commercial properties, the City is concerned about the position of downtown merchants
to compete with larger, new stores that are likely to follow this population growth to the north
and west. The Economic Development element, along with the Land Use element, seeks to
establish policies and implementing actions that will strengthen the downtown and avoid the
fate of many other small cities that grew rapidly away from their historic cores. In many cases,
downtown businesses were forced to shut their doors as large superstores, chain stores, and
franchise businesses came to dominate commerce in those cities.

In a 1998 community survey, Rio Vistans cited the need to improve the downtown in terms of
maintenance, use of the waterfront, tree plantings on Main Street, shopping choices,
directional/historical signage, and parking. Several of the Rio Vista Principles, described
earlier in this chapter, were formed as a direct result of this survey.
The City’s Downtown Marketing and Design Study (Economic & Planning Systems, 1999) used
these principles as the basis for developing a plan that would guide development of the historic
downtown as a unique environment for shopping, dining, and entertainment. The study
establishes a specific land use, design, marketing, and financing plan for revitalization and
economic development in the historic downtown core. This strategy is expected to facilitate
revitalization and economic success so merchants will not be forced to compete head-on with
the new businesses that will locate outside the historic downtown core.
Specifically, the existing downtown will be encouraged to transition to a cultural, civic,
entertainment, and specialty retail center. Restaurants, offices, housing, and employment
businesses are considered to have priority over retail in the near term. Other entertainment
uses, including boutiques, video stores, and antique and second-hand shops will be encouraged
over the long-term.
          HIGHWAY 12 (DROUIN DRIVE TO THE RIO VISTA BRIDGE)
The existing Highway 12 commercial corridor should serve as more highway commercial- and
service commercial-type uses, including vehicle sales, lodging, bait shops, gas stations,
convenience stores, nurseries, and hardware stores. Existing uses are generally consistent with
this concept. Over time, Caltrans and PG&E uses (vehicle and equipment maintenance yards,
as discussed in the Land Use element) may find more suitable locations, and these sites could be
developed with more commercial uses.
The EPS retail demand study documented the need to bring activity-generating uses into the
existing downtown to supplement existing public, retail, and employment uses. The Rio Vista
Principles developed during the Town Hall meetings reinforce maintaining the downtown as a
cultural, civic, and service center for the community.
          HIGHWAY 12 / CHURCH ROAD
When new retail construction does occur at this intersection, the new business should
complement rather than compete with existing stores on Highway 12 and downtown. If the
downtown is to be strengthened and preserved, new office and specialty uses should not be
developed prematurely on the periphery at the Highway 12/ Church Road intersection.
The City will encourage a mixed-use “town center” concept and pedestrian-friendly design that
allows for ease of access without adjacent residential neighborhoods needing to use arterial
streets. A mixed-use and town center concept can foster economic growth and provide
affordable housing in the process, also contributing to meeting the City’s jobs/housing balance.
Opportunities to strengthen existing stores and revitalize the downtown area with new
spending by households must be encouraged and nurtured. Therefore, new retail at

July 18, 2002

Highway 12 and Church Road can be accommodated so long as it does not replicate the retail
niches outlined for other areas.
This intersection could serve as a desirable location for a new community shopping center in
the range of 200,000 square feet. By applying the appropriate design guidelines, this new center
should be consistent with other goals of the General Plan and, at the same time, should provide
a greater variety of convenience-shopping opportunities and regional-type retail uses on a
modest scale. Non-retail uses, such as medical services, secondary government facilities,
community center, professional offices, and financial uses, also should be encouraged in this
location. The retail mix could contain some limited highway commercial (although this should
not comprise the majority of uses or land area), general commercial, and neighborhood-serving
retail (grocery/drug and specialty), with the potential for community-serving variety of retail or
“junior” discount stores as the market develops.
Since present the expenditure levels in Rio Vista do not support substantial new retail
development, development of any new shopping center should be phased appropriately along
with new housing construction rather than preempt the existing market.
          BRANN RANCH / CANRIGHT ROAD
Located 0.5 mile off Highway 12, this area is comprised of about 15 acres at the northwest
intersection of these two secondary roadways. The City does not expect marketability of this
area to materialize until much of the Brann Ranch, Gibbs Ranch, and Trilogy developments are
built out.
This area of the City could accommodate a smaller, truly “neighborhood” retail mix and
possibly some employment-generating uses. It is a good candidate for conversion to light
industrial/”flex” space to augment industrial land capacity, with some neighborhood
commercial or service uses mixed in, if land uses are compatible with neighboring or adjacent
uses.
Service commercial, “flex” space, office, and retail are also possible uses in this location:
although the site’s proximity to the airport imposes some limitations due to the airport’s
restrictions on population or employment density.
HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
          HIGHWAY 12 (DROUIN DRIVE TO THE RIO VISTA BRIDGE)
The City expects to upgrade pedestrian infrastructure on Highway 12 as part of the commercial
development of Highway 12. Future buildings will be sited for ease of access to both
pedestrians and autos; pedestrian access is particularly important from adjoining
neighborhoods. Building architecture will limit the “chain store” appearance.

SERVICE COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
          RIVER ROAD / ST. FRANCIS DRIVE
There are few sites between the river and River Road (Highway 84). Some opportunities exist
for public access to the riverfront on small, compact sites; there is little opportunity for a trail
due to proximity of the road to the riverbanks.
The City envisions more intensive development in this area of prime developable acres (with
redevelopment of some parcels needed). It should be developed similar in character and
intensity to that of the Business Park. Landscaping and appearance upgrades will be needed.
Some river viewpoints, connections to downtown, and pathways need to be provided. River
Road should continue to be a primary truck route and provide access to all the industrial
districts.
Areas near Highway 12 have potential for highway commercial uses as well as
service/industrial uses (e.g., former Chevron site).
          AIRPORT ROAD / CHURCH ROAD
There is a potential for some commercial/retail uses at the northwest corner of Church and
Airport Road on the Marks Ranch. A site of approximately 6 acres is designated commercial by
the Marks Ranch Specific Plan, PUD Permit, and Marks Ranch Development Agreement. This
site probably will be viable for commercial uses as buildout nears, as it is not close to the
Highway 12 arterial; however, this location is relatively close to a portion of the future
residential neighborhoods in River Walk and the Marks Ranch, as well as the future industrial
development north and south of Airport Road.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
Table 7-4 calculates the likely number of jobs that the available undeveloped land could
accommodate at current building and employment densities, and compares that number to the
projected households (excluding Trilogy).

Note that the table does not include any of the retail sites, including downtown; therefore
retail/personal service jobs are generally not included. Some mixed-use or other employment-
generating activities (such as government) can be compatible with downtown retail, housing,
and office uses (e.g., Dry Vac). Employees from these uses help to support downtown retail and
service businesses. The industrial lands are assumed to accommodate primarily industries that
manufacture or assemble goods for “export” out of the community, bringing in revenues from
outside sources that would not otherwise be spent in Rio Vista. Many professional and office
jobs support industries or households already in the community and may be located in any
industrial, business park, or commercial area. The job categories not represented may add up to
an additional 20–25 percent of the total jobs counted in the table.
           RIO VISTA BUSINESS PARK
The Rio Vista Business Park will remain a “basic” business park to provide ample affordable
office and industrial space for start-up and expanding businesses. Metal buildings, concrete tilt-
ups, and pre-fabricated structures on relatively small sites will be considered standard for this
site typically sized to service small to medium businesses.
           AIRPORT ROAD
Approximately 160 acres of land on both sides of Airport Road between Church Road and the
Rio Vista Business Park (former airport) are owned by the City. About half of this area south of
Airport Road is available for limited industrial uses, with the remainder north of Airport Road
able to accommodate more intensive, general industrial and employment uses. These lands are
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                               7-23                        Economic Development
July 18, 2002

currently comprised of large parcels that can accommodate large users. The City needs to
undertake site planning and a property mapping process to efficiently allocate areas for both
large and small operations. This area should be reserved for employment-intensive businesses,
such as manufacturing, office, research and development, and business support services.
Because of the proximity of the south parcels to existing and proposed residential uses across
Harris Road, more limited industrial/office uses and low-noise/traffic uses should be located
adjacent to residential development.
Placing streets, landscape buffers, and pathways between residential and employment uses will
both minimize conflicts with residential neighborhoods and protect the viability of the
businesses that locate there. Particularly in the areas adjacent to Harris Road, industrial
buildings should be designed to place building frontages closest to the street, with storage and
parking behind the buildings.
          RIO VISTA MUNICIPAL AIRPORT
Airport-related industrial, service, and retail businesses are encouraged, along with other
employment-generating uses that are compatible with an airport environment. The City
recently completed an infrastructure and building project that constructed a 3,600-sq.-ft.
hangar/commercial building and a 6,000-sq.-ft. office/retail building. Approximately 50,000 sq.
ft. of building site capacity exist in a 12-acre business park adjacent to Airport Road, on the
southwest portion of the airport; and additional sites for hangars and industrial/service
businesses are available on the east side of the airport.
          GIBBS RANCH
Airport land use compatibility is critical for this area (refer to discussion in the Land Use element),
with high design standards. Development of this area must be employment-intensive, with
similar uses as those envisioned for the City-owned parcels south of Airport Road.
Warehousing, storage, and other land-intensive but low-employment uses should be limited or
avoided.
          BRANN RANCH/CANRIGHT ROAD
The potential for commercial and industrial development exists for lands on Canright Road.
The location and size of such development have not yet been determined. Some land has been
set aside for open space, residential, and commercial. Airport land use compatibility is critical
(refer to discussion in the Land Use element).
          HIGHWAY 12 / SUMMERSET DRIVE
The existing business use in this location is expected to continue to operate. To protect its
viability, newer residential developments adjacent have and should continue to provide
buffering in order to accommodate existing business.
WATERFRONT DEVELOPMENT
The Rio Vista Waterfront Plan (David Evans & Associates et al., 1999) addresses the public access
and development potential of the downtown waterfront. The downtown waterfront includes
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     7-24                                Economic Development
July 18, 2002
the Sacramento River edge from City Hall to the Helen Madere Bridge, and an area on both
sides of Front Street, north of Logan Street—long designated as a Study District on the City's
current Zoning Map. The enthusiastic participation of the community shaped the contents of
the Rio Vista Waterfront Plan. The public process included participatory public workshops; and
meetings between the city staff and Study District landowners. The primary goals of the plan
address public access to the waterfront and stabilization of the Sacramento River edge. The
process also examined the development potential of the lands in the Study District and the
relationship of the Study District to public access along the Sacramento River.
The Study District represents a unique downtown development opportunity. The proximity of
the site to historic downtown, and over 2,200 lineal feet of river frontage on the Sacramento
River, are central to the recommendations of the Rio Vista Waterfront Plan (David Evans &
Associates, 1999). Highway 12 provides immediate access to the Study District and downtown.
Regional activity centers, housing and commercial development, additional parking, boating
access, pedestrian-friendly streets, and a pedestrian/bicycle trail along the waterfront all
contribute to the vitality of downtown Rio Vista.
The Waterfront Plan, although not a land use or economic development plan, demonstrated the
capability of the Study District to accommodate both public access and a significant amount of
commercial, employment, housing and institutional development. A major specific plan effort
needs to be undertaken to establish land uses and design guidelines for private development,
public facility and infrastructure needs, funding sources, and a development plan for the
waterfront.
FORMER ARMY RESERVE BASE
The former Army Reserve Base also has potential for a scientific research/interpretive center for
the Sacramento Delta. A consortium of state and federal agencies are interested in establishing a
research/public education facility on the lower terrace portion of the site (about 20 percent of
the site area). This will provide the opportunity for joint use facilities (for example, a
recreation/community center, combined with a Delta interpretive center and conference facility
and joint recreational/agency boat launch facilities). The science center would provide up to
200 jobs and may provide significant portions of the financing for the community recreation
facilities envisioned on the larger portions of the site. In addition to the jobs, a science center
would generate tourism interest and bring people from many diverse locations and
backgrounds to Rio Vista. An economic analysis of the proposal currently is being conducted.

G.        Implementing Actions for Economic Development (ED)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Economic Development element.
ED-1               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
                   (Existing)
The City of Rio Vista has and will continue to maintain an ongoing Economic Development
Program, including at least one full-time staff person or equivalent in the Community
Development Department, which has the responsibility for administering all related activities.
ED-2               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will undertake a Strategic Plan for Economic Development. The plan will:
          •   Include policies, strategies, and priorities for business attraction, community
              promotion, and marketing; and appropriate, compatible, and cost-effective business
              sectors on which to concentrate marketing efforts and resources.
          •   Identify resources needed.
          •   Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities of the community                   for
              attracting business.
          •    Specific issues and potential attraction strategies to be evaluated in the Strategic
              Plan include: agribusiness and related sectors and services; technology and
              information; research and development; “back office” functions for various
              industries (accounting, billing, sales, and support services);             medical and
              professional services; environmental products and services; and traditional
              manufacturing sectors. The plan will evaluate and identify business attraction
              strengths, such as quality of life and location in the Delta; business weaknesses, such
              as isolation from interstate highways, infrastructure needs, and workforce; and
              review the lands currently designated for commercial and industrial activities to
              ensure that sufficient land capacity exists to accommodate potential opportunities.
              The Plan will recommend a marketing and development strategy that will prioritize
              business sectors for attraction and retention efforts, and will identify crucial steps to
              provide infrastructure and correct deficiencies.
ED-3               BUSINESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
                   (Existing)
The Solano Economic Development Corporation (SEDCORP) is a non-profit organization that is
devoted to promoting business development and expansion in Solano County. SEDCORP
assists municipalities and business entities by providing a marketing and educational forum
and a clearinghouse for business location inquiries about Solano County. Other useful

July 18, 2002

organizations and programs include the State Trade and Commerce Agency, and the
Department of Housing and Community Development.
ED-4               RIO VISTA REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
                   (Existing)
The Rio Vista Redevelopment Plan was adopted to eliminate blight in the older sections of the City
through revitalization of the historic downtown and redevelopment of the former airport site
(Rio Vista Business Park), the waterfront, and other affected areas. This revitalization is
expected to increase employment opportunities, increase the tax base, and create an economic
environment that would encourage new private development and investment.
The Redevelopment Plan contains specific City goals and objectives. The City will use its
redevelopment authority to establish additional redevelopment areas, in order to improve
appearance, upgrade infrastructure, and screen “unsightly but necessary” uses from view.
Redevelopment of the targeted areas will include relocating housing in instances where land
use incompatibility cannot be resolved. Rehabilitation of housing and implementation of other
housing assistance programs, using the Low/Mod Housing Set-Aside Fund, also will occur.
The Housing element contains a detailed description of the City’s housing programs and
policies for affordable housing, including those funded or administered through the
Redevelopment Agency.
ED-5               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will use industrial development bonds (IDBs), business assistance loans, revenue
bonds, grants from state and federal funds, and various other forms of business assistance and
financial incentives to attract and retain business. IDBs and revenue bonds are used to reduce
interest rates on loans for capital and development purposes by conveying tax-exempt status
through the City’s participation. These financing tools are repaid by the business. Additional
financial incentives may include reduced land costs by City participation, using redevelopment
or grant funds to cover portions of capital or development costs; sales or property tax rebates;
and other incentives. The City may use some or all of these at various times if deemed
appropriate.
The City will continue to apply for and use economic development grants for infrastructure,
business assistance loans, and other eligible purposes.
ED-6               ORDINANCE AND REGULATION REVIEW
                   (Proposed)
The City will review and update ordinances and related regulations to bring them into
consistency with the General Plan, including the policies of this element. The review also will
include identifying opportunities to streamline the process for beneficial industries or
businesses while ensuring compatibility with adjacent land uses and environmental quality.

July 18, 2002

ED-7               DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement its development review process in accordance with the
statutory requirements contained in such documents as the Zoning Ordinance, Sign Ordinance,
Subdivision Ordinance and the Subdivision Map Act, specific plans and their design guidelines,
the California Environmental Quality Act, the Permit Streamlining Act, and other statutes. The
process will promote flexibility and innovation in accommodating commercial, service, and
industrial activities and development proposals.
The City will include potential socioeconomic and fiscal impacts, such as those associated with
premature commercial development, in the consideration and analysis of new retail commercial
proposals. Impacts may include potential lost community services, jobs, and City revenues from
existing businesses that may not survive after the new operation begins.
ED-8               DOWNTOWN AND WATERFRONT SPECIFIC PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will undertake a major planning effort, not only for the Waterfront Study District but
also for much of the rest of the historic downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. The result
will be a specific plan that will establish land uses and design guidelines for private
development, public facility and infrastructure needs, and funding sources, as well as a Capital
Improvement Program for the entire downtown.
ED-9               RETAIL MARKET ANALYSIS
                   (Proposed)
If it is unclear whether a proposed retail project is in keeping with the overall goals of the
General Plan, the City will require supplemental and project-specific retail market analysis for
projects larger than 10,000 square feet.
ED-10              DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
                   (Proposed)
The City will establish design standards and guidelines (in addition to those included in this
General Plan) for future development, screening, landscaping, and existing uses. The City will
develop specific standards for commercial and industrial categories or districts with particular
needs or conditions, such as the downtown.
ED-11              ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS
                   (Proposed)
The City will use assessment districts for streets, frontage improvements, landscaping, and
other infrastructure. Assessment districts can be used to improve an area and spread the cost
over several or many properties, thus alleviating the burden from only one or a few. The
facilities are financed through bonds, which then are assessed to all properties in the district
benefiting from the improvements. This mechanism also can be used for ongoing maintenance,
such as for street lights and landscaping.

July 18, 2002
ED-12              CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop a 5-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which will prioritize and
schedule infrastructure improvements over a 5-year period. This program will provide certainty
and a time-frame for needed infrastructure from all funding sources, including development
fees, bond funds, redevelopment grants, and assessment districts.
ED-13              CONTRACT CONSISTENCY REVIEW
                   (Proposed)
The intended use, purpose, or activity; term; conditions; and language of any lease, sale,
agreement, or contract for City land or buildings must be consistent with the General Plan and
other City policies, ordinances, and regulations. The Community Development Department will
review all such contracts for consistency prior to approval.
ED-14              AIRPORT MASTER PLAN UPDATE
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement and update the Airport Master Plan, as needed. The airport
is both an economic development benefit, as a capital facility that many communities lack and a
location for businesses needing or desiring to be near the airport facilities. A 12-acre business
park and locations for commercial and industrial businesses (fixed base operators) are included
on airport grounds. The Master Plan provides for these businesses and their necessary support
facilities.
ED-15              FRANCHISE ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will establish a franchise ordinance and review its regulations to ensure that the
maximum control and leverage can be exercised over telecommunications services, both in the
manner and means of service provision and in granting easements on City property and rights-
of-way. This review will overlap into development standards and regulations, such as the
Subdivision Ordinance.
ED-16              PROPOSED TRUCK ROUTE
                   (Proposed)
The City will establish a truck route as shown in the Circulation & Mobility element of the
proposed General Plan.

July 18, 2002
Chapter 8                    Circulation & Mobility
A.        Introduction
The Circulation & Mobility element is concerned with the movement of people and goods
through and around the community. The element focuses on the community’s system of
regional or cross-town streets (arterials and collectors), local access or neighborhood streets,
transit, and bicycle and pedestrian routes. The objective is to design the most effective system
possible, balancing the community’s various mobility needs with the character of the
community. These potentially competing needs are expressed in the Rio Vista Principles,
adopted through the Town Hall meetings and visioning process.
Mobility can occur in many ways. This element addresses a range of circulation issues that
affect mobility, including:
          •   Vehicular circulation on streets and highways, including private automobiles, public
              transportation, and commercial vehicles.
          •   Vehicular parking in its relationship to travel.
          •   Bicycle circulation for recreation, school, and work.
          •   Pedestrian circulation.
          •   Fixed-rail circulation for passengers and goods.
          •   Air transportation for passengers and goods.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        8-1                          Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

          •   Water transportation for passengers and goods—both for recreational and non-
              recreational purposes.
State law recognizes that circulation and land use are closely related and requires that policies
contemplated by the Circulation & Mobility, Land Use, and other elements be related and
consistent. The policies should demonstrate a balance between anticipated land uses and the
transportation facilities that serve them. The circulation policies also must be interwoven with
community character and design, economic development, housing and neighborhoods,
recreation, air quality, and noise and safety policy issues.

trip origin/destination patterns is Korve Engineering’s Highway 12 Major Investment Study and
Project Study Report Equivalent (MIS/PSR), prepared for Solano Transportation Authority in
October 2001. This report is available for review at the City of Rio Vista’s Community
Development Department.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     8-2                            Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

B.        Purpose and Authority
California Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that the general plan for a city or county
include a circulation element, consisting of the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities
and facilities, and correlated with the land use element of the plan. The circulation element has
been a requirement of State planning law since 1955. The element typically serves as an
infrastructure plan for the existing and proposed facilities needed to support the safe and
effective circulation of people, goods, energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and
communications.
As described in Government Code Sections 65300.5 and 65302(b), circulation elements must be
consistent and correlated with the land use element of the general plan. In fact, the amount,
type, and location of land uses proposed in the land use plan drive the need for improvements
in the circulation system. Therefore, not only should the two elements be consistent and
correlated, the land use element should serve as the principal guide for estimating locally
generated travel demand, which in turn helps to determine the need for circulation
improvements.
While updating this General Plan, the City of Rio Vista participated with other local agencies in
Solano County to develop a process for estimating and allocating future growth. City staff
worked with the local jurisdictions and the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) to reach
concurrence with the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) on future population
growth numbers
The following considerations are factored into the development of a circulation element:
          •   Social concerns, including how people use the circulation system to travel, who has
              access to various parts of the system (both physically and economically), and how
              the circulation system affects the daily schedule of residents’ lives.
          •   Environmental effects, such as the air, noise, and water quality implications of the
              circulation system, as well as the effects of the system on people’s perceptions of
              their neighborhood and community. Environmental issues such as air quality are
              discussed more thoroughly in the Resources & Conservation Management element.
              Noise is addressed in the Safety & Noise element.
          •   Economic factors involve the relationship between circulation and economic activity,
              as well as the costs of building and maintaining the system.
          •   Internal circulation issues that address movement strictly within the City—that is,
              movement that originates and ends within the City and the Rio Vista planning area.
          •   External circulation issues that address movement between Rio Vista and adjacent
              communities, circulation within Solano County, and regional circulation in the Bay
              Area and Sacramento regions. Also important are the transportation links between
              Rio Vista and the Sacramento, Oakland, and San Francisco airports; Bay Area Rapid
              Transit (BART); Amtrak; and interstate highways. These links are not directly
              relevant to the community’s internal circulation system; however, traffic between

July 18, 2002

              regions along State Route 12 (commonly referred to as Highway 12) significantly
              affects mobility in Rio Vista.
Not all regional or countywide issues are relevant or important to Rio Vista and not all Rio
Vista issues are important to other cities in the county. Air transportation, for example, is
directly relevant to the City both because a military airport is nearby and a municipal airport is
located in the City’s northeast corner (adjacent to the Trilogy and Brann Ranch residential
areas). The proximity of Travis Air Force Base has greater implications for Fairfield, Suisun
City, and Vacaville than for Rio Vista. Yet Rio Vista and Vacaville are the only cities in Solano
County with general aviation airports within their jurisdictions.

C.        The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
Transportation facilities, particularly Highway 12, were identified as a significant concern
during the community vision (Town Hall) meetings. A major vision statement and supporting
principles were articulated for community circulation and mobility issues. The community
vision and principles that most directly relate to the Circulation & Mobility element are listed
below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.
     Community identity should be strengthened with attractive entryways on Highway 12, Main Street,
     and River Road.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES THAT DEFINE RIO VISTA
     The community should seek to connect the existing town to new developments and the Sacramento
     River waterfront by an extensive and interconnecting trail system. The natural drainageways, hills,
     and sensitive vegetation areas should be the basis for designing such a system.
     Adequate public facilities—sewer, water, transportation, public safety, parks, recreation, education,
     and others—should be in place or assured in a timely fashion before new development projects
     proceed.
ENSURE EASE OF MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, AND BUSINESSES
     Accessible, easy, and convenient circulation systems for autos, pedestrians, and bicyclists alike should
     be designed into all new developments.
     Convenient and accessible truck routes for delivery and shipping of goods and services should be
     provided, while minimizing the impact to residential neighborhoods and sensitive districts.
     The development of the connecting trail system suggested by the above principles should be pursued
     as a key circulation facility, as well as a natural resource opportunity.
     Many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance of each other. This design allows
     independence and safe movement for those who do not drive, especially seniors and young people.
     Schools should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them. Interconnected
     networks of streets should be designed to encourage walking and reduce the number and length of
     automobile trips.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                            8-5                              Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

     The needs of automobiles and pedestrians should be balanced. It is a fact of modern life that
     development must adequately accommodate automobiles. However, pedestrian accessibility should
     not be sacrificed or made less important than automobile accessibility.
     Streets, thoroughfares, and public spaces should be:
     •    Safe, comfortable, attractive, and interesting to the pedestrian and motorist alike; and
     •    Free of barriers and designed with multiple connections to various parts of the community.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           8-6                                 Circulation & Mobility

D.         Setting
PLANNING AREA
The City of Rio Vista is located along the west bank of the Sacramento River in the Delta Region
of northern California. Extending west into the Montezuma Hills of Solano County, the
planning area covers approximately 11,255 acres. As shown in Figure 8-1, Highway 12 bisects
the city in an east-west direction, serving as the principal connector between Interstate 80 in
Fairfield and Interstate 5 in Stockton.
STREET AND ROADWAY SYSTEM
The street network continues to be the basic element of the circulation system. Streets and
highways are classified according to function, described in Table 8-1. Figure 8-1 shows Rio
Vista’s existing circulation system.
                                                       TABLE 8-1
                                             Street Classification System
  Freeway
  Drivers use freeways primarily for long-distance, high speed trips. Cars can enter a freeway only at an inter-
  change; major streets cross only at underpasses or overpasses.          (Examples are Interstate 80, Interstate 680,
  Interstate 5, and Highway 4.)
  Expressway
  Drivers typically use expressways for regional trips. Other roads may cross expressways at intersections with
  traffic signals, or they may have underpasses or overpasses. It is usually not possible to enter an expressway from
  an adjacent parcel of land. Speed limits range from 45 to 60 mph. (Highway 12 through Suisun City and Fairfield
  is an example.)
  Arterial
  Drivers use arterial streets to travel to activity centers, freeways, expressways, and other arterials. Speed limits
  range from 35 to 45 mph. Driveways connect adjacent land uses directly; collector streets conduct traffic to the
  arterials. (Highway 12 in Rio Vista is an example.)
  Collectors
  Drivers use collector streets to travel within and between neighborhoods, as well as to access adjacent land uses.
  Speed limits range from 25 to 35 mph. These streets collect traffic from local streets and route traffic to arterials.
  (Examples are Second Street, Drouin Drive, and Sierra Drive.)
  Local Roads, Residential Streets, and Alleys
  Drivers travel on local roads, residential streets, and alleys only to reach adjacent land uses. Local streets are
  designed to protect residents from through-traffic. Speed limits are 25 mph or less. (The majority of Rio Vista’s
  street network includes these types of streets.)
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                8-7                                    Circulation & Mobility

 Rio Vista General Plan 2001 8-8 Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) controls the design, operation, and
maintenance of expressways and highways, including traffic signals, on state routes such as
Highway 12. Caltrans currently considers Highway 12 to be a future “expressway.”
Expressways are defined as higher speed, regional roadways that allow access at more frequent
points than freeways but at greater separations than local streets. All major and minor local
streets are under the jurisdiction of the City of Rio Vista (the City). The street classifications are
defined in Table 8-1. The table also identifies the local components of the City’s circulation
system.
          FREEWAYS
There are no freeways within the vicinity of Rio Vista. The nearest freeways are Interstate 80
located approximately 30 miles to the northwest and Interstate 5 that is approximately 25 miles
to the east.
          EXPRESSWAYS
There are no expressways within the Rio Vista planning area. The portion of Highway 12 that
runs through Fairfield and Suisun City, approximately 15 miles west of Rio Vista, would be
considered the nearest expressway.
          ARTERIALS
As the only east-west route that connects Rio Vista with nearby communities, Highway 12 is the
primary traffic carrier through Rio Vista. The highway serves many different users, including
regional through-trips and movement of goods, inter-city travel, commute traffic, agricultural
truck trips, and recreational traffic—both local and regional. Highway 12 serves as a regional
circulation route, connecting Rio Vista with the City of Fairfield, the remainder of Solano
County, the cities of Lodi and Stockton, and the Bay Area. Highway 12 is a two-lane highway
from Lodi to Suisun City. It is developed to a four-lane expressway standard through Suisun
City to Interstate 80. Current average daily traffic (ADT) is estimated at 14,000–20,000 trips in
Rio Vista and over 35,000 trips in parts of Suisun City and Fairfield.
Because of the potential development that has been approved over the past decade—both north
and south of Highway 12—this route serves as a major local arterial and is key to the City’s
circulation system. Highway 12 connects the newly developing areas west of Church Road
with the downtown historic core area and the waterfront.
Airport Road is the other arterial roadway in the City. This road runs in an east-west direction
north and parallel to Highway 12, connected to it by Church Road.
          COLLECTOR ROADS
Presently, nine streets in Rio Vista collect traffic from local streets and route traffic to arterials.
These collectors are Main Street, River Road (State Route 84), Front Street, Second Street, Drouin
Drive, Church Road, Airport Road, St. Francis Drive, and Sierra Drive.

July 18, 2002

          LOCAL ROADS, RESIDENTIAL STREETS, AND ALLEYS
Except for the above arterial and collector roads, all principal streets within Rio Vista are
classified as local roads. The City’s downtown core has an extensive network of alleys that
connect to these local roads (also called residential streets).
          RIO VISTA BRIDGE
The Helen Madere Bridge (commonly known as the Rio Vista Bridge) links the Solano County
and Sacramento/San Joaquin Counties portions of Highway 12. Traffic engineers consider this
bridge a “gateway” to both the County and the Bay Area. As such, the bridge allows inter- and
intra-regional traffic, as well as traffic between counties. For example, east Contra Costa
County commuters use the bridge as a link to Solano County, while residents of Solano County
(including Rio Vista) use the bridge in the opposite direction, commuting to Contra Costa
County and the Central Valley. In addition, commuters and commercial truck traffic use the
bridge and Highway 12 as a direct link between the Central Valley and the Bay Area.
ROADWAY OPERATIONS
Roadway operations can be described in terms of their level of service (LOS). LOS can be
expressed both as a quantitative measure and a qualitative experience. The quantitative
description focuses on how long drivers may need to wait to pass through an intersection or the
speed at which they can travel on a street. The qualitative measure focuses on how drivers
perceive their driving experience. Each LOS is assigned a letter, ranging from A (less than a 5-
second wait at intersections and no restrictions on speed along arterials) to F (delays of more
than 60 seconds at intersections, and “stop and go” movement on arterials). Complete LOS
descriptions are provided in Table 8-2.
Traffic engineers use quantitative measures of LOS to help them design or reconstruct a street
or intersection. The engineers take into account the volume of traffic and where it is coming
from, the size and design of the arterial or intersection, signal timing, distance between cars,
how aggressively people drive, and other variables. LOS normally is used to describe peak-hour
conditions—the morning or afternoon hour when traffic is heaviest.
The quantitative measure of LOS can be roughly equated with drivers’ perceptions of driving
conditions. Drivers may experience LOS A through LOS D as “free flowing” to “easily
understandable delay.” LOS D is the most commonly accepted standard for urban streets.
Conditions of LOS E and F typically are considered less acceptable. Perception of traffic
conditions often is influenced by expectations. People expect and accept occasional heavy
traffic, but not a continuous network of delays—and not throughout the day. Drivers also
expect and tolerate more traffic delay in high-activity areas, such as a lively downtown, than
they accept on neighborhood streets.

                                  60 seconds. Traffic may back up into “up-                    by a “down-stream” obstruction, such as
                                  stream” intersections. Delay generally caused by             lanes reduced from 2 to 1, a stalled car, or
                                  obstruction or irregular occurrence (e.g., signal            construction activity.
                                  preemption for a train). This condition is often
                                  viewed as “gridlock.”
      __________
      Notes:
      a “Average wait” is a measure of traffic conditions at intersections. It is an estimate of the average delay for all vehicles entering the
      intersection in a defined period of time, for example, the evening peak hour. It is expressed as a range rather than a single value. Some
      drivers actually will wait more or less time than indicated by the range.
      b “Average speed” is a measure of traffic conditions on arterial streets. Average speed is based on the total time it takes to travel a certain
      distance, including the time spent waiting at intersections. It is determined more by traffic volume and conditions at intersections than by
      the legal speed limit.
Quantitative measures of LOS are useful aids to understanding the community and helping to
identify potential problems with street design and impacts of land use. However, LOS ranges
are theoretical. When used as a factor in determining land use capacity, they must be tempered
by judgment and interpretation. Minor adjustments in signal timing, turning-lane provisions,
points of access from adjoining property, and other modifications can improve the actual
operation of the intersection. Given all the variables, intersections often work better than the
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                                8-11                                                Circulation & Mobility

LOS would predict. In such cases, more detailed evaluation of driving behavior and intersection
design are needed.
Korve Engineering used the Solano County Travel Demand Model (also referred to in this
element as the STA Traffic Model) in a 2001 study prepared for STA (Highway 12 Major
Investment Study and Project Study Report Equivalent [Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent]). The
study assessed existing roadway conditions, particularly LOS at key intersections and in
roadway segments along the Highway 12 corridor, including the portion that extends from the
western end of the Rio Vista planning area to the Rio Vista Bridge.
          STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL AREAS
Maintaining an LOS D at all intersections is not always appropriate or necessary. People may
expect and tolerate varying levels of congestion, depending on the location and time of day. In
the downtown area, for example, people expect slower speeds and more traffic. It is perceived
as part of the activity and vitality associated with a mixture of uses, greater pedestrian activity,
and commercial and related activities. In these areas, “significant delays” (LOS E) may be
acceptable. Allowing for heavy traffic in these few locations takes into consideration how
people perceive congestion. However, while more traffic may be tolerated, every effort should
be made to encourage people to walk once they arrive at these locations.
Highway 12 is another area where special LOS standards are appropriate. Highway 12 is
included in STA’s Congestion Management Program (CMP) road system. Under CMP
legislation approved in 1990, selected intersections along the designated roadways must be
monitored and improved if they become worse than LOS E.
Residential neighborhoods are also areas of concern. Neighborhood traffic problems usually
relate to traffic levels perceived to be heavy, speeding, or congested at specific times and
locations (e.g., schools), rather than congestion levels measured by LOS only in terms of
impediments to travel. These traffic problems and proposals to respond to them are addressed
through the neighborhood traffic management policies discussed later in this element.
          DAILY TRAFFIC COUNTS
To assess existing traffic levels in Rio Vista, the Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve
Engineering, 2001) obtained daily traffic volumes along a section of Highway 12 east of Church
Road. Consultants performed weeklong, 24-hour counts along this roadway segment, where
weekday traffic peaks in the morning between 7 and 9 a.m. and in the evening between 5 and
7 p.m. As shown in Table 8-3 below, traffic volumes are approximately 8 percent higher on
weekdays than on Saturdays, with a peak-hour increase of approximately 45 percent.

          INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE
Three key Highway 12 intersections within the City were included in the regional study:
     •    Summerset Road
     •    Church Road
     •    Main Street-Hillside Terrace
Operating conditions at each of the intersections were calculated using the methodology of the
Transportation Research Board’s (1994) Highway Capacity Manual. With this methodology, an
intersection LOS was assigned to describe operating conditions. The results of the intersection
LOS analysis are shown in Table 8-4. Delay is expressed in terms of seconds per vehicle.

While through-traffic on Highway 12 passes through the intersection of Main Street-Hillside
Terrace and Highway 12 unimpeded, traffic on the minor street approaches (currently
functioning at LOS E) experience difficulty crossing the highway or entering mainstream traffic
at this location. This condition exists throughout the developed sections of Highway 12 in Rio
Vista. During peak periods, vehicles and pedestrians experience difficulty crossing or entering
Highway 12 because of the magnitude of prevailing traffic flows.

          LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR LINKS AND SEGMENTS
In addition to the LOS calculations for intersections, the Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent
provided calculations for peak-hour service levels on the following links and segments in Rio
Vista:
     •    Highway 12 west of Summerset Road
     •    Highway 12 west of Church Road
     •    Highway 12 through Rio Vista
LOS calculations for these links and segments used volume-to-capacity ratios, based on the
following capacity assumptions from the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research
Board, 1994):
          •   A two-lane highway west of Summerset Road with 1,400 vehicles per hour per lane.
          •   An arterial street through Rio Vista and the Rio Vista Bridge with 900 vehicles per
              hour per lane.
Table 8-5 summarizes the results of the LOS analysis for links under existing conditions. Each
study link was found to function at LOS A, except for the segment through Rio Vista.
Currently, the existing signalized intersections function as the bottlenecks in the study corridor
rather than the links between intersections.

          TRUCK TRAFFIC
Based on the most recent data from Caltrans, truck traffic along the portion of Highway 12 in
Rio Vista represents approximately 14 percent of the total vehicle traffic. Although this is more
than twice the percentage of truck traffic in the western portion of Highway 12, the figure is
misleading. Because there are fewer vehicles traveling in Rio Vista as compared to segments
farther west, truck traffic—similar in volume over all segments—becomes a higher percentage
of overall traffic volume in the Rio Vista segments.
          ACCIDENT DATA
The Traffic Accident Surveillance and Analysis System (TASAS), maintained by Caltrans,
collected accident data on Highway 12 for the 5-year period between January 1, 1995 and
December 31, 1999. The analysis involved two sections of Highway 12 that include a portion or
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                             8-14                                   Circulation & Mobility

all of the highway through Rio Vista. The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve
Engineering, 2001) had delineated these sections because of the distinct geometric
characteristics that each possesses. For the first section, a rural two-lane highway segment from
Walters Road to Drouin Drive, the observed accident rate was less than the statewide average
for similar facilities; however, the second section, which extends from Drouin Drive to the
Sacramento River, experienced an accident rate greater than the statewide average.
          HIGHWAY 12 SAFETY TASK FORCE
The Highway 12 Safety Task Force (Task Force) was convened in October 1998 to study accident
issues in the Highway 12 corridor and recommend solutions. The Task Force has been effective
in identifying accident problems and causes while proactively pursuing solutions. This group
identified some of the issues discussed later in this element. The Task Force is responsible for
the current funding and programming of geometric improvements in an effort to reduce
accidents in these areas. In addition to geometric improvements, the Task Force is responsible
for the introduction of signage and increased enforcement in the Highway 12 corridor. A
summary of their actions is included in their recently published Highway 12 Safety Corridor
Action Plan.
          ACCIDENT-PRONE AREAS
The following are accident-prone areas, as reported in the Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent:
          •   Summerset Road. The intersection of Summerset Road and Highway 12 has
              experienced a relatively high incidence of rear-end collisions. This is the first
              signalized intersection for a relatively long distance on Highway 12 and lacks an
              advanced warning flasher.
          •   Church Road. The intersection of Church Road and Highway 12 does not provide
              left-turn lanes for vehicles attempting to exit Highway 12, and inadequate
              acceleration and deceleration distances are provided on Highway 12 for right-
              turning vehicles. This configuration has resulted in a relatively high number of both
              injury and non-injury accidents.
          •   Hillside Terrace. A large number of broadside and rear-end collisions have
              happened at this location over the last 5 years. In addition, side-street traffic may
              experience difficulty accessing or crossing the mainline traffic flow during peak-
              traffic periods.
          •   Rio Vista. A relatively high number of auto and pedestrian collisions have occurred
              on Highway 12 through Rio Vista. These accidents likely occur because of the
              combination of poorly defined areas for pedestrians to cross Highway 12 in Rio Vista
              and the high speeds and heavy volumes of traffic. Highway 12 often acts as a barrier
              between the two “halves” of Rio Vista that it bisects, and pedestrian crossings are
              particularly hazardous. The highway is a high-speed, two-lane roadway that lacks
              pedestrian access, turn lanes, and road shoulders. The existing commercial uses
              adjacent to the highway lack traffic or turn-movement controls and, in numerous
              locations, pedestrian crossings and sidewalks. Sidewalk access for pedestrians with
              impaired mobility is virtually non-existent.

In recent years, agencies besides Caltrans (in particular, the Highway 12 Safety Task Force) have
studied in detail a number of these accident-related problems and suggested solutions. As a
result, solutions to some of these problems are now funded. The status of these improvements
is included in Table 8-6.

                             Gardiner/Highway 12
          ROADWAY CONDITIONS
Although the street system is functioning adequately from an operational standpoint, some
roads are in need of repair. Portions of the older neighborhoods and the downtown, including
Main and Front Streets, have been identified as high priorities for repairs. The City has been
successful in procuring funds through STA and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC) for overlays and reconstruction of parts of Main and Front Streets. Funding sources are
being sought on an ongoing basis for other streets in deteriorating condition.
As described earlier, Highway 12 is a high-speed, two-lane roadway that lacks pedestrian
access, turn lanes, and road shoulders. In addition, the existing commercial uses adjacent to the
highway lack landscaping, traffic- or turn-movement controls, pedestrian crossings, and
sidewalks in numerous locations. Although the highway is the City’s frontage and is near the
historic downtown, few linkages exist between the downtown residential and commercial uses
and the highway commercial “strip” alongside Highway 12.
The environmental and aesthetic character of the Highway 12 corridor varies in different places
throughout the City. From the west, the character is still largely rural passing the city limits,
then rural on the south frontage and rural-suburban on the north frontage next to Summerset
Road. After Church Road, the highway passes through the hills and drainageway valleys and
ravines of the River Walk and Esperson properties. From Drouin Drive to the Rio Vista Bridge,
the existing highway commercial district dominates both sides of Highway 12.
          TRANSIT SYSTEM
Transit refers not only to buses and rail systems moving large numbers of people over fixed
routes but also to carpools and vanpools of commuters traveling daily to a common destination.
Recently, new regional transit routes were initiated from the Fairfield-Suisun area. These
include buses to BART and Citylink service to Vacaville. Passenger train service is offered by
Amtrak, with trains stopping at the Suisun-Fairfield Station.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                    8-16                              Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

Rio Vista operates an on-demand bus system sometimes referred to as “dial-a-ride.” A single
nine-passenger bus is owned and operated by the City of Rio Vista. The bus responds to
individual calls for service and connects Rio Vista residents to Suisun City-Fairfield, Antioch,
Lodi-Stockton, the Amtrak station in Suisun City, and the Solano Mall. Dial-a-ride also services
other destinations in Fairfield and Vacaville, such as Kaiser and North Bay hospitals and clinics,
county services, and other commercial destinations.
          RAIL SERVICE
          CAPITOL CORRIDOR SERVICE
Amtrak’s Capital Corridor inter-city rail service provides six trains daily for each direction
between San Jose and Sacramento, with stops in the East Bay, Solano County (Suisun City), and
Davis, and connections to downtown San Francisco and Oakland. Longer route service is
available from Suisun City and Davis to Chicago and Seattle. Although the Capitol Corridor
service includes two trains at commute hours, the service primarily targets the occasional inter-
city traveler, rather than daily commuters. A future station is planned in Fairfield near Travis
Air Force Base and south Vacaville. The station in Suisun City (Suisun-Fairfield Station) is
adjacent to Highway 12—about 20 miles from Rio Vista—and is the most direct connection for
Rio Vista residents.
          LIGHT RAIL (BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT)
For travelers and commuters to choose Amtrak or BART over their own cars, they must be able
to access rail stations easily and travel to their destination with minimal wait times. Parking
must be readily available for cars and bicycles, and transit bus schedules must be carefully
coordinated with improved rail service.
Currently, the most direct connection to BART from Rio Vista is the Bay Point Station in
Pittsburgh adjacent to Highway 4. This station is about 25 miles from Rio Vista and requires
travel on one of the major Bay Area commuter routes (Highway 4) through Antioch and
Pittsburgh. No plans exist for a bus connection from Rio Vista. The BART station in El Cerrito is
about 45 miles away and is available through a regional bus connection from Amtrak’s Suisun-
Fairfield Station. In the future, it may be possible to use either the dial-a-ride system or a regular
fixed-route connection from Rio Vista to the Suisun-Fairfield Station or to the Bay View Station.
The Suisun City bus also connects to the Vallejo ferry terminal.
          TRANSIT FOR THE MOBILITY-IMPAIRED
A number of people in Solano County cannot use conventional public transportation because of
a physical or mental disability. Many of these individuals are elderly, while others use
wheelchairs or have other limitations to their mobility. As with transit for Rio Vista residents in
general, transit for the mobility-impaired also is limited. The City’s paratransit services offer
alternative transportation for some mobility-impaired residents.
People who cannot use conventional, fixed-route transit need specialized services—called
“paratransit.” The CAC provides a paratransit service to residents of Rio Vista. Seniors and
disabled people of any age who have no other means of transportation may use the service for a
small fee. The service operates on weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. by reservation. Most
trips are for medical purposes; and most riders are seniors, persons who cannot drive, or lower
income residents.

July 18, 2002

          PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
Some specialized transportation needs can best be met by the private sector. These include
shuttle buses that serve limited routes during peak-travel periods and taxi services. Travel
corridors between residential areas, downtown, and shopping centers may benefit from shuttle
services. Trilogy or other large developments may create such services for their residents as
growth occurs. Furthermore, although taxi fares are higher than other forms of transportation,
the service fulfills more personalized needs.
          BICYCLE NETWORK
Until about 30 years ago, people rode bicycles primarily for recreation and children comprised
the greatest percentage of cyclists. With an increased awareness of physical fitness, the
relatively low cost of cycling versus motor vehicle travel, and environmental benefits (e.g.,
reduced air pollution), bicycling has risen in popularity. Adults now represent the majority of
all cyclists. Recreational biking, children bicycling to school, bicycle-to-transit trips, and other
utilitarian trips are an integral component of the community’s travel patterns.
Consequently, bicycle pathways have become a key element of the transportation system. A
consistent bicycle network can help to ensure safety, accessibility, and quality of life in the
community.
The mild climate and predominately flat topography of the Delta and Solano County are
conducive to cycling. Bicycle activity is limited in the City of Rio Vista, however, with the focus
primarily on recreation. This is largely due to the lack of a bicycle network—bicycle paths in
Rio Vista are limited to a single bicycle lane on Poppy House Road and along Highway 12.
Because Rio Vista is bisected by Highway 12, this heavily used roadway acts as a hazardous
physical barrier to both pedestrians and bicyclists.
The most commonly used bikeway design standards are contained in the Caltrans Highway
Design Manual. Table 8-7 shows the three types of bicycle route standards and their functions.
STA recently updated its Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan (Alta Transportation Consulting, 2000),
which designated a Class II bicycle route along Highway 12 through Rio Vista. However,
without separated bicycle paths or sufficient shoulder width for dedicated bicycle lanes, cyclists
are forced to share the roadway with motor vehicles, which affects both roadway operation and
safety.

                      California Department of Transportation’s Bicycle Route Standards
  Class I Route
  Off-street pathways. These pathways are entirely separated from street traffic (at least several feet from curb)
  with 4 feet per lane on two-way facilities. If combined with pedestrian use, an additional 2–4 feet in width is
  necessary. This type of route also may be removed entirely from the street network. Preferred locations are in
  natural and scenic areas in the major trails and pathways shown in Figure 8-4 and within the rights-of-way or
  adjacent to heavily traveled streets.
  Class II Route
  Striped, separate lane on the street surface. The minimum width is 6 feet from the face of curbs on each side of
  the street or a 4-foot striped lane on the inside of the parking area, where on-street parking is allowed. (NOTE:
  Some communities adopt a standard for the striped lane to the outside of the parking area and vary the required
  lane width.) This typically occurs on a collector or arterial street, where there is greater roadway width and
  higher vehicular traffic volume. Striping also is appropriate on local streets that provide connections to
  destinations such as schools, commercial centers, and the waterfront.
  Class III Route
  Signed routes along local streets. These routes are established where a path or lane is not feasible along through-
  traffic routes or local streets likely to be used by bicyclists where a path or lane is not feasible. They alert motorists
  to the likelihood of bicyclists sharing the roadway. These routes also may indicate a preferred route for bicyclists
  to use, such as a direct route to a school. Class III routes are established by placing bicycle route signs along the
  roadway.
           PEDESTRIAN NETWORK
Pedestrian traffic in the city continues to be generated primarily by children; however, many
adults walk for pleasure. In addition, persons operating wheelchairs are considered
pedestrians. Walking can be a convenient means of short-distance travel. Where development
maintains a pedestrian-oriented environment and locates destinations within a 5- to 10-minute
(¼- to ½ -mile) walking distance, many short-distance automobile trips can be eliminated.
Figure 8-2 shows the existing ¼- and ½-mile radii around the downtown, the Highway 12
commercial district, and the intersection of Highway 12 and Church Road.
Sidewalks. Most streets in Rio Vista have sidewalks on both sides, consistent with existing City
standards. The exception is the private street system in the Trilogy project that is restricted to
seniors and oriented around a golf course and a number of recreation centers. There are gaps in
some sidewalks, particularly on Highway 12, River Road/State Route 84 and the industrial
districts. In addition to safety considerations, continuous and unobstructed sidewalks
encourage their use by pedestrians.

E.        Outlook
NATIONAL, STATE, AND REGIONAL TRENDS
In the past decade, the State and Solano County have become more involved in transportation
improvement projects. Voters have been more willing to approve additional taxes for
transportation. Air quality legislation has played an increasingly major role as there is a
growing awareness of the significant effect of congestion on the region’s environmental,
economic, and social well-being.
Traffic, congestion, and related issues (e.g., “urban sprawl”) continue to be identified as the Bay
Area’s most significant problem by respondents to an annual poll conducted by the Bay Area
Council. The Sacramento region is experiencing a similar awareness of the problem.
Several significant trends affect the problem:
          •   People are driving more. Vehicle miles of travel—a standard measure of travel
              demand—and vehicle registrations, have increased much faster than employment or
              population.
          •   Land and housing costs continue to increase. Increased land and housing costs are
              forcing new housing development further into outlying areas, which requires people
              to make longer commute trips. Solano, San Joaquin, south Sacramento, and east
              Contra Costa Counties continue to host “bedroom communities” where many
              residents commute for up to 2 hours in each direction—predominantly in single-
              occupancy autos.
          •   The number of employed persons per household has increased. Households earn
              more, own more cars, and make more commute trips. As a result, people now tend
              to run errands, shop, and transport their children at peak hours, rather than during
              the day.
          •   Telecommuting does not represent a large portion of employment. Telecommuting
              (in-home business and office work made possible by technological advances), is a
              growing alternative but has not yet resulted in a significant decline in regional
              congestion.
          •   Facilities are becoming consolidated and outside walking distances. Increasingly,
              school, park, retail, and civic opportunities are located in larger “centers” or
              consolidated facilities that are located further from the typical neighborhood
              residence and usually outside walking distance (more than ¼- to ½-mile radii).
          •   Pedestrian and bicycle access is limited or not part of the design. Although some
              multiple uses or functions are located relatively close to one another, often they are
              separated by major streets, walls, or inhospitable environments (e.g., large parking
              lots), with no access or connections conducive to walking. Thus, by design, people
              are discouraged from using anything but an automobile—even for short-distance
              trips that are within typical walking or biking distances.

CIRCULATION AND MOBILITY CONSIDERATIONS
There is a growing recognition that transportation facilities should be designed to serve all
members of the community: children, seniors, the handicapped, and those who depend on
automobiles, buses, or other means of transportation for mobility. Mobility is essential to
personal, neighborhood, and community growth and opportunity. The following section
discusses the central issues and problem-solving approaches for circulation and mobility in Rio
Vista and the surrounding region.
          REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PATTERNS
The growth in traffic is a regional problem closely tied to the pattern of land use that has
evolved in the Bay Area and Sacramento regions. Since 1970, job growth has been concentrated
in the inner Bay Area counties and in Sacramento and Placer Counties in the Sacramento region.
Highway 12 in Rio Vista also is affected by traffic from San Joaquin County, particularly the
Lodi and Stockton areas. A large percentage of Solano County’s residents commute to jobs
outside the county. According to the 1990 Census, 43 percent of people living in Rio Vista work
outside the community, with 27 percent working outside Solano County, mostly in the Bay
Area and the Sacramento region.
The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve Engineering, 2001) provides a regional look at
land uses and transportation patterns. Using the STA Traffic Model, the study indicates that
approximately 60 percent of traffic at the Rio Vista Bridge has an origin or destination within
Rio Vista. The remaining 40 percent represents traffic traveling through the area on
Highway 12; a substantial amount of this percentage is traveling between Rio Vista and the
Fairfield-Suisun City area.
          TRAFFIC CONGESTION
Resolving traffic congestion issues is a problem that requires the cooperative efforts of many
agencies. Land use, community character, and transportation are closely interconnected. These
components must be carefully balanced as the city and the region continue to evolve.
Single-passenger autos have strained the regional transportation system to its limits. A greater
emphasis must be placed on alternatives, such as ridesharing, bus, rail and water transit, and—
particularly for shorter trips for daily activities near home—bicycling and walking.
          AIR QUALITY ISSUES
Air pollution is a major regional issue that has been firmly linked to transportation—cars cause
more than half of all air pollution in California. In the Bay Area, auto exhaust is responsible for
over 80 percent of carbon monoxide; approximately 70 percent of visible particles, which are
called particulates; over 50 percent of nitrogen oxide, which causes “brown haze”; and over 40
percent of hydrocarbons. The Resource Conservation & Management element of this General
Plan discusses air quality attainment status, impacts, and improvement measures.
Strict emission-control standards have improved auto emissions since the 1960s, but air quality
will be worse in the future because people are driving more. The California Clean Air Act was
passed in 1988 to address this issue. The Act established strict new air quality standards and
gave Regional Air Quality Districts new powers to achieve them. These powers include
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       8-22                          Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

developing and carrying out Transportation Control Measures (TCMs). TCMs are aimed at
curtailing the use of cars through employer-based trip reduction, land use policies, and special
fees tied to vehicle use. The impacts of auto use on air quality will continue to shape regional,
state, and federal transportation policies over the next 20 years.
          PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE ACTIVITY
Safety is the primary concern for Rio Vista residents with regard to travel within the City. A
consistent bicycle network with either bicycle lanes or wider curb lanes is needed to increase
safe access for bicyclists and pedestrians to work, school, recreation, retail, and other
destinations. Such a system will create a more sustainable environment by reducing traffic
congestion, vehicle exhaust emissions, noise, and energy consumption. These considerations
have become increasingly important as Rio Vista plans for the significant anticipated growth of
this community.
The Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan (Alta Transportation Consulting, 2000) recently was adopted
to encourage the development of a unified bicycle system throughout Solano County with
connections to other regional bicycle and pedestrian systems. This update to its 1995 plan
recommends, as one of the primary system links, some Class II shoulder improvements in
conjunction with Highway 12 improvements in Rio Vista. The City will integrate the County’s
bicycle plan with the City’s plans for trails and pathways, as described later in this section’s
discussion of future circulation improvements.
          TRANSIT DEMAND AND USAGE
The same land use and design considerations that influence pedestrian and bicycle activity
equally affect transit demand and usage. Logical transit routes and potential locations for fixed
stops (e.g., Highway 12 and the commercial area at Church Road and Highway 12) must be
easily accessible (i.e., within ¼- to ½-mile radii) to as many people as possible. Both land use
mix and density are important to enhancing transit demand and usage. A mix of
complementary uses within a short distance of a transit stop enables a rider to accomplish more
than one errand or task with one stop (similar to being able to accomplish several purposes with
a single vehicle trip). Conversely, single uses force the transit rider to take several rides or trips
to different destinations in order to accomplish more than one errand or task, which yields
transit inconvenient and a mode of last resort. Density has a similar impact; the higher the
residential density or intensity of nonresidential use, the more people and destinations are
accessible with a single ride or vehicle trip. To encourage use, transit stops also must be
designed to provide easy and direct pedestrian connections within walking distance.
          ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN
Appropriate design that balances auto and pedestrian uses can enhance transportation facilities
and make them an asset to the community and neighborhood. Generous landscaping, buffers,
and related design features can insulate the community from noise and air pollution caused by
transportation. Minimizing noise, traffic, and air pollution and maintaining visual aesthetics
should be key objectives in transportation planning. Noise-reduction measures also can be
incorporated into the design and construction of new buildings, as described in the Safety &
Noise element of this General Plan.
Some communities create special design requirements for streets as a technique to improve the
appearance of roads and better integrate them into the community. Major streets that pass
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     8-23                              Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

through residential neighborhoods carry traffic in the same way as other streets, but design
elements can screen sidewalks and front yards from the sights and sounds of heavy traffic, slow
the speed of vehicles, and narrow the streets—either physically or by appearance. Additionally,
reduction of the impervious surfaces of streets and sidewalks helps meet current and future
storm water quality requirements. These elements include:
          •    Reducing curb-to-curb pavement widths where performance standards for garage
               placement, projected traffic, and parking restrictions are used.
          •    Installing planter strips between streets and sidewalks.
          •    Screening cars parked at the curb from residences.
          •    Planting larger trees closer together between curb and sidewalk.
LAND USE AND GROWTH PROJECTIONS
Developing an understanding of future circulation needs begins with establishing land use and
population growth assumptions. This section summarizes both the process for developing
these assumptions, as well as the subsequent data evaluation. These were the basis for
determining the need for improvements and developing the City’s proposed circulation system.
          EXISTING LAND USE DATA
The existing land uses in Rio Vista are primarily comprised of residential, commercial, and
industrial uses. The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve Engineering, 2001) uses future
land use forecasts from ABAG; general planning information from Rio Vista, Suisun City,
Fairfield and other Solano County jurisdictions; and the STA traffic model (travel demand
model) develop its traffic projections. Table 8-8 provides a summary of existing (2000) and
future (2025) land use forecasts within the Rio Vista planning area. For the model, 2025 is the
forecast year. The land use assumptions for 2025 in the model are the same as the 2020
population and land use map adopted by this General Plan. The model therefore is consistent
with both the Land Use element and the limitations the urban growth boundary (UGB)
(adopted as delineated in Figure 3-1 of the Development Constraints & Boundaries element)
place on future annexation.

The City anticipates substantial land use changes in Rio Vista over the next 25 years as shown in
Table 8-8 above. In this summary, commercial space includes retail, office, and industrial
development. (Note: Korve’s land use figures vary somewhat from those used in the rest of this General
Plan due to minor differences in Korve’s study area boundaries and the use of slightly less current
population and housing data to generate the STA traffic model.)
          MONITORING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION—THE STA TRAFFIC MODEL
The location and intensity of development directly affect traffic levels in the surrounding area
and the community as a whole. Transportation engineers have developed several mathematical
tools to monitor the relationship between land use and the transportation system. One tool is
the traffic-forecasting model. The model forecasts traffic volumes and conditions under future
land use scenarios. It is based on estimates of how much traffic will be generated by new
development, what streets are available for the traffic to use, and the amount of new traffic the
street system can accommodate. This evaluation also can be performed during the development
review process in order to help determine types and intensities of land use, as well as suitable
mitigation measures.
The STA traffic model forecasts traffic countywide and takes into consideration land use
projections for every Solano County jurisdiction, as well as surrounding counties and regions.
The model generates a picture of future local and through-traffic, which provides an estimate of
future demand from outside Rio Vista. This identifies where forces outside the community’s
control may affect the Rio Vista Bridge and Highway 12.
TRAFFIC FORECASTS FOR 2010 AND 2025
The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve Engineering, 2001) forecasts circulation needs
and identifies the physical improvements and management practices necessary to appropriately
serve future travel demand. The study corridor covered the portion of Highway 12 between
Interstate 80 and the Rio Vista Bridge, and examined traffic movement west of Summerset
Drive, west of Church Road (including the Church Road intersection), and the Highway 12
segment through Rio Vista.
The STA Traffic Model evaluates future traffic levels and forecasts traffic conditions at the same
three study intersections and roadway segments shown in Tables 8-4 and 8-5. Near-term traffic
projections for 2010 assumed a linear growth in traffic from existing levels to those levels
projected for 2025.
Except for the portion through downtown Rio Vista, the Highway 12 corridor currently does
not experience regular periods of congestion and delay; however, travel demand forecasts
predict that traffic will more than double over the next 20 years. The STA bases its conclusions
and recommendations primarily on LOS calculations at the key intersections and link and
roadway segments for 2010 and 2025.
          INTERSECTION LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR 2010 AND 2025
Table 8-9 presents the results of the LOS analysis at the three study intersections. Except for a
traffic signal to be installed at the intersection of Highway 12 and Main Street-Hillside Terrace,
the analysis assumes no roadway improvements. Results show that the identified near-term

operational movements would result in acceptable operating conditions in 2010. By 2025,
however, unacceptable conditions would prevail at the Church Road intersection.

          RIO VISTA BRIDGE
The Rio Vista Bridge over the Sacramento River is a two-lane, twin-tower drawbridge that
raises the bridge deck in order to allow water traffic to pass. Bridge operations periodically
create significant delays, stopping traffic for several minutes at a time while water traffic is
passing. The bridge is a key facility for Rio Vista residents. The STA Traffic Model shows that
43 percent of current traffic on the bridge originates or ends in Rio Vista (Rio Vista traffic), while
about 57 percent is traffic passing through—neither originating or stopping in Rio Vista
(through-traffic). The model projects a similar proportion throughout the General Plan
buildout; the percentages change only slightly by 2020, to 45 percent Rio Vista traffic and 55
percent through-traffic.
The main concern with the bridge is the limitation of its two-lane capacity. The STA Traffic
Model shows the bridge falling to LOS E at peak hours by 2010 (50 percent buildout), although
only one segment of Highway 12 is projected to require four lanes at the same time. (The model
calculates the delays caused by water traffic by treating the bridge as a city street, with traffic
signals rather than the drawbridge delays.) The model estimates the capacity of the Rio Vista
Bridge with its existing configuration to be approximately 900 vehicles per hour per direction
(approximately 18,000 ADT). Long-term (2025) traffic projections indicate that additional
capacity for crossing the Sacramento River may be necessary.
TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION MANAGEMENT
The need to improve roadway and parking facilities will be carefully balanced with the need to
control traffic congestion. Unrestricted expansion of roadways and parking would undermine
attempts to promote the use of alternative means of transportation. The long-term economic
and social health of Rio Vista depends on favorable traffic conditions, which can be maintained
only through a balanced transportation system.
The regional study showed that Transportation Demand Management (TDM) improvements
such as carpooling and local shuttle and transit service, would not be sufficient to noticeably
improve operating conditions along Highway 12. Safety improvements at Church Road and
Summerset Drive and near-term traffic improvements to Highway 12 outside the City would
improve conditions in the short term. However, traffic improvements that include widening
Highway 12 from Summerset Road to River Road, installing a traffic signal at Church Road, and
improving the Rio Vista Bridge likely would be needed in the long-term to serve future traffic
volumes.
The City has considered the alternatives from the Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve
Engineering, 2001) to develop policies and implementing actions that will improve circulation
through the city during the time frame of this General Plan. The map in Figure 8-3 illustrates
the proposed circulation system and reflects the findings of the regional study, in addition to
other anticipated needs.
STREET AND ROADWAY SYSTEM NEEDS
All streets are designed to function as multi-modal facilities that serve local vehicular,
pedestrian, and bicycle traffic; provide access to businesses, residences, and other streets and
facilities; and carry varying traffic volumes. Rather than applying a single standard for all
circumstances, this General Plan uses performance-based improvement standards for the
community streets.

July 18, 2002

The traffic analysis for this element indicates that the roads in Rio Vista require improvements
to accommodate the amount of development projected for 2020. However, adding and
widening roads is expensive and may diminish certain positive elements of Rio Vista’s
character. Approaches to balancing major road improvements with other ways of improving
circulation include TDM or Transportation Systems Management; more efficient operation of
existing roads; providing multiple linkages between new and existing neighborhoods, and
within new developments; and improvements to the bicycle and pedestrian circulation systems.
          ARTERIALS
Figures 8-1 and 8-3 show the current and anticipated arterial streets in Rio Vista, respectively.
Highway 12 is the City’s primary arterial. The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent and the STA
Traffic Model indicate that Highway 12 will require various levels of improvements over time,
including intersection enhancements, traffic signals, safety measures, and eventual widening to
four lanes throughout Rio Vista. The Rio Vista Bridge will begin to constrain LOS capabilities
regardless of the level of improvement elsewhere. This element discusses both Highway 12 and
the bridge in greater detail in other sections. The traffic study indicates that other arterial streets
will need various levels of improvement—ranging from selective intersection improvements
and signalizations to four-lane, divided segments in some locations. Arterial street
improvements also must accommodate transit, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic.

          COLLECTORS
Figures 8-1 and 8-3 show current and anticipated collector streets in Rio Vista, respectively.
Traffic levels and adjacent development conditions largely will determine the need for
improvements on these streets. Collectors range from two-lane residential streets that convey
traffic to an arterial street (e.g., Drouin Drive) or from one neighborhood to another, to median-
divided facilities that serve commercial, industrial, and residential traffic. Collectors also may
become arterials as conditions change. Neighborhood character and pedestrian access will be
important factors in the City’s consideration of proposed design of improvements to collector
streets.
          LOCAL STREETS
Local streets provide access to individual residences and some businesses. The development of
new neighborhoods adds new local streets. The need for driveway access, on-street parking,
pedestrian access, and connections within and between neighborhoods, as well as
neighborhood character will determine improvements to existing local streets, as shown in
Table 8-11 and Table 8-12. Roads that are currently local in function and design may become
collectors as traffic increases and improvements are made.
PROPOSED CIRCULATION SYSTEM
There are a variety of components in the City’s proposed circulation system. These include
function and standards, visual and pedestrian characteristics, functional (performance)
characteristics, and local street descriptions. The following sections describe these components
as they apply to the proposed circulation system in further detail.
          VISUAL AND PEDESTRIAN CHARACTERISTICS
The local streets that provide access and connections to individual residences and
neighborhoods are key elements in the creation of the traditional “village” character and
ambiance of Rio Vista. The relationship of street frontage, sidewalks, trees, front yards, and
house design is critical to the creation of pedestrian-friendly, pleasant neighborhoods. These
neighborhoods should accommodate the automobile without sacrificing pedestrian ease,
comfort, and safety. Therefore, this General Plan envisions construction of all future local
streets in Rio Vista with “parkways” separating sidewalks from vehicle travel ways. In most
cases, the sidewalk will be separated from the curb by at least 5 feet of landscaped parkway,
with street trees planted at 30-foot intervals.

          FUNCTIONAL (PERFORMANCE) CHARACTERISTICS
Several key elements will determine how streets in proposed developments will function or
perform and, therefore, will influence their design.
          •   Traffic volume served. Traffic volume measured in average daily vehicle trips (also
              referred to as average daily traffic or ADT) will be the most important determinant
              of the needed width and access control. ADT factors include the number of
              residences taking direct access, the location of a segment or block within the
              development (i.e., how many other streets feed traffic onto the particular segment),
              and the directional preference of drivers to and from traffic attractors outside the
              block.
          •   Design speed. Expected vehicle speed will affect the need for width and access
              control. Wider streets encourage faster vehicular speeds. Local streets are expected
              to be designed for slow speeds—25 miles per hour (mph) for residential streets; 15
              mph for limited residential, one-way, and cross streets; and 10 mph for alleys.
          •   One-way or two-way traffic. One-way traffic requires only one through-lane, while
              two-way flows need at least two through-lanes.
          •   Number of lots taking access within a block. The number of driveways or vehicles
              that will need to be accommodated for local access, in addition to any through-traffic
              expected to be present, will be a consideration in the review of proposed
              development.
          •   Lot width or density. Lot width or density will determine the number of lots served
              by a street segment or block. If lots are wider, there are fewer access points for street
              loading, which reduce street width requirements.
          •   Direct access from residences. Whether residences access the street from multiple
              driveways along the street (front-loaded lots) or only at discrete points is a
              determining factor in street width requirements. For example, each lot may gain
              access by a separate driveway from the front of the lot to a garage or from controlled
              drives or alleys. More access points along streets correspond to more potential
              vehicle conflicts and necessitate wider streets. Street width can be reduced if street
              loading occurs at fewer access points.
          •   Garage location. Placing the garage in the rear of the lot will allow for more parking
              on the lot or within alleys, reducing the need for on-street parking lanes.
          •   Length of block. The length of a block affects the number of lots served and traffic
              accommodated by a given street segment. Longer blocks must accommodate more
              traffic, more lots, and more vehicle entry points—with more potential conflicts;
              therefore, development on longer blocks requires wider street sections.
          •   On-street parking. The presence or absence of on-street parking affects street width
              requirements. A determination will be made whether to provide on-street parking
              on one, both, or neither side(s). The required amount of on-street parking
              diminishes with the presence of alley parking and longer driveways.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       8-32                             Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

          LOCAL STREET DESCRIPTIONS
In this General Plan, the local street hierarchy consists of residential streets, minor/limited
residential streets, cross streets, and alleys.
          •   Residential streets are expected to provide parking on both sides and carry traffic
              volumes of 500 ADT or more.
          •   Minor/limited residential streets generally have parking only on one side. This
              allows for a narrower street with a lower design speed (15 mph), which is expected
              to accommodate less than 500 ADT.
          •   Cross streets connect blocks, but no lots directly access these streets. They are
              typically short segments, crossing no more than two or three intersections. On-street
              parking is not present because there are no fronting lots. Alleys, common drives, or
              parking courts may intersect and take access to these cross streets mid-block.
          •   Alleys are narrow roadways that provide direct access to lots in a controlled
              fashion—as they preclude direct driveway access by individual lots to a fronting
              street. Alleys usually provide rear access to garages, carriage houses, onsite parking,
              and service vehicles and are constructed to driveway standards. Alleys are expected
              to carry only the traffic from the lots served and have a very low design speed of
              10 mph. Future design specifications will provide for a travelway of at least 16 feet
              wide, as well as a 3-foot width of landscaped area between the travelway and rear
              lot fences.
FUTURE CIRCULATION IMPROVEMENTS
          LOCAL STREETS
In the future, heavy traffic on through-streets may prompt drivers to take shortcuts through
residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, as development occurs in the area south of the existing
Old Rio Vista neighborhoods, residential traffic will increase. Because there are no arterials
connecting the downtown or Highway 12 from the south, through-traffic may affect Old Rio
Vista neighborhoods—primarily along Second, Third, and Front Streets. The Drouin Drive and
Sierra Drive neighborhoods also may experience through-traffic problems as growth occurs.
Streets that are wider than residential scale also generate impacts because they tempt drivers to
speed.
Figure 8-3 shows general locations and routes for critical street linkages. Some of those linkages
are collector streets; others are neighborhood, local, or minor streets that need to be strategically
located in order to provide multi-modal connections between neighborhoods, major streets, or
other destinations.
          HIGHWAY 12
The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent (Korve Engineering, 2001) indicates that sometime
around 2010 (the halfway point in the projected buildout of this General Plan), portions of
Highway 12 will need to be expanded to four lanes in order to maintain the LOS standards set
by the policies of this element. By full buildout in 2020 or beyond, all of Highway 12 through
Rio Vista will need to be four lanes. The study also acknowledges that, long-term, the Rio Vista
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      8-33                             Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

Bridge will need to be expanded or a new bridge will need to be constructed in another
location—creating a bypass for inter-regional (through) traffic. The particulars of location,
design, and funding require a future study and planning process. The STA Traffic Model
supported and recommended the following improvements:
          •   Widen Highway 12 to four lanes from the city limits west of Summerset Road to
              River Road (this could be a phased improvement over a number of years, as traffic
              demand warrants).
          •   Install a traffic signal and improve the intersection of Highway 12 and Church Road.
This Circulation & Mobility element identifies as a key policy a pedestrian and bicycle trail and
pathway system, linking the Sacramento River to existing neighborhoods and downtown, as
well as to future neighborhoods, parks, and commercial centers. The hazard that Highway 12
poses is one of the most serious obstacles to the realization of the trail system linkage; a means
for crossing the highway at key locations between signalized intersections is necessary.
Numerous stakeholders will have a role in resolving the issues surrounding Highway 12. The
City has primary fiscal responsibility for improvements (through the Roadway Impact Fee,
right-of-way dedication requirements, and development review process), and the State provides
various funding sources. The MTC and STA also administer several funding programs that
may provide additional local funds for sidewalks, landscaping, safety crossings, and similar
improvements.
          RIO VISTA BRIDGE
In 1992 Caltrans studied the Rio Vista Bridge extensively, including a review of a number of
options for a “high bridge” and bypass to route traffic around Rio Vista in the future. The
Caltrans study of bridge alternatives considered an Antioch-style “high bridge” with a freeway-
standard bypass. Caltrans preferred a route to the south, linking a bypass to Highway 12 at
Azevedo Road. A “second drawbridge” with a design that raised the base level of the platform
to 50 feet above water was given limited consideration. This design required removing the
existing bridge and building two new bridges to the new specification. It also would have
required business relocation and other community hardships.
          DOWNTOWN BYPASS ROUTE
Both the northern bypass route shown in the 1991 Amendments to the 1985 Rio Vista General Plan
(City of Rio Vista, 1990) and the southern bypass indicated as the preferred route in the 1992
Caltrans study would create severe community and environmental impacts. A bypass located
miles to the north or south would severely impact the viability of the existing highway
commercial retail base and likely would force relocation of much of this activity to the bypass
route outside the proposed urban limits. The previously recommended northern bypass route
now conflicts with the policies of the DPC. The area north of the City is largely floodplain,
wetland and drainage areas, and agricultural lands. The area south of the City contains the
Montezuma Hills and large dryland farming operations, as well as sensitive habitat areas along
the Sacramento River.
After reviewing potential alternatives, the General Plan Steering Committee recommended
Airport Road as a potential bypass route with more community benefits and fewer drawbacks
than the earlier recommendations. Airport Road is less than 1 mile from the existing bridge,
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       8-34                            Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

which makes the location less likely to draw business activity away from the downtown and
existing corridor. Also, Airport Road is already designated as a major arterial, with a proposed
right-of-way of 100 feet. An Airport Road bypass would pass through the heart of Rio Vista’s
industrial districts, thereby increasing visibility of these areas. A bypass at the Airport Road
location would relocate the major truck access points away from the existing business district
and residential areas. Concerns regarding this bypass route include avoiding environmental
impacts and acquisition of excessive rights-of-way.
          TRANSIT SYSTEM
Highway 12 is designated as an interim future transit route. Planned transit stops include the
locations along Highway 12, Church Road (north and south of Highway 12), Main Street, and
the intersection of Liberty Island and Canright Roads in order to serve proposed commercial
activity centers.
          BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
The Rio Vista General Plan is intended to encourage walking and biking by design. Street
improvements should be viewed as an opportunity to enhance the bicycle and pedestrian
system. Development projects should be designed so that pedestrians—especially seniors and
adults with small children—and cyclists will feel safe from traffic. Sidewalk width, intersection
configuration, and proximity to heavy traffic will be considered in assessing the need for
connector trails and pathways. The City will encourage narrow streets and intersections with
narrow turn radii to slow traffic. In some situations, motorized vehicles will be given priority
because of their sheer numbers and the need to reduce congestion.
Adding traffic signals that respond to bicyclists riding over detectors in the pavement or to
pedestrians pushing buttons that change the signal will help to make bicycling and walking safe
and convenient in Rio Vista. Intersections also will require ramps for wheelchairs, baby
carriages, and other non-motorized vehicles. The City will encourage consideration of
alternatives, such as continuous sidewalks, pedestrian and bicycle bridges, underpasses, and
designated routes through large developments, to prevent long detours for bicyclists and
pedestrians.
Carefully placed buildings and well-planned pathways will encourage people to walk and
bicycle to and from and within developments. For example, clustering buildings around a core,
placing parking behind buildings, or separating parking areas into smaller lots or courts all
reduce the distances between buildings. In some large developments, it also will be important
to build paths or walkways through the site to connect with public sidewalks. The City will
encourage the use of landscaping, shade trees, benches, and lighting to make walking more
pleasant.
          BIKEWAYS
Currently, all bikeways in Rio Vista are on-street bicycle lanes or routes. The proposed off-street
path system will permit both pedestrians and riders to enjoy a safe, relaxing environment free
from vehicular traffic, as well as create a natural connection from both new and existing
residential neighborhoods to the Sacramento River.
Figure 8-4 provides a map of the proposed trails and pathways system, which includes some
existing pathways. Class I bikeways are separate off-street bicycle paths or trails for bicycles

July 18, 2002

only. Multi-use trails are off-street paths that are shared by pedestrians. As described earlier in
this chapter, Class II bicycle lanes are striped lanes on existing rights-of-way, and Class III
bicycle routes are signed bikeway routes that share the roadway with motor vehicles. Criteria
for locating these routes are listed in Table 8-7.
          BICYCLE PARKING
The City will ensure that parking is easily accessible and well-designed in an effort to
encourage people to ride their bicycles to work, school, retail, and other community facilities.
Bicycle racks and lockers will be installed to protect bicycles from theft and bad weather. Racks
will clearly define where bicycles should be parked, discouraging impediments to pedestrians
and damage to trees or other stationary objects that might be used as alternative bicycle racks.
Making lockers available to long-term users, such as office workers, will provide them security
and protection from the elements. Short-term users, such as shoppers, will require simply
designed racks that are convenient to use. The City will review and update its ordinances as
needed in order to recognize the varying demands for bicycle parking.

 Rio Vista General Plan 2001 8-37 Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002
          PEDESTRIAN NETWORK
Since children comprise the largest segment of pedestrians in Rio Vista, areas with a large
concentration of children, such as schools and playgrounds, will demand special attention to the
separation of pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Careful neighborhood, building, and site
design—including the relative proximity to convenience goods and services—promotes
pedestrian travel and safety. The City will achieve these objectives through successful
implementation of this element along with the Land Use and Community Character & Design
elements. In addition, the Trails and Pathways Map shown in Figure 8-4 proposes to establish a
safe means of travel for pedestrians, including a grade-separated crossing at Highway 12
between Drouin Drive and Church Road.
MOVEMENT OF GOODS
With the anticipated local and regional growth, Highway 12 likely will continue to serve as the
primary truck route, with local truck deliveries coming into the downtown on Main and Front
Streets. Other local roads that typically serve trip destinations in the industrial or employment
districts in the north areas will likely continue to experience high volumes of truck traffic.
Airport, Church, Liberty Island, and Canright Roads all bisect or traverse existing or planned
commercial and industrial districts. The City proposes to designate these roads as truck routes
(including transport of hazardous materials) for the foreseeable future or until safety
considerations preclude truck traffic. Figure 8-5 shows the anticipated future truck routes.

F.        Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions
An effective circulation system provides for the movement of people, goods, and energy, while
minimizing negative external effects such as safety hazards, congestion, and noise. This
element provides guidance toward improving the efficiency of the City’s transportation and
circulation network. The City of Rio Vista has developed goals, policies, and implementing
actions that stem from and are intended to achieve the related Rio Vista Principles and vision
statements developed through the community visioning process. The implementing actions
associated with each policy are fully described in Section G, “Implementing Actions,” at the end
of this chapter.
STREETS AND ROADWAY SYSTEM
The City’s policies for its streets and roadway system direct development to integrate
opportunities for all modes of transportation in order to facilitate movement throughout the
City. Large residential developments have concentrations of people, some of whom will work
in the same general locations. Developers will be expected to incorporate design features that
encourage (or at least do not discourage) access by bicycle, sidewalk connections, carpool
waiting areas, and—as the population grows, bus stops.

NEIGHBORHOOD CIRCULATION
          NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The intent of the City’s neighborhood circulation policies is to ensure that new development
roadways are designed on a grid or modified grid street system that provides multiple choices
of routes to destinations—both for drivers and pedestrians. Traffic dispersal prevents
concentration on one or a few neighborhood streets that are not intended to serve as primary
traffic routes. Allowing for the continuation of the grid into adjacent properties in the future
will enable this pattern of dispersal to continue as growth progresses. Multiple intersections
with stop signs also encourage through-traffic to use collector and arterial streets instead of
local ones. In addition, the same measures discussed and illustrated in the following section,
“Existing Neighborhoods,” can be designed into new neighborhoods as they are built.

          EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS
A range of physical and program options can be used to divert traffic or slow it down. Simple
visual cues, instituted as part of an overall neighborhood design plan, often will solve traffic-
related problems. Although visual cues do not serve as traffic controls, landscaping, signage,
and other improvements tell drivers that they are entering a quiet residential place, where they
should drive more slowly, be more aware of conditions along the edge of the street, and respect
local pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Recognizable neighborhood entries are visual cues. Entries
can be marked by short center medians or corner curb “bulb-outs” with landscaping and signs.
Short medians or tree planting pockets that extend into the parking lane narrow the perceived
width of the street, which can control speed. Where visual cues do not work, the next step
would be to consider installing speed undulations or closing the street partially or completely.
Speed undulations are raised pavement, similar to speed bumps, but much wider. It is
important to note that physical deterrents may increase response times for emergency vehicles,
reduce access, increase noise, and cause new and increased maintenance costs.

              traffic growth.
RIO VISTA BRIDGE
For the foreseeable future, routing through-traffic miles away from Rio Vista would result in
devastating effects on the current retail economy. Any such bypass also would result in major
environmental and visual impacts. A bypass north of Airport Road is contrary to policies of the
DPC, while a southern bypass would cut through the Montezuma Hills, wetlands, and
farmlands. Both routes would induce growth in areas outside the current and proposed urban
limits and would force premature annexation in order to manage this growth. Furthermore, the
costs of the previous alternatives studied in 1992 are prohibitive. Therefore, the City seeks to
identify a less costly and damaging alternative and funding source for the immediate future.
The City shall support an alignment along Airport Road as the preferred alternative, until
further information is obtained.

HIGHWAY 12 CORRIDOR
Today, Highway 12 bisects Rio Vista, acting as a physical a barrier between the two “halves” of
the community. Pedestrian crossings are particularly hazardous. This hazard poses one of the
most serious obstacles to the realization of the trail system linkage; a means for crossing the
highway at key locations between signalized intersections is necessary. This element identifies,
as a key policy, the establishment of a pedestrian/bicycle trails and pathways system that links
the Sacramento River to existing neighborhoods and downtown, as well as to future
neighborhoods, parks, and commercial centers.
Resolving the issues surrounding Highway 12 must involve numerous stakeholders. The City
bears the primary fiscal responsibility for improvements (through the Roadway Impact Fee
Program, right-of-way dedication requirements, and the development review process) and the
State of California provides various funding sources. The MTC and STA also administer several
funding programs that may provide additional local funds for sidewalks, landscaping, safety
crossings, and similar improvements.
GOAL 8.12          TO SUCCESSFULLY LINK THE TWO “HALVES” OF RIO VISTA BISECTED BY

F.        Implementing Actions for Circulation & Mobility (CM)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Circulation & Mobility element.
CM-1               LAND USE MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
Local land use planning is a method of managing regional traffic growth and local traffic issues.
This General Plan includes land use policies aimed at giving more Rio Vista workers the choice
of living closer to their jobs and encouraging housing growth to follow new job creation, rather
than increase the proportion of long-distance commuters. The Land Use Map establishes
policies supporting mixed uses and higher density development within walking distance of
planned commercial and activity centers (e.g., the intersection of Highway 12 and Church Road
and the downtown). If other communities adopt similar policies, it also may be possible to
improve the balance of jobs and housing on a county or regional level, which will reduce the
length and number of commute trips.
The City will designate a mix of uses at higher intensities near potential transit stops and near
commercial and employment centers shown on the Land Use Map of this General Plan. The
City periodically will review land use policies and regulations as the transit system develops.
CM-2               SPECIFIC PLANS
                   (Proposed)
As determined to be appropriate, the City will require major new development proposals to be
processed through specific plans or planned unit development (PUD) permits that are
consistent with these policies and the Land Use element, as well as amended Zoning and
Subdivision Ordinances.
CM-3               ROADWAY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND STREET DESIGN
                   (Proposed)
Streets are classified in a hierarchy that identifies categories or types based on their functional
requirements and their relative importance in establishing community character, defining
neighborhoods, providing connections between key land uses and neighborhoods, and
allowing opportunities for alternative modes of travel. The location of arterials and primary
streets (collector and important local street connections) are shown on Figure 8-5. During project
design review, the City will require that the locations of other minor streets are consistent with
these standards and criteria.
The following tables and illustrations describe three general levels of streets: arterials, collectors
and residential access streets. Arterials are designed to carry high traffic volumes; collectors,
moderate volumes; and residential streets, lower to moderate volumes that allow for direct
access to residential units or lots from these streets. Residential access streets are further
divided into five street types: the neighborhood through-street is the standard; four optional
street types with narrower sections may be used only when lower traffic volumes and certain
neighborhood characteristics allow. The performance standards that create the conditions for a
particular street type determine these characteristics.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          8-56                        Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002
All street types are governed by performance factors, performance standards and design
characteristics typical of the type of roadway described. These are intended to provide direction
to the City’s decision makers (staff, planning commission, city council and others as applicable)
for interpretation and implementation. The performance standards and design characteristics
are to be considered as the required implementation criteria, unless, in the sole judgment of the
decision maker(s), an alternative approach is demonstrated to fully achieve the intent of the
Circulation Element’s goals and policies and this implementation measure and to be equivalent
or superior to the criteria and standards specified below.
          •   Performance factors. A listing or description of particular traffic, safety, or
              community character conditions, the presence of any one of which creates an impact
              that will require a specified street type as the minimum condition necessary to
              accommodate that environmental factor or condition. For example, high traffic
              volumes on a particular street or the use of that street for through-traffic connections
              with other communities would require the street to be classified as an arterial. The
              absence of performance factors indicates that the utilization of a particular street is
              optional.
          •   Performance standards. A listing or description of the minimum conditions that
              must exist and are based on street type being used. For example, designation as an
              arterial street requires that future development or improvements to that street
              adhere to all performance standards listed, such as no on-street parking,
              intersections and curb cuts separated by at least 600 feet, and capability for a 35-mph
              speed limit.
          •   Design characteristics. A set of design specifications that apply to individual street
              types at buildout of the General Plan. Initial phases or segments of arterials or
              collector streets may not need to incorporate all listed characteristics but should be
              able to be accommodate them when needed (e.g., right-of-way width and placement
              of utilities in initial phases must be able to accommodate future lanes, landscaping,
              and separated sidewalks). Some characteristics are flexible (e.g., the ultimate right-
              of-way for collector streets may range from 60 to 82 feet, depending on adjacent land
              uses and projected traffic demands).

CM-4               DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
Most nonresidential developments built since 1960 have been oriented toward automobiles. For
example, building entries face vast parking lots; sidewalks are lacking or circuitous; and in
business parks, often no lunchrooms are on the site or restaurants nearby. Zoning may
exacerbate this by limiting uses to single-purpose manufacturing or employment functions,
thereby requiring additional trips for business or civic services. Some fairly simple changes in
the design of new development and redevelopment could encourage people to carpool, ride the
bus, bicycle, or walk to work, thereby reducing unnecessary trips during the business day. Such
revisions include rideshare drop-off and waiting areas, bicycle parking, preferential parking for
carpools and vanpools, direct access to transit stops, transit pullouts and shelters, and showers
for bicyclists. Onsite services could include printing and postage, repair, and rental facilities;
pedestrian amenities and landscaping along sidewalks; building entry orientation toward
streets rather than parking lots; lunchrooms; restaurants; and banking services. Most modern
employment uses can be allowed in the downtown or retail areas, which would place
employment near business and personal services, as well as add population that would support
retail activities during the day.
The City’s Community Development and Public Works Departments will conduct a review of
each proposed development. If the City determines that a development proposal requires a
traffic impact study, the analysis will be prepared to be consistent with the assumptions and
methodology of the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) traffic model. In conjunction with
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process, the traffic impact study may include
(1) an analysis that evaluates traffic conditions assuming “market-based” development
standards, and (2) a “full buildout” analysis (i.e., 20-year) that evaluates traffic conditions
assuming buildout of the City under the General Plan. The traffic study will define what
transportation improvements or measures are necessary to maintain the level of service (LOS)
standards and will address funding impacts. The City will use the full buildout traffic analysis
to identify locations where additional rights-of-way should be preserved beyond those required
under the 20-year analysis. The City will consider whether improvements can be included in
the existing right-of-way before widening or otherwise expanding streets and intersections.
Several developments and the City, where appropriate, would share the costs over time of
specific improvements or traffic reduction programs—such as Transportation Systems
Management (TSM). Area-wide studies, including the General Plan and zoning studies, could
establish the types of improvements and programs, as well as the appropriate methods of
payment. Assessment districts, roadway impact fees, or development agreements would
allocate the appropriate share of the costs to specific developments.
Development review also will include compliance with CEQA, which requires cities to assess
the environmental effects of new development, including traffic. CEQA requires a traffic
analysis if a project is large or is expected to produce a significant increase in traffic demand.
The Solano County Congestion Management Plan (CMP) also requires a traffic analysis for
large projects that require General Plan amendments. When the traffic analysis shows that the
development will cause an intersection or roadway segment to drop below desired levels of
service, the City may require the new development to alleviate its share of the congestion.
In accordance with CEQA, the City will require a traffic-impact analysis for large new
developments and those with the potential to worsen traffic conditions. Prior to project
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     8-65                            Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

approval, the City will require new development to demonstrate that the proposed mitigation
measures will be adequate to prevent deterioration in level of service standards. The City will
review environmental impact reports for proposed transportation projects to ensure that
adequate mitigation measures are incorporated that will effectively reduce traffic impacts.
CM-5               CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will adopt a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) that includes the arterial streets and
intersection improvements required to maintain level of service standards set forth in this
element. Korve Engineering’s (2001) Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent study also has
identified near-term (2010) safety improvements.
The City’s CIP could include some or all of the following improvements:
          •   Improvements to Drouin Drive.
          •   Improvements to Highway 12 between Drouin Drive and the Rio Vista Bridge (in
              cooperation with Caltrans).
          •   Replacement of deteriorated sidewalks.
          •   Priority designations for improvement of specific intersections.
          •   Installation of a trail and bicycle system.
          •   Improvement of existing roads, signs, and traffic signals that encourage walking and
              bicycle travel.
          •   Installation of bridges and undercrossings for bicyclists and pedestrians.
          •   Installation of bicycle parking in the downtown and at City parks, civic buildings,
              and other community facilities.
          •   Installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of Highway 12 and Hillside Terrace.
          •   Installation of a signalized, lighted crosswalk at the intersection of Highway 12 and
              Gardiner Way.
          •   Addition of left-turn lanes and acceleration-deceleration lanes at the intersection of
              Highway 12 and Church Road as recommended in the Highway 12 Major
              Improvement Study and Project Study Report Equivalent [Korve Engineering, 2001]).
          •   Installation of advance warning flashers west of the intersection of Highway 12 and
              Summerset Road as recommended in the Highway 12 Major Improvement Study and
              Project Study Report Equivalent [Korve Engineering, 2001])..

July 18, 2002

CM-6               ROADWAY IMPACT FEE PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will consistently levy a roadway impact fee on new development, through fee
adoption by ordinance, development agreements, conditions of approval, and other project
entitlements. In determining the fee, the City will consider traffic projections in 2020—as
determined by the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) traffic model or other equivalent
methodologies—for the proposed new development. The City will allow credits against the
Roadway Impact Fee in order to provide immediate funding or construction and to prevent
deterioration of existing levels of service. Developers will be eligible for fee credits after
reaching an agreement with the City on the improvement location(s) and design(s), and the
City’s acceptance of the completed construction. The City will assign responsibility for
providing improvements on Highway 12, intersections, and arterial and collector streets as
shown in Tables 8-11 and 8-12.
CM-7               TRAFFIC REDUCTION MEASURES
                   (Proposed)
The City will use the Solano County Travel Demand Model (also referred to in this element as
the Solano Transportation Authority [STA] Traffic Model) and the Highway 12 Major Investment
Study and Project Study Report Equivalent (Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent) (Korve
Engineering, 2001) in evaluating the balance between development and transportation. The
City will actively participate with STA to implement Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) measures.
The Highway 12 MIS and PSR Equivalent was prepared not only to identify the type and size of
roadway facility necessary to serve traffic levels forecasted, but also to develop a phased
implementation plan for near-term physical improvements and establish management practices
to serve near-term traffic levels. The report identified the following measures with the best
potential for reducing traffic:
          •   Carpooling program (park-and-ride lot). The City will construct a park-and-ride lot
              that will accommodate approximately 50 vehicles at its first phase. Once fully
              utilized, the City will expand the facilities to increase its capacity. The City will
              construct the park-and-ride lot a location visible from Highway 12 and will include
              installing signage on the highway to identify the lot as a park-and-ride facility. Land
              availability will drive the exact location of the site; land dedication may be required
              of future development. The City would launch a local advertising campaign to
              publicize the new facilities and the benefits of carpooling. The advertising campaign
              also would emphasize the use of STA’s existing ride-matching service.
          •   Local shuttle program. In conjunction with STA, the City would implement a local
              shuttle program that connects the Trilogy retirement community and future
              development with the retail and commercial uses in Suisun City and Fairfield. A
              single bus running on 1-hour cycles is expected to meet initial demand. The City
              would expand the program to include shorter cycles or other areas through STA’s
              purchase of additional buses.
          •   Transit service. The City envisions a new SolanoLink route running from Fairfield
              to Suisun City and Rio Vista along Highway 12. The new route would connect to the
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       8-67                              Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

              Capitol Corridor Station and the upcoming Fairfield Transportation Center. The
              City expects 1-hour cycles to meet the initial demand.
CM-8               INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
Regional planning is a method for addressing traffic congestion and air pollution that result
from long-distance commuting. Rio Vista is working with many regional agencies to mitigate
these impacts, including the following:
          •   Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). The MTC is the Bay
              Area’s “metropolitan planning organization” (MPO) for the nine counties of the Bay
              Area, including Solano County. According to federal transportation policy, an MPO
              is responsible for transportation planning and distribution of a wide range of
              transportation funds, particularly federal funding. MTC prepares and implements a
              regional transportation plan and conducts studies of transportation corridors.
          •   Solano County Transportation Authority (STA). The STA is the “local planning
              organization” (LPO) responsible for providing a planning function similar to the
              MTC but on a “sub-regional” or countywide basis. This agency prepares and
              implements a comprehensive countywide transportation plan and coordinates the
              transportation efforts of Solano County cities with MTC. Most funding decisions are
              recommendations to MTC. Depending on the requirements of the particular
              programs, STA may have the authority to directly approve a city’s funding request
              in certain areas. STA is also Solano County’s Congestion Management Agency
              (CMA). As such, STA is responsible for developing standards for traffic service
              levels, called a Congestion Management Program (CMP), for particular identified
              roadways in Solano County. In Rio Vista, the CMP roadway is Highway 12.
          •   Caltrans. Caltrans is the state agency responsible for transportation on a statewide
              level and will work with the City on improvements to Highway 12 within the City.
The City will continue to coordinate with these and other agencies as follows:
          •   The City will work with the River Delta Unified School District to provide safe
              crossings and access for school children.
          •   The City will continue to provide City Council and staff representation on regional
              transportation planning groups.
          •   The City will represent the needs of Rio Vista residents to transit providers
              responsible for carrying out handicapped-access regulations.
          •   The City will actively support plans to increase the number of inter-city trains and
              plans for eventual commuter service with connections to BART and other regional
              transit facilities.
          •   The City will participate in County and regional transportation planning efforts.

CM-9               LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL FUNDS
                   (Existing)
Local sources of funding include redevelopment tax increment funding, the creation of an
assessment district, and park development funds. Other sources of funding may include, but
not be limited to Transportation Equity Act (TEA) transportation funds, State Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP), federal air quality funds, California Coastal Conservancy, State
Parkland Bond monies, and the California Department of Boating and Waterways. In the past,
the City has used these funding sources to construct roadway and waterway improvements.
CM-10              DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
                   (Existing)
Where appropriate, the City will use the development agreement process established under
State law and the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that developers of major new neighborhoods
comply with the policies of this General Plan and to establish other benefits to the City in
exchange for land use entitlement guarantees for developers and property owners.
CM-11              PUBLIC/PRIVATE COOPERATION
                   (Existing)
The City will coordinate with private transportation providers to develop innovative methods
for running needed shuttle services in Rio Vista. The City also will involve developers and
program managers of the Trilogy development in coordinating public and private transit
opportunities for mutual benefit. The City may provide incentives to: (1) increase the
availability of transportation services to areas within the City, and (2) provide access to critical
services (e.g., medical facilities) that are not available in Rio Vista and require travel to other
cities in Solano County.
The City will encourage existing businesses to install bicycle racks. Since bicyclists are the best
source of information about where improvements to the bicycle system are needed, the City
should consult them to obtain recommendations for improvements and to help develop
proposals for state and federal funding of bicycle projects.
CM-12              TRAILS AND PATHWAYS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City will implement the Trails and Pathways Map as shown in Figure 8-4, which requires
new development to include bikeways that connect to or become a part of the pedestrian and
bicycle system, wherever feasible. The Park and Recreation Commission will review the plan
periodically and advise staff and the City Council on needed improvements.
CM-13              COUNTYWIDE BICYCLE PLAN
                   (Existing)
To reduce consumption of non-renewable energy sources and to improve air quality, the City
will integrate its Trails and Pathways Map as shown in Figure 8-4 with the recently adopted
Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan (Alta Transportation Consulting, 2000). This action also will
further encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation. (Also see Policy RCM-21 in the
Resource Conservation & Management element.)

July 18, 2002
CM-14              ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS
                   (Proposed)
If new development creates the need for an arterial street or intersection improvement prior to
the development of the parcels adjacent to that improvement, the City may use an assessment
district as a funding source for these improvements. Assessment districts also may be used for
bikeways and trail maintenance within subdivisions.
CM-15              BIKEWAYS AND TRAILS MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
Under the supervision of the City’s Public Works Director, City staff regularly will maintain
bikeways and trails and bicycle facilities. Maintenance areas may include some trails that are
funded through assessment districts.
CM-16              PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH
                   (Proposed)
The City will create and distribute maps of Rio Vista’s bicycle system and information about
bicycle safety through newspapers and other publications at City buildings, schools, street fairs,
and special events. The City will continue and expand the Rio Vista Police Department’s role in
bicycle education and safety.
CM-17              NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will create a Neighborhood Improvement Program to determine appropriate traffic-
calming measures in neighborhoods with traffic issues. The City should structure the program
in such a way that ensures participation of residents, property owners, city departments,
schools, and other stakeholders. The City will work with neighborhoods and businesses to
decide (1) where curbs, gutters, and sidewalks are needed on unimproved local streets; and (2)
payment methods for improving and replacing facilities.
Several roadway design options are described on the following page.

                 •     “Bulb-outs” with landscaping at corners to slow traffic entering the street and
                       deter through-traffic.
                 •     “Gateway” markers on bulb-outs to announce neighborhood entrance and slow

                 •     A diverter is a closure or obstacle that channels traffic to preferred routes.
CM-18              TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT ACT
                   (Existing)
It is in the interest of the State that funds available for transit development are fully expended.
Such funds may be expended for physical improvement to improve the movement of transit
vehicles, the comfort of the patrons, and the exchange of patrons from one transportation mode
to another. The California Government Code incorporates the intent of the Transportation
Development Act and provides for the allocation of monies from the Local Transportation Fund
(LTF) to cities and counties for these purposes. Monies from the LTF help finance transit
services and transportation projects in Rio Vista.
CM-19              TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
                   (Proposed)
The City will implement Transportation Systems Management (TSM) to improve the efficiency
of its existing transportation systems. TSM is oriented toward making better use of existing
transportation facilities through short-term, low-cost improvements that are easier to
implement than system development modifications—such as roadway construction. A key
element in the City’s implementation of its TSM plan is the dissemination of information to
employers and employees concerning existing transit and rideshare options for trips between
home and work.
The City’s TSM plan will involve the implementation of Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) and Transportation Control Measures (TCMs). TDM uses techniques aimed at reducing
traffic congestion. These techniques include the promotion of flexible work schedules, rideshare
programs, and expanded transit service. These strategies give employees greater flexibility in
travel to and from work, which reduces congestion during peak commute periods.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                                8-71                                      Circulation & Mobility
July 18, 2002

TCMs are incorporated into state-mandated air quality plans at the regional level. These
measures can reduce the quantity of pollutants discharged by motor vehicles through a
reduction in the number of single-occupant vehicle trips. TCMs will include not only public
transit and ridesharing but also measures such as the use of cleaner-burning automobile fuels,
the adoption of local trip-reduction ordinances, the design of highways to mitigate negative air
quality impacts, and land use planning to reduce trip distances.
CM-20              ZONING ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The Zoning Ordinance is one of the primary tools for implementing the General Plan. Zoning is
the classification of the City into districts and the description of allowable uses and
development standards within each district. The City will review its Zoning Ordinance and
amend the ordinance as needed to bring it into conformance with the policies and proposals of
this General Plan.
CM-21              SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
In accordance with the Subdivision Map Act—Division 2 (Section 664201 et seq.) of the
California Government Code, the City has adopted a Subdivision Ordinance to regulate and
control the design and improvement of subdivisions, including the requirement for tentative
and final maps. The City will review its Subdivision Ordinance and amend the ordinance as
needed to bring it into conformance with the policies and proposals of this General Plan.

Chapter 9                   Open Space & Recreation
A.        Introduction
The maintenance of open space, or land and water, in a largely open physical state is crucial to
the well-being of any community. Open space not only provides the critical functions of
resource and habitat preservation but also allows visual and physical access to those resources
and their associated recreational opportunities. Open space also allows for the managed
production of agricultural, forestry, mineral, and other important resources. Human beings are
drawn to open space as a respite from the “hardscape” of roadways and buildings. Both
developed parklands and undeveloped natural features create organizing elements around
which neighborhoods and towns often are centered or oriented. Open space also defines the
limits or edges of a community’s urban development and the beginning of agricultural
production or resource management.
The Sacramento River is one of the City’s most spectacular natural resources. This large open
space not only contains valuable riparian habitat but also is the conduit of transportation and
economic activity that provides great economic value to the urbanized areas along its banks.
Access to and views of this resource are extremely important to both the history and identity of
Rio Vista.
The Open Space & Recreation element provides goals, policies, and implementing actions for
acquiring, developing, using, and preserving parks and open space over the long term. The
main themes of this element are (1) using cost-effective methods of acquiring open space;
(2) developing a trail system that integrates and connects with regional trail systems
surrounding Rio Vista; and (3) providing and maintaining adequate City parks, recreation
facilities, and other public spaces for current and future residents. Although agricultural lands
comprise the vast remainder of the City’s open space resources, the goals, policies, and
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      9-1                          Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002

implementing actions pertaining to agricultural lands are discussed in the Resource
Conservation & Management element of this General Plan.
During the Town Hall workshops and meetings that initiated the General Plan update, the
following critical community concerns emerged:
          •   Preserve open space.
          •   Enhance and improve access and the appearance of the riverfront as a community
              resource.
          •   Provide more recreational opportunities and developed parklands of all kinds.

July 18, 2002

B.        Purpose and Authority
The State of California recognizes the importance of open space and resource conservation
through the Government Code’s requirements and objectives for this element: the recognition of
open space as a valuable resource for its own sake, the coordination of local policies with state
and regional policies, and the use of open space to preserve environmentally sensitive natural
areas and habitat. State Government Code Section 65560 defines open space land as “any parcel
or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use for
the purposes of: (1) preservation of natural resources, (2) managed production of resources,
(3) outdoor recreation, and (4) public health and safety.”
The State encourages, but does not require, the General Plan to include a parks and/or
recreation element. Since recreation is an important concern of Rio Vista residents and since
park facilities and recreational opportunities cannot exist without open space, this element
includes parks and recreation issues, goals, and policies as an integrated whole.
This General Plan proposes the development of a network of open spaces to provide relief from
urbanization, access to natural areas, and the ability to travel along open space corridors to
reach destinations throughout the City. The network would create a series of contiguous and
non-contiguous open space parcels that bear a positive and direct relation to each other. Other
elements of this Plan propose land use, conservation, and boundary or annexation policies that
seek to preserve the viability of agricultural production and minimize conflicts between urban
and agricultural activities (see the Land Use, Planning Constraints & Boundaries, and Resource
Conservation & Management elements).
The Open Space & Recreation element is intended to fulfill three purposes:
          •   Meet State of California legislative requirements for the mandatory General Plan
              Open Space element.
          •   Integrate the discussion of open space with recreational opportunities and facilities,
              including parkland, and pedestrian and bicycle access.
          •   Provide specific parks, open space, and recreation development policies and
              standards that function as a master plan for community facilities in addition to the
              broad policy framework of a general plan element.
The scope of issues addressed in the Open Space & Recreation element overlaps with other
elements of the General Plan. This element should be used in combination with other elements
to ensure full implementation of all General Plan resource-related policies.

C.        The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
The community vision and planning principles that most directly relate to the Open Space &
Recreation element are listed below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     Farmland and nature are important elements of the community. A clear edge between urban
     development and agriculture should be maintained.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.
     New development should create complete neighborhoods rather than a series of subdivisions that are
     indistinguishable from those in other communities.
     Parking lots should not dominate street frontage, public spaces, or buildings.
     Community identity should be strengthened with attractive entryways on Highway 12, Main Street,
     and River Road.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
     The existing downtown and waterfront should be strengthened and retained as the central focus of
     the community. Cultural, civic, entertainment, and specialty retail uses—and supporting uses and
     activities should be located in the downtown and adjacent areas.
     Redevelopment of Rio Vista’s downtown and waterfront should create economic vitality and an
     atmosphere for walking and shopping. Historic building facades should be restored, and new projects
     should be linked to their surroundings.
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
     Commercial development along the Highway 12 corridor should not displace or preempt investment
     from the downtown or along the existing developed corridor.
PROVIDE ADEQUATE LEISURE AND RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL RIO VISTA RESIDENTS
     A range of parks, from tot-lots and village greens to ball fields and parkways, should be distributed
     within all of Rio Vista’s neighborhoods. Existing parks should be maintained and new parks should
     be provided as new neighborhoods are developed.
     New development should provide adequate recreation opportunities. Standards for parks, recreation
     facilities, and trails—and financial mechanisms for their operation and maintenance should be
     developed by and required of every new development.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           9-4                            Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002

PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES TO ALL RIO VISTANS IN
A FISCALLY HEALTHY AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER
     Growth should pay for itself. New development should ensure that sufficient public services are
     provided without additional burden to existing residents or over-extending current capacity.
     Rio Vista should continue its tradition of cooperation with private nonprofit agencies and other
     public agencies, to provide essential services for youth, seniors, the economically disadvantaged, and
     those in crisis.
     Adequate public facilities—sewer, water, transportation, public safety, parks, recreation, education,
     and others—should be in place or assured in a timely fashion before new development projects
     proceed.
     The Rio Vista Airport is a vital public facility and economic resource; new residential development
     must take steps to ensure that its viability is not threatened.

D.        Setting
Rio Vista has a strong orientation to the Sacramento River and to the rich agricultural lands of
the Central Valley. Locally, the Montezuma Hills are farmed in a method known as “dry land
farming,” producing grain and grass crops without expensive irrigation. The City’s location on
the river historically allowed for steady trade with the supply barges that moved up and down
the river. Today, the riverfront is devoted to service craft (dredgers and shoreline maintenance
operations), a few commercial fishermen and, primarily, pleasure craft. One of the City’s
neighborhoods backs up on the river, while a portion of the City’s industrial land faces the river
north of the Helen Madere Bridge (commonly referred to as the Rio Vista Bridge). The area
between the bridge and Main Street has been the focus of numerous efforts to better utilize the
riverfront and integrate it with downtown activity. These efforts remain important goals for the
community.
Rio Vista’s setting encourages outdoor activities. The Sacramento River provides a place for
both active work and recreation. Various river sports, such as water skiing, sailing,
sailboarding, swimming, and fishing, contribute to the economic and overall health of the
community. The historic neighborhoods and downtown present a very walkable environment,
although post-World War II developments are more auto-dominant and less connected to the
downtown core.
EXISTING OPEN SPACE IN THE RIO VISTA VICINITY
Rio Vista’s rich combination of hills, farmland, and river provides the traditional economic base
of the community, as well as spectacular views and open space. Important open spaces lie
within and adjacent to the City, and along the Sacramento River; marshlands mark the eastern
floodplain of the river to the north of town, with the Montezuma Hills to the south. Rio Vista is
surrounded by agriculture, primarily grazing and “dry farm” lands on the north, west, and
south. The following describes key open space components of the Planning Area.
          MONTEZUMA HILLS
The Montezuma Hills lie to the west and south; these landforms create the hilly topography of
the historic neighborhoods and the later neighborhoods that extend from the water tank to State
Route 12 (commonly referred to as Highway 12). The rolling terrain levels out gradually toward
Highway 12 and Church/Amerada Roads. A more abrupt shift in elevation occurs over a 1-mile
stretch north of Highway 12 and east of Church Road but is more pronounced on the south side
of Highway 12. The hilly terrain is very pronounced south of the existing neighborhoods and
the high school (Esperson property).
The Montezuma Hills are the most significant topographic feature of the Planning Area. The
preservation of landform can create places for long views, natural drainage flows, public open
space, and protected habitat. These hilltops also create opportunities for visual connections to
the existing neighborhoods south of Highway 12.

July 18, 2002

          SACRAMENTO RIVER AND THE DELTA
To the east of Rio Vista is the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River is a major presence in the
City from the former Army Reserve Base north to the Rio Vista Bridge at Highway 12. The City
boat launch is located adjacent to City Hall at Main Street; the fishing access park and pier are
located adjacent to the bridge. Great potential exists for public access and enjoyment of the
riverfront at the former Army Reserve Base site and in the area between Main Street and the
bridge.
North of Highway 12, the areas immediately adjacent to the Sacramento River are
predominantly industrial and commercial outdoor storage yard uses, with some residential
mixed in. State Highway 84 (River Road) parallels the river, except for several areas where
privately owned parcels have been developed in various uses. Little potential for public open
space or recreational facilities exists here due to the proximity of the roadway and the
developed uses.
          HISTORIC DOWNTOWN CORE AND SOUTH OF HIGHWAY 12
Several small neighborhood and community parks and recreation facilities are located in these
historic neighborhoods, including the City swimming pool at Bruning Park. Rio Vista High
School and Riverview Middle School also are located in the area, providing open space and
recreational opportunities in the form of turf fields. The 500-acre Esperson Ranch, a large
property annexed by the City in 1991 and planned for development, contains numerous hills
and drainageways that have been proposed for trails and/or viewpoints elsewhere in the
General Plan (see the Community Character & Design, Circulation & Mobility, and Resource
Conservation & Management elements).
          NORTH OF HIGHWAY 12
The area from Highway 12 to Airport Road and farther north contains a wide range of land
uses, including residential neighborhoods constructed in the 1950s and 1960s; recent
subdivisions; the City’s business park (former airport); and other general business,
warehousing, storage, and industrial uses. The City’s major active recreational center, Egbert
Field, is located on St. Francis Way—in the industrial-zoned district and near most of the
residential neighborhoods. Two small neighborhood parks, a future park site owned by the
City, and D. H. White Elementary School also are located in this area. A large drainageway and
floodplain lies between the north edge of the older residential neighborhoods and the industrial
districts. This riparian area lies within the Los Ulpinos property, proposed for future
development. (Parts of the property’s overall plan for development also are discussed in the Circulation
& Mobility and Resource Conservation & Management elements—potential trail routing, open space for
habitat protection, and drainage.)
          NORTH OF AIRPORT ROAD
A large expanse of open land and some developed urban uses lie north of Airport Road within
the city limits. All of this area (about 800 acres) is within the boundaries of the Delta Protection
Commission (DPC), a state agency that governs the Sacramento River Delta watershed (see the
Planning Constraints & Boundaries element). Rio Vista’s General Plan must conform with this
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       9-7                              Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002

agency’s policies, which require that uses in the area be restricted to agriculture and open
space—except for areas within the city limits that were zoned for development prior to the
creation of the DPC in 1993. This exception includes (1) an area of about 120 acres located east of
Church Road, including the former City dumpsite that is designated for manufacturing uses;
(2) the existing site for the proposed Northwest Wastewater Treatment Plant (NWWTP); and
(3) the developed industrial/storage uses along River Road. A relatively large area of City
ownership will remain open even after the construction of the NWWTP, which may provide
further opportunities for public access and/or recreational use—particularly for passive
activities such as nature or hiking trails.
          SUMMERSET/TRILOGY, GIBBS AND BRANN RANCHES
Over 1,400 acres lie within three properties north of Highway 12 and west of Church Road: the
Summerset/Trilogy senior housing development (800+ acres); and the Gibbs and Brann
Ranches, proposed for conventional housing (320 acres each). Summerset/Trilogy is currently
under development and includes a commercial golf course and private recreational facilities for
over 3,500 homes, with about 500 houses constructed to date. The golf course and some of the
private recreation facilities are already in operation. These private facilities fulfill the immediate
recreational needs of the residents but do not provide community recreational facilities, such as
sports fields, trail systems, or larger community/regional open space opportunities. As outlined
in previous development agreements, the Gibbs and Brann Ranches are expected to include
both community and neighborhood recreational facilities and one elementary school site.
          OUTLYING AREA—NORTH, SOUTH, AND EAST
Areas surrounding Rio Vista will remain in a mix of open space uses, including agriculture,
drainageways, habitat areas, and floodplain. All of these areas are presently zoned Agriculture
with large parcel sizes. The Sacramento County General Plan precludes urban services or
private utility systems that would allow development directly across the river from Rio Vista.
In Solano County, an election must be held on any parcel proposed for conversion from open
space to a more intensive use.
The Trail and Open Space Corridor Opportunities Map shown in Figure 9-1 indicates open
space opportunities created by topography, drainage, and biological habitat present in the
Planning Area. The Community Character & Design and the Resource Conservation &
Management elements also discuss opportunities and constraints posed by environmental
characteristics (Note: Figure 9-1 serves also as the Sensitive Local Resource Areas Map shown in
Figure 10-2).
OPEN SPACE OPPORTUNITIES
The Rio Vista General Plan considers two broad types of parkland: active and open space or
passive. Within these broad categories, the Plan provides for specific types of park
development and uses. Table 9-1 describes the types of open space parklands within the City of
Rio Vista.

                                      TYPES OF OPEN SPACE PARKLANDS
  “Active” Parklands
  Traditional parklands refer to open space that provides a variety of active facilities for City residents.
  These sites are generally the type of facilities most people envision when describing a park. Traditional
  parklands typically include facilities such as ball fields, multi-use turf areas, hard court areas, and picnic
  tables. The City has classified its active park sites into a hierarchy of three categories: neighborhood,
  community, and city-wide (regional) parks. The hierarchy is based on a number of factors, including the size
  of the site, facilities provided, location, and area served. Definitions for each type of active park are shown
  in Table 9-2. Park standards are provided in Table 9-5, and siting criteria in Table 9-6.
  “Open Space or Passive” Parklands
  Non-traditional parklands refer to open space areas such as vernal pool preserves, riparian areas, and
  marshlands. Passive parklands may also include areas with unique topographical features or portions of gas
  well site. These lands may be used as passive recreational areas for visual and aesthetic enjoyment. In
  addition, such areas may accommodate bikeway or other trail connections. Recognizing that non-traditional
  parklands provide some recreational opportunities, the City has identified the potential recreational value of
  these lands in meeting the park acreage requirement. Recreational value is primarily defined here as a
  measure of public accessibility to passive recreational opportunities. This value may be increased through
  improvements such as bike trails, signage, and pedestrian pathways to increase accessibility by recreation
  users.

          EXISTING CITY PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES IN RIO VISTA
Rio Vista currently has a variety of parks and recreational facilities. Table 9-2 provides the
definitions of different park types, as generally recognized by the National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA). Figure 9-2 shows the location of existing park and recreation facilities, and
potential future sites for community park facilities.
                                                         Table 9-2
                                                 PARK DEFINITIONS
  Neighborhood Park
  A neighborhood park can generally be defined as a landscaped park of limited size for passive recreation of
  all ages, but with designated active areas. Neighborhood parks provide scenic and aesthetic value. Typical
  improvements found at neighborhood parks include athletic fields, multi-use turf areas, hard courts and
  playground equipment. Neighborhood parks fall into two categories: those located adjacent to school sites
  and those that are not. In general, facilities located adjacent to school sites are larger (typically 6-8 acres)
  and provide more active facilities; while those located away from school sites are smaller (generally
  1-5 acres) and provide more passive facilities, such as picnicking, turf areas, and some natural areas.
  Neighborhood parks serve the recreational needs of people living within a one-quarter-mile radius (5 minutes
  walking distance). This park type includes small “neighborhood squares” or “mini-parks” of 2 acres or less.
  Community Park
  A community park provides recreational opportunities beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks and is
  usually larger than a neighborhood park (typically 10-20 acres or more but can be smaller if community
  facilities are located there). Most regulation fields and active facilities are located in community parks. Such
  facilities as youth baseball, soccer, and softball fields are sited in “complexes” of four or more to allow for
  the most efficient use and support facilities such as rest rooms and concession stands. Community buildings,
  indoor recreation facilities, tennis courts, and swimming pools are also typically located in community parks.
  Such parks may contain picnic grounds and pathways, natural areas, passive landscaped areas, or resource
  protection areas and require ample car and bicycle parking facilities. Community parks are expected to draw
  from outside the immediate neighborhood but may function as a neighborhood park for the area in which it is
  located.
  Regional Park
  Regional parks are identified as unique recreational centers that serve the entire urban population. These
  extensive park areas provide service and facilities that are specialized or of regional interest. Typical
  facilities may include large open space areas; large group picnic facilities; restrooms; nature centers; trail
  systems; scenic drives; campgrounds; community centers; libraries; swimming pools; water-oriented facilities
  for boating, swimming, and fishing; competitive sports fields; outdoor arenas; play equipment for varied age
  groups; tennis courts; and concessions.
  Note: The shared use of school and park facilities is addressed in the Schools component of the Public Facilities &
         Services element.

          NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS
The City of Rio Vista has five neighborhood parks, as described below.
          •   Buena Park (2.0 acres) has a large turf area and pedestrian paths. The historic
              Chinese and Japanese cemetery, located in the eastern section of the park grounds, is
              not designated as such, nor is it presently separated from the remainder of the park
              facility. The remainder of the park is mostly passive open space. Although its small
              size and lack of active facilities classify the site as a neighborhood park, it has
              community-wide appeal because of its historic and cultural importance.
          •   Crescent Park (0.2 acre), located on North Crescent Drive near downtown, is a
              neighborhood tot lot and playground. The site contains a turf area with play
              equipment. Most of the equipment is in need of replacement to meet Americans with
              Disabitlities Act and state safety standards.
          •   Drouin Park (1.1 acres) is located on Drouin Drive and serves a neighborhood
              developed in the 1970s. The park has a turf field and playground equipment. Like
              Crescent Park, much of the equipment needs to be replaced.
          •   Homecoming Park (1.0 acre) is located in the Homecoming Subdivision, off Airport
              Road. The park has a grassy area, a neighborhood tot lot, picnic tables, and a
              barbecue area.
          •   Sierra Park (0.1 acre) is located at the intersection of Main Street and Sierra Drive.
              This park is a passive, landscaped area with no active play equipment. The park is
              primarily a visual resource that lends character to the neighborhood.
          •   D. H. White School Park (0.7 acre) is adjacent to D. H. White Elementary School, on
              Elm Way. The park is primarily a playground and is used by both the neighborhood
              and school children. The grounds are owned by the River Delta Unified School
              District; the equipment is owned by the City. This equipment also needs to be
              replaced.
          •   Trigueiro Park (3.2 acres) is an undeveloped park site located behind the D. H. White
              Elementary School.
          COMMUNITY PARKS
The City of Rio Vista has two community parks, as described below.
          •   Bruning Park (1.4 acres) is located on Montezuma and Third Streets, adjacent to the
              downtown area. This park contains the City’s public swimming pool and rest rooms.
              It is well-used by Rio Vista residents, including the high school swim team and local
              swim clubs. Picnic tables are also on the grounds. The park is a well-known
              community gathering place for various events.

              baseball/softball fields are also used for youth soccer.
          REGIONAL PARKS
One regional park, described below, is located adjacent to the city limits.
          •   Sandy Beach Regional Park (10± acres) is located immediately south of the City’s
              wastewater treatment plant. It is operated and managed by Solano County under
              contract to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The facility contains a two-lane boat
              launch ramp, parking area, picnic tables, campsites, and a swimming beach. The
              park is available to the entire City.
          WATER-RELATED RECREATION FACILITIES
Due to the City’s proximity to the Sacramento River, water-related recreation facilities are also
located within the City, as described below.
          •   Fishing Access and Pier (0.4 acre) includes a lighted fishing pier and fish-cleaning
              facilities.   Plans to update these facilities are included in the Waterfront
              Redevelopment Plan.

July 18, 2002

          •   Bicycle and pedestrian paths are included in this element to the extent that they can
              be considered recreation oriented and may meet the parkland dedication
              requirement. (The primary discussion of bicycle and pedestrian paths is found in the
              Circulation & Mobility element of this General Plan.)
          NATURAL GAS WELL RESERVE SITES
Natural Gas well reserve sites are found throughout the City of Rio Vista and represent
potential passive open space lands available within the City’s urban development fabric.
However, as the State’s energy needs increase, natural gas exploration, drilling, and production
activities will expand to more areas within the city limits. Each gas well site uses an area
approximately 300 feet in diameter for the duration of the production. While initial drilling
usually lasts a few weeks, gas well site production can occur over a period of up to 50 years.
Consequently, environmental issues, such as nuisance potential, noise, public health and safety,
resource conservation, and water quality, must be addressed during the planning process for
open space and recreational use of these sites.
The City’s Hydrocarbons (Natural Gas) Ordinance regulates the drilling and production
operation through the Conditional Use Permit process, in order “to promote the economic
recovery of natural gas in a manner compatible with surrounding land uses and protection of
public health and safety.” This ordinance, along with park standards for gas well sites, are tools
that can be used by the City, developers, and natural gas companies to guide safe and
appropriate use of these sites. (Discussions related to gas well reserve sites are also found in other
elements of this General Plan, including Community Character & Design and Safety & Noise.)

July 18, 2002

E.        Outlook
OPEN SPACE/TRAILS
The open space needs of a community can generally be categorized as (1) lands necessary for
preservation of biological and natural resources, (2) lands for the production of managed
resources (such as agricultural preserves), and (3) open space used for outdoor recreation. This
element addresses the first and third of these types of open space or passive parklands. (The
Resource Conservation & Management element addresses the conservation and management of the City’s
open space resources.)
          OPEN SPACE
A substantial area surrounding Rio Vista that functions as open space is not necessarily
managed to serve that purpose—the Sacramento River Delta and surrounding agricultural land
are examples. The City’s natural open spaces and features, such as drainageways, riparian
vegetation, and topography, provide Rio Vista with a unique identity. Along with these swales
and riparian corridors, the natural landform of the Montezuma Hills is a key feature that
contributes to the community’s character. Figure 9-1 illustrates potential open space
opportunities that the City will consider when reviewing all development projects.
The Open Space & Recreation element provides policies for preservation of these natural open
space areas to ensure that these areas are considered in the future planning and design of
development areas. Lands adjacent to existing and future parks, residential developments, the
waterfront, and school sites are potential contributors of passive open space. In addition, the
many natural gas reserve sites in the City provide excellent opportunities for passive recreation.
(Policies related to conservation and integration of these natural features also are found in the Resource
Conservation & Management and Community Character & Design elements.)
          TRAILS
In evaluating the City’s parks needs through this General Plan update, an open space network
was recognized as being necessary to provide linkages throughout the City. Park sites and
other public spaces are vital components of this network. As the City grows, preservation of an
open space network becomes key to maintaining these linkages. (Trail connections are identified
on the Trails and Pathways Map in the Circulation & Mobility element to provide a means of unifying
recreational opportunities between the waterfront, parks, and other inland recreation areas.)
          TRAILS DEDICATION
To ensure the establishment of trails connections and development of the network, the General
Plan contains policies that will require the dedication of land and/or constructed improvements
to accomplish this objective. The City has established a dedication requirement policy of 1 mile
of developed trail or 3 acres of trail corridor space per 1,000 residents, whichever is greater. The
trail standard is based on a needs analysis conducted as part of this General Plan update and
was considered in preparing the Trails and Pathways Map.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        9-16                                Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002

In calculating the trail required corridor acreage for trails, corridor width was presumed to
average 25 feet, but can be much wider (an entire swale or hillside, for example) or narrower.
Credit toward the corridor space standard of 3.0 acres/1,000 residents can be given for any
corridor or passive space that includes a corridor, so long as both the linear and acreage
standards are met. The area standard is calculated as follows:
          •   1 mile (5,280 linear feet) X 25 linear feet (average width) = 132,000 square feet.
          •   132,000 square feet/43,560 square feet= 3.03 acres.
This figure has been rounded to establish a 3-acre per 1,000 residents development standard.
This standard may include trails on public and redevelopment lands (e.g., the former Army
Reserve base and downtown/waterfront), as well as those required within private development
projects.
If trails are included in the street rights-of-way, they are credited toward the City’s roadway
impact fee for the particular development project. Any development fee for trails will be based
only on the mileage of trails not included in street rights-of-way, as those are already included
in the roadway impact fees.
          TRAILS STANDARDS
Trails may include separated pathways alongside collector and arterial streets that are located
within or adjacent to private development sites. Illustrations of typical trail standards are
shown in Figure 9-3, Figure 9-4, Figure 9-5, and Figure 9-6 on the following pages.
PARKLANDS
          PARKLAND NEEDS
The potential buildout of the Plan area, as described in Chapters 3 and 4, is 24,000 persons.
Approximately 18,000 persons will reside in unrestricted housing units; 6,000 senior residents
will live in the Trilogy subdivision. Since Trilogy provides neighborhood parks and active
recreational facilities for its residents, the City’s active parkland needs at General Plan buildout
are based on the unrestricted housing population. It is estimated that, upon buildout of the
General Plan, approximately 68.4 acres of active parkland will be needed. Table 9-3 provides a
breakdown of the existing and future parkland needs, and Figure 9-7 identifies the general
target areas for future community parks.
As the population increases and demographics shift, continual assessment will be required to
determine whether the quantity and type of parkland are meeting the changing needs of City
residents. The City’s Parks and Recreation Commission is a nine-member body responsible for
reviewing parks and recreational facilities/programs, and for making recommendations to the
City Council. The Commission and the Council will plan and evaluate the City’s parks and
recreational facilities by applying the parks definitions, standards, siting criteria, and guiding
policies of this General Plan. Since this General Plan does not anticipate the City expanding
beyond its current boundaries, the City has considered all potential recreation areas extending
into the urban reserve.

    a Specific inventory unavailable.
    b Based  on General Plan buildout population of 18,000 persons.
During 1999-2000, the City evaluated Rio Vista’s existing parks inventory and then analyzed
acreage needs for the provision of future recreation facilities. The inventory showed that, by
2000, the ratio of existing, active parkland to population was 1.5 acres per 1,000 residents.
            COMMUNITY COMPARISON OF PARKLAND STANDARDS
Prior to this General Plan update, no park standard had been established on which to base the
deficit of parkland. Therefore, the City completed a needs analysis to establish a park standard
for incorporation into the General Plan. The study compared park standards of other
jurisdictions, as illustrated in Table 9-4.
            ACTIVE PARKLAND DEDICATION
The City will require dedication of parkland by new development in accordance with state and
local requirements. An active parkland standard was developed by the City based on its needs
analysis and will be instituted with this General Plan as described in the next section.
            ACTIVE PARKLAND STANDARD
A 5-acre per 1,000 residents active parkland standard was established after completion of the
needs study. Using this standard, the City determined that, in 2000, the citywide need was
83.7 acres, with an existing deficit of 15.3 acres. To remove this deficit, the City determined that
new development’s responsibility would be 68.4 acres (of active parkland), while existing
residents would be responsible for 15.3 acres.
The 5-acre parkland standard includes 2 acres of community parkland and 3 acres of
neighborhood parkland, as shown in Table 9-5. As shown in Figure 9-7, three general areas have
been designated as target areas for future community parks: two areas north of Highway 12
(River Walk property and Gibbs and Brann Ranches) and south of Highway 12 (Esperson
property).

July 18, 2002

Neighborhood parks should be a focal point for the local community. They provide space for
residents to relax, play, and engage in informal recreational activities. The park improvements
should be oriented toward the recreational needs of the neighborhood in which it is located. A
neighborhood square is one version of a neighborhood park. These smaller activity areas are
usually located in high-density residential areas where the “square” is the central focus of the
neighborhood. Figure 9-8 and Figure 9-9 illustrate prototype drawings of a 3-acre neighborhood
square and a large, 5±-acre neighborhood park. Suggested criteria for the siting of active
parkland are outlined in Table 9-6.
NATURAL GAS WELL RESERVE SITES
Presently, the majority of natural gas well sites in the City are located on undeveloped or
agricultural lands. With the development of Summerset/Trilogy and Homecoming in recent
years, gas well sites have become an important consideration in subdivision site design. Due to
the importance of ongoing natural gas operations, gas well site usage needs to be integrated
carefully into future residential developments. Future residents in the vicinity of these sites
must be informed of the operations relative to safety, noise, traffic, and duration of these
facilities (see the Safety & Noise element).
Along with the constraints to land use associated with the gas well sites, their even distribution
throughout the Plan area affords an opportunity to create parklands and open space. The linear
character of the transmission line easements offers a valuable addition to the trail system. Prior
to their operation, gas well reserve sites are to be considered as a neighborhood amenity and
treated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the developer and the gas company to consider
future potential neighborhood concerns in locating well sites. Accordingly, the City will review
proposed locations during the development review process of the sites for mitigation and their
compliance with appropriate ordinances (see the Safety & Noise element).
A gas well site’s approximate 300-foot-diameter is largely a no-build zone, with a relatively
small interior portion used for natural gas production. The unused portion of the well site
provides additional land that may be dedicated to passive parkland. Figure 9-10 illustrates the
concept of contiguous, usable area adjacent to a gas well site with the potential for parkland
dedication.
          NATURAL GAS WELL SITE DEDICATION
The rectangular-shaped operations area in the middle of the “clear zone” shown in Figure 9-10
will not eligible for credit toward the City’s park space dedication/improvement requirement
or toward park fees. However, the remaining portions of the sites (the “clear zone”) will be
eligible if part of a contiguous, undivided site no less than 2 acres. This area would be
configured as a neighborhood square, as shown earlier in Figure 9-6, or larger facility—at a
minimum, the site should be usable as an informal play lawn, sitting area, or tot lot.
          NATURAL GAS WELL SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
To integrate natural gas well reserve sites into development areas, the following standards were
developed as part of the General Plan update process. Table 9-7 contains the Gas Well Site
Development Standards that will be used throughout the City.

                              GAS WELL SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
  •    Gas well sites shall be included in passive areas on the perimeter of proposed development projects rather
       than the interior, whenever feasible.
  •    Gas well sites shall be located so that roads front on them and the number of lots backing on to them is
       minimized.
  •    The working area of the sites shall be clearly delineated both by signage and on-the-ground markers.
       Specific design approvals for these sites shall be made part of the development review process.
  •    Gas well sites shall be landscaped. Upon establishment or drilling of the gas well, the site shall be restored
       with landscaping, by the gas company, in compliance with the policies of this element and the Hydrocarbon
       (Natural Gas) Ordinance.
  •    Remaining portions inside the work area and the “clear zone” shall be maintained in landscaping, with any
       landscaping disturbed during drilling operations replaced after the drilling is complete.
  •    Access drives shall be paved with all-weather surface and shall be positioned on the site to create the
       least disturbance possible to the adjacent residences.
  •    If a gas well is established and remains in place, two levels of fencing and screening are required by the
       gas company:
       1.   A decorative, solid wall or similar structure shall be established around the immediate perimeter of
            the well/equipment area.
       2.   A decorative, transparent fencing, such as wrought iron or similar material, shall be placed around the
            portions of the work area used for access and maneuvering of trucks and equipment.
WATERFRONT
More than commercial services are required for a downtown to prosper recreational and
cultural activities also are needed. The waterfront area, extending from Main Street to the Rio
Vista Bridge, is a valuable land resource that can complement activity in the historic downtown
core. This 8-acre area—bounded by Highway 12 on the north, Front Street on the west, Main
Street on the south, and the Sacramento River on the east—provides myriad opportunities for
public and private land uses to effectively link the river and downtown.
Opportunities for increased access and enjoyment of the City’s riverfront are a high priority for
Rio Vista residents, since present access to the river within the City is limited and
discontinuous. This priority is evidenced by the City’s current plans to reconstruct the public
pier at the foot of Main Street. In addition, the waterfront is an area where water-oriented
recreation can be encouraged, while a “working” waterfront remains for businesses that
support the marine- and agriculture-related industries.
Site layout and design play a critical role in the enhancement of, and access to, the waterfront.
Proper development of the parcels can provide sweeping vistas of the river, as the City’s name
“Rio Vista” depicts. Decks and balconies of buildings can face east toward the river. “Stepping
down” or tiering building heights from east of Front Street toward the river can maximize river
views and the aesthetic enjoyment of the waterfront.

These visions for the waterfront are design concepts contained in the 2001 Waterfront Conceptual
Plan (David Evans & Associates, 2001), which has recently been completed. This plan will assist
the City and developers in implementing General Plan policies pertaining to the Sacramento
River waterfront. Public use elements of the Conceptual Plan include a pedestrian boardwalk
connecting Main Street and the Rio Vista Bridge, an upgrade of the fishing pier adjacent to the
bridge, bank stabilization, and landscaping. The enhanced setting and additional foot traffic are
expected to increase the recreational value of the waterfront. New construction, private
restoration, and reorientation of existing buildings along the river frontage also will
significantly improve this important area of the City. (Development of the waterfront is discussed in
detail in the Community Character & Design element.)
FORMER ARMY RESERVE BASE
The former U.S. Army Reserve Base, located along the Sacramento River just southwest of the
downtown, is presently in the process of being conveyed from the U.S. Army to the City of Rio
Vista. The conveyance is subject to the condition that the City use the property for recreational
purposes.
In 1998, the Rio Vista Army Base Reuse Plan (Economic & Planning Systems, 1998) was prepared
to develop a series of goals and objectives for the 23-acre parcel that will guide the
redevelopment and reuse of the former Army Reserve Base site. Various options are presented
in the plan to provide the City with a range of development scenarios. A few of the potential
uses include marine research center, conference center/retreat, and other water-related
private/public recreational uses.
Prior to any decisions concerning the site’s use, the City will continue to work with the U.S.
Army in an environmental assessment of the site. Once the site assessment has been completed,
the City will take additional steps toward planning for site development.

G.        Implementing Actions for Open Space & Recreation (OSR)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Open Space & Recreation element.
OSR-1              DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City will continue with its development review process in accordance with the
requirements and policies contained in such documents as the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
Hydrocarbon (Natural Gas) Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance and Subdivision Map Act,
California Environmental Quality Act, and other relevant statutes. The Parks and Recreation
Commission and other interested agencies will be consulted about development proposals that
may affect parks and recreational facilities. Any comments and recommended mitigation will
be considered during the review process. Development review will address the need for park
facilities; the timing and provision of such facilities; the design relationship between the parks
and adjacent development; gas well site planning, locations, landscaping and improvements;
trail locations, improvements, and construction; and preservation of open space areas.
Locations and design of all open space facilities must be approved by the City prior to issuance
of any entitlements or permits.
OSR-2              DEDICATIONS, FEES, AND EXACTIONS
                   (Existing)
The City will require new residential development to dedicate land or pay in-lieu fees (up to
3 acres) and pay park fees for land purchase and development costs at the standard of 5 acres
and 1 mile of trail per 1,000 residents. Dedications of trail and path rights-of-way will be
required on properties where trails are indicated on the Trails and Pathways Map. All trails
will be designated for pedestrians and cyclists unless otherwise indicated. The City will use its
legal authority to ensure compliance with the General Plan standards for park dedication.
OSR-3              RIO VISTA WATERFRONT PLAN
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to prepare and subsequently implement the Waterfront Conceptual Plan.
The plan is intended to provide the design for public access along the riverfront. The design is
to incorporate and complement future commercial development, in addition to providing a
physical and visual linkage between Highway 12 businesses, the waterfront, and downtown.
OSR-4              ARMY BASE REUSE MASTER PLAN
                   (Adopted January 1999)
The Rio Vista Army Base Reuse Master Plan (Economic & Planning Systems, Inc., 1998) describes
the potential opportunities and constraints associated with reuse of the former Army Reserve
Base. Site development will take advantage of the waterfront location and emphasize the
water-oriented nature of Rio Vista. Public recreation will be a key component of the plan. The
City envisions a tiered planning process, in which the individual elements of the plan and
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    9-38                             Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002
funding sources will be identified as part of a cooperative effort with interested and responsible
agencies.
OSR-5              LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL FUNDS
                   (Existing and Proposed)
The City will continue to pursue existing and alternative sources of funding in order to provide
parklands and facilities that will adequately meet community needs. The City will identify and
evaluate financial mechanisms that can be used to maintain and operate recreational facilities
and protect the City’s investment in them. The City will identify funding to obtain easements in
order to accommodate the facilities and construct trails and paths through floodway and
floodplain areas as needed along the length of all waterways, as shown on the adopted Trails
and Pathways Map. Other sources may include State bond acts, federal and state grants,
assessment districts, and public/private partnerships. Neighborhood groups may be an
additional source of finance and voluntary labor to meet recreational needs.
OSR-6              DESIGN GUIDELINES
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop and adopt design guidelines for parks, open space, trails, and pathways
that are consistent with the environmental design criteria contained in the Community
Character & Design and the Circulation & Mobility elements. These guidelines will provide
specific development criteria for bridges and other public improvements, including
specifications for grade separation between roadways and trails (where feasible). The design
guidelines will identify needed improvements to Highway 12 adjacent to the Esperson and
River Walk properties, including an overpass to accommodate a trail crossing, as shown on the
Trails and Pathways Map.
OSR-7              PARK DEFINITIONS, STANDARDS, AND SITING CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
The City will use the parks definitions, standards, and siting criteria as defined in the Open
Space & Recreation element to plan for future parks and recreation facilities. These guidelines
will be used to allow the City flexibility for varying circumstances—in terms of size, facilities,
and service areas—in order to ensure that existing and future needs are met. The Parks and
Recreation Commission will establish the performance standards that include objectives and
criteria for identifying park sites, trails, paths, and all publicly maintained land used for
recreational purposes. These standards will differentiate between active and passive recreation,
and will address the parklands deficit in terms of the number and kinds of facilities,
appropriate levels of improvements and maintenance, and distribution of such facilities
throughout the City.
OSR-8              TRAILS AND PATHWAYS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
A comprehensive trails system will be instituted for the entire Planning Area as part of the
Circulation & Mobility element of this General Plan (see Figure 8-7 in Chapter 8). This map will
serve as the basis for any future trails masters plan that could establish priorities and identify
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           9-39                      Open Space & Recreation
July 18, 2002

funding for trail development. The City and private developers will construct trails and paths
in accordance with the adopted Trails and Pathways Map. All proposed trails will undergo
design review to ensure proper implementation of the Trails and Pathways Map.
OSR-9              DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
                   (Proposed)
The City will use the development agreement process to facilitate the design and development
of project areas that are consistent with the goals and policies of this element. Development
agreements should specify the timing and construction of project improvements, including gas
reserve sites, parklands, trails, and open space areas. Requirement for improvements and/or
dedications and any credit to apply to park and open space standards will be determined
through this process.
OSR-10             SENSITIVE LOCAL RESOURCE AREAS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The General Plan identifies several significant areas in the Rio Vista Planning Area where one or
more sensitive natural resources may be concentrated or that may feature several of these
resources. Throughout the General Plan, these significant areas are referred to as “sensitive local
resource areas” (SLRA). SLRA can be defined as “areas possessing one or more natural
resources that, when taken together, create a feature that is uniquely representative of Rio
Vista’s character.” The SLRAs are mapped in Figure 10-2 in the Resource Management &
Conservation element, as areas that are to be preserved to the extent feasible during the course
of development. The SLRAs boundaries map is not intended to be exact but is drawn in general
form to serve as an overlay that will guide the project design and development phases in
affected areas.
OSR-11             INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
The City staff and Parks and Recreation Commission will confer with other jurisdictions, in an
effort to identify new programs and approaches to parks, trails, and open space development
that have proven successful in other communities.
The City should develop joint powers agreements with the school districts, public utilities, the
County, and other agencies to develop, administer, and use parks, open space, and recreation
facilities and programs. These agreements could facilitate use of non-City owned properties
including, but not limited to, undeveloped well sites and schools.
OSR-12             PARKS MASTER PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare a Parks Master Plan prior to or concurrent with project approvals
associated with the Esperson, Brann Ranch, or River Walk properties. With this plan,
community park sites will be identified, and the City can work with developers to identify
desired neighborhood park sites well in advance of subdivision development. The Parks Master
Plan may include one or more of the following components:

                   the City-owned site adjacent to D. H. White School, or some combination of
                   these.
                   Gibbs/Brann Ranch, if Gibbs becomes family housing, or a smaller facility if
                   developed as senior housing.
                   South of Highway 12 – former Army Reserve Base, high school, Riverview
                   School, and Esperson property (future development).
          •   A prioritized list of properties to be leased or acquired when funding becomes
              available or opportunities arise.
          •   Assessment of City-wide recreation needs, demographics, and recreation trends.
          •   Identification of any parks and recreation deficiencies in the City and identification
              of programs to bring them up to City standards.
          •   Identification of potential sites for specialized activities, such as skateboarding.
          •   Establishment of a unified theme for parks by creating a park logo and a consistent
              design for park signs.
          •   Determination of the active needs of the population and establishment of facility
              standards that can be used for planning future park and recreation facilities.
          •   Conceptual plans for a community center, in either new or existing buildings, to
              include space for a museum, performing arts, arts and crafts studios, kitchen, day
              care, and after-school facilities.
          •   Conceptual landscaping plans for the triangular parcel between Main Street and
              Highway 12 and the area within the westbound Highway 12 off-ramp at the Rio
              Vista Bridge as beautification areas and entrances to the City.
          •   Development of a catalogue of gifts and donations to the City, suitable for park and
              recreation purposes.
          •   Identification of general design and siting standards to ensure efficient and safe park
              facilities.

The City will re-assess its parks and recreation needs every 5 years as part of the General Plan
update.
OSR-14             ENVIRONMENTAL/VISUAL CONSTRAINTS MAP
                   (Proposed)
The City will require with each development proposal an environmental/visual constraints
map, based on the findings of a project-specific biological assessment and consistent with
General Plan goals and policies. These maps will consider the potential open space
opportunities illustrated in Figure 9-1 and in Figure 10-2, the Sensitive Local Resource Areas
Map.
OSR-15             PARK MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
                   (Existing)
Rio Vista’s Public Works Department will continue to maintain the City’s parks and recreation
lands, including open space areas with recreation value. New development areas will be
required to identify resources for the maintenance of future parks and recreation lands.
Ongoing maintenance mechanisms may include a homeowner’s association; dedication to the
City with the formation of a maintenance assessment district, capital facilities, and maintenance
district; or other mechanism. Conveyance to other private entities, either profit or non-profit,
may be an option if sufficient assurances are in place for the continued maintenance of the area.
OSR-16             PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
                   (Existing)
The City will actively solicit Public Involvement in the planning and development of parks and
recreational programs to more effectively meet the needs of City residents. The City will
involve teens, seniors, and other interest groups in the development of recreational and cultural
programs to meet the needs of specific user groups. A primary means of public input will be
through the Parks and Recreation Commission and the City Council, the bodies that review and
act on proposed recreation improvements and programs. Standards for parks, recreation
facilities, and trails—as well as financial mechanisms for their operation and maintenance—are
reviewed by these bodies.
OSR-17             PUBLIC FACILITIES UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will annually review and update the list of public facilities, including requirements for
the use of these facilities, needed at various park sites. This list will be distributed throughout
the community for review and comment.

OSR-18             WATER AND ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City will develop and design parks, golf courses, and other recreation lands consistent with
the Resource Conservation & Management element of the General Plan. The City will
incorporate water and energy conservation measures into the design of recreation facilities. The
City will adopt landscaping and maintenance practices that conform to the conservation
standards set forth in the Resource Conservation & Management element.
OSR-19             LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will adopt and implement a landscape ordinance, establishing standards that will
enhance the character of neighborhood parks by adding landscaping, sculpture, and seating.
The standards will include varying the landscaping, improvements, and construction materials
from park to park. In addition, the ordinance will provide standards for water-conserving
landscaping that will reduce water use in developments. Requirements will specify use of trees
and other vegetation in new development in order to provide shade and reduce energy
demands for cooling. This ordinance will be applied in the design and development of City
parks and recreation facilities, and will be developed consistent with the provisions of the
Resource Conservation & Management element.
OSR-20             SIGN ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City’s Sign Ordinance Review and Update will be revised to include specific requirements
relating to informational signage at gas well reserve sites. Signage will be required at all well
sites in prominent locations to inform future residents of the potential for gas well drilling and
production. The signage will provide location of detailed information on the operation and
responsible parties. (Also see informational requirements for natural gas well sites in the Safety &
Noise element.)

Chapter 10 Resource Conservation & Management
A.        Introduction
The most significant determinants of a community’s identity and quality of life are its
relationship to the surrounding natural environment, the quality and preservation of its
biological and cultural resources, and the safety and well-being of its citizens. The City of Rio
Vista recognizes that natural resources are limited and must be conserved wherever possible.
These resources provide both tangible and intangible benefits. For example, the Sacramento
River environs provide benefits to the City, not only in the diversity of species they support but
also in their aesthetic appeal to residents and visitors to the community. The challenge for Rio
Vista is balancing the preservation of its natural resources with continued urban growth and
development. In addition, natural resources will need to be managed in a manner that allows
resident use and benefit, while ensuring their long-term viability and availability.
These issues are addressed in this Resource Conservation & Management element, in
accordance with the state-mandated conservation element. (Issues associated with natural hazards,
including seismic safety, subsurface hazards, and flooding, are included in the Safety & Noise element.)
Policy and discussion areas are divided into two general components. The Natural and Cultural
Resources component ensures (1) the conservation, development, and use of natural
resources—including land, air, water, soils, natural gas, rivers, fish and wildlife, minerals, and
other natural resources; and (2) the preservation of archaeological, historic, and visual
resources.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                         10-1                   Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

The Resource Conservation & Management element directs the use of open space as a means of
ensuring the continued availability of land for:
          •   Managed production for agriculture and mineral extraction.
          •   Seasonal drainage corridors and floodwater conveyance.
          •   Preservation of key hilltops and ridges.
          •   Retention of natural topography in the Montezuma Hills.
          •   Wildlife habitat.
          •   Enjoyment as a visual resource and aesthetic amenity.
Open space also is considered in this element as a means to preserve land that, if converted to
urban uses, could compromise public health and safety. (The economic benefits of production [e.g.,
agricultural and natural gas] on open space lands are discussed in the Economic Development element;
open space for outdoor recreational use is discussed in the Open Space & Recreation element; and issues
of public health and safety related to natural hazards are addressed in the Safety & Noise element.)

July 18, 2002

B.        Purpose and Authority
State law requires a General Plan to address open space and conservation issues, including the
preservation, management, and efficient use of open space and natural resources. The State has
defined open space lands as being essentially unimproved and devoted to the preservation of
natural resources, managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, or public health and
safety. Conservation efforts are intended to focus on the wise management of natural and
manufactured resources in order to ensure their continued availability for use, appreciation,
and enjoyment. The policy direction of this element responds to environmental laws that have
been passed since the 1970s, including the Clean Water Act, state and federal Clean Air Acts,
state and federal Endangered Species Acts, the California Native Plant Protection Act, the
National Historic Preservation Act, the Integrated Solid Waste Management Act and Title 24 of
the Uniform Building Code. In addition, numerous federal, state, and local regulations related
to environmental health and safety will serve to implement the policies and programs that the
City has established to manage and conserve its natural resources.
The broad scope of issues addressed in the Resource Conservation & Management element
overlaps with other elements of the General Plan. This element should be used in combination
with the other elements to ensure full implementation of all General Plan resource-related
policies.

C.        Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
The community vision and planning principles that most directly relate to the Resource
Conservation & Management element are listed below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     Farmland and nature are important elements of the community. A clear edge between urban
     development and agriculture should be maintained.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.
PRESERVE AND STRENGTHEN THE DOWNTOWN, WATERFRONT, AND HISTORIC PLACES
     The Sacramento River should be made an accessible resource for the enjoyment of Rio Vista residents
     and the general public.
PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES THAT DEFINE RIO VISTA
     New development should accommodate and showcase natural features as community amenities. New
     development should respect the contours of hillsides, valleys, and drainageways as important
     recognizable features of Rio Vista. Key hilltops to be preserved for public use and vistas should be
     identified.
     The community should seek to connect the existing town to new developments and the Sacramento
     River waterfront by an extensive and interconnecting trail system. The natural drainageways, hills,
     and sensitive vegetation areas should be the basis for designing such a system.
ENSURE EASE OF MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, AND BUSINESSES
     The development of the connecting trail system suggested by the above principles should be pursued
     as a key circulation facility, as well as a natural resource opportunity.

July 18, 2002

D.        Setting
Natural, cultural, and visual resources contribute to the community’s quality of life and sense of
identity. The key components to be addressed in establishing a policy framework for resource
conservation and management in Rio Vista include:
          •    Open space*
          •    Biological resources
          •    Water resources
          •    Air quality
          •    Soils
          •    Energy
          •    Solid waste reduction
          •    Historical and archaeological resources
          •    Visual resources
*Encompasses agricultural lands, mineral extraction lands, and natural habitats in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River
Delta (Delta).
OPEN SPACE
Open space is discussed in several elements of the Rio Vista General Plan. The Open Space &
Recreation element discusses open space in the context of the recreational opportunities it
provides. The Economic Development element recognizes the importance of open space for the
production of food and energy. The Resource Conservation & Management element discusses
the function of open space in preserving natural and visual resources.
Open space plays an important role in the management of our water resources. By absorbing
rainfall, either by transmitting it to plants or by recharging the groundwater supply, less runoff
is created. As the amount of open space decreases and impervious surface area increases
through development, so does the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff. As a result,
increased flooding problems occur.
The natural vegetation in open space lands plays an important role in the purification of both
air and water. The leaves of plants act as filters—intercepting and trapping some airborne and
water-borne pollutants. Water taken from the ground is transpired through the leaves, and
pollutants are captured in the process. Furthermore, during photosynthesis, plants absorb
carbon dioxide and release oxygen, a vital process in producing fresh air. Natural vegetation is
also important in providing food and habitat for animals, insects, and migratory birds. By
providing these habitats, open space plays a vital role in stabilizing the entire ecosystem.
Open space also serves a valuable role in the protection of aesthetics and visual resources. As
lands are converted to urban uses, the visual amenity that open space provides becomes
increasingly valuable to the community. Whether it be in the form of developed parks,
farmland, or expanses of natural vegetation, open space is a resource that must remain available
for relief from the urban hardscape.

July 18, 2002

          AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Delta agricultural lands were “reclaimed” through construction of levees and drainage of the
marshy islands of the area. In less than 100 years (from 1850 to 1930), hundreds of thousands of
acres of land went into agricultural production. Early crops were grains, fruits, and vegetables
that were marketed in nearby cities. Early specialty crops included wheat, barley, beans, and
potatoes. Later, asparagus, sugar beets, tomatoes, and celery grew in popularity. The Delta
region now produces a variety of crops, including grains, fruits, field crops, nuts, seeds, pasture
and alfalfa, and vegetables.
In the recent past, thousands of acres of agricultural lands in the Delta region were developed
for residential and other urban uses. Presently, Rio Vista’s urbanized core is surrounded by
agriculture, primarily grazing and “dry farm” lands on the north, west, and south. Some of
these large tracts are permanently managed as pasture, and others are planted in annual crops
such as wheat and corn. As with naturally occurring open space, these agricultural lands
provide rich seasonal wildlife habitat. Thousands of acres of agricultural lands in the Delta are
flooded after harvest to provide feeding and resting areas for local and migratory birds and
other wildlife.
Agriculture also remains an important part of the community’s well-being, both in terms of
identity and economics. Most businesses in Rio Vista are supported in some fashion by
agriculture. Many persons employed in agriculture live, purchase goods and services, and send
their children to school, as well as participate in a variety of other community activities, in Rio
Vista. Ranching operations purchase such “big-ticket” items as harvesting and planting
equipment, cars and trucks, and bulk supplies. Rio Vista is now and should remain solidly
linked to its agricultural heritage, natural surroundings, and landscapes.
Many counties, as well as some cities, have adopted codes or ordinances that require some level
of disclosure or notification to property owners in areas near farm operations. These ordinances
are based on the premise that agricultural operations supersede simple nuisance issues that
typically would not be acceptable in urban neighborhoods. Rio Vista’s General Plan does not
propose a Right-to-Farm Ordinance because most undeveloped areas within the city limits have
been removed from agricultural production or are bound by previous development agreements.
Instead, proposed projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine appropriate
disclosures or notification to property owners in areas near farm operations. (Note: The Land Use
and Economic Development elements contain additional discussion of agricultural land use.)
          SACRAMENTO RIVER DELTA
The principal waterway in the Rio Vista area is the Sacramento River, which borders the City to
the east. The river and Delta environs provide a variety of habitat types for wildlife in and
around Rio Vista.
The Delta Protection Commission (DPC) was created in 1992 to protect and enhance the existing
land uses in the Delta: agriculture, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The Commission was
charged with preparation of a regional land use and resource management plan for the Primary
Zone of the legal Delta, a portion of which lies within the City of Rio Vista and its planning area
(also see the Planning Constraints & Boundaries element). The Solano County General Plan
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      10-6                 Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

supports the agricultural land uses in this area—this policy was underscored by the action of
Solano County voters who, in 1984, approved a measure to prohibit land uses other than
agriculture and open space in this region except by a vote of County residents.
One of the most noticeable changes in the Delta Primary Zone in recent years was the planting
of about 4,500 acres of new orchards and vineyards. In addition, significant acreages in the
Primary Zone have been purchased in the last few years by state, federal, and non-profit
agencies for enhancement and management as wildlife habitat.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The Sacramento River Delta in and around Rio Vista is an area rich in biological resources.
From shorebirds and wintering waterfowl to the varied fish and other aquatic species, the Delta
is one of the City’s most valued natural resources. The following sections describe the
vegetation and wildlife resources in the vicinity.
          VEGETATION
Outside the urban core, most of the planning area contains agricultural and vacant lands. Small
amounts of herbaceous upland and some open water habitats may be found, as well as woody
non-native vegetation. Sensitive habitat types found in the nearby Delta lands include marsh,
riparian, and naturally occurring vernal pools. The following text describes the various habitat
types found in the Delta region.
          AGRICULTURE
The planning area contains large tracts of land in active agricultural use. These tracts include
lands that are actively farmed or in a temporarily fallow condition (i.e., fallow for less than 2
years) and other lands that are left vacant for natural gas extraction. Predominant crops in the
region are corn, wheat, milo, sunflower, and potato. A smaller portion of the agricultural land is
in perennial crops, such as asparagus or vineyards. Much of the land around Rio Vista is
permanently managed as pasture and grazed, primarily by beef cattle; however, land
containing field crops is grazed seasonally by sheep for weed control and stubble reduction.
Many low-lying agricultural areas are flooded during the rainy winter.
          RIPARIAN HABITAT
Riparian habitat is associated with areas at the margins of perennial and intermittent streams,
rivers, and other waterbodies with abundant soil moisture. Small areas of riparian habitat exist
in the Delta, primarily in thin strips along waterways and levees. Some larger areas of riparian
vegetation can be found around blowout ponds in the interior of Delta islands. Ecologically,
riparian habitat is biologically very rich, supporting more species than most other habitat types
due to the presence of water and a productive, nutrient-rich environment. However, historical
loss of riparian habitat exceeds 90 percent statewide as a result of agricultural land conversion,
urbanization, and construction of flood control and water conveyance systems. Many species
dependent on riparian communities now are considered rare, and several of these are legally
protected or are being considered for protection under state or federal endangered species laws.
Because of the rarity of this habitat type and its importance biologically, riparian habitat is
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     10-7                 Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

considered sensitive. Common species in riparian habitat include willow, cattail, tule, blue
elderberry, white alder, buttonbush, blackberry, and California rose.
Because weeds become established readily on Delta islands, farm management emphasizes
“clean farming” practices that include annual disking of fallow fields and periodic clearing of
riparian trees and shrubs from the interior of ditch systems. Thus, overhanging riparian
vegetation is rare along ditches or canals on the interior of Delta islands but is more prevalent
along many portions of sloughs and channels between Delta islands that are not riprapped.
          MARSH
Marsh habitat is dominated by herbaceous plant species growing in inundated or saturated soil.
Tidal marsh and non-tidal permanent and seasonal freshwater marsh occupy much of the Delta
islands. Non-tidal permanent and seasonal freshwater marsh typically is associated with
riparian and open-water habitats in relatively undisturbed locations. Seasonal non-tidal marsh
supports some of the same species as permanent marsh. Seasonal non-tidal marsh occurs in low
grassland areas and the perimeter of permanent marsh, where high winter and spring flooding
occurs for 3-4 months yearly. Marsh habitat is similar to riparian habitat in terms of its location,
species associations, and historical losses. Therefore, like riparian habitat, marsh habitat is
considered a sensitive community. Dominant marsh plants include cattail, tule, bulrush, other
emergent wetland species, and buttonbush.
          VERNAL POOL AND VERNAL SWALE
Vernal pools are seasonally flooded depressions that pond water during the rainy season. They
are internally drained and lack a drainage outlet. The pools usually are found on ancient soils
with an impermeable layer, such as a hardpan, claypan, or volcanic basalt. The impermeable
layer allows the pools to retain water much longer than the surrounding uplands. However, the
pools are shallow enough to dry up each season. Vernal pools occur as isolated pools in annual
grasslands or may be located in an intricate matrix within seasonal swales.
Vernal swales are natural, gently sloping broad drainages that convey runoff during, and for
short periods after, rainfalls and may be connected with vernal pools. Both vernal pools and
swales support a distinctive biota adapted to (1) periodic or continuous inundation during the
wet season, and (2) the absence of either ponded water or wet soil during the dry season.
Vernal pools and swales support a high diversity of native annual hydrophytic plant species.
Common dominants include goldfields, navarretia, prostrate pigweed, coyote thistle, woolly
marbles, popcorn flowers, downingias, annual hairgrass, and common spikerush. Alkali pools
may include additional dominants such as alkali heath, alkali-mallow, alkali weed, saltgrass,
and introduced matgrass. Subalkaline flats support dominants such as saltgrass, Chenopodium
species, and Atriplex species. Vernal pools often provide habitat for a number of rare endemic
plant species, including legenere, dwarf downingia, and Colusa and Solano grasses.
Vernal pools and swales in the aquatic phase often support diverse and dense assemblages of
invertebrates, particularly crustaceans and insects. Common crustaceans in vernal pools include
copepods, seed shrimp, fairy shrimp, and tadpole shrimp. Diving beetles and fly and mosquito
larvae are typical insects in vernal pools. Many invertebrates thrive in vernal pools because of
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    10-8                  Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

the absence of fish, which are their primary predators in other aquatic habitats. The abundance
of invertebrates provides food for a variety of bird species, including cinnamon teal, mallard,
and other waterfowl, as well as shorebirds and wading birds such as avocet, killdeer, and
yellowlegs. Vernal pools provide important breeding grounds for several amphibians,
including western spadefoot toad and California tiger salamander. Other species commonly
encountered in the drying phase of vernal pools include the Pacific treefrog and common garter
snake.
          HERBACEOUS UPLAND
Annual grassland is found primarily on the broad, gentle interior slopes of the perimeter levees.
Typical annual grassland species include canary grass, ripgut brome, mustard, and burr-clover.
Levees may be grazed but are not cultivated.
Exotic perennial grassland is a habitat type with moisture conditions ranging between those of
perennial grasses (e.g., Bermuda grass, perennial ryegrass, saltgrass, and Johnson grass) and
annuals, but is not wet enough in the dry season to support typical wetland species (e.g., cattail,
rush, dock, tule, and bulrush). More mesic (moderately moist) portions of the interior levee
slopes may include this habitat type.
Both exotic marsh and exotic perennial grasslands tend to be ruderal plant communities that
colonize previously disturbed sites, such as abandoned fields, mowed levees, or flooded corners
of active crop lands. If not disturbed for several years, grasslands tend to be replaced by native,
woody riparian or freshwater marsh species.
          WILDLIFE
At least 230 species of birds and 43 species of mammals are found in the Delta (California
Department of Fish and Game, 1987). Many of these species occur in the Delta only during fall
and winter, when the Delta becomes home to an abundance of migratory and wintering
wildlife. The most conspicuous groups of wintering wildlife include waterfowl, shorebirds, and
raptors. Wildlife species and populations on different islands vary primarily according to the
amounts and types of crops grown, amounts of natural habitats remaining, and extent of
seasonal flooding of agricultural fields.
The Delta is a particularly important habitat for shorebirds. Thousands of shorebirds use fields
flooded for weed control in late summer and fall, and fields that flood shallowly from seepage
and rainfall in winter. The Delta also provides habitat for an abundance of wintering waterfowl
that migrate down the Pacific Flyway each year. Large populations of ducks, geese, and swans
inhabit agricultural fields and seasonal wetland habitats throughout the Delta. Concentrations
of snow geese, tundra swans, white-fronted geese, pintails, and mallards are among the more
visible species that are attracted to the Delta. Large amounts of waste grain and winter wheat
provide foraging habitat, and seasonally flooded fields provide both food and roosting habitat.
The sandhill crane is one of the more conspicuous species that migrates to the Delta each year.
Both lesser and greater sandhill cranes use traditional wintering areas in the Delta from October
through February. The Delta also is home to an abundance of wintering raptors, including red-
tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, rough-legged hawk, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, sharp-

July 18, 2002
shinned hawk, Cooper’s hawk, and peregrine falcon. During winter, raptors forage
opportunistically throughout the Delta on rodents that become accessible because of flooded
fields and other agricultural activities.
          SPECIAL-STATUS FISH AND AQUATIC SPECIES
The Delta contains fish and other aquatic species that have been identified by state or federal
agencies as species at risk. Chinook salmon, steelhead trout, green sturgeon, Delta smelt,
longfin smelt, and splittail are present either year-round or seasonally. Some species, like the
chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and green sturgeon, are seasonal; others, such as Delta smelt,
longfin smelt, and Sacramento splittail, are year-round residents in the Delta. Other aquatic
species that could inhabit the area include the Southwestern pond turtle and vernal pool fairy
shrimp.
          SPECIAL-STATUS PLANTS
Special-status plant species potentially occurring in the planning area are defined as at-risk
species with known populations in or near the planning area, or species found in habitats
identical or similar to those found in the planning area. The California Department of Fish and
Game’s Natural Diversity Data Base indicates that six special-status plant species are known to
occur in the planning area. All are wetland-associated species from wetland habitats that occur
along margins of large waterways or within the confines of the levee system (i.e., in-water
islands or large remnant marshes). Reference “Appendix A of the General Plan Final EIR” for a
list of the special-status plant species known or with the potential to occur in the planning area.
          SPECIAL-STATUS WILDLIFE
Numerous special-status wildlife species are found in the Delta during fall and winter.
Reference “Appendix A of the General Plan Final EIR.”
WATER RESOURCES
The discussion of water resources in the Resource Conservation & Management element focuses
primarily on water quality and groundwater recharge. (Water supply and the City’s role as a
service provider is discussed in the Public Facilities & Services element.)
Surface water serves many important purposes in both the natural and built environment.
Beneficial uses of the Sacramento River in the Rio Vista planning area include:
          •   Municipal and domestic, industrial, and agricultural water supply.
          •   A navigable channel for large shipping vessels.
          •   Water sports and recreation.
          •   Aesthetic enjoyment.
          •   Groundwater recharge and freshwater replenishment.
          •   Preservation and enhancement of fish, wildlife, and other aquatic resources.
The beneficial uses of the underlying groundwater are municipal and domestic, industrial, and
agricultural water supply.

Watersheds within the city limits are partially urbanized areas with large tracts of vacant land.
Drainage in the undeveloped areas of the City is generally by sheet flow into various small
swales and intermittent streams.
For the most part, measurements of water quality in Rio Vista indicate that no major sources of
pollution are present. However, the City’s wastewater treatment plant, which flows to the
Sacramento River, exceeds capacity during extreme wet-weather periods. The plant currently is
undergoing physical improvements to (1) improve plant reliability, and (2) expand the facility’s
capacity in order to fully accommodate the current wastewater flow conditions and the
increases that are expected as a result of ongoing development. (Note: A full discussion of the
City’s wastewater treatment facilities is found in the Public Facilities & Services element.)
AIR QUALITY
Air is a critical environmental resource that must be protected. Rio Vista enjoys good air
quality due to the Delta breezes and the community’s relative distance from the large urban
areas of the Bay Area and Central Valley. Nevertheless, without conscious efforts to achieve
and maintain air quality standards, threats to the public health may result from degraded air
quality. Degradation of air quality is caused, in part, by emissions of pollutants from motor
vehicles, as well as by commercial and industrial development. Agricultural activities and
wood-burning stoves also affect air quality.
Both the state and the federal Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) have established
ambient air quality standards for six key air pollutants by which overall air quality is measured.
These six pollutants are photochemical ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, particulate matter 10 microns or less in diameter (PM10), and lead.
High concentrations of ozone and carbon monoxide lead to harmful effects. Ozone diminishes
lung function and leads to respiratory infections; carbon monoxide reduces the amount of
oxygen reaching the heart, brain, and other vital organs. Seniors, children, fetuses, and persons
with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are especially sensitive to the effects of carbon
monoxide and ozone.
The Sacramento Valley Air Basin, of which Rio Vista is a part, meets each of the ambient air
quality standards except ozone (state and federal standards) and PM10 (state standards). Ozone
forms when precursor pollutants (i.e., hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides) react together in
sunlight. Sources of ozone precursors include motor vehicles, petroleum and chemical
industries, consumer products, and dry cleaning. From 80 to 90 percent of carbon monoxide
emissions results from motor vehicles burning gasoline incompletely. The Yolo-Solano Air
Quality Management District (YSAQMD) is the agency responsible for protecting human health
and property from the harmful effects of air pollution. The YSAQMD has jurisdiction over the
northeast portion of Solano County, from Vacaville on the west to Rio Vista on the south. The
District is governed by an air quality management board composed of representatives from
both the county boards of supervisors and the mayors and city council members from the cities
within the District.

July 18, 2002

SOILS
Soil conservation is an important aspect of natural resource management—both during
construction and after development. Consequently, Rio Vista soils are considered a community
resource to be preserved. The U.S. Natural Resource Conservation District’s (NRCS’s) soils map
of the Rio Vista quadrangle is shown in Figure 10-1.
Soil properties that are most limiting in the Sacramento River Delta include drainage, slope,
shrink-swell potential, bank stability, and shear strength. The planning area is underlain by
thick deposits of alluvial sediments. Near-surface deposits are generally dark-colored, often
highly organic, and of mixed lithologic composition and origin. Recent sediments along the
eastern margin of the Delta are derived mostly from metamorphic sources in the Sierra Nevada
foothills. Sediments along the western edge of the Delta are derived from the uplifted Tertiary
sedimentary rocks of the Coast Ranges. The deepest layers of the alluvial sediments are a
complex mixture of coarse sand and gravel bedrock deposits, sand- and silt-sized overbank
deposits, and silt- and clay-sized backwater deposits. Sedimentary bedrock underlies the
alluvial sediments.
Soils in the planning area reflect its original land cover, supporting mostly tule marsh
vegetation and riparian forest vegetation. Soil types include loams, clays, clay loams, silty clay
loams, fluvaquents, and mucks. Mineral soils cover most of the upland portions of the Delta
and the lowland portions are dominated by peat soils. These soils are generally deep (up to 60
feet) and very poorly drained.
ENERGY
Rio Vista is in Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (PG&E’s) Sacramento Division of Area 6.
Since the California legislature approved deregulation of the utilities in 1996, PG&E has
divested itself of its production facilities and now purchases electricity for distribution through
the Independent Systems Operator (ISO). Power is transmitted to Rio Vista by PG&E
transmission lines that run from the Brighton substation in Sacramento to the Grand Island
substation. Large transformers at the Grand Island substation then step the electricity down
from 115,000 volts to 21,000 volts for local distribution and use. PG&E operates 12-kilovolt (kV)
electrical distribution lines to serve residences and farm operations. These lines typically run on
wooden utility poles.
PG&E is also the distributor of natural gas through lines that run through central California.
Approximately 80 percent of existing demand in Rio Vista is from homes. Commercial
development and industry each account for 10 percent of the City’s demand.

Rio Vista General Plan 2001 10-13 Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002
Rio Vista contributes to the natural gas supply with its gas reserves in various locations
throughout the City. Gas-gathering facilities in Rio Vista place most of the natural gas in lines
directed toward Stockton and Lodi.
SOLID WASTE REDUCTION
Solid waste is any unwanted or discarded material that is not a liquid or a gas. Common solid
wastes are paper products, metals, glass, plastics, cloth, food scraps, rock, soil, yard waste, and
wood. In Rio Vista, businesses generate 30 percent of the waste and households generate
70 percent. Since much of this material is recyclable, conservation efforts to reduce solid waste
and landfill volumes are an important component of this General Plan.
Currently, a private waste collection company (Rio Vista Sanitation Service [RVSS]) is
authorized to provide residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collection and
disposal services to the City of Rio Vista. Waste is collected and transported in compliance with
county and state regulations governing solid waste disposal to the Contra Costa Waste Service
Transfer Station in Pittsburg, where loads are sorted through and recyclable material is
removed.
The residual waste is loaded in transfer trailers and taken to the Potrero Hills Landfill (PHLF) in
Fairfield, operated by Potrero Hills Landfill, Inc. The current capacity of PHLF is 21 million
cubic yards. The estimated time of closure ranges from 15 to 57 years, depending on the annual
fill rate. There is expansion potential if needed in the future.
Several diversion programs currently operate in Rio Vista. RVSS works specifically with the
Rio Vista High School Recycling Center. RVSS provides containers for newspaper, cardboard,
glass, aluminum, and plastic. The drop-off location is at the Rio Vista High School parking lot.
The material is hauled to Mt. Diablo Recycling in Concord for processing. Information
regarding other recycling programs and diversion rates can be obtained from the City of Rio
Vista.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
The Delta possesses a unique blend of historic and archaeological resources. Until the Gold
Rush of the 1840s and 1850s, the Delta was a network of waterways and natural islands of sand
and peat. The levee system that evolved between the 1850s and the present represents a unique
human-made landscape that contributes to the rich historic heritage of the Delta region.
The growth of the Central Valley economy, prompted by the discovery of gold, brought
thousands of new settlers to the region in the mid-1800s and dramatically increased the demand
for agricultural land. The water cannon process of gold extraction contributed to the
transformation of the ecosystem and, in combination with levee construction, eliminated most
of the marshlands before 1900.
In 1857, when Rio Vista was established in its current location, levees were under construction
along the river in many locations throughout the Central Valley. These levees opened up the
vast, rich agricultural lands around Rio Vista and enabled this small river landing settlement to
grow and prosper. (See the Introduction for a more detailed discussion of the community’s history.)

The Rio Vista Museum on Front Street houses most of the documentation of Rio Vista’s history.
Numerous books have been written about this small river town; local efforts are now being
made to correct, update, and expand historical accounts of the area. While the community is
rich in its history—with numerous homes and commercial buildings dating back to the mid-
nineteenth century and the settlement of Chinese immigrants—there is no historic district in Rio
Vista, nor do any programs exist to promote or preserve its historic structures or sites. The Rio
Vista Museum, which operates under a Board and is funded through donations and
memberships, functions as the primary local source for historical and genealogical data. Local
residents also serve as authoritative, albeit unofficial, sources of historical and cultural
information.
VISUAL RESOURCES
Visual resources are both varied and abundant in and around Rio Vista. Those approaching
town from the west enter the Rio Vista city limits miles before they experience the historic
flavor of its downtown core, where vast expanses of agricultural lands intermingle with new
residential development and vacant grasslands are dotted with natural gas production wells.
Just beyond this view corridor—south of Highway 113—are the rolling Montezuma Hills, with
undulating topography that creates spectacular vistas. On the northern edge of the City, the
Delta marshlands provide yet another viewing opportunity. Travelers from the east enter the
City’s gateway at the Rio Vista Bridge, with panoramic views extending the length of the town
from the Deep Water Channel to the marina. Primary viewing opportunities in Rio Vista are
intermittent, from vantage points along Highway 12 that offer sweeping vistas of the
Montezuma Hills to the Sacramento riverfront from the Rio Vista Bridge south to Sandy Beach.

July 18, 2002

E.        Outlook
This Resource Conservation & Management element will be used as a guide to direct future
actions by the City and the development community in their treatment of natural, cultural, and
visual resources. Specific resources of concern include open space, biological resources, water
resources, air quality, soils, energy, solid waste reduction, historic resources, and visual
resources. This element focuses on open space as a means of ensuring the continued availability
of land for (1) managed production for agriculture and mineral extraction, (2) seasonal drainage
corridors and floodwater conveyance, (3) preservation of key hilltops and ridges, (4) retention
of natural topography in the Montezuma Hills, (5) wildlife habitat, and (6) enjoyment as a
visual resource and aesthetic amenity
SENSITIVE LOCAL RESOURCE AREAS
The General Plan identifies several significant areas in the Rio Vista planning area where one or
more of the resources identified above may be concentrated or that may feature several of these
resources. Throughout this element and others in the General Plan, these significant areas are
referred to as “Sensitive Local Resource Areas” (SLRAs). SLRAs can be defined as “areas
possessing one or more natural resources that, when taken together, create a feature that is
uniquely representative of Rio Vista’s character.” The SLRAs are mapped in Figure 10-2 as areas
that are to be preserved to the extent feasible during the course of development. The SLRA
boundaries map is not intended to be exact; the map is drawn in general form to serve as an
overlay, to guide the project design and development phases in affected areas.
The Sensitive Local Resource areas illustrated in Figure 10-2 can be separated into two general
categories; low areas comprised of minor water courses known as drainageways or corridors,
floodplain and marsh or wetland areas; and the key landforms, which include specific hilltops,
ridgelines, valleys and their adjacent slopes, characteristic of the northern Montezuma Hills.
The low areas are discussed and defined in the Water Resources section of Outlook; policies
related to these are found under Goal 10.5 (protection of water resources). Key landforms
(hilltops, ridgelines and valleys) are discussed in the section of that name under Outlook;
related policies are found under Goal 10.11. Figures 5-3 and 10-2 show the general locations of
both low areas and the key landforms that have been identified as particularly prominent or
important to retaining the character of the community’s context and setting. Figures 10-2 and 5-
3 are not intended to delineate exact locations.
OPEN SPACE
Preservation of open space for myriad uses is a basic goal of the Rio Vista General Plan. While
the City’s intent for use of open space is discussed in detail in the Open Space & Recreation
element, the policies of this element and their supporting programs will help to preserve and
enhance open space as natural habitat. Implementing these actions will:

July 18, 2002

          •   Ensure that sensitive biological areas are properly conserved and managed with
              future development projects.
          •   Contribute to the preservation of the City’s archaeological, historic, and visual
              resources.
Growth pressures from the Bay Area and plans for large-scale development within the city
present challenges in achieving these objectives. The potential loss of open space areas to
development pressures represents a concern that is addressed in the policies and implementing
actions of this element. The City will be challenged in balancing resource preservation with the
development needed to sustain a healthy and prosperous community. Preservation efforts will
first focus on avoidance, with compensation a less desirable approach to be used when
avoidance is not feasible. The overall goal is to minimize loss of valuable and significant natural
resources.

Rio Vista General Plan 2001 10-18 Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002
Policies directed at the preservation of open space are intended to guide rather than hinder the
development process. Toward that end, the General Plan provides key tools, such as the SLRAs
map, Sensitive Habitat Buffer Guidelines, and Resource Evaluation Criteria, to facilitate the
design and development of projects that are in keeping with the Rio Vista Principles and goals
of this element.
          AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Although Rio Vista has not designated any of its lands in the city limits for agricultural uses,
preservation of farmland is a critical component in maintaining its rural, small-town character.
Rio Vista supports agriculture outside the municipal boundaries. As the City develops and
expands, it will continue to promote agricultural conservation practices and will oppose
premature or inappropriate efforts to intensify land uses in adjacent unincorporated areas. The
General Plan policies are intended to solidify this stance and provide implementing actions that
will encourage agriculture to continue right up to the urban edge.
General Plan policies in all elements with an agriculture component were developed under the
assumption that Solano County’s Measure A (or its equivalent) will remain in place during the
life of this General Plan. That is, lands outside and adjacent to the city limits will remain in
agricultural production and any urban uses will be directed to areas within municipal
boundaries. With this County policy of keeping unincorporated lands around Rio Vista in
agriculture, the need for an urban separator within the city limits will not be needed and the
City will be able to maximize the use of land to where it abuts County lines. The City will
encourage compact design and development of traditional neighborhoods in pedestrian-
friendly environments throughout the City. The City will need to closely monitor land use
decisions in the County, to ensure that this policy remains in place. Rio Vista will actively
oppose any efforts to intensify land uses in the vicinity of the City.
In cases where agricultural buffers are required for health and safety purposes, the City will
encourage the use of easements, density transfers, or binding agreements between developers
and agricultural landowners to establish sufficient transition areas between urban and
agricultural land uses. Such implementation measures are fully described in Section F of this
chapter. The need for buffer areas to separate urban development from agricultural lands may
vary from project to project and from lot to lot, depending on the adjacent agricultural use. The
General Plan adheres to the agricultural buffer standards, according to class, as established by
the State of California and used by Solano County.
          SACRAMENTO RIVER DELTA
While changes in land use from agriculture are proposed on several Delta islands in the
Primary Zone, no land use changes are proposed on DPC lands in the Rio Vista planning area.
Loss of steady water supplies for Valley farmers will tend to make Delta lands with their
riparian water rights more valuable for agriculture. New markets to sell crops and new crops,
including crops to burn as energy sources, will continue to keep agriculture an important land
resource in the Delta and in California.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    10-19                   Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

Since the DPC is a state agency, the City’s General Plan policies must be in accordance with this
agency’s policies for protected lands within Rio Vista’s planning boundaries. Agricultural
operations, natural resource protection, water-related recreation, and public facility uses will
remain the only allowable uses in the Delta Primary Zone under the new General Plan.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Development under buildout of the General Plan would result in the conversion of large tracts
of undeveloped land that could have the potential to adversely affect sensitive habitat. Infill
development in more developed areas of the City is not expected to adversely affect important
biological habitats or plant species.
This element provides a Sensitive Local Resource Areas Map to provide a starting point for site
planning as large development projects are proposed. While this map is intended to serve as a
general guide in identifying SLRAs, site-specific biological resource evaluations also will be
required with each proposed project when it has been determined through the use of an initial
study or environmental checklist that the project could result in potentially significant impacts
to sensitive biological resources. Implementing actions, such as establishing Sensitive Habitat
Buffer Guidelines, updating the Zoning Ordinance, and open space requirements, are some of
the ways in which developments will be able to mitigate any potential impacts.
WATER RESOURCES
The Sacramento River and inland drainages are among the most significant and valuable of Rio
Vista’s natural resources. Development adjacent to streams will need to be designed,
constructed and maintained to avoid adverse impacts on riparian vegetation, river bank
stability, and water quality to the maximum extent feasible. The City’s policies in this regard
apply to all watercourses, wetlands, and drainage corridors shown on the SLRAs Map (Note: In
this element, “drainage corridor” is used as the collective term for drainageways, minor watercourses,
and intermittent and perennial streams; these corridors include the smallest tributaries in a river basin.)
The City strengthens its commitment to water conservation and water quality for both surface
water and groundwater through its General Plan policies. Implementing actions emphasize the
use of buffers and proper design to minimize urban runoff and pollutants entering waterways.
(Water supply policies are discussed in the Public Facilities & Services element.) These are further
defined as intermittent streams or watercourses shown on USGS topographic maps; there are
two such features contained within the areas shown in Figure 10-2: the “Industrial Creek”
intermittent stream bed and adjacent floodplain that flows through the main “valley” that
bisects the Esperson and Riverwalk properties; and the Watson Hollow stream basin that flows
through the Brann, Gibbs and City airport properties.
In addition to land use considerations, key implementing actions to protect water resources
involve the use of setbacks, best management practices (BMPs) (e.g., grading, drainage, and
erosion control), and site design. The City will encourage the use of natural stormwater
drainage systems to preserve and enhance existing natural features.

July 18, 2002

AIR QUALITY
Buildout under this General Plan will result in a substantial increase in vehicle emissions, as a
direct result of population growth. Regional growth will continue to negatively affect air
quality. Rio Vista has defined its role in the attainment of state and federal air quality standards
of the Sacramento Valley Air Basin through its policies and programs. Land use patterns and
the General Plan’s Community Design Guidelines (as part of the Community Character & Design
element) will directly benefit the City’s air quality. The emphasis on traditional neighborhood
design and the creation of a pedestrian-friendly environment are expected to decrease the
amount of local automobile travel and vehicle emissions. In addition, the Plan’s guidance with
regard to site preparation and construction activities, the use of trees and vegetation for air
contaminant reduction, and cooperation with the YSAQMD will further serve to reduce the
adverse impacts of growth on air quality. (Additional implementing actions relating to air quality
are discussed in the Circulation & Mobility element.)
SOILS
Development under buildout of this General Plan will significantly disturb soils. Policies and
implementing actions in this element are intended to preserve or minimize disturbance to soils,
primarily through the use of sound grading and erosion control techniques. The General Plan
policies rely on local ordinances and the BMPs recommended by the NRCS as the primary
guidelines for grading and erosion control measures. Figure 10-3 illustrates the preferred
method for cuts and fills.
In addition, knowledge of soils limitations and their suitability for development will help to
conserve this limited resource and determine proper land use. The soils map on Figure 10-1,
combined with the USDA Resource Conservation District’s Soils of Solano County, define the
characteristics of soils in Rio Vista; this information can be applied to constraints analyses for
proposed development.
HILLTOPS, RIDGELINES, VALLEYS AND SLOPES
    Rio Vista’s location in the Montezuma Hills, adjacent to the Sacramento River, is a unique
    feature of the city’s character. The Montezuma Hills offer outstanding views of the existing
    city, the Sacramento River, and the regional agricultural landscape. Low-lying areas that
    include drainage corridors (intermittent streams), wetlands and floodplains, absorb storm
    water runoff and help to alleviate or reduce flooding. Figure 10-2, Sensitive Local Resource
    Areas and Figure 5-3, General Locations of Key Hilltops, Valleys and Ridgelines, identify the
    sensitive resources that require special resource conservation and management policies.
    The preservation of the sensitive hilltops, ridgelines and valleys accomplishes several
    resource conservation and management objectives. The hilltops, ridgelines and the adhacent
    slopes, define the natural character of the Montezuma Hills and provide for long views to the
    regional landscape. When viewed from the existing city, they provide a visual link and
    connection to the natural character of this unique environmental feature. When in the hills,
    the hilltops and ridgelines offer the potential for views to a variety of urban and natural
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       10-21               Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

    features. Taken together, this perspective is one of the key defining elements of Rio Vista’s
    sense of place, its connection to its surroundings and its definition of itself as a community.
    The valleys and drainage corridors are a significant component of the structure of the
    Montezuma Hills, and are integral to the surface run-off that feeds the wetlands located at
    the low end of this sensitive resource area. The valleys also offer the potential for an
    integrated public open space and trail system that can link the majority of the developing
    lands immediately contiguous to the existing urban core.
    The hilltops, ridgelines and valleys offer a variety of outstanding community benefits as the
    city develops adjacent to these sensitive environmental areas. The preservation of the
    significant natural functions of these resources presents a unique opportunity for public
    benefit, access and enjoyment that is otherwise impossible to create.
    Goals, policies, and implementation measures, including design criteria, that relate to these
    key resources and the opportunities they represent, are stated mainly in two Elements:
    Chapter 5, Community Character and Design; and this Chapter 10, Resource Conservation
    and Management.
    VISUAL RESOURCES
    The City of Rio Vista will use the tools provided in this General Plan to retain its small-town
    character in what is now a desirable rural setting. In an effort to avoid generic suburban
    architectural styles, the policies and implementing actions in this element seek to preserve
    open space areas and views as an important feature of the community. Together with the
    design guidelines in the Community Character & Design element, the policies and
    implementing actions in this element will help to further strengthen the visual interest of the
    city.
    The gateway areas are visual focal points for those entering the city on Highway 12.
    Buildout under this General Plan will bring substantial new development along the
    highway—portions of which are within highly sensitive viewing corridors. Consequently,
    proper siting and design of development projects in these areas are critical to maintaining a
    desirable aesthetic quality in these areas.
    Development should be sensitive to the key natural features of the area, including ecological
    systems, vegetative communities, mature trees, watercourses, land forms, archaeological and
    historical resources, and architecturally significant structures. Proposed projects should
    identify and conserve special areas of high ecological sensitivity throughout the City—for
    example, key hilltops, riparian areas, and views of the Sacramento River waterfront. By
    respecting and preserving important natural resources and visual character, development
    may serve as an asset rather than a detriment to the community.

ENERGY
Californians have become more energy conscious since the energy crisis in 1972. The advent of
deregulation, rapidly escalating cost of energy, and ever-decreasing availability of fuel sources
have prompted government agencies to conserve energy and look for alternatives to the use of
non-renewable resources. Strategies used by state and local communities include improving
the efficiency of transportation systems, replacing fixtures that use a lot of energy with newer
and more efficient equipment, and promoting recycling. (These strategies also are discussed in the
Circulation & Mobility element and in other sections of this element.)
Communities throughout the state are presently experiencing “rolling blackouts” as a result of
the imbalance at certain times between the supply of and demand for electricity. The ISO,
which serves as a power brokerage, operates the State’s electricity power grid and tells the
distributors of electricity when they need to transfer load to PG&E.
As electricity demand continues to outstrip the available supply in California, Rio Vistans will
need to change the way they use and manage limited power resources. Reports from the ISO
indicate that statewide energy conservation is significantly reducing the demand. Until
additional or alternative power generation sources come online, energy conservation will
become increasingly important to the community.

There is a potential for utilizing biofuels from the Delta to power a generating plant in the
vicinity. Current Rio Vista demands are about 4-5 megawatts; future demand will grow to
about 20 megawatts at today’s energy usage rates. If feasible, a biofuel plant might provide a
large portion of Rio Vista’s demand or perhaps even excess capacity. Various solid wastes
might also be used for co-generation.
SOLID WASTE REDUCTION
The cities and County of Solano have established goals and policies for solid waste reduction
and increased use of secondary (recycled) materials. These goals and policies, which are
contained in the Solano County Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan (Environmental
Science Associates, 1995), include measures for transforming the current system of producing,
consuming, and disposing of material goods to a new system that places greatest emphasis on
reducing the generation of solid waste at the source of the generation; secondary emphasis on
recycling or composting the maximum feasible amount of the solid waste that is generated; and
finally, disposing of the residue that cannot be reduced, recycled or composted in sanitary
landfills that meet current regulatory design criteria for environmental protection.
These goals include the reduction of the amount and hazard of special wastes generated.
Maximizing recycling, reuse and composting of special waste, and ensuring environmentally
safe disposal of special waste that cannot be reused, recycled or composted is an integral part of
this program.
Another goal of the plan includes increased use of secondary materials. The Solano County
Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan states the intent of this interjurisdictional effort to
strengthen markets for secondary materials by continuing to place emphasis on front-end
(source-separated) management methods that produce the highest quality, most marketable
materials, and by increasing local markets for locally produced materials.
The City of Rio Vista will continue to work with the cities and Solano County to achieve these
stated goals. Future development within the planning area is not expected to affect the ability
of the City or its solid waste disposal service provider, Rio Vista Sanitation Service (RVSS), to
continue their part in implementing solid waste reduction programs.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
Rio Vista’s historic resources continue to play a vital role in maintaining the community’s
character. The city’s rich historical context needs to be called out and preserved for future
generations. The City’s overall preservation objectives are to identify, protect, and encourage
preservation of Rio Vista’s historic and cultural resources throughout the City. This element
establishes the policies and implementing actions to guide the City’s achievement of its
preservation objectives.
Restoration of historic buildings to meet modern building codes (i.e., the Uniform Building
Code, the Uniform Fire Code, and the Uniform Plumbing Code) can be too costly for property
owners. In addition, some alterations required by these modern codes could detract from the
historic aspects of the structures. Therefore, the City will encourage property owners to pursue
historic designation for their structures and sites under federal, state, or local authority. Such a
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     10-25                Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

designation would enable the property owner to implement alternative building regulations for
the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration, or relocation of structures designated as qualified
historic buildings, as allowed by the State Historical Building Code (Title 24, Part 8).

G.        Implementing Actions for Resource Conservation & Management
          (RCM)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Resource Conservation & Management element.
RCM-1              SENSITIVE HABITAT BUFFER GUIDELINES
                   (Proposed)
The City will review projects on a case-by-case basis to determine the setback requirements for
sensitive habitat. General guidelines for setbacks will include 100 feet from the edge of
perennial streams; 50 feet from the edge of intermittent streams; and 50 feet from the edge of
sensitive habitats, including riparian zones, wetlands, and habitats of rare, threatened, and
endangered species. Based on more detailed information supplied as part of the review for a
specific project, the City may determine that these setback distances are not applicable in a
particular instance or that they should be modified (decreased or increased) based on the new
information provided. Additional setbacks may be required for Sensitive Local Resource Areas
(as defined in Section E in this chapter and shown in Figure 10-2; also see implementing action RCM-6
below). The City may allow exceptions as follows:
          •   The location is necessary to avoid or mitigate hazards to the public.
          •   The location is necessary for the repair of roads, bridges, trails, or similar
              infrastructure; the City determines that there is no feasible alternative; and/or the
              City’s decision makers have determined that the project has minimized
              environmental impacts through project design and infrastructure placement.
RCM-2              FEES, DEDICATIONS, AND EASEMENTS
                   (Proposed)
Parcel lines (in the case of a subdivision) or easements (in the case of a subdivision or other
development) should be located to optimize resource protection. If a Sensitive Local Resource
Area (SLRA) or other significant corridor, including drainage corridors, hilltops, or other
sensitive areas, is proposed for inclusion in an open space parcel or easement, allowed uses and
maintenance responsibilities within that parcel should be clearly defined and conditioned prior
to map or project approval.
The City will seek to protect SLRAs by (1) requiring adequate setbacks; (2) maintaining these
areas in an essentially natural state; (3) prohibiting the planting of invasive, non-native plants
within the SLRAs or setback areas; and (4) avoiding removal of natural vegetation within the
areas to the extent feasible.
RCM-3              COMMUNITY DESIGN GUIDELINES
                   (Proposed)
The City will apply the Community Design Guidelines, as described in the Community
Character & Design element of the General Plan. These guidelines will promote the integration
of natural and built environments.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       10-44                  Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

RCM-4              NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES INVENTORY
                   (Proposed)
In conjunction with the environmental review of a project required by the California
Environmental Quality Act, the City will require that resource field surveys be submitted,
concurrent with development applications, that provide an inventory of the type, quantity, and
quality of existing open space and natural resources. This requirement may be waived if the
City determines that the proposed planning area has been sufficiently surveyed or does not
contain resources considered significant. The completed surveys will be used to evaluate
individual projects and to compile a comprehensive natural resources inventory for the City.
The City will initiate, or work with the Rio Vista Museum Board and other interested local civic
groups to undertake, an inventory of structures (50 or more years old) or sites with potential
architectural, historic, archaeological, or cultural significance to the community. The inventory
could include developing historic context statements for each property that is determined to
have local historical significance. The information will be incorporated into the City’s cultural
and historical database, to be maintained by the Rio Vista Museum, which then can be made
available to historians or property owners pursuing listing on the official state or federal
register.
RCM-5              PUBLIC AWARENESS/EDUCATION PROGRAMS
                   (Proposed)
The City’s role in public education about resource conservation and management will, at a
minimum, provide City residents with literature and public information announcements on
habitat preservation; highway cleanup and beautification; water and energy issues; wastewater
generation, treatment, and reuse; and household waste reduction. In addition, the City will
request additional information from state and federal agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, California Department of Fish and Game, and State Office of Emergency
Services that can be reproduced and distributed. The City will attempt to reach all households
and businesses by ensuring that this information is easily accessible to them.
Another key component of this implementing action is to increase public awareness of and
involvement in the preservation of cultural and historical resources. The City will work with
the Rio Vista Museum Board and local historians to promote involvement in historical research,
construction of informational markers and kiosks, and historic structure restoration efforts.
Outreach efforts will be made, in partnerships with these groups, to solicit involvement in
signage design, funding and construction through the local schools, businesses and residents.
RCM-6              SENSITIVE LOCAL RESOURCE AREAS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The General Plan identifies several significant areas in the Rio Vista planning area where one or
more sensitive natural resources may be concentrated, or that may feature several of these
resources. Throughout the General Plan, these significant areas are referred to as Sensitive
Local Resource Areas (SLRAs). SLRAs can be defined as “areas possessing one or more natural
resources that, when taken together, create a feature that is uniquely representative of Rio
Vista’s character.” The SLRAs are mapped in Figure 10-2 as areas where particular care is taken
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           10-45            Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

to respect and preserve major portions of these important features during the course of
development. The SLRAs boundaries map is not intended to be exact. Specific locations of key
features are expected to be identified by RCM-7, the environmental / visual constraints map
that will be prepared and submitted as one of the first steps in the development review process.
Figure 10-2 is considered to be subject to change as more specific information becomes available
about a particular site or property. Its purpose is to identify certain sensitive areas and key
features as a point of beginning for the design process.
RCM-7              ENVIRONMENTAL/VISUAL CONSTRAINTS MAP
                   (Proposed)
The City will require with each development proposal an environmental/visual constraints
map, based on the findings of a project-specific biological assessment and consistent with
General Plan goals and policies. These maps will consider the potential open space
opportunities illustrated in Figure 10-2, the Sensitive Local Resource Areas Map.
RCM-8              DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
Through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of proposed new development on natural
resources, including Sensitive Local Resource Areas (SLRAs). The CEQA process dictates that
the City will refer any development proposal with a potential for direct or indirect impacts on
open space, sensitive habitat, air quality or drainage to the Community Development Director
and City Engineer, and other local agencies (e.g., YSAQMD) as applicable, for comment.
Where the Initial Study indicates that development projects may affect resources under the
jurisdiction of state or federal agencies (e.g., YSAQMD, the California Department of Fish and
Game, Regional Water Quality Control Board, Department of Water Resources (for Reclamation
Board), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency), the City will use the State Clearinghouse to refer such projects to the
appropriate agencies. The City will consider the comments of these departments and agencies
in the development review process. The City also may adopt its own specific standards for
some or all of the resources discussed in this element, in order to achieve the community’s
stated goals and policies.
In conducting its environmental review for projects, the City may require an inventory of the
quantity and quality of resources, assessment of potential project impacts, and identification of
preservation methods and other mitigation and monitoring measures. When significant natural
resources would cause parcels to be undevelopable, such parcels will not be created for urban
purposes unless City/CEQA-approved mitigation programs are incorporated.
Sensitive Local Resource Areas The City will work with developers to explore development
alternatives and standards that will minimize impacts on SLRAs. Such techniques may include
grading standards, limitation of development intensity, and cluster development. The City will
evaluate proposed projects for potential water quality impacts; projects may require sediment
basins as part of grading activities or grease/oil traps where concentrations of pollutants are
anticipated.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      10-46               Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

Where appropriate, the City will encourage the establishment of native plants and landscaping
that provide wildlife habitat. Where possible, the City will place archaeological sites or fragile
historic sites within open space areas as defined during this process. The City will determine
the potential for project linkages to local and regional open space networks through project
review. The City will use development agreements and/or other entitlement processes to
ensure open space preservation, maintenance, and management whenever feasible.
Agricultural Lands Mitigation of significant impacts on agricultural operations will be required
as a condition of approval of plans or subdivision maps. The City will determine the extent of
required buffers on annexation areas following an evaluation of probable impacts on
agricultural operations. Potential measures include the following “typical” mechanisms, as well
as ad hoc measures to be applied to individual projects:
          •   Disclosure of potential agricultural impacts to potential buyers of properties within
              1,000 feet of a property line adjacent to crop or grazing land; disclosure agreements
              to be included in homebuyer purchase agreements and attached to the deed of trust
              to ensure the information is also received by all future buyers of the property.
          •   Buffers consisting of natural resource areas or similar uses sited adjacent to
              agricultural lands where feasible.
          •   Conservation easements.
          •   Binding agreements between the developer, adjacent landowner, and the City that
              will reduce the potential impacts of agricultural operations. All parties shall enter
              into such agreements voluntarily.
          •   Implementing the provisions of Assembly Bill 1190 to provide that certain
              agricultural activities, operations, facilities, or appurtenances thereof, do not
              constitute a nuisance as long as they continue to operate in a similar manner to that
              in which they have historically operated.
          •   Agricultural easements, similar to aviation easements around airports (i.e., may be
              subject to legal restrictions).
Air Quality The City nmay require new development projects to submit an air quality analysis
for review and approval. Based on that analysis, the City shall require appropriate mitigation
measures. The City shall require as a condition of approval that all new development projects
submit a Construction Emission/Dust Control Plan to the Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management
District for review and approval prior to issuance of grading permits.
Historic and Cultural Resources Any project that may affect the character-defining features of a
historic or cultural resource will be reviewed to determine the potential for effects on the
significance of the resource to occur. If the property has not been previously evaluated but is 50
years or older, it should be evaluated to determine its potential eligibility and related review
requirements. The environmental review and certification process is distinct from, although
directly related to, the actual discretionary action decisions.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       10-47                 Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

RCM-9              BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
                   (Existing)
The City will require that developers use best management practices (BMPs) as recommended
by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service. Approaches to design, construction, and
maintenance techniques should ensure that development near a sensitive corridor would not
cause or worsen natural hazards (e.g., erosion, sedimentation, flooding, and water pollution).
Techniques will include erosion and sediment control practices, such as hay bales, turbidity
screens, temporary vegetation, and other management practices to minimize siltation,
sedimentation, and erosion. The City will require that these measures be left in place until
disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation that will prevent the transport of
sediment offsite. Additional BMPs to be used include oil and sand separators, grassy swales,
detention ponds, vegetative buffers, and other source control and treatment measures.
RCM-10             RESOURCE MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
                   (Proposed)
The City will accompany the designation of any area as Open Space with a program to ensure
the long-term maintenance and management of the area. The program will address the
frequency and type of maintenance needed, management and monitoring provisions to ensure
the continued viability of the resource, and designated costs and funding sources. When the
open space area is required as the result of permits issued by federal or state agencies, the
maintenance and management program will be consistent with applicable permitting
requirements. The City will consider the establishment of maintenance districts or homeowners’
associations (HOAs) to ensure sufficient funding for maintenance. Funding should consider all
municipal costs that will ensure protection of natural values, improvements, public use, and
adjacent properties.
Most property owners have some protected open space on their privately held land; its use and
maintenance is restricted by conditions in the deed. Open space could exist as private open
space; or the original developer could retain ownership of the open space land; or it could be
conveyed to a nonprofit land trust; or could be owned and managed by a homeowners
association (HOA). The intent of these options is that neither the individual homeowner nor the
community be adversely affected by the protected open space. While a deed restriction could
potentially lower the value of the open space, the loss could be offset by the increased value of
homes adjoining the open space.
RCM-11             RESOURCE EVALUATION CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
To establish levels of protection for open space lands, the City will review and consider the
inherent capabilities, qualities, and limitations of undeveloped lands targeted for development.
Sites will be evaluated in terms of their resource capacity, based on the following criteria, to
determine the extent to which they may require protection as a valuable natural resource:
          •   Significance. Significance involves the uniqueness or rarity of the site, or portions
              thereof.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     10-48                Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

          •   Natural function. Either directly or indirectly, large tracts of undeveloped land
              serve a purpose in natural cycles or systems. In some instances, sites provide habitat;
              in other instances, they are a vital factor in food, chemical, or energy cycles.
          •   Moderator of other natural phemonena. One natural function that is of particular
              concern to the City is the potential role of a site in modifying the environment or
              buffering its effect on adjoining areas. The site also may provide a moderating
              influence in a cycle or process. These functions often are critical to maintaining a
              balance in nature by slowing processes that otherwise would alter the environment
              too quickly.
          •   Geomorphological processes. Many physical and chemical processes act on the
              land’s surface to produce distinctive areas. Recognizing the significance of factors
              that affect landform evolution is essential to understanding the effects of such factors
              on urban development.
          •   Stability. Certain sites may lack durability or relative permanence because of the
              physical factors affecting the location. Some sites are naturally unstable, some are
              unstable when disturbed, and others are naturally stable.
          •   Degradation potential. The risks of degrading or destroying a site or transferring
              effects to other areas must be carefully considered. Undesirable alteration of natural
              systems may be an unanticipated consequence of development.
          •   Tolerance. The ability to recover from disturbance of different intensities is closely
              related to, and in some ways builds on, the concept of degradation potential. The
              degree of tolerance often is related to the type of use.
          •   Hazard. In some cases, a site may not be passive. Intrusion into an area may pose
              unnecessary safety risks to both life and property, as well as to the environment.
          •   Cultural importance. Sites can convey a sense of well-being or satisfaction to an
              individual or groups of people. Although this characteristic is often objectively not
              quantifiable, its consideration may be important in establishing protection standards.
          •   Special uses. Some land uses, by their very nature, must be located in a particular
              site. These uses, when identified, may need exception from the policy. Other land
              uses may acceptably locate on a site, provided special care is taken to protect the
              resource.
RCM-12             ZONING ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
To ensure that the Zoning Ordinance works in conjunction with General Plan policies to achieve
resource conservation and other City objectives, the City will review and modify its Zoning
Ordinance on an ongoing basis.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                         10-49                Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

The Zoning Ordinance update may include such modifications as the establishment of a zoning
designation applicable to sensitive resource areas. After modifications, the Zoning Ordinance
will serve as a tool for directing specific land uses to appropriate areas of the City and away
from sensitive resources.
The City also will review and update the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that it contains provisions
for non-conforming uses and structures in order to allow for the continued use and reuse of
historic buildings that do not meet current zoning standards.
RCM-13             LAND USE MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
To mitigate the impacts of land development on natural resources, and to minimize exposure
by residents to natural hazards (i.e., geologic and flooding), the City has designated the general
areas where open space, as shown on the proposed Land Use Map in the Land Use element,
may act as buffers between urbanized development and environmentally sensitive or flood-
prone areas.
RCM-14             AGRICULTURAL BUFFERS
                   (Proposed)
Since the General Plan Land Use element allows development to occur at urban densities to the
edge of the City limits, agricultural buffers will not be used to create a fixed greenbelt or urban
separator between the City and agricultural lands. Agricultural buffers will be applied,
however, in cases where a transition zone is needed to mitigate health and safety impacts or to
reduce land use incompatibility impacts to a less-than-significant level.
On a case-by-case basis, the City will evaluate development projects that abut agricultural lands
and will apply the agricultural buffer standards established by the Solano County Agricultural
Commission and the State of California for mitigation of health and safety concerns. While the
base land use of this buffer area will remain that of the adjoining urban use, methods such as
dedications, fees, and easements; resource maintenance and management programs; or binding
agreements between developers and agricultural landowners will be implemented to establish
adequate mitigation while giving developers flexibility in project design.
RCM-15             INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
At the earliest opportunity, the City will consult with Solano County and other responsible
agencies to ensure the coordinated designation and preservation of agricultural lands in the
Planning Area. The City also will cooperate with Solano County, nonprofit organizations, and
landowners to maintain policies (such as Measure A) that will continue to protect farmland at
the edge of urban development on unincorporated lands. These policies include the County’s
Right-to-Farm Ordinance, the use of agricultural easements, and farmland acquisition by non-
profit farmland trusts.
The City will continue to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wastewater
discharge and stormwater management regulations, as enforced by the State Water Resources
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           10-50          Resource Conservation & Management

Control Board and the Regional Water Quality Control Board. These regulations include
requirements for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. Rio Vista
intends to meet its requirements by promoting the use of cost-effective urban runoff controls,
including best management practices, to reduce the amount of pollutants entering the
waterways. Plans to protect the City’s water resources and water quality include the
development of standards for urban runoff to protect waterways and recharge areas.
The City will support the policies for wetland areas regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the California Department of Fish and Game.
Coordination with all agencies with jurisdiction at all levels of project review will continue to
ensure that appropriate mitigation measures are implemented and the necessary permits are
obtained.
The City will work in conjunction with the Delta Protection Commission (DPC) to implement
the goals and policies of the DPC’s Regional Land Use and Resource Management Plan (Delta
Protection Commission, 1995) for the Primary Zone of the Delta.
RCM-16             WASTEWATER REUSE
                   (Proposed)
The City will actively pursue the use of treated wastewater in irrigation and industrial
applications and, if feasible, in wildlife or wetlands habitat. The City will plan for development
of the proper infrastructure to facilitate wastewater reuse by the public and private sectors.
RCM-17             ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN CRITERIA
                   (Proposed)
1.        The City will require developers to minimize the creation of engineered drainage
          channels that concentrate runoff and disrupt natural drainage patterns. Runoff should
          be directed into vegetated valleys to allow for greater absorption of stormwater into the
          water table.
2.        Key hilltops (landforms), valleys, and sensitive areas are identified in Figure 10-2. The
          City will require these features to be left in their natural state as follows:
          •   Key hilltops (landforms). Sufficient natural slope and contours should remain to
              retain the view of the landform as an easily identifiable natural landmark from
              nearby streets and public areas.
          •   Valleys. Engineered cut or fill along banks should be avoided so that natural
              drainage retention and opportunities for trails at the top of the banks remain. The
              valley should not be substantially altered from its natural form and direction.
3. Grading Criteria for development within Sensitive Resource Areas and adjacent to Hilltops,
     Ridgelines & Valleys
     The primary objective of grading criteria is to allow for urban development to occur, while
     ensuring that finished grades adjacent to and within sensitive resource areas, hilltops,
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        10-51                   Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

     ridgelines and valleys respect the existing natural character of the Montezuma Hills
     landform. Both the alignment of the existing contours and the existing moderate gradients
     of these slopes, which rarely exceed one foot of rise over five feet of run, are important
     features of the Montezuma Hills, and must be integrated into development plans within and
     adjacent to them. Development within and adjacent to the sensitive resource areas and key
     landforms identified by Figure 10-2, is to meet the following grading criteria, illustrated in
     Figure 10-3.
     Where development occurs within sensitive resource areas and/or adjacent to key
     landforms (sensitive hilltops, ridgelines or valleys), the finished character of the engineered
     slopes and development should blend with the undulating character and alignment of the
     existing natural contours. The gradual changes in elevation of the site should still be
     recognizable after development is complete. The preferred approach to implementation is
     illustrated by the following criteria. The reviewing authority may accept variations from
     these criteria if and when it finds that site conditions warrant and the policies the criteria are
     intended to implement will be achieved equally as well by the proposed variation.
          •   On key landforms themselves, grading should be mininal. The landform or feature
              identified is to remain largely undisturbed; some streets, trails, utilities and similar
              minor improvements are allowed, but no homes or significant accessory structures.
              If limited grading occurs, graded sections should conform to limited gradients
              defined below.
          •   Slopes adjacent to key landforms should exhibit limited gradients: Areas between
              key feature (highest elevation of hilltops, ridges, lowest elevation of valleys) and
              edge of development (graded pad, fence, roadway, utilities, structures, etc.) –
              finished appearance of engineered slopes to be compatible with pre-development
              appearance of natural features. This requirement is typically achieved by ensuring
              that engineered slopes achieve an average gradient of no more than 4 to 1; maximum
              gradient 3 to 1; with a minimum gradient the same as natural slope (See Figure 10-3)
          •   All other developed areas, where proposed engineered slopes do not occur within
              sensitive resource areas and/or adjacent to sensitive hilltops, ridgelines or valleys,
              the alignment of the engineered slopes does not need to follow the character and
              alignment of the existing natural contours. Vegetation, drainage, erosion and
              maintenance issues will be considered where slopes in excess of 3:1 are proposed.
4. View Preservation
          •   View sheds to be identified by the environmental/visual constraints map (RCM-7):
          •   From existing developed neighborhoods
          •   From proposed new neighborhoods
          •   From public streets and major arterials
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        10-52               Resource Conservation & Management
July 18, 2002

View shed analysis and preservation: Views to and from the key features identified by Fig 10-2
will be identified as follows: From existing public roadways, public facilities, neighborhoods to
the key landforms (hilltops, ridges, valleys); from identified hilltops and ridges to the river,
distant hills and rural areas, bridge and other local landmarks. A view shed analysis,
determining critical views (sight lines) to be protected or preserved will be conducted as part of
the development review process. Lot configurations, building placement, landscaping and
private fence lines should respect the identified view sheds and allow views of the hilltop,
ridgeline or valley within the identified view shed. Views out over countryside from higher
points in neighborhoods and from identified hilltops and ridgelines should remain
unobstructed over structures and improvements.
5. The City will require the submittal of vegetation protection and restoration plans as part of
     the development review process.
6. Natural gas well reserve sites should be developed as usable open space or neighborhood
     visual amenities. Opportunities for the development of natural gas well sites as park
     facilities are discussed in the Open Space & Recreation element.
RCM-18             LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will adopt and implement a landscape ordinance, which will establish standards for
water-conserving landscaping in order to reduce water use in developed areas. Requirements
will specify the use of trees and other vegetation in new development in order to preserve and
enhance the natural habitat. This ordinance will be applied in the design and development of
private and public development projects, and will be consistent with the provisions of the Open
Space & Recreation element.
RCM-19             GRADING AND EROSION CONTROL ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
Through the Public Works and Community Development Departments, the City will establish a
Grading and Erosion Control Ordinance that includes specific standards for project
construction and erosion control. This ordinance will address prompt revegetation of disturbed
areas, avoidance of grading activities during wet weather, avoidance of drainage corridors and
SLRAs, and other erosion control measures.
RCM-20             FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAPS
                   (Existing)
The City will continue its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, including
adoption and administration of updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
model ordinances and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs).

July 18, 2002
RCM-21             COUNTYWIDE BICYCLE PLAN
                   (Proposed)
To reduce consumption of non-renewable energy sources and improve air quality, the City will
integrate its Trails and Pathways Map (Figure 8-6 in the Circulation & Mobility element) with the
Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan (author, year [[need rest of citation info for references section]]), in
order to further encourage alternative modes of transportation. The Trails and Pathways Map
will incorporate bikeway and pedestrian linkages throughout the City, including connections
through and between neighborhoods and the open space network. (Also see Implementing Action
CM-13 in the Circulation & Mobility element.)
RCM-22             PUBLIC SERVICES MONITORING REPORT
                   (Proposed)
The Community Development Department will coordinate preparation of a biennial public
services monitoring report for presentation to the City Council. This report will document
growth trends, the capacity and level of service for public services, and facility planning efforts.
The report will include a resource inventory for use in reevaluating current goals and policies
related to water and energy use and conservation.
RCM-23             TITLE 24 OF THE UNIFORM BUILDING CODE
                   (Existing)
Through the Building Department, the City will continue to enforce Title 24 energy
requirements. These requirements are part of the Uniform Building Code, which defines
construction standards to promote energy conservation.
RCM-24             SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING PLAN
                    (Existing)
In accordance with the California Integrated Waste Management Act, Rio Vista has adopted
Solano County’s Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan that contains a Source Reduction
and Recycling Element. The Plan provides for specific steps that will be taken by local
agencies—acting independently and in concert—to meet the countywide diversion objectives
for waste through source reduction. Rio Vista will work with the County and the six other
incorporated jurisdictions to encourage a transition to reducing waste (and the toxicity of waste)
through the following measures:
          •   Educating the community regarding product reuse, reduction of material volume,
              increased product lifetime, and decreased consumption.
          •   Encouraging residents, businesses, and institutions to engage in recycling and
              composting programs.
          •   Setting an example within City government operations for resource conservation
              and less wasteful behavior.

July 18, 2002

This will be accomplished in part by the City’s cooperation with the County and other cities to
develop new source-reduction programs through pilot programs and to establish a Recycling
Market Development Zone that can attract industries that use recovered materials. Other
source-reduction options for the City include continued use of its recycling facility at the
Corporation Yard for community recycling, and the diversion program currently in operation at
the Rio Vista High School Recycling Center.
RCM-25             SIGN ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will review and amend the Sign Ordinance to include a section that addresses
placement of historical signage, markers, or kiosks on or near historical structures and sites in
the City. The Sign Ordinance will be amended to add design guidelines for this informational
signage.
RCM-26             PRESERVATION ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will adopt a Preservation Ordinance as part of its Municipal Code update to be the
primary implementing mechanism for preservation of historic structures and sites. The
ordinance will establish criteria for the review of new development, alterations, and
rehabilitation and remodel projects that involve structures that are 50 or more years old.
RCM-27             OFFICIAL REGISTER
                   (Proposed)
The City will work with the Rio Vista Museum Board and interested community members to
encourage owners of historic structures to pursue eligibility for listing of their properties in the
National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources. As
appropriate and to the extent feasible, the City will assist historic property owners with the
process.
RCM-28             LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL FUNDS
                   (Existing)
The City will target qualifying structures for programs that provide financing toward the
preservation of these historic properties. Resources include federal historic rehabilitation tax
credits and the Transportation Equity Act (TEA) enhancements program.
The California Mills Act (Government Code Section 50280, et seq.) is a state program that
permits local governments to provide for a reduction in property taxes on a historic property
when certain conditions are met. Owners of designated historic properties must enter into a
preservation contract directly with the local government. Under this legal contract, the owners
agree to restore the property, if necessary, to maintain its historic character, and use it in a
manner compatible with its historic character. A reduction in property tax is given for 10 years,
and the contract renews automatically every year until either party notifies the other to
terminate the contract.

Chapter 11 Safety & Noise
A.        Introduction
SAFETY
The residents of Rio Vista rely on the City for many of their safety needs, such as fire protection
and crime prevention. They count on the City to plan for, and protect them from, natural
hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, and other potentially dangerous situations. The Safety
element addresses safety concerns of the community and sets forth the goals and policies
essential for their resolution. The Safety element is comprised of the following components:
          •   Seismic and Geologic Hazards includes goals and policies to protect the City’s
              residents from danger associated with active faults, liquefaction, and ground failure
              (landslides). While the potential for seismic and geologic hazard occurrences in Rio
              Vista is not high, the soil and geologic characteristics of the City continue to play an
              important role in determining safety procedures.
          •   Flood Control dictates, in large part, the need for development standards along the
              Sacramento River and principal drainageways that will provide adequate flood
              protection to life and property.
          •   Natural Gas Wells discusses the integration of natural gas well operations with
              future residential development. This element establishes policies and implementing
              actions that enable natural gas wells to operate while minimizing noise and safety
              hazards for residents in close proximity to the well sites.
          •   Police Services addresses protection of persons and property within the City by
              application of the crime prevention unit, department training program, and street
              patrols. The police department is also one of the first responders to 911 police
              emergency dispatch calls.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                       11-1                                    Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

          •   Fire Protection includes goals and policies to prevent and protect against
              catastrophic fires, and to minimize the loss of life and damage to property and the
              environment. The fire department is also one of the first responders to 911 fire and
              medical emergency dispatch calls.
          •   Hazardous Materials addresses the need for the safe and efficient handling of
              hazardous materials and implementation of programs that will comply with State
              law.
          •   Emergency Services discusses the extent of emergency medical services available to
              City residents, and provides policies and programs that will ensure continued
              effectiveness of this essential service.
          •   Health Services includes the existing status of health services in the City of Rio Vista
              and provides policies that help to ensure that health service needs are met.
          •   Odors addresses the existence and control of nuisance odors, particularly those due
              to odorizing of natural gas and agricultural operations. The policies and
              implementing actions directed at controlling odors will work in conjunction with the
              actions of private enterprises involved in odor-producing operations.
          •   Highway 12 is included as an issue area in this element due to the noise and safety
              concerns that are present along this principal roadway through the City. The
              policies and implementing actions that address pedestrian/bicyclist safety along
              Highway 12 are consistent with those in the Circulation & Mobility element.
          •   Rio Vista Airport reinforces the intent of the Solano County Airport Land Use
              Commission’s Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUP) (Solano County Airport
              Land Use Commission, 1988) to ensure protection of the public’s health, safety and
              welfare, particularly noise and safety hazards associated with airport operations.
              The airport policies contained in this element are consistent with the ALUP and the
              Circulation & Mobility element of this General Plan.
NOISE
The basic objectives of the Noise element of the General Plan include:
          •   Ensuring that site design requirements for residential development are adequate to
              protect residents from sound levels that exceed the specified residential standards.
          •   Protecting sensitive land uses, such as schools, hospitals, and libraries, from sound
              levels in excess of residential sound levels.
          •   Designing streets to reduce, wherever feasible, excessive noise from such roadways.
          •   Restricting truck traffic in residential areas except for deliveries within the area or on
              designated truck routes. To the extent possible, truck usage in residential areas
              should be limited to daylight hours.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        11-2                                     Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

          •   Providing sound protection, to the extent possible, along transportation routes in
              accordance with the adjacent uses of land.
          •   Providing sound protection, to the extent possible, from aircraft ingressing and
              egressing the City airport.
The Noise component of the Safety & Noise element outlines policies and implementing actions
to protect Rio Vista residents from excessive noise levels that are annoying to the senses and
detrimental to public health. The Noise element addresses the following subjects:
          •   Transportation and airport noise
          •   Industrial noise
          •   Natural gas wells
          •   Construction noise
          •   Noise along Highway 12
The element establishes acceptable noise level criteria for land uses affected by either fixed or
transportation-related noise sources. Noise and land use compatibility criteria are designed to
provide an acceptable community noise environment and to minimize noise-related complaints
from residents. The compatibility criteria should be used in conjunction with future noise
exposure levels in order to identify projects or activities that may require special treatment to
minimize noise exposure.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-3                                  Safety & Noise

B.        Purpose and Authority
SAFETY
Since 1975, State law has required that a safety element be included as part of all general plans.
In 1984, the legislature consolidated the safety and seismic elements into one element that
includes seismic safety, geologic hazards, fire safety, and flooding. As with all elements,
additional safety issues of particular importance to the community also may be included.
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act of 1972. This Act addresses areas identified by the
State Geologist as likely to experience earthquakes. The Alquist-Priolo Act focuses on surface
fault rupture and not shaking. It addresses earthquake safety in building permits and
subdivision procedures by requiring project applicants to submit a registered geologist’s report
describing potential for onsite surface rupture. Rio Vista is not included within any special
study area and, consequently, not subject to these requirements.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act. This Act provides for a statewide seismic hazard mapping and
technical advisory program. This program assists cities and counties in fulfilling their
responsibilities for protecting the public health and safety from the effects of strong ground
shaking, liquefaction, landslides, or other ground failure and other seismic hazards caused by
earthquakes.
Pursuant to this Act, maps and accompanying information are to be made available to local
governments for planning and development purposes. The Division of Mines and Geology, in
implementing the Act, to the extent possible, is to coordinate its activities with, and use existing
information generated from, the earthquake fault zones mapping program, the landslide hazard
identification program, and the inundation maps prepared pursuant to Section 8589.5 of the
Government Code.
Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code. This chapter requires all businesses to
report the quantity and locations of hazardous materials to the regulatory authority on an
annual basis if the business stores (1) above 55 gallons of a liquid or 500 pounds of a solid
hazardous material, (2) above 200 cubic feet of a compressed gas, or (3) a radioactive material
that is handled in quantities for which an emergency plan is required. This plan is referred to as
the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) and includes a Consolidated Contingency Plan
or Emergency Response Plan. The regulatory authority (the Certified Unified Program Agency)
in Solano County is the Solano County Department of Environmental Management. All
hazardous materials sites generally are inspected annually by Solano County.
Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This code, as well as the State Aboveground
Petroleum Storage Act, requires facilities or sites that store more than 660 gallons in a single
container or 1,320 gallons in aggregate of oil to prepare a Spill Prevention, Control, and
Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan. The SPCC Plan contains much of the same information as the
Contingency Plan described above for hazardous materials but is more detailed in the
description of spill response and prevention measures.

NOISE
State Department of Health Services Office of Noise Control. This department establishes the
State Guidelines for acceptable noise standards. The agency’s Model Community Noise Control
Ordinance contains recommended noise standards for cities and counties to use as guidelines in
the development of their noise performance standards. Particular attention has been paid to the
State’s exterior noise limits for rural land uses, which sets a maximum recommended level of
40–50 decibels (dB). (A decibel measurement adjusted to account for the decibel scale used to
measure noise.) This recommendation has served as the basis for Rio Vista’s proposed adoption
of a 45-dBA (a weighted decibel measurement) noise performance standard at the residential
property line for those properties in proximity to natural gas well production.
State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Noise Element Guidelines. In accordance with
Government Code Section 65302, the OPR Guidelines require that general plans identify and
quantify major noise sources by preparing generalized noise contours for current and projected
conditions. Significant noise sources include traffic on major roadways and highways, railroad
operations, airports, and representative industrial activities and fixed noise sources.
The Guidelines include recommended exterior and interior noise level standards for local
jurisdictions to identify and prevent the creation of incompatible land uses due to noise. The
OPR Guidelines contain a land use compatibility table that describes the compatibility of
different land uses with a range of environmental noise levels in terms of Ldn (a day-night
average sound level). A noise environment of 60 dB Ldn or less typically is considered
acceptable for residential uses according to those guidelines.
California Administrative Code (California Noise Insulation Standards, Title 25, Chapter 1)
This code enforces the State’s noise guidelines for single-family attached units, apartments,
hotels, and motels but not for single-family detached units. The guidelines recommend a
maximum exterior noise level of 60 dBA (community noise equivalent level [CNEL]) for
residential uses. If multi-family or single-family attached units are proposed in areas of
potential incompatibility or in areas where future noise levels exceed 60 dBA CNEL, they would
be subject to Title 25—which requires a detailed noise analysis with recommended noise
abatement measures, as required.
California Public Utilities Code. Sections 21670 et seq. of the Public Utilities Code authorizes
establishment of an airport land use commission and the formation of a comprehensive airport
land use plan that will “protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring the orderly
expansion of airports and the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public’s
exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards within areas around public airports to the extent
that these areas are not already devoted to incompatible uses.” The Rio Vista General Plan and
specific plans must be consistent with the ALUP, or the governing body of the local jurisdiction
must take specific steps to override the commission’s recommendations.

     C.       The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
The Rio Vista principles that reflect the community’s vision in the Safety & Noise element are
listed below.
PRESERVE RIO VISTA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL-TOWN CHARACTER
     Rio Vista should still be recognizable to today’s residents 30 years from now. New development
     should reinforce the characteristics that make Rio Vista unique. Existing neighborhoods should be
     examined and strengthened.
     Farmland and nature are important elements of the community. A clear edge between urban
     development and agriculture should be maintained.
     The Sacramento River and related natural areas should be showcased and enhanced. These resources
     should be recognized as vital and essential to the community.

SAFETY
          SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The City of Rio Vista and the planning area are generally located in a seismically active region.
Although there has been no historical record of damage to Rio Vista from earthquakes,
groundshaking has been reported on several occasions. On May 19, 1889, the Antioch-
Collinsville earthquake induced groundshaking in Rio Vista. Similarly, in 1892, an earthquake
centered in the Vacaville-Winters area was felt in Rio Vista. This seismic event produced
groundshaking at intensity VI on the Modified Mercalli Scale. This level (VI) of groundshaking
also was generated in the planning area by an earthquake on August 12, 1906. Earthquakes that
shook Contra Costa, Alameda, San Joaquin, and Santa Clara Counties on October 22 and 23,
1916, also were reported in Rio Vista.
          REGIONAL FAULTING
The Delta region is subject to seismic risk because of its proximity to the San Andreas Fault
system. This fault system includes the San Andreas, Hayward, Calaveras, Rogers Creek,
Antioch, Green Valley-Concord, and Greenville Faults. All of these faults have been active
historically. There are several faults along the eastern, southern, and western bounds of the
Montezuma Hills in which Rio Vista is situated (Herd and Helley, Brown, 1970; Schlocker, 1971;
Jennings, 1973). These faults include the Rio Vista, the Midland, and the Antioch. The fault
locations are shown in Figure 11-1.
The presence of the Rio Vista Fault is inferred on the basis of stratigraphic and physical
evidence. The stratigraphic evidence was derived from bore holes drilled by the U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation (Gilbert and Associates, 1975). The physical evidence for the fault is a straight,
steep 2.5-mile-long scarp in the Montezuma Foundation. Jennings (1973) classified the Rio Vista
Fault as one that has undergone Quaternary displacement during the past 2 million years.
Although the fault has displayed no movement within the historic past (last 200 years), an
earthquake epicenter was located on this fault (Jones and Stokes Associates, 1974). There has
been no recent evidence of surface faulting or tectonic creep along the Rio Vista Fault.
The Antioch Fault is located approximately 8 miles southwest of the planning area. This
Quaternary fault presently is undergoing right lateral, strike-slip tectonic creep in the vicinity of
Antioch (Gilbert and Associates, 1975). Strike-slip tectonic creep denotes slow, constant
horizontal movement along a vertical fault. The Antioch Fault has produced numerous
earthquakes during historic times; these earthquakes have caused groundshaking in the Rio
Vista planning area.
The Midland Fault zone extends north to south, approximately 1 mile west of the planning area.
The presence of this fault zone is based almost entirely on subsurface data (Gilbert and
Associates, 1975). The Midland Fault zone originally was thought to be the source of the 1892
earthquake; however, data obtained from subsurface investigations indicate that this is
probably not the case.

          SEISMIC HAZARDS
Rio Vista lies near several well-defined and active faults that are capable of producing
earthquakes of different magnitudes, all with engineering significance. The Antioch Fault is
believed capable of producing a maximum credible earthquake and maximum possible
earthquake with Richter magnitudes of 5.75 and 6.5, respectively (Jensen-Van Lienden
Associates, 1991). While the Midland Fault also is considered a potentially active fault, the Rio
Vista Fault is suspected to be inactive.
          SUBSURFACE HAZARDS
The planning area extends through urbanized portions of Rio Vista into agricultural lands and
waterways. Electrical power transmission lines and buried natural gas pipelines are located
throughout the area, and exploratory wells are continually being drilled throughout the Delta.
Rio Vista, as part of the larger Delta region, serves as a significant source of natural gas and
underground gas storage areas.
PG&E (Pacific Gas & Electric), Calpine Natural Gas Company, and other independent oil and
natural gas companies operate gas transmission lines throughout the planning area. One line is
located near the western border of the Montezuma Hills; another line is located approximately
1.5 miles west of Liberty Island Road and roughly parallels the road. These two transmission
lines intersect approximately 0.5 mile north of Highway 12.

          FLOOD CONTROL
Rio Vista is situated on the west bank of the Sacramento River, which drains the northern half
of the Central Valley. No other major bodies of water are located within the planning area. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has mapped the 100-year floodplain for the
City of Rio Vista, determining the limits of inundation and depth of flow for floods of a 100-year
storm. As shown in Figure 11-2, most land in the city limits lies outside the 100-year flood
hazard area and is partially protected by levees along the north side of the City (Note: the Flood
Insurance Rate Map is discussed in greater detail later in this section).
          EFFECTS OF FLOODING
Flooding can cause widespread damage to affected areas. Buildings and vehicles can be
damaged or destroyed, while smaller objects can be buried in flood-deposited sediments.
Floods also can cause drowning or isolation of people and animals. Floodwaters can break
utility lines, interrupting services and potentially affecting health and safety, particularly in the
case of broken sewer or gas lines.
The secondary effects of flooding are due to standing water, which can result in crop damage,
septic tank failure, and water well contamination. Standing water also can damage roads,
foundations, and electrical circuits.
          DRAINAGE PATTERNS
Runoff in the Rio Vista planning area collects along intermittent, normally dry stream courses
that extend in a northeasterly direction from the Montezuma Hills. In the immediate vicinity of
Rio Vista, Industrial Creek provides natural drainage for the northern portion of the City. The
City’s storm drains collect stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces throughout the City.
The storm flows from both natural watercourses and the City’s system discharge into the
Sacramento River.
          HISTORY OF FLOODING
The Sacramento River is the principal watercourse in the planning area. The City of Rio Vista
has been subject to flooding along the Sacramento River on numerous occasions in the past.
The first recorded incident of flooding in the area occurred in 1862; the floodwaters swept away
the town. Subsequently, the town was relocated onto higher ground at the edge of the
Montezuma Hills. During the major floods of 1940 and 1942, the river height reached over 16
feet above mean sea level (msl). The construction of major flood control facilities and water
diversion projects within the upper Sacramento River basin has since moderated the high river
flows and mitigated flooding in Rio Vista. Flood control facilities in the planning area include
dikes, levees, and designated floodways. Industrial Creek drains into a floodway that crosses
the northern part of the City, providing flood protection for residences in this area.

          FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP
The effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the City of Rio Vista is dated August 4, 1987.
On October 9, 1996, FEMA issued a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) (Case No. 96-09-1067P) for
the City. An LOMR issued to the Chief Executive Officer of the community has the effect of
revising the FIRM without physically revising and reprinting the affected FIRM panel(s).
The 100-year floodplain boundary, as shown in Figure 11-2, indicates the maximum extent of
flooding during a storm with a 1 percent probability of occurrence in any given year. A 100-year
flood would inundate portions of the riverfront, the floodway between Industrial Creek, and
the Los Ulpinos area. Flooding south of the City would occur along Marina Creek and its
tributaries. Flooding also occurs north of Rio Vista near Church Road and Highway 12, where
agricultural activities have interfered with natural drainage (Solano County, 1979).
For Rio Vista, the “project design floodplain” is approximately 13 feet (U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers datum) or 10 feet above msl, fluctuating between 9 and 11 feet (Nolan, 1981). The
design flood elevation is equal to or slightly higher than the 100-year floodplain elevation. At
this level, water depths would average 4–5 feet within the floodplain zone.
          LOCAL FLOODING CONCERNS
Inadequately sized culverts and bridges can impede the passage of high-water flow in local
drainageways. Undersized infrastructure typically results in short-term backups behind the
culvert or bridge, with pooling water in such areas, creating an unintended detention basin.
The primary area of concern in Rio Vista is the Edgewater Drive neighborhood that fronts on
the Sacramento River. Most property owners have constructed retaining walls along the rear of
their homes facing the river, alleviating much of the flood concerns there. During heavy rainfall,
large volumes of water will backflow from the Delta Marina, just south of Edgewater Drive,
requiring sandbags to be placed at the south end of the cul-de-sac on Edgewater Drive.
While the Sacramento River is the primary source of flooding, other areas in the City are subject
to flooding due to inadequate drainage during heavy storms. One of these areas is Church Road
at Airport Road. This roadway intersection often is flooded during periods of moderate to
heavy rainfall, with water overtopping the roadway up to several inches. Much of the problem
can be attributed to undersized culverts that are not properly aligned with the drainage ditches;
this allows stormwater flows to bottleneck and flood the intersection.
St. Francis Way at Rolling Green Drive is another area of the City that experiences periodic
flooding. During heavy rains every 5–10 years, the area along Industrial Creek, which runs
between the City Corporation Yard and Egbert Field, accumulates up to 5 inches of stormwater.
Presently, there is no corridor wide enough to run drainage pipe with sufficient capacity to
carry away the water.
The City has installed flap gates on storm drains along Main Street and Front Street at Logan
Street. These flap gates keep the Sacramento River from backing up during high-water periods
into the storm drains at City Hall, Dry Vac, and the old corporation yard.

July18, 2002

          NATURAL GAS WELLS
The natural gas field surrounding Rio Vista is one of the largest and oldest in California. Due to
the deregulation of natural gas prices and the new emphasis placed by PG&E on acquiring gas
supplies within California, there has been increased activity in Rio Vista. This activity has been
further stimulated during this year as a result of energy shortages and the inability of
production facilities to meet consumer demand. Natural gas activities in the vicinity of Rio
Vista include drilling and construction of new wells, and gas well production and transport. It
is not uncommon for a gas well to have a production life of up to 50 years.
          POLICE SERVICES
The Rio Vista Police Department presently consists of one police chief, one lieutenant, two
sergeants, one detective, seven patrol officers, one administrative assistant, and one community
service officer. The police force operates four marked cars and three unmarked cars. Generally,
the police force patrols on a 7-day per week, 24-hour per day basis. Police calls are prioritized,
and emergency calls are dispatched first. Officers are on patrol for 12-hour shifts from either
6 a.m. to 6.p.m. or from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Shifts are designed to be covered so that at least two
patrol officers are available during the day and night. Since the jail is located 24 miles away in
Fairfield, it is essential that an officer remain available in the City to respond to calls. If Rio Vista
police officers are on an emergency call and/or transporting to Fairfield when another call
comes in, the department may request mutual aid, per its agreements with the Isleton Police
Department, Solano County Sheriff’s Department, and California Highway Patrol (CHP). The
response time may vary, depending on the agency responding, but emergency calls remain the
highest priority.
The Police Department currently is housed at City Hall. With a facility space of 1,200 square
feet, the available space is undersized to meet the current needs. The department plans to
relocate to a larger facility, as discussed in the “Outlook” section of this chapter.
          911 SYSTEM
The Rio Vista Police Department has a contract with Contra Costa County for police
dispatching of its 911 calls. If the 911 call is police-related, Contra Costa County dispatch will
relay the call directly to the City police. This differs from fire- and medical-related 911 calls that
are transferred from the Contra Costa County dispatch to Solano County through a “one-
button” transfer service for dispatching. The 911 system has been very reliable throughout the
history of the program and has been down only once in the last 7-8 years—the breakdown was
caused by a local utility company’s temporarily canceling all of its telephone lines in Rio Vista
and in the surrounding community. (Note: Dispatching of 911 calls from cell phones or highway call
boxes are received by the CHP and are handled independently of the City’s contract with Contra Costa
County. The response times to these calls are considerably slower; however, efforts are being made to
improve service in this area.) The City has just obtained a local number to be made available to
local residents for 24-hour non-emergency police department calls; these calls are relayed
immediately to the Contra Costa County dispatcher.

          FIRE PROTECTION
The City of Rio Vista Fire Department provides fire protection services within the City. The
Delta Fire Protection District contracts for service with the City for portions of south
Sacramento County—the boundaries are Vieira’s Resort to the north, Jackson Slough Road to
the east, and south to the Antioch Bridge. The firehouse for both fire departments is located at
350 Main Street in downtown Rio Vista.
The City serves as lead agency for managing the two fire departments. Three paid personnel
staff the fire station—one captain, one paramedic/firefighter, and one administrative assistant;
part-time paramedics and apparatus operators work 12-hour shifts with varying schedules
throughout the week. The department relies largely on volunteers for fire fighting and
emergency response. The department also provides Advanced Life Support (ALS) paramedic
services from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. Dispatching for the fire department is provided on a 24-hour
per day basis by Solano County Sheriff’s Department (via the Contra Costa County central
dispatch).
The Rio Vista Fire Department owns 10 pieces of equipment: one water tender, one rescue
squad, one wildland interface Type 2, one 50-foot telesquirt, two 1,250 gallon-per-minute (gpm)
engines, two 4x4 power wagon grass units, and two command vehicles. The department also
has access to the Office of Emergency Services (OES) through the Delta Fire Protection District.
The Insurance Service Office (ISO), a national rating service sponsored by fire insurance
carriers, ranks fire districts’ firefighting capability to reduced structural fire losses on a scale of
1-10, with 1 being the best. The present ISO Insurance rating of the Rio Vista Fire Department is
4. This rating was given in 1993, and many of the deficiencies noted at the time of the last rating
have been corrected.
          HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials are defined as those that are a potential threat to human health and that
could cause serious illness, injury, or death. Household products, agricultural pesticides,
asbestos, and transported hazardous materials (e.g., liquid and gas chemicals) are a few
examples of hazardous materials.
          HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS
The most common hazardous materials are those found or used in the home. Waste oil is a
common hazardous matter that is often improperly disposed of and can contaminate surface
water through runoff. Other household hazardous wastes (paint, pesticides, cleaning products,
and other chemicals) are common and often improperly stored in garages and homes. Because
of their widespread use in households throughout the community, these products constitute the
most common health hazard to Rio Vista residents.
          AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES
In and around the City of Rio Vista are large tracts of agricultural land. Crops commonly are
sprayed with pesticides that can contaminate the soils. Potential contaminants include DDT,
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      11-14                                    Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

lead, and arsenic. In such areas, it is prudent to conduct soils testing, with soil clean-up steps
taken if necessary, before allowing intensive development to occur.
          ASBESTOS
Asbestos is a crumbly material often found in older buildings that typically is used as insulation
in walls and ceilings. Asbestos commonly was used in the past as an insulating material
because it had the desirable characteristic of being fire resistant. However, it can pose a health
risk when very small particles become airborne. These dust-like particles can easily be inhaled,
where their microscopically sharp structures can puncture tiny air sacs in the lungs, resulting in
long-term health problems. Many old structures in Rio Vista potentially contain asbestos. Pre-
1979 construction often included asbestos and it should be assumed that the demolition of older
structures in the City may present this hazard. Proper asbestos abatement and disposal
procedures should be undertaken during the demolition of old buildings.
          LEAD-BASED PAINT
Paint in many houses and apartments built before 1978 contains lead—it is commonly referred
to as lead-based paint. The lead from paint, paint chips, and dust can pose serious health
hazards if not taken care of properly. People can breathe or ingest lead through exposure to
objects covered with lead dust, contaminated garden soil, or paint chips. Since babies and
young children often put their hands and other objects in their mouths, and since children’s
brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead, this substance is
more dangerous to children than to adults.
Lead-based paint that is in good condition is usually not a hazard. Peeling, chipping, chalking,
or cracking lead-based paint is a hazard that needs immediate attention. Common areas to
check for these conditions are windows and window sills; doors and door frames; stairs,
railings, and banisters; and porches and fences. Exposure to lead dust often occurs through
improper removal and disposal of lead-based paint in the home—lead dust can form when
lead-based paint is dry-scraped, dry-sanded, or heated. Lead in soil also can be a hazard when
children play in bare soil or when soil is transported into the house on people’s shoes.
The City of Rio Vista’s Building Department provides informational brochures to the public in
an effort to inform residents about the hazards of lead-based paint and measures that can be
taken to help limit or prevent human exposure to lead dust. The City’s building inspector is
available to advise the public about proper abatement and disposal procedures during the
demolition or renovation of old buildings.
          INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
More than 60,000 chemicals are produced in the United States. Over 11,000 of these chemicals
are used for commercial purposes. In the City of Rio Vista, various manufacturing, industrial,
and service industries use or store hazardous materials, including pesticides, acids, solvents,
caustics, plastics, and heavy metals.
As discussed under “Purpose and Authority,” Chapter 6.95, Section 25503 of the California
Health and Safety Code, specifies the thresholds that require businesses to report the quantity
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    11-15                                  Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

and locations of hazardous materials to the regulatory authority on an annual basis. In Rio
Vista, businesses are required to submit their HMBPs to the Solano County Department of
Environmental Management. A plan must be submitted for each site that stores above the
threshold quantities of a hazardous material or any amount of hazardous waste. The HMBP
includes an inventory of hazardous materials stored at a facility, with specific physical and
chemical descriptions of each material. The HMBP is required to be reviewed annually and
updated if there are any material changes that affect the quantity or location of hazardous
materials. The HMBP also includes a Consolidated Contingency Plan or Emergency Response
Plan, which describes the emergency response procedures to be taken in case of a hazardous
material spill or fire. The Plan provides facility identification information, emergency contacts
and response procedures to be taken in the event of a hazardous material emergency.
Emergency equipment capabilities, emergency services, and employee training also are outlined
in the Plan.
          TRUCK TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Trucks traveling through Rio Vista commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including
gasoline and various crude oil derivatives, and other chemicals known to cause human health
problems. When properly contained, these materials present no hazard to the community. In
the event of an accident or spill, these materials may be released, either in liquid or gas form. In
the case of some chemicals, such as chlorine, highly toxic fumes may be carried through the air
a significant distance from the site of their release. Although standard accident and hazardous
materials recovery procedures are enforced by the State and adhered to by private
transportation companies, the City is at moderate risk because of the volume of truck traffic
along the Highway 12 corridor.
          ODORS
Three principal sources of odors can, depending on weather conditions, produce an
aesthetically adverse effect on the environment in Rio Vista. The first, and perhaps most
prevalent, source of odors is the fertilizer spread on grain fields in the Montezuma Hills right at
the edge of the City limits—particularly the application of bio solid fertilizers on the marginal
soils of the grasslands and rangelands in the agricultural area surrounding Rio Vista. During
hot weather and a west wind, the odors travel into the City and can remain in the air for several
days. Although this spreading has been in practice for about 7 years, this summer was the first
time in about 5 years that the spreading occurred upwind of residential areas in Rio Vista.
These bio solids come from waste management plants in the area. They pose no greater hazard
than other natural fertilizers such as manure; each is made up of purely organic materials.
The second source of odor is the PG&E odorizer station on Montezuma Hills Road. The station
adds mercaptan to the natural gas as an odorizer, which can be detected in the event of a gas
leakage Since natural gas is virtually odorless, the addition of mercaptan is necessary to enable
humans to detect the smell of natural gas in the air.
The third source, with the fewest incidents of odors, is the wastewater treatment plant. Except
when sludge is being transferred to the Dry Vac unit, the treatment plant is largely odor free.
The sludge is cooked under high temperature in the Dry Vac unit, which results in a Class “A”
sludge that is virtually odor free.

July18, 2002

          EMERGENCY SERVICES
There are three tiers of emergency response in Rio Vista. The Rio Vista Fire Department,
through an agreement with Solano County Emergency Medical Services (EMS), assumes the
first response to all medical emergency calls in the City. At the same time, emergency medical
technicians (EMTs) are put on all the fire department’s trucks. Through the Joint Powers
Authority (JPA) with other cities of Solano County and Solano County Emergency Management
Services (EMS), there is an ambulance contract with Medic Ambulance Service. The ambulance
contract acknowledges the Delta Fire Protection’s responsibility to the Antioch Bridge.
          HEALTH SERVICES
Rio Vista’s role in health services issues is somewhat limited. The City is not directly involved
with the establishment or management of any health care facilities. Nevertheless, Rio Vista is a
growing community with an ever-increasing need for health services that is recognized by the
City in its planning efforts.
The City’s geographic isolation has made it difficult to establish the wide range of medical
services needed to serve the community. This is of serious concern to the City, given the special
health care needs of children, teens, seniors and low-income households in Rio Vista.
There are no emergency medical clinics in Rio Vista and the City is without assisted living or
skilled nursing facilities. Given the substantial increase in the senior population, as a result of
the Trilogy development, this absence of senior health care facilities has become increasingly
problematic. The lack of prenatal care, mental health services, and a public health clinic also
leaves a wide gap in medical services for a large portion of the City’s population. This absence
of health care facilities and services requires that residents travel long distances to communities
such as Fairfield, Antioch, Vallejo, Lodi, and Sacramento to received medical services.
One sole practitioner who has been providing medical care in the City for 40 years may not be
able to serve much longer. North Bay Hospital contracts with a doctor’s group in Fairfield to
provide a doctor’s services in Rio Vista. This doctor may not be present in Rio Vista for the
long-term either.
A range of health care and social services are presently met by non-profit organizations in the
community. As the need continues to increase for services offered by these organizations, they
are routinely faced with shortages in facility space, funding or both. The principal non-profit
health and social service providers in the community include Rio Vista CARE, Community
Action Center (CAC), and Yes to Kids.
          RIO VISTA CARE
Rio Vista CARE, with a part-time staff of three (soon to add a fourth), provides drug, alcohol,
and family counseling to Rio Vista residents of all income and age groups. At this time, the
waiting list for counseling ranges from teens to seniors. During the school year, 80 percent of
the agency’s clients are school-age children. All four schools have waiting lists for counseling
services—three schools in Rio Vista and one in Isleton. The agency receives some referrals
through the Rio Vista Police Department Diversion Program. Rio Vista CARE receives its

funding from a variety of local, state, and federal sources. Private donations (e.g., service clubs,
businesses, school districts, volunteers) constitute a significant portion of their funding.
          COMMUNITY ACTION CENTER
Community Action Center (CAC) provides food, clothing, and emergency shelter to those in
need around the City. The center is staffed by an executive director (the only paid staff), a
CalWorks receptionist, volunteer teens, and one homeless family. CAC services include a
senior brownbag lunch program that serves 35 seniors monthly; the USDA Commodities (food)
Program that serves 75 people every month; the Emergency Food Closet that provides food to
as many as 60 homeless persons per month. Once every 3 months, individuals receive 1 week’s
supply of food. In addition, the CAC provides resource information, homeless emergency
shelters, and its Season of Caring Program (rental assistance).
          YES TO KIDS
The Yes To Kids before- and after-school program currently operates under a joint agreement
between the River Delta Unified School District and Rio Vista CARE. This program is modeled
after similar successful programs in the Solano County communities of Fairfield and Vacaville.
Yes To Kids provides a safe before- and after-school environment for children to do homework,
and have social interaction. Funding for this program is limited and, since the need is
continuing to increase, program operators are continually looking for additional means of
funding for program expansion.
          HIGHWAY 12
State Route 12 (commonly referred to as Highway 12) is a high-speed, two-lane roadway that
bisects Rio Vista, running in an east-west direction through the City. Local traffic and regional
traffic on this route has increased as development in Rio Vista and surrounding communities
(Solano County and Sacramento County) has increased. The present safety concern with
Highway 12 is the safe crossing of bicyclists and pedestrians, which is addressed in the
“Outlook” section of this chapter.
          RIO VISTA AIRPORT
Since the 1950s, Rio Vista has had a municipal airport. The former airport was relocated to a
new facility that opened in 1992. New infrastructure and building sites for businesses recently
have been added; therefore, the facility is both a public asset and an economic development
opportunity, although it has not yet achieved fiscal self-sufficiency.
The Rio Vista Airport is located north of Airport Road and west of Church Road. The facility
has a helipad and two runways, one 4,200 feet and the other 2,200 feet. The 10-year-old facility
recently was upgraded with water, sewer, and additional utility improvements; an improved
12-acre business park; and a new office/administration building. Several “fixed base
operators” (FBOs) are located onsite, including a mechanic. The City operates a fuel concession
at the site, as well as hangars of various sizes for rent. Approximately 50 aircraft are located at
the site. A private company not related to airport operations recently occupied the new office

building and one hangar building. The business park can accommodate up to 100,000 square
feet of building development sites or “pads.” The future Fire Station No. 2 will be located here.
NOISE
In the Rio Vista community, noise is generated by a variety of transportation-related noise
sources as well as fixed sources. Transportation-related sources include Highway 12 traffic,
with a substantial amount of truck traffic, and aircraft activity at the Rio Vista Airport. Office
and commercial uses, industry, agriculture, recreational and public facilities, along with gas
well compressors, are routinely occurring fixed sources of noise in and around the City;
temporary fixed sources include construction and natural gas well drilling.
Stationary noise sources that may be ongoing over a 24-hour period, such as natural gas
pipeline compression, can be measured by standards based on 24-hour weighting. These
standards may not be adequate, however, to address other noise sources, particularly industrial
noise sources, which occur infrequently but at a potentially higher intensity.
Rio Vista’s exterior noise standards for new uses affected by all stationary (non-transportation)
noise sources under the General Plan update range from 45 to 65 dBA Ldn. This range provides
for cases in which a higher standard is needed (e.g., continual generation of ‘white noise’ from
natural gas pipeline compression; and infrequent but relatively high intensity noise). Table 11-3
contains the noise standards for new uses affected by stationary noise sources.
The noise standards used for the General Plan closely follow recommendations made by the
State Department of Health Services’ Office of Noise Control. These noise compatibility
standards are shown in Table 11-1.
The existing noise exposure contours are taken from those adopted by the City in the 1990
Amendments to the 1985 General Plan (Rio Vista, 1991). Since the 65-dBA contour is shown as
an estimated range falling within 100-200 feet from the centerline of Highway 12, and because
local topography, vegetation, or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposure
at a particular location, the noise contours should not be considered exact.
          NOISE & SOUND MEASUREMENT
Sound levels are frequently expressed in units called decibels (dB). When this measure of
sound intensity is adjusted correct for the relative frequency response of the human ear, the
resulting unit is the “A-weighted” decibel (dBA). A-weighting de-emphasizes low frequencies
to better correlate with the response of the human ear to sound (i.e., the human ear is more
sensitive to high frequencies). The zero on the dBA scale is based on the lowest sound level that
the healthy, unimpaired human ear can detect. The dBA scale is a logarithmic rather than a
linear measure of sound intensity; consequently, a 10-dBA sound level increase denotes a factor
of 10 higher in intensity, while a 20-dBA increase denotes a factor of 100. A 1-2 dBA change in
ambient noise levels is generally not audible even to sensitive receptors. The decibel system of
measuring sound provides a simplified relationship between the physical intensity of sound
and its perceived loudness to the human ear.

The physiological effects include sleep intrusion, vasoconstriction (constriction of veins), and
loss of hearing. Sleep intrusion occurs either when noise causes a person to awaken or when
noise causes changes in the depth of sleep. The levels of noise that cause sleep intrusion and the
actual harm produced have not been determined. Vasoconstriction occurs for sound levels over
70 dB; the degree of constriction is proportional to the number of decibels by which the level
exceeds 70. Vasoconstriction presently is considered only potentially dangerous.

Noise affects people psychologically as well as physiologically. The psychological effects
depend on the individual and the characteristics of the sound other than its intensity. People
who work in a high occupational noise climate may be less sensitive to community noise
intrusion. Also, continuous noise has been found to be less annoying than intermittent noise.
The time of day when a sound is emitted is an important factor in determining whether or not it
is considered a nuisance. Sounds that may be barely noticeable at midday may be seriously
disruptive in the middle of the night. A number of measurement scales that attempt to account
for this time factor have been developed. Two of the more commonly used scales of this type
are the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night sound level Ldn. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developed the Ldn measure, a 24-hour average sound
level in which a 10-dBA penalty is added to any sounds occurring between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The CNEL scale, which is used in California Airport Noise
Regulations, is similar except that an additional 5-dBA penalty is added for the evening hours
between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.
          MOBILE AND STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, noise in Rio Vista is generated by a variety of noise
sources. These noise sources can be either mobile whereby the source does not remain in one
location (e.g., motor vehicles and aircraft), or they can be stationary (e.g., industrial and
recreational facilities).
Noise from any of these sources can be an irritant to individuals close to the source. Factors
such as climatic conditions, time of day, and ambient noise often influence the degree to which
noise-sensitive uses, such as residences and schools, are affected. The principal sources of noise
in Rio Vista include:
          •   Highway 12
          •   Rio Vista Airport
          •   Natural gas pipeline compression
          HIGHWAY 12
Local and regional traffic on Highway 12 is considered a principal source of noise that may
affect sensitive noise receptors to a greater or lesser extent, depending upon the time of day.
This mobile noise source generates a 65-dBA contour of approximately 100–200 feet from the
centerline of the roadway according to the Solano County General Plan Noise Contour
estimates, as adopted in the 1990 Amendments to the 1985 Rio Vista General Plan (Rio Vista, 1991).
The existing estimated 65-dBA noise contour is shown in Figure 11-3. This contour range
represents the area in which an average 65-dBA noise level is reached during a normal 24-hour
day. The range has not been adjusted to account for the greater intrusiveness of evening and
nighttime noise.
The 1985 Rio Vista General Plan (Rio Vista, 1977) identified the following measure to reduce or
attenuate noise impacts associated with Highway 12:
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                   11-22                                  Safety & Noise

          •   Development shall be set back from Highway 12 an adequate distance to comply
              with noise standards, or these distances can be reduced if noise attenuation devices
              such as sound walls are proposed.
          •   Development projects shall be reviewed based on criteria shown in the City’s Noise
              Ordinance and shall comply with State and City standards.
          RIO VISTA AIRPORT
Rio Vista Airport can be considered both a mobile and stationary source of noise since it
operates as both a base for aircraft takeoffs and landings, as well as an industrial park. Noise
generated from industrial uses of the site is not significant at this time, however. The principal
source of noise affecting sensitive receptors is associated with aircraft operations.
Aircraft noise affecting the City is produced by operations occurring at the Rio Vista Municipal
Airport. The greatest potential for sound intrusion occurs when aircraft land, take off, or run
up their engines while on the ground. The sounds associated with general aviation propeller
aircraft are produced primarily by the propellers and secondarily from the engine and exhaust.
The most recent noise contours for the Rio Vista Airport were prepared as part of the ALUP
(Solano County Airport Land Use Commission, 1988). The most expansive of these noise
contours was one projected for ultimate buildout, which assumed a 3,060-foot runway and a
fleet activity mix of single-engine (74.9 percent), agricultural (15.0 percent), twin-engine (10.0
percent), and business jets (0.1 percent). The average daily volume was projected to be 329
flights. The ALUP’s 2004 noise contours are illustrated in Figure 11-4. These contours represent
an average of all noise levels expected during a normal 24-hour day, adjusted to an equivalent
level that accounts for the greater intrusiveness of evening and nighttime noise. The adjusted
noise level is referred to as a “community noise equivalent level” (CNEL).
The ALUP contains the following policy language regulating future land uses within this area
to ensure that they are compatible with future noise levels:
          •   The evaluation of airport/land use noise compatibility shall consider the
              future CNEL contours of the airport.
          •   Because of the inherent imprecision in the calculation of noise contours, it is
              not intended that the depicted locations be absolute determinants of the
              compatibility or incompatibility of a given land use.
          •   The maximum CNEL which shall be considered normally acceptable for
              residential areas in the vicinity of the Rio Vista Airport is 60 dBA.
          •   The extent of outdoor activity associated with a particular land use is an
              important factor to be considered in evaluating its compatibility with airport
              noise.

July18, 2002
          •   Single-event noise levels shall also be considered in the evaluation of
              airport/land use noise compatibility. This is particularly important in areas
              which are often overflown by noisy aircraft but which do not have high
              CNELs (e.g., because prevailing winds cause most aircraft departures to go in
              a different direction). The primary concern would be the location of
              residential and other noise-sensitive uses under the straight-in
              approach/departure flight tracks. (Solano County Airport Land Use
              Commission, 1988.)
In developing land uses in the planning area that fall within the airport compatibility zones, a
number of developer-proposed land uses have been modified to reflect compatibility zones and
associated densities. Development projects are reviewed based on the current criteria shown in
the ALUP and must comply with Federal Aviation Authority and City standards.
          NATURAL GAS WELLS
Natural gas wells may be considered a stationary noise source, although most noise associated
with natural gas production is below the performance thresholds established by the City, or it is
of short duration (e.g., well-drilling and extraction). Gas well compressors, which constitute the
principal source of noise associated with natural gas production, are largely localized in their
noise generation. The sound of natural gas pipeline compression produces a type of “white
noise” effect in the surrounding area. Within Rio Vista, there are several operating compressors
and pipelines—one is owned and operated by Calpine Natural Gas California, Inc.; another gas
well/compressor station, located behind Rio Vista High School, is owned by PG&E; other gas
well owners in Rio Vista that may operate using compressors include Castle Minerals, ANA
Production, and others.
The City’s Hydrocarbons Ordinance (Ordinance No. 476 of the Rio Vista Municipal Code) was
established to provide for “the economic recovery of natural gas in a manner compatible with
surrounding land uses and protection of the public health and safety.” This ordinance provides
performance standards to supplement those found in Section 513 of the Zoning Ordinance
(Noise Ordinance) as mitigation for noise generated from natural gas pipeline compression.
Although compressors may not be installed at the time the well begins production, with a single
well producing for a period of up to 50 years, gas well operations may require pipeline
compression at some point during the production life of the well. Therefore, noise mitigation
may not be required on gas well sites until such time as a compressor is required.
The large compressor station owned by PG&E referred to above, is a central station that takes
gas from the feeder lines owned by the gas extraction operators and passes it into PG&E’s main
distribution lines. This facility, located in a large structure, currently generates noise from a
large cooling fan that ventilates the facility, rather than the compressor itself. This facility has
been the subject of noise mitigation requirements for the Vineyard Bluffs subdivision, through
the CEQA document for that project (mitigated negative declaration). PG&E officials co not
expect the facility to remain in operation for the long term, although there is no certain date (or
commitment) for the facility to cease operation.

July18, 2002

          CURRENT NOISE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
The City generally has followed the State standards in the establishment of acceptable noise
levels for development. Both Section 513 of the Zoning Ordinance and the Hydrocarbons
Ordinance require mufflers or “cloaking” of equipment if noise emitted exceeds 60 dB. The
Zoning Ordinance noise section also requires “cloaking” if noise in “non-industrial” areas
exceeds 50 dB at 200 feet from the source.
The Hydrocarbons Ordinance states that “Gas operations shall be governed solely by and be
required to meet the noise standards of Section 513.B.1 of the Zoning Ordinance, provided,
however, compressors operated by internal combustion engines shall have muffler systems
installed if the sound from the compressor measures 60 dBA or more immediately outside any
non-industrial building used for human occupancy located at a distance of 150 feet or more
from the compressor. “
Airport standards usually require special insulation or noise reduction measures in residences
to reduce interior noise to 30–35 dB. The ALUP includes noise contours with supporting
policies and land use compatibility criteria to provide guidance in development projects.
According to the ALUP, the maximum CNEL normally considered acceptable for residential
areas in the vicinity of the Rio Vista Airport is 60 dBA.

E.        Outlook
SAFETY
Existing and proposed General Plan policies and ordinances reflect the City’s ongoing
obligation to protect lives and property. In addition, the City is committed to working closely
with Solano County and other emergency service providers in a periodic update of plans for
emergency events. Implementation of these policies and enforcement of supporting City
ordinances will ensure that efforts are maximized in protecting the citizens of Rio Vista from
potential geologic and seismic safety hazards, flooding, and other natural disasters.
          SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Since Rio Vista is located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults, the City’s ability to respond
to a seismic event is crucial to the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. The General Plan
process has included a reexamination of the City’s emergency response policies and the drafting
of its Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (Rio Vista, 2001) to reinforce the state of the
City’s preparedness in responding to seismic and other emergency situations.
          FLOOD CONTROL
Future planned development will significantly increase the amount of impervious surface and
decrease natural vegetation. These conditions limit water infiltration opportunities and,
without adequate mitigation, can increase stormwater runoff and decrease the time required to
reach peak discharge rates. The City is committed to minimizing damage due to flood hazards
through identifying floodplain boundaries and limiting development in areas where flooding is
likely to occur.
          NATURAL GAS WELLS
Natural gas production will continue to play an important role in the local economy. The City
will establish that developers and gas companies have adequate safeguards and emergency
response plans in place prior to development in the vicinity of gas well operations. Although
the City’s monitoring capabilities are limited, the assurances that safeguards and reporting are
carried out will occur largely through the City’s development review process and through the
update and enforcement of the City’s Hydrocarbon Ordinance.
          POLICE SERVICES
This element’s policies and implementing actions reflect the importance of public safety in
maintaining Rio Vista’s small town character. Without adequate staffing, and facilities and
equipment with the latest technology, the City will lose its ability to provide a safe and secure
environment for its citizens. With this in mind, the City has assessed its current level of service
and projected what will be needed in the near-term and during the General Plan planning
period to meet the needs of the community.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-28                                    Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

The City presently is preparing to temporarily relocate its Police Department facility to the Rio
Vista Business Park. The facilities will increase in square footage from 1,200 to 7,200 square
feet—this space is needed to accommodate existing staff and equipment. It is expected that
these facilities will meet the Department’s needs for approximately 5-7 years, when the
population growth in the City is anticipated to necessitate further facilities expansion.
Long-term plans for Rio Vista include construction of a Civic Center that will provide for the
additional expansion of the Police Department’s facilities. No location has been determined for
the City offices.
Staffing will be increased relative to the needs of the community. Population increase will be
the principal factor in determining the extent to which the staff will need to be increased.
Development patterns could be another factor in determining the need for staffing. The intent
of the City to keep growth compact rather than “leapfrogging” will positively contribute to the
efficiency of the department in its ability to maintain a continual presence in neighborhoods.
The City intends to maintain the existing high level of response as it prioritizes its emergency
calls. It is not anticipated that a police substation will be needed during the next 10 years—the
ability of the police to maintain a regular presence in all of the City’s neighborhoods will be
accomplished through its central facility. At such time that the population increases to more
than 20,000 residents, the City will need to reassess its facilities in order to determine whether a
second facility is necessary.
The City intends to make use of the newest available technology in order to best serve its
residents. Staying current will require a year-to-year assessment of what equipment is available.
The City will seek grants to supplement local funds for purchase of this equipment through the
State Office of Traffic Safety and the Office of Criminal Justice Planning.
          911SYSTEM
The City expects to continue its contract with Contra Costa County for dispatching services in
the near to midterm future. When the population starts to approach buildout at 20,000
residents, the City may choose to explore the possibility of having its own dispatch for police
and fire. The current trend is to consolidate even further than what presently exists among the
police departments in Solano County—regionalizing dispatch services in an effort to gain
significant cost savings is the primary reason for this move. Preliminary talks have begun
among Solano County and the cities to consolidate dispatch centers down to two or three in the
County service area. The trade-off is that further regionalizing of the dispatch system reduces
familiarity with the affected area and has the potential to increase response time.
          FIRE PROTECTION
Buildout of Rio Vista, as proposed in the General Plan (i.e., Trilogy, Esperson, River Walk,
Marks, Gibbs, and Brann Ranches), will require the construction of at least one additional fire
substation and the purchase of additional equipment. In response to the General Plan buildout
scenario, the City may require the dedication of one or two lots in new development areas for
construction of a firehouse. One additional pumper would be located at the new station; nine
new paid personnel would be needed to staff the proposed station(s). The City will seek to
recruit new volunteers who either live or work in the City or surrounding area.

The future targeted ISO rating is 3. The future targeted response time as the new areas are
developed is 4 minutes (90 percent of the time).
          COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
The City has prepared and will soon adopt its draft Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
(Rio Vista, 2001) in accordance with the requirements of Solano County’s Emergency Response
and Planning Program, and the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
Operations Area Response. The plan defines the primary and support roles of City agencies
and departments in after-incident damage assessment and reporting requirements. This plan
will serve as a key component in implementing the City’s policies that address emergency
response.
          HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Many of the potential risks associated with hazardous materials can be reduced through the
City’s provision of educational materials and staff recommendations through the City’s
Building Department. Education in the handling and disposal of household products, asbestos,
and lead-based paints will be an ongoing effort to ensure the safety of Rio Vista residents.
Local, state and federal regulations will largely be relied upon for ensuring that reporting
requirements are met and business plans are prepared by those businesses operations that
involve the transport, handling and storage of hazardous materials. The City will help to
ensure compliance with these regulations to the greatest extent possible in the course of its
normal permit and inspection processes.
The Truck Route Map in the Circulation & Mobility element will provide transporters of
hazardous materials with acceptable routes through the City. The map will be used as a
reference in the event of questions regarding safe transport.
          ODORS
In winter, after the fertilizing season is over in the area, Solano County plans to implement an
appeals process for addressing concerns over bio solid fertilizers. Currently, a proposal must be
filed with the County to spread bio solid fertilizers on agricultural fields. In the future, the City
of Rio Vista will be made aware of proposals for spreading bio solids upwind of Rio Vista and
in the surrounding area. An appeals process will be established through the County’s
Administrative Director of Environmental Management. If either party is not satisfied with the
outcome, a further appeal may be made to the Solano County Board of Supervisors.
The City recognizes that it cannot expect to halt the spreading of bio solids as it continues its
policies of supporting agriculture on the lands surrounding Rio Vista. However, the City will
continue to monitor sources of odors that can affect the quality of life in the City and advise its
citizens of their options in addressing these odors. The success of monitoring and informing the
public will depend on the extent of public/private cooperation and interagency coordination.

July18, 2002

          EMERGENCY SERVICES
The City will continue to operate under the terms of its contract with Solano County. Rio Vista
Fire Department will continue its public/private partnership with Medic Ambulance Service
and agree to be “first responders” on emergency calls, staffing all of its fire trucks with
emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Unless State legislation changes in the future, the City
will be prohibited from providing its own ambulance services.
          HEALTH SERVICES
The City will encourage and work with health care providers to increase the availability of
health care services in Rio Vista. It is the intent of the City to minimize the extent to which
residents have to travel long distances to receive basic care. Medical clinics, emergency medical
care, and assisted living and skilled nursing facilities are just a few of the health care services
that the City will seek to establish in the community.
The lack of adequate public transportation will create the need for facilities to serve residents in
areas geographically removed from the Downtown core. The City envisions the construction
and operation of a social services and health care facility in the vicinity of Airport and Church
Roads. This strategic location will facilitate access by residents in the north and west areas of
the City to convenient health care services.
Although Rio Vista CARE moved its offices recently to a larger space, their services are
constrained by insufficiently sized facilities. While the demand is expected to remain high, the
agency will not be able to significantly expand its services without adequate space. As soon as a
substantially larger building becomes available for staff, it is expected that Solano County will
have a greater presence in Rio Vista with a staff of therapists and eligibility workers. The City
will work with Rio Vista CARE, if needed, to obtain grant funding for construction of new
community facilities.
The Community Action Center (CAC) would like to expand its services to include teen
pregnancy counseling, a teen work program, and drug and birth control information. Other
needs that the center cannot currently address include emergency shelter, transitional housing,
affordable housing, and affordable childcare. Additional funding will be needed before the
center’s staff and facilities can be increased.
Before- and after-school childcare is another of the community needs that will continue to
increase as the community grows. The City will work with local service providers and the
River Delta Unified School District to help ensure that before- and after-school care will be
available to all children in need of this service.
          HIGHWAY 12
Providing a means of safely crossing Highway 12 for bicyclists and pedestrians is of primary
concern to the City. As traffic continues to increase on this principal roadway through Rio
Vista, improvements will be required to increase the ease of access between the north and south
sides of the City. The Circulation Map in the Circulation & Mobility element indicates an
approximate location for a highway undercrossing or overcrossing to be constructed. The
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-31                                   Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

policies and implementing actions in that element are consistent with the intent of this Safety &
Noise element to increase safety in this area.
          RIO VISTA AIRPORT
Expansion and development at the Rio Vista Airport are expected to continue without placing
increased risk to the public or those working on the site. Continuation of existing standards for
analysis of new developments, adoption and periodic update of the City’s Comprehensive
Emergency Management Plan, and prohibition of residential construction within the restricted
zones will minimize the danger of potential hazards. The airport/land use safety compatibility
criteria contained in the ALUP will be used in assessing risks associated with the operation of
aircraft to and from the airport in order to minimize risk to people on the ground and in the
aircraft, largely through reducing density and maximizing the amount of open land within the
vicinity of the airport. The City will continue to implement the ALUP and consider the Plan’s
safety criteria during its review of proposed land use plans and development projects in the
vicinity of the Rio Vista Airport.
NOISE
          MOBILE AND STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Future noise levels in the community are based on an anticipated increase of traffic and airport
operations, as well as industrial noise or nuisance noise that may result from land development
in the community. Traffic increases may be predicted based on cumulative buildout of the City.
The Circulation & Mobility element discusses the anticipated increase in traffic as a result of
plan buildout. Future industrial-related noise is more difficult to predict because not all
industrial uses produce significant noise. In some cases, non-industrial uses could produce
nuisance noise that could affect nearby noise-sensitive uses—typically, residential uses. The
likely noise levels that will be expected from each noise source are discussed below.
          HIGHWAY 12
Continued land development in Rio Vista and the surrounding area will result in traffic
increases in Rio Vista. Such increases will result in increased noise levels, affecting residents
living close to heavily traveled roadways. Highway 12 would continue to be by far the greatest
contributor to overall roadway noise in the community. However, much of this increase may be
attributed to future development outside the community, especially in Solano County and
Stockton.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    11-32                                 Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

Assuming no new barrier for noise attenuation, areas within a range of 260–400 feet measured
from the centerline of Highway 12 could potentially be subjected to noise levels in excess of 60–
65 dBA Ldn, which is the City’s proposed noise standard without mitigation as shown in the
1990 General Plan Amendments to the 1985 Rio Vista General Plan (Rio Vista, 1991). Figure 11-5
shows the estimated noise level contours along Highway 12, based on projected buildout under
the Land Use element. The 60–65 dBA contour is shown as an estimated 400 feet from the
centerline of Highway 12. Because local topography, vegetation, or intervening structures may
significantly affect noise exposure at a particular location, the noise contours should not be
considered exact. Residential projects that are proposed within this distance of Highway 12 will
require a noise study to determine the actual distance of the project from the 60-dBA contour.
The Solano Transportation Authority (STA) traffic model indicates that around 2010 (the
halfway point in the projected buildout of this General Plan) portions of Highway 12 will need
to be expanded to four lanes in order to maintain the level of service (LOS) standards set in the
Circulation & Mobility element. By full buildout, in 2020 or beyond, all of Highway 12 will
need to be expanded to four lanes. A community-wide noise study of major arterials would be
helpful in assessing noise levels once traffic levels have been determined under the buildout
scenario.
           RIO VISTA AIRPORT
Airport noise is expected to increase as the use of the airport increases. Future noise contours
(2004) for the airport have been developed as part of the ALUP. As shown in Figure 11-4, the
contours will be used to evaluate development projects onsite and in the vicinity of the Rio
Vista Airport. If airport activity increases substantially above that anticipated in the ALUP, a
follow-up noise study would be needed to update the noise contours.
          NATURAL GAS WELLS
Natural gas wells will continue to dot the landscape of Rio Vista and, as development continues
as planned, will become an integral part of residential communities in the southern and western
portions of Rio Vista. Natural gas pipeline compression associated with gas wells has the
potential to create noise impacts near residential development. The noise concern over gas well
compressors under this General Plan update is that substantial new residential development
will be constructed in the south area of Rio Vista (Esperson property) close to these
compressors.
The City will apply noise performance standards to ensure that the noise generated from
natural gas pipeline compressors is not intrusive for residents living near these sites (see
discussion below). Adopting the recommendations of the State’s Model Noise Control Ordinance
for rural residential areas, the City will adopt a noise standard of not greater than 45 dBA at the
residential property line. This higher-than-usual standard for outdoor noise accounts for the
continual generation of “white noise” resulting from the compression in natural gas pipelines.
This standard are directed toward well-head compressors at specific well sites. The large main
line compressor building located near Vineyard Bluffs on the Esperson property will be
evaluated separately, as a part of specific noise analyses to be conducted for future
development projects proposed on the Esperson property.

          FUTURE NOISE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Rio Vista’s exterior noise standards for new uses affected by traffic and airport noise under this
General Plan update range from 60 to 70 dBA Ldn. Table 11-2 illustrates these standards for
various noise-sensitive land uses; these standards are consistent with those recommended by
the State Office of Noise Control. The standards shown in Table 11-2 are most appropriately
applied to land uses adjacent to continuous noise sources, such as roadway traffic noise.
Standards based on 24-hour weighting are not adequate to address certain noise sources,
particularly industrial noise sources, which occur infrequently but at a potentially higher
intensity. Rio Vista’s exterior noise standards for new uses affected by non-transportation
(stationary) noise sources under the General Plan update range from 50 to 65 dBA Ldn.
Table 11-3 contains the noise standards for new uses affected by stationary noise sources,
including natural gas pipelines.
          ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
During initial review of development proposals, it may be determined that noise levels have the
potential to exceed City noise standards if the project were implemented. In such cases, the City
will require that an acoustical analysis be prepared to further evaluate the extent to which
mitigation would be required if the project were approved. This measure includes projects
proposed within the estimated future noise contours shown in Figures 11-4 and 11-5. Table 11-4
outlines the City’s requirements for the preparation of acoustical analyses. These analyses will
be the responsibility of the project applicant.

      Notes:
      1.    For traffic noise in the City of Rio Vista, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately similar.
            Interior noise level standards are applied in noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors
            in the closed positions.
      2.    Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or residences
            with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the
            residence.
      3.    For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor
            recreation area, such as at pools, play areas, or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided in multi-family
            residential uses, the standards shall be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development.
      4.    Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less using a practical application of
            the best available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed—provided
            that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise levels are in
            compliance with this table.
      5.    Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas.
      6.    Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at
            clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
      7.    Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation are considered sensitive.
      8.    These standards are consistent with the Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (Solano County Airport Land Use
            Commission, 1988).

  3.    Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas, and are not commonly used
        during night-time hours.
  4.    Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly
        identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
  5.    Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation are considered sensitive to noise.
  6.    The outdoor activity areas of office, commercial, and park uses are not typically used during nighttime hours.
  7.    It may not be possible to achieve compliance with this standard at residential uses located immediately adjacent to loading
        dock areas of commercial uses while trucks are unloading. The daytime and night-time noise level standards applicable to
        loading docks shall be 55 and 50 dB Leq, respectively.
  8.    The City will apply noise performance standards as outlined in the policies of this Safety & Noise element to ensure that the
        noise generated from natural gas pipeline compressors is not intrusive for residents living near these sites. Adopting the
        recommendations of the State’s Model Noise Control Ordinance for rural residential areas, the City will adopt a noise
        standard of not greater than 45 dBA at the residential property line. This higher-than-usual standard for outdoor noise
        accounts for the continual generation of “white noise” resulting from the compression in natural gas pipelines.
  General Notes: a. The Table 11-3 standards shall be reduced by 5 dB for sounds consisting primarily of speech or music and for
                        recurring impulsive sounds.
                     b. If the existing ambient noise level exceeds the standards in Table 11-3, the noise level standards shall be
                        increased at 5-dB increments to encompass the ambient level.

G.        Implementing Actions for Safety & Noise (SN)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Safety & Noise element.
SN-1               CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND GEOLOGY STUDIES
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to monitor California Department of Mines and Geology studies for
potentially active faults in the vicinity of Rio Vista. Information on a previously unknown or
inactive fault that is discovered or becomes active can be obtained by monitoring such studies.
Discovery of any such fault in the region may require modification to the City’s development
and building codes.
SN-2               INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
Seismic and Flood Hazards. The City will continue its coordination with other agencies on
issues of seismic safety and flood control. Coordination between the City and Solano County
occurs through several mechanisms, including the distribution of development proposals for
review and comment. The City will continue its cooperation with federal, state, and local
agencies—including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and California Department of Fish and Game. (Note: Solano County Water Agency acts
as the County Flood Control District. Its role with the City in flood control efforts, however, is
minimal—the only project managed by this agency in the vicinity of Rio Vista is the Mellon Levee,
located at the southern end of the Yolo Bypass.)
Odors. The City will maintain updated information through the Solano County Department of
Environmental Management to ensure that the public is informed about the proposal, use, and
appeal of the use of bio solids fertilizer. The City will cooperate with the Solano County
Agricultural Commission in ensuring that agricultural practices are in accordance with County
requirements.
Police and Fire Protection Services. The City will continue to participate in its mutual aid
agreements and coordination between the City’s police and fire departments and other
jurisdictions and law enforcement/fire protection agencies.
Emergency Services. The City will continue to participate in the Joint Powers Authority (JPA)
with other cities and Solano County, including the Solano County Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) Department, to: (1) ensure that an effective and broad-reaching community-wide
emergency notification system is in place; (2) increase the availability of ambulance and
paramedic services in Rio Vista; and (3) strive to maintain and improve, where needed, the
emergency response time. Rio Vista will work with the JPA toward increasing staffing and
obtaining 24-hour coverage. The City also will work closely with the JPA and continue to
evaluate the 5-year contract with EMT, the ambulance service provider, to improve ambulance
services in Rio Vista.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-53                                 Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

Rio Vista Airport. The City will refer all development projects within the vicinity of the Rio
Vista Airport to the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission for its review and comment.
In addition, the City will work with the Commission to periodically assess and update the
Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan (Solano County Airport Land Use Commission, 1988).
SN-3               UNIFORM BUILDING CODE
                   (Existing)
Through the Building and Public Works Departments, the City will continue to enforce and
update the Uniform Building Code, which includes construction standards for seismic and
geologic safety.
SN-4               DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City’s Development Review process involves a review of the proposed project’s compliance
with local ordinances and regulations; an environmental review in accordance with the
requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); site design review (described
in greater detail below in SN-35), and drafting of conditions of approval. The following is a
general discussion of the City’s development review process as it pertains to safety and noise
issues associated with proposed development projects.
          SAFETY
Siesmicity, Flooding, Grading, and Drainage. The City will refer all development proposals to
the Building Department, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address potential
flooding, seismic, grading, soils, or geologic impacts. A detailed site analysis will be required
for major development proposals falling within ¼ mile of a fault (i.e., fault location and activity
data, and hazard mitigation measures). The environmental review for projects must include a
full inventory of potential grading and drainage impacts—along with any potential soil,
geologic, or flood concerns; an assessment of potential project impacts; and an identification of
mitigation and monitoring measures. Issues related to slopes, liquefaction, ground failure,
flooding, and erosion must be addressed. Project design, grading, and building construction
techniques must be used, as appropriate, to minimize these impacts.
The City will require the applicant to provide specific data requirements pertaining to potential
hazards, including slope instability, seismicity, flooding, and fire. The data on hazards will
assist the City and the applicant in determining the permitted level of development on the site.
Through the development review process, the City will implement the following actions to
prevent flooding and excessive runoff:
          •   Promote the use of open grassy swales to carry runoff from urban areas to natural
              drainages.
          •   Discourage large continuous paved areas in development unless adequate drainage
              is provided.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    11-54                                   Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

          •   Encourage development to maximize the use of pervious paving materials.
          •   Ensure a design that prevents the diversion of runoff onto neighboring properties.
          •   Encourage development to discharge runoff into pervious drainageways.
          •   Locate building pads a sufficient distance above the 100-year floodplain elevation.
          •   Ensure that all storm drainage culverts and bridges along designated floodplains are
              designed to accommodate, at a minimum, 100-year flood volumes. Where
              practicable, improvements should accommodate 150 percent of the 100-year
              volumes.
Gas Well Sites. The City will review proposed locations of natural gas well sites when tentative
maps and development projects are submitted for review and approval. The Hydrocarbons
Ordinance and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) will be considered during this
development review process to verify compliance and ensure that sufficient mitigation is in
effect to guarantee public safety. The City is to receive assurances from the gas companies that
all gas well sites, compressor sites, and dehydration units will be checked regularly by
operators (allowing for flexibility to shift the focus, as needed, from consistently running wells
to higher priority wells), and that data for gas operations will be recorded. The operations/
business plan should specify the frequency and protocol for checking on wells. Operators shall
be trained to identify potential problems and report any negative findings to the appropriate
personnel immediately and to the City, as deemed appropriate, so that proper response can be
initiated.
Police and Fire Protection Services. The City will refer all development proposals to the Rio
Vista Police Department and Fire Department for review and comment. The review process
will consider the provision of access to lands for emergency services, street access to all
structures, fire and crime prevention programs, and the enforcement of building and fire codes.
The departments’ comments will be considered during the development review process.
Hazardous Materials. The City will refer any development proposal that may be affected by, or
affect, the storage, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials to the Fire Department and
other appropriate agencies responsible for hazardous materials. Where appropriate, the
County’s Hazardous Materials Management Plan will be applied and, if required by State law, a
Risk Management Prevention Plan. A business plan and procedures shall be prepared and
submitted to the City’s police and fire departments as a requirement of any administrative or
use permit under the City’s Hydrocarbon Ordinance, where deemed appropriate by the
decision-making entity (staff or Planning Commission), and in other circumstances where
applicable. Such plans shall contain all provisions required by Assembly Bill 2185, Department
of Transportation (DOT) and Cal-OSHA regulations for environmental controls of hazardous
materials and other provisions that may be required by the City. (Note: The Hazardous Material
Business Plan [HMBP] and Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures [SPCC] Plan are outlined in
SN-13 below).
Medical Services. The development review process includes discretionary review by the
Planning Commission and Design Review Committee, based on consideration of General Plan
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-55                                   Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

objectives and policies, and criteria established by the Zoning Ordinance and other City
regulations and adopted guidelines. Through this process and the requirements of CEQA, the
City will work with project proponents to establish their health and medical facilities in areas of
the City that are convenient, close to public transit, or located in a pedestrian network. To the
greatest extent possible, the City will remove regulatory and financial barriers to applicants
with projects that will help to fill the gap in health and medical services.
          NOISE
The City will continue its existing development review process in accordance with the
requirements contained in such documents as Section 513 of the Zoning Ordinance (Noise
Regulation), the Uniform Building Code, State Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24), Specific
Plans, the City’s Design Guidelines, CEQA, Solano County Environmental Health regulations,
and other relevant statutes and regulations.
Because noise considerations are an integral part of the community planning and design
process, the City will require noise information from the project applicant to adequately
evaluate the effects of project noise on the community. Conditions of approval will be
developed, along with mitigation measures, to ensure that the goals and policies of the Safety &
Noise element are met.
Natural Gas Wells. The City will review proposed locations of natural gas well sites when
tentative maps and development projects are submitted for review and approval. The City will
consider the Hydrocarbons Ordinance and CEQA during this development review process, to
verify compliance and ensure that adequate measures are in place to mitigate noise impacts.
With a performance standard of 45 dBA at the residential property line, the City expects that
there will be a shared responsibility between the developer and the natural gas company for
mitigating noise impacts where natural gas wells are already in production, and in the
establishment of new wells.
Adequate safeguards appear to be in place through the development review process, CEQA, the
Hydrocarbons Ordinance, and the Solano County Department of Environmental Management
to address noise, health, and hazard issues associated with drilling and production of natural
gas wells.
Schools. In accordance with Education Code Section 17215, any proposed school sites within
two miles of any of the Rio Vista Municipal Airport runways will require a school site
evaluation by the Division of Aeronautics.
SN-5               SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will review and revise its Subdivision Ordinance as needed to incorporate the specific
data and design requirements related to surface faulting, ground failure, flooding, and noise
that are contained in this General Plan update.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      11-56                                Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

SN-6               GRADING AND DRAINAGE ORDINANCE
                    (Proposed)
The City will enact a Grading and Drainage Ordinance. The ordinance will require special
excavation precautions to minimize hazards areas of slope instability, limit grading to those
operations that would enhance ground stability without drastic site alteration, require special
surface and subsurface drainage provisions, require that grading restore rather than disrupt
natural patterns and volumes of surface runoff, and limit the construction of impermeable
surfaces (structures, patios, and roads) over naturally permeable soils and geologic areas.
SN-7               SPECIFIC PLANS
                   (Proposed)
          SAFETY
The City will ensure that specific plans and planned unit developments (PUDs) are consistent
with the goals and policies of the General Plan. Proposed specific plans will:
          •   Identify potential geologic, soil, and seismic hazards in the plan area and also
              include measures to reduce the risk of such hazards.
          •   Outline criteria for development on steep slope areas, as applicable, to ensure public
              safety and minimize environmental and aesthetic impacts.
          •   Include the designation and preservation of floodplain areas and adjacent habitat.
          •   Incorporate provisions for public infrastructure, utilities, and emergency services to
              remain functional during flood conditions to the greatest extent feasible.
              Development agreements may be used to secure implementation and funding
              provisions.
          •   Specify anticipated need, if any, for additional fire services based on land use
              designations in the plan area. The specific plan must include the location and size of
              fire facilities, a fire facilities phasing plan, and source(s) of funding (to be available at
              the time of development).
          NOISE
All proposed specific plans and PUDs will be reviewed in terms of present and future noise
levels and means of noise attenuation. The City will consider techniques such as site and
building design, barriers, and traffic planning; these techniques will be incorporated into the
specific plan as needed. Tentative maps and PUDs will incorporate noise attenuation
techniques into the site design, based on more definitive noise considerations. Noise attenuation
techniques may be required as conditions to the approval of such maps and permits.
Where conventional development practices are not appropriate, PUD procedures may be
applied by the County to those lands that are proposed for development with identified
constraints that may be hazardous to development. Presently, both County and participating
city ordinances provide for PUD procedures as an alternative to conventional procedures.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                           11-57                                   Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

The State-authorized specific plan technique provides the County and participating cities with
an alternative regulatory measure to mandatory PUD. Specific area planning can be used to
ensure that proposed development layouts adequately consider hazards to safety associated
with development and natural resource values. The technique is particularly appropriate for
larger development sites with a complex variety of natural and human-induced conditions and
land use needs. Specific plans may include, but are not limited to, mapped analysis of soil,
geologic, seismic, flood, noise, and visual conditions; and related controls on grading, building,
building location, density, drainage, wildfire, flood protection, noise abatement, open space,
circulation, access, landscaping, landscaping preservation, public facilities, and natural resource
protection. A specific plan is, in effect, a publicly prepared and adopted PUD proposal. Such
studies also provide an integrated and efficient means of environmental impact assessment.
Specific plan preparation could be financed by groups of interested developers as part of the
environmental impact report process or through special assessment district procedures.
SN-8               LAND USE MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
In areas where potentially significant soil, erosion, and flooding impacts are identified, the City
will consider open space or other appropriate land use designations, including those designated
on the Land Use Map in the Land Use element.
SN-9               ZONING ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
Development regulations, primarily the zoning regulations, provide the standards for
development, prescribe allowable uses, contain specific incentive provisions, and include other
standards and procedures related to approval of development projects. The City will undertake
a review and update of these ordinances and regulations to ensure that unnecessary obstacles
are removed from the process of establishing health and medical facilities and services. The
City also will continue to regulate all uses and development in areas subject to flooding through
regular review and updates of the zoning ordinance.
SN-10              SENSITIVE LOCAL RESOURCE AREAS MAP
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The Sensitive Local Resource Areas Map, as specified in the Safety & Noise element and the
Resource Conservation & Management element, will be used to identify the boundaries of the
100-year floodplain and other environmentally sensitive areas where their development could
result in potential hazards to the public.
SN-11              LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL FUNDS
                   (Existing)
Flood Control. The City will pursue mechanisms to finance flood prevention and storm
maintenance programs. If necessary, the City will consider alternative funding sources,
including the establishment of a drainage utility and assessment district.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          11-58                             Safety & Noise
July18, 2002
Health Services. The City of Rio Vista will work with local health and social services providers
to pursue funding opportunities for planning, construction and staffing of health and medical
facilities. Possible sources include the Wellness Foundation. The City will take the lead role in
applying for funds that cannot be directly pursued (e.g., State of California Community
Development Block Grant Program) by private, not-for-profit enterprises.
Police Services. The City will continue to pursue grants through the State Office of Traffic
Safety and Office of Criminal Justice Planning to leverage local funding for equipment.
SN-12              FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP
                   (Existing)
The City will continue its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, including
adoption and administration of updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
model ordinances and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
SN-13              HAZARDOUS MATERIALS BUSINESS        PLAN AND SPILL PREVENTION, CONTROL,
                   AND COUNTERMEASURES PLAN
                   (Existing)
In accordance with Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, development sites
that store above the threshold quantities of a hazardous material or any amount of hazardous
waste will submit a Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) to the Solano County
Department of Environmental Management. The HMBP will include an inventory of hazardous
materials stored at a facility, with specific physical and chemical descriptions of each material.
The HMBP will be reviewed annually and updated if any material changes affect the quantity
or location of hazardous materials.
The HMBP also will include, where appropriate, a Consolidated Contingency Plan that
describes the emergency response procedures to be taken in case of hazardous material spill or
fire. The plan provides facility identification information, emergency contacts, and response
procedures to be taken in the event of a hazardous material emergency. Emergency equipment
capabilities, emergency services, and employee training also are outlined in the Plan.
Compliance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations—preparation of a Spill Prevention,
Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan also will be required, where appropriate. The SPCC
Plan contains much of the same information as the contingency plan but is more detailed in the
description of spill response and prevention measures.
SN-14              COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
                   (Draft)
The City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan provides direction for responding to
disastrous occurrences in Rio Vista. This plan, which meets the requirements of Solano
County’s policies on Emergency Response and Planning, the Standardized Emergency
Management System (SEMS) Operations Area Response, defines the primary and support roles
of City agencies and departments in after-incident damage assessment and reporting
requirements. With this plan in place, it is the underlying goal of the Safety component of this
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                    11-59                                  Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

element to protect the life, property, and environment of community residents, businesses,
employees and visitors.
The City will maintain and update the comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. The plan
addresses interagency coordination, emergency functions, continuity of government
responsibility, and public awareness. In addition, the plan provides for the operation of police,
fire and health services, as well as transportation alternatives in the event of a multi-hazard
emergency. City evacuation procedures are described and are submitted to the State Office of
Emergency Services (OES) for approval. The City will implement this plan in the event of a
hazardous seismic or geologic occurrence.
The City’s plan is being revised to become eligible for receipt of State and federal emergency
aid. Once reviewed by the State OES and adopted by the City Council, the plan will be
implemented and updated every 2 years as required by OES.
SN-15              DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS
                   (Proposed)
Disclosure information on the existence of natural gas well sites within residential
developments will be included promotional brochures for new residential developments.
Deeds of trust for properties within these subdivisions will contain similar disclosures about the
existence of natural gas wells in the vicinity. This measure will ensure that new property
owners are notified that gas companies maintain the subsurface mineral rights to natural gas
and are expected to conduct drilling and production operations in designated areas within the
residential development.
SN-16              POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to emphasize the use of modern technology in providing effective law
enforcement for the community. The Police Department sets as its goal to continue timely
response and prioritization of all emergency calls. In addition, timely response to routine calls
and the high visibility of patrol service will strengthen security within the community.
SN-17              POLICE DEPARTMENT FIELD TRAINING PROGRAM
                   (Existing)
The Police Department will continue to conduct its field training program for all new Police
Department employees. The 5-week program emphasizes current law enforcement standards
and techniques to ensure that employees have the skills necessary to carry out their duties.
SN-18              PUBLIC EDUCATION/AWARENESS PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The Rio Vista Police Department and Rio Vista Fire Department will continue working to
provide extensive community-based service and education programs focusing on crime
prevention, drug awareness, and fire prevention—with an emphasis on citizen protection and
involvement.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      11-60                                Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

For existing development that is incompatible with measured or projected noise contour levels,
the City will provide information to occupants and property owners on possible noise
abatement measures, such as berming, installing acoustical walls, and soundproofing (double
glazing, caulking, and insulation).
SN-19              FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS
                   (Existing)
The Rio Vista Fire Department will continue to implement its fire prevention programs as
follows:
          •   Present annual Fire Prevention Week at local schools.
          •   Assist businesses in preparing their fire prevention programs upon request.
          •   Conduct fire extinguisher demonstrations to service clubs and businesses upon
              request.
          •   Conduct fire inspections through the business license approval procedure.
          •   Carry out routine fire inspections to the extent possible, with schedule depending on
              staff availability.
SN-20              FIRE AND SAFETY CODES
                   (Existing)
Through the Rio Vista Fire Department (RVFD), the City will continue to enforce state and
federal codes relating to fire and safety. Specifically, the RVFD will apply the Uniform Codes
including, but not limited to, the Uniform Fire Code, California Fire Code, National Electrical
Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, and codes relating to hazardous materials disposal to their
inspection procedures. Where appropriate, RVFD will refer code violations to the City’s
Building Department for follow through to ensure full compliance with these codes.
SN-21              CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to be used as a source of funding
for capital improvements for police and fire facilities and equipment. The CIP plan will be
reviewed and updated every 5 years to determine what changes or additions in facilities and
equipment will be required.
SN-22              DEDICATIONS, FEES, AND EXACTIONS
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
Where determined to be necessary, the City will require, as a condition of project approval, the
dedication of land or payment of appropriate fees and exactions to help offset municipal costs
for fire protection facilities and services. As growth occurs, this measure will help to ensure the
continued provision of adequate fire, police, and emergency response services and facilities.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          11-61                              Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

SN-23              ANNUAL REPORT
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare an annual report that addresses the provision of police, fire, and
emergency services. Information from this report will be used to update the Comprehensive
Emergency Management Plan and to evaluate the need for additional services in order to
ensure that Rio Vista maintains desired response times and service levels as the community’s
population increases.
SN-24              COUNTYWIDE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN
                   (Existing)
In accordance with the California Integrated Waste Management Act, Solano County and its
seven incorporated jurisdictions adopted a Countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan in
November 1995. The goal of the plan is to reduce the amount and hazard of special wastes
generated, and to ensure environmentally safe disposal of special waste that cannot be reused,
recycled, or composted. The plan has established an implementation schedule to achieve its
objectives, including setting a target of at least 15 percent of Solano County households to
replacing at least one household hazardous waste product with a safer, effective product or
method each year; an additional 10 percent of households will participate in a household
hazardous materials collection event each year. As part of this plan, Rio Vista will conduct
periodic surveys of their residents to assess changes in the use of hazardous products.
SN-25              CIRCULATION & MOBILITY ELEMENT
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The Circulation & Mobility element of this General Plan establishes specific truck routes where
noise conflicts with land use compatibility issues are least likely to occur. Truck traffic
associated with delivery and loading in residential and commercial areas will be limited to
daytime periods when ambient noise levels are highest. (Figure 8-5 illustrates the proposed truck
routes for trucks hauling hazardous materials.)
This element also proposes a circulation system that includes an undercrossing for pedestrians
and bicyclists on Highway 12. Construction of this crossing will increase mobility within the
community by providing a means of safe passage from developments north of Highway 12 to
the downtown core. (See Policy 8.3.K.)
SN-26              RESOURCE MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
                   (Proposed)
The City will establish a program to ensure the long-term maintenance and management of
parks and designated open space areas. The program will address the frequency and type of
maintenance needed, management and monitoring provisions to ensure the continued viability
of the resource, and designated costs and funding sources. When the open space area is
required as the result of permits issued by federal or state agencies, the maintenance and
management program will be consistent with applicable permitting requirements. Funding
should consider all municipal costs that will ensure public safety, including the use and storage
of toxic chemicals.
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                          11-62                           Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

SN-27              CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE
                   (Existing)
The City will comply with and enforce, to the extent feasible, Chapter 6.95, Section 25503 of the
California Health and Safety Code. This chapter requires all businesses to report the quantity
and locations of hazardous materials to the regulatory authority on an annual basis if the
business stores (1) above 55 gallons of a liquid or 500 pounds of a solid hazardous material,
(2) above 200 cubic feet of a compressed gas, or (3) a radioactive material that is handled in
quantities for which an emergency plan is required.
SN-28              BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
                   (Existing)
The City will require that developers use best management practices (BMPs) recommended by
the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service. Approaches to design, construction, and
maintenance techniques should ensure that development near a sensitive corridor would not
cause or worsen natural hazards (e.g., erosion, sedimentation, flooding, and water pollution).
Techniques will include erosion and sediment control practices, such as hay bales, turbidity
screens, temporary vegetation, and other management practices to minimize siltation,
sedimentation, and erosion. The City will require that these measures be left in place until
disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent vegetation that will prevent the transport of
sediment offsite. Additional BMPs to be used include oil and sand separators, grassy swales,
detention ponds, vegetative buffers, and other source control and treatment measures.
SN-29              PUBLIC/PRIVATE COOPERATION
                   (Proposed)
The City will cooperate with private concerns in the areas of medical care facilities and
agriculture to ensure public health and safety.
SN-30              LEGISLATIVE MONITORING
                   (Proposed)
The California Health and Safety Code prohibits cities from providing their own ambulance
services. The counties are responsible for ambulance services in the cities. Rio Vista will
continue to monitor legislation and support efforts to repeal or modify this statute, in order to
allow Rio Vista to provide ambulance services in the city.
SN-31              ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare a Strategic Plan for Economic Development. The plan will:
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                   11-63                                  Safety & Noise
July18, 2002
          •   Include policies, strategies, and priorities for business attraction; community
              promotion and marketing; and appropriate, compatible and cost-effective business
              sectors on which to concentrate marketing efforts and resources.
          •   Identify resources needed.
          •   Analyze the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities of the community for
              attracting business.
Specific issues and potential attraction strategies to be evaluated in the plan include:
agribusiness and related sectors and services; technology and information; research and
development; “back office” functions for various industries (accounting, billing, sales, and
support services); medical and professional services; environmental products and services; and
traditional manufacturing sectors. The plan will evaluate and identify strengths in attracting
businesses, such as quality of life and location in the Delta; weaknesses in attracting businesses,
such as isolation from interstate highways, infrastructure needs, and workforce; and revie3w
the lands currently designated for commercial and industrial activities to ensure that sufficient
land capacity exists to accommodate potential opportunities. A marketing and development
strategy will be recommended that will prioritize business sectors for attraction and retention
efforts, and will identify crucial steps to provide infrastructure and correct deficiencies.
SN-32              MARKETING ASSISTANCE AND POLICY SUPPORT
                   (Existing)
The City will provide/refer/support marketing assistance and policy support for the Solano
Economic Development Corporation (SEDCORP), a non-profit organization that is devoted to
promoting business development and expansion in Solano County. SEDCORP assists
municipalities and business entities by providing a marketing and educational forum and a
clearinghouse for business location inquiries about Solano County. Other useful organizations
and programs include the State Trade and Commerce Agency and the Department of Housing
and Community Development.
SN-33              SOLANO COUNTY APPEALS PROCESS
                   (Under development)
In winter 2001-2002, after the fertilizing season is over in the area, Solano County is planning to
implement an appeals process for dealing with the concerns over bio solid fertilizers. An
appeals process will be established through the County’s Administrative Director of
Environmental Management. If either party is not satisfied with the outcome, a further appeal
may be made to the County Board of Supervisors.
SN-34              AIRPORT/LAND USE COMPATIBILITY PLAN
                   (Existing)
The Airport/Land Use Compatibility Plan sets forth the safety and noise criteria that the Solano
County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) will use to evaluate land use plans and
proposed development in the vicinity of the Rio Vista Airport. The noise evaluation criteria
applied to determine airport/land use noise compatibility considers future Community Noise
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-64                                    Safety & Noise

Equivalent Level (CNEL) contours; these noise contours were calculated based upon aircraft
activity forecasts contained in the adopted airport master plan.
The airport/land use safety compatibility criteria is used to minimize risks associated with the
operation of aircraft to and from the airport; the intent of these criteria are to minimize risk to
people on the ground and in the aircraft, largely through reducing density and maximizing
amount of open land within the vicinity of the airport.
SN-35              SITE DESIGN REVIEW
                   (Ongoing)
The City will continue its design review of projects to determine ways in which project design
may minimize risks to public safety and attenuate significant noise levels. Where noise levels
exceed community noise standards for a proposed land use, one or more of the following
techniques may be required to reduce the noise to acceptable levels: traffic planning, site
planning, architectural layout, construction modifications, landscaped berms and, as a last
resort, sound wall barriers. Each of these techniques is described briefly below.
Airport/Land Use Compatibility. The airport/land use safety compatibility criteria will be
applied to site design review to ensure compatibility between the airport operations and
proposed land uses within the vicinity of the airport. Application of these criteria will help to
minimize risk to people on the ground and in the aircraft, largely through reducing density and
maximizing the amount of open land within the vicinity of the airport.
Traffic Planning. Roadway design, traffic signalization, and other traffic planning techniques
can reduce noise caused by speed or acceleration of vehicles. Limiting truck traffic to certain
designated sections of the City can help to maintain acceptable noise levels in residential
neighborhoods.
Site Planning. Proper site planning to reduce noise impacts is the first area that should be
investigated for a given project. By taking advantage of the natural shape and contours of the
site, it is often possible to arrange the buildings and other uses in a manner that will reduce and
possibly eliminate noise impacts. Planned unit developments are particularly conducive to site
planning techniques. Site planning techniques include:
          •   Increasing the distance between the noise source and the receiver.
          •   Placing land uses that are not sensitive to noise, such as parking lots, maintenance
              facilities, and utility areas, between the noise source and the receiver.
          •   Using structures that are not sensitive to noise, such as garages, to shield noise-
              sensitive areas.
          •   Orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise source.
Architectural Layout. In many cases, noise reduction requirements can be met by giving
attention to the layout of noise-sensitive spaces. Bedrooms, for example, will be considerably
quieter if placed on the side of the house facing away from a freeway. Similarly, balconies
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        11-65                                Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

facing a freeway should be avoided. Quiet outdoor spaces can be provided next to a noisy
highway by creating a U-shaped development that faces away from the highway. Proper
architectural layout often can eliminate the need for costly construction modifications.
Noise Barriers. Noise barriers are commonly used to reduce noise levels from ground
transportation and industrial noise sources. Noise barriers serve a dual purpose in that they can
reduce the noise level outdoors and indoors. The City will discourage the use of sound walls as
noise barriers and they will be considered a last resort for use in reducing noise levels.
To be effective, a noise barrier must be massive enough to prevent significant noise
transmission through it and high enough to shield the receiver from the noise source. The
minimum acceptable surface weight for a noise barrier is 4 lbs./sq. ft. (equivalent to ¾-inch
plywood), and the barrier must be carefully constructed so that there are no cracks or openings.
To be effective, a barrier must interrupt the line-of-sight between the noise source and the
receiver. As an example of this relationship, consider a flat area with a housing tract next to a
road. If there are no diesel trucks on the road, a 7-foot high barrier will reduce the traffic noise
by about 8 dBA. If trucks are present, the noise from the trucks will be reduced only by about
4 dBA. Because the stacks of the diesel trucks exceed the height of the barrier, the noise path
will not be completely interrupted.
Another important and often overlooked consideration in the design of noise barriers is the
phenomenon of “flanking.” Flanking is a term used to describe the manner by which a noise
barrier’s performance is compromised by noise passing around the end of a barrier. Short
barriers, regardless of height, provide essentially no reduction in the overall noise level. The
effects of flanking can be minimized by bending the wall back from the noise source at the ends
of the barrier.
In addition to meeting acoustical requirements, noise barriers must be evaluated for possible
maintenance problems, aesthetic and environmental considerations, safety conflicts, and cost.
Construction Modifications. If site planning, architectural layout or noise barriers—or a
combination of these measures—do not achieve the required noise reduction for the building in
question, modifying the building’s construction may be required. Indoor noise levels due to
exterior sources are controlled by the noise reduction characteristics of the building shell. The
walls, roof, ceilings, doors, windows, and other penetrations determine the structure’s overall
noise reduction capabilities.
In general, windows and doors are the acoustical weak links in a building. Often, all that is
required is sealing the windows on the noisy side of the building and providing an alternate
means of ventilating the building. Beyond this measure, thicker windows or double-glazed
windows may be required. Doors should not be located on the side of the building facing a
noisy source. If doors are oriented to a noisy source, they should be solid-core and equipped
with an appropriate acoustical door gasket.
Where more noise reduction is required, the ceiling, roof, or walls may need to be modified to
provide the reduction. The extent of modification will depend on the amount of noise reduction
required.

July18, 2002

The Noise Exposure Contours and the California Noise Insulation Standards. The California
Noise Insulation Standards (Title 25 of the California Government Code) for multi-family
dwellings require an acoustical report for dwellings proposed in areas where the Ldn exceeds
60 dBA. The purpose of the acoustical report is to demonstrate the manner by which the
development will meet the standards for interior noise levels. If noise measurements show that
the on-site Ldn exceeds 60 dBA, an acoustical report will be required.
SN-36              NOISE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
The City shall apply the Noise Performance Standards shown in Tables 11-1 and 11-2 of the
Safety & Noise element to the review of new development of noise-sensitive uses exposed to
existing fixed noise sources. These standards will also be used to evaluate the potential impacts
of proposed new fixed noise sources in proximity to noise-sensitive land uses. Where a noise
sensitive land use is proposed near a fixed noise source such as the PG&E main compressor
facility near Vineyard Bluffs, an industrial facility or the airport, noise measurements will be
performed to determine whether existing and/or future noise levels from that source will
exceed the City’s Noise Performance Standards at the property line of the proposed use.
Similarly where a fixed noise-producing use such as an industrial facility is proposed near an
existing or future noise-sensitive use, a noise analysis will be prepared to ensure that the noise
produced by that use will not exceed the Noise Performance Standards at the property line of
the noise-sensitive use.
The acoustical analysis shall be the responsibility of the project applicant. The analysis, that is
to be prepared by a qualified acoustical consultant, shall include representative noise level
measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local
conditions and the predominant noise sources; the report shall estimate existing and projected
noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the Noise Performance Standards and shall
recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the goals and policies of the
Safety & Noise element.
SN-37              NOISE LEVEL CONTOUR MAPS
                   (To be adopted as part of this General Plan)
To generally evaluate the potential for noise conflicts associated with new developments and
projects, the City will refer to the General Plan Noise Level Contour Maps (refer to Figures 11-3
and 11-4). The maps show generalized locations of noise contours associated with the various
noise sources. The contour maps can be used as a tool to evaluate the potential for exposure of
a noise-sensitive land use to noise levels that may exceed the City’s noise standards. Because
local topography, vegetation, or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposures
at a particular location, the noise contours should be considered generalized and not site-
specific.
SN-38              MAJOR INVESTMENT STUDY AND PROJECT STUDY REPORT EQUIVALENT
                   (Existing)

(Korve Engineering, 2001) was prepared to identify the physical improvements and

management practices necessary to appropriately serve future travel demand. Current and
projected traffic operations along the study corridor (Highway 12 between Interstate 80 and the
Rio Vista Bridge) were evaluated through the calculation of levels of service, including four
roadway segments and three intersections in the Rio Vista city limits. Future-year projections in
this report focused on the near-term traffic levels (2010) rather than the buildout scenario
addressed in this General Plan update.
SN-39              ZONING ORDINANCE (SECTION 513) REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will review and update Section 513 of the Zoning Ordinance (Noise Regulation) to
ensure compliance with the goals, policies and standards contained in the Safety & Noise
element. Particular areas of change will include noise performance standards for gas well
operations (i.e., compressors) in residential neighborhoods and mobile or short duration types
of noise emissions, or noise generated by added equipment that does not require zoning
approval or a building permit. Types of problems covered by such provisions include on-site
vehicular operations, such as truck loading and unloading; operation of construction
equipment; and amplified music. Such noise abatement provisions generally would be enforced
on a complaint basis.
Because it is possible that a gas well site could be located less than 200 feet from a residence (the
“clear zone” is a 150-foot radius from the center of the site), Section 513 of the Zoning
Ordinance is not adequate. Further, gas well compressors may operate 24 hours per day, on a
continual basis. For the purpose of outdoor residential or recreational activities, the sensitivity
to constant noise is greater (lower tolerance level) than for individual noise events (such as
automobiles and aircraft). Therefore, the City will update the Zoning Ordinance to modify the
noise performance standard to 45 dBA (maximum) at the residential property line—this is 10 dB
higher than interior levels, which reflects an expectation of some outdoor noise.
These noise standards will be administered as a part of the regular zoning and building permit
application process. The applicant will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the
standards.
SN-40              HYDROCARBONS ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City’s Hydrocarbons Ordinance (Ordinance No. 476 of the Rio Vista Municipal Code) was
established to: (1) promote the economic recovery of natural gas in a manner compatible with
surrounding land uses; and (2) protect the public health and safety by establishing reasonable
limitations, safeguards, and controls on gas exploration, drilling, and production and
transportation of natural gas resources.
The ordinance will be reviewed and amended to: (1) reflect the City’s 45-dBA (maximum) noise
performance standard for gas well operations (i.e., compressors) near residential development;
(2) require that muffler systems be installed on compressors operated by internal combustion
engines if the sound from the compressor measures 60 dBA or more immediately outside any
non-industrial building used for human occupancy and located at a distance of 150 feet or more
from the compressor; and (3) ensure the adequacy of standards for noise, location, operations,
 Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     11-68                                    Safety & Noise
July18, 2002

and bonding provisions to implement the policies of the updated Rio Vista General Plan. The
Hydrocarbons Ordinance provides performance standards to supplement those found in
Section 513 of the Zoning Ordinance (Noise Ordinance) as mitigation for noise generated from
natural gas pipeline compression.
The Hydrocarbons Ordinance also will be amended to enforce the implementation of adequate
mitigation to guarantee public safety. The ordinance shall require that the City receive
assurances from the gas companies that all gas well sites, compressor sites, that dehydration
units will be checked on a daily basis by operators, and that data for gas operations will be
recorded; operators shall be required to be trained to identify potential problems and report any
negative findings to the appropriate personnel immediately and to the City, as deemed
appropriate, so that proper response can be initiated.
SN-41              CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to enforce the California Vehicle Code sections relating to adequate
mufflers and modified exhaust systems.

Chapter 12                     Public Facilities & Services
A. Introduction
This element concerns the public infrastructure and facilities that allow for the growth of the
community. Operational and programmatic issues are considered, but this chapter is primarily
concerned with the provision of capital facilities. Following is a brief description of the facilities
that are considered in this element.
CITY CAPITAL FACILITIES
          CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Civic and community facilities include the public buildings that house the various functions
and services provided by local government: public safety (police and fire) stations; city offices;
community and senior centers; libraries; large recreational structures, such as pools, recreation
centers, and theatres; corporation or maintenance facilities; and large capital equipment items
with long-term usage, such as fire engines and street maintenance vehicles.
          AIRPORT
Rio Vista has had a municipal airport since the 1950s. The airport was relocated to a new facility
that opened in 1992. New infrastructure and building sites for businesses have recently been
added, so the facility is both a public asset and an economic development opportunity,
although it has not yet achieved fiscal self-sufficiency.
          WATER SYSTEM
The existing community and future growth depends on the delivery of potable water to homes
and businesses and the expansion of that capability as demand increases. The current system
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                      12-1                          Public Facilities & Services
July 18, 2002
and supply are examined, along with the safeguards and actions necessary to facilitate
expansion.
          WASTEWATER SYSTEM
Wastewater treatment and collection capacity also must be provided in order to continue to
support the community and its expansion. The City currently has two small wastewater
treatment plants; another plant is needed if growth is to continue.
          WATER AND ENERGY CONSERVATION
The recent energy crisis has served to remind all Californians of the importance of conserving
electricity and heating fuel; even automobile travel has become somewhat price sensitive as
gasoline prices have risen. While not in the forefront of consumer consciousness, water may yet
become the scarcest commodity, both in the short term due to recent drought years and in the
long term due to the growing imbalance of statewide storage capacity in the face of rapid
statewide growth rates. This element addresses water and energy conservation. Energy
conservation also is considered in the Resource Conservation & Management and Housing
elements.
FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
          SCHOOLS
The discussion of schools includes not only classroom buildings but also fields, offices, libraries,
and support facilities. Issues include the size of facilities in proportion to the size of the
community; potential joint use and funding of commonly used facilities such as athletic fields
and libraries; and funding of adequate facilities to accommodate the growth of the community.
FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR
          ELECTRIC, GAS, AND COMMUNICATION UTILITIES
The past year has made all residents acutely aware of the importance of energy utilities,
particularly electrical and natural gas distribution systems. Growing in importance for both
daily living and commercial/industrial business activity are telecommunications delivery
systems and capacity. Cable television, wireless communication, telephone systems, and
internet connection systems are almost as critical as the basic power utilities. Ensuring that the
community has access to rapidly changing technology as well as adequate supplies of energy is
the central issue here.
          SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
The City contracts with a private waste disposal company to provide solid waste disposal
service for residents and businesses. A hazardous waste collection facility recently has been
constructed. The City is in the process of closing its former landfill site on Airport Road; no
active landfill site exists within the city limits. The City’s responsibility for recycling and source
reduction measures are addressed in the Resource Conservation & Management element.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                        12-2                           Public Facilities & Services
July 18, 2002

B.        Purpose and Authority
The purposes of the Public Facilities & Services element are to:
          •   Identify the facility and service needs of the City, for existing conditions and for
              conditions at buildout of the General Plan;
          •   Identify performance standards and other means to ensure that desired service levels
              are maintained throughout the buildout process; and
          •   Fulfill the community vision stated by the Rio Vista Principles that concern these
              issues.
Both this element and the Economic Development element are considered optional under
Government Code Section 65302 (the General Plan statutes). This code section states, “The
General Plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the
judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.” This
element most closely relates to the Land Use, Housing, and Economic Development elements,
as public facilities allow population and economic growth to occur.

July 18, 2002

     C.       The Rio Vista Principles: Implementing the Community Vision
The community vision and planning principles that most directly relate to the Public Facilities
& Services element are listed below.
PROVIDE ADEQUATE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES TO ALL RIO VISTANS IN
A FISCALLY SOUND AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER
     Growth should pay for itself. New development should ensure that sufficient public services are
     provided without additional burden to existing residents or over-extending current capacity.
     Rio Vista should continue its tradition of cooperation with private nonprofit agencies and other
     public agencies, to provide essential services for youth, seniors, the economically disadvantaged and
     those in crisis.
     Adequate public facilities – sewer, water, transportation, public safety, parks, recreation, education
     and others – should be in place or assured in a timely fashion before new development projects
     proceed.
     The Rio Vista Airport is a vital public facility and economic resource; new residential development
     must take steps to ensure that its viability is not threatened.

D.        Setting
The “Setting” section describes the existing public facilities and services in Rio Vista and the
City’s current needs. Figure 12-1 shows the locations of existing and proposed community
facilities and schools.
CITY CAPITAL FACILITIES
          CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
           CITY HALL
The current facility is located at the end of Main Street, adjacent to the Sacramento riverfront.
The building was constructed in the 1950s and expanded in the 1960s, when a municipal
courtroom and support offices were added. The municipal court facility ceased to operate in
the 1980s, and the entire structure now serves as both City Hall and Police Station. The total
size of the single-story building is about 7,000 square feet (sq. ft.). The former courtroom is now
the City Council chamber. Recent and planned growth in both administrative departments and
the Police Department have resulted in a shortage of needed space for both functions.
Current space needs are estimated at 4,000 sq. ft. for the Police Department and 5,000–6,000 sq.
ft. for the remainder of the administrative offices. A proposal is under consideration that would
move the Police Department to temporary facilities and renovate the building. This action
would provide adequate administrative space for about 5–10 years.
          POLICE STATION
As noted above, the Police Station currently shares the same building with City Hall. Current
space needs require the Police Station to relocate. A temporary location in the Rio Vista Business
Park (former airport) is under consideration. Modular buildings would provide the temporary
office space. Although not ideal, this arrangement could provide adequate space for up to 5
years. Potential future sites for the Police Station have not been thoroughly researched; at
present, the only specific alternative is a building owned by the City and currently used in part
for the Senior Center, adjacent to the current City Hall on Main Street. Other general areas
where the future station could be constructed include various locations downtown,
Highway 12, River Road, the proposed Business Park site, and other undetermined locations.
Only one facility is needed, as police units are dispatched while patrolling; however, a sub-
station could be provided for public services in a future commercial center, community
building, or other City facility if the need arises.
          FIRE STATION AND EQUIPMENT
One fire station of approximately 5,000 sq. ft. is located on the corner of Main and Third Streets
downtown. A second facility is needed to maintain recommended response times to the
northwest neighborhoods (Trilogy, Gibbs and Brann Ranches, and the Rio Vista Airport). A
Class A pumper and a Class C grass fire engine have been purchased within the last year. Other
equipment is aging and will need to be replaced over the next 5 years.

Rio Vista General Plan 2001 12-6 Public Facilities & Services
July 18, 2002
          SENIOR CENTER
Approximately 2,000 sq. ft. of the building located adjacent to City Hall on Main Street is used
as a Senior Center, administered and funded by a nonprofit organization, “Citizens for Seniors.”
The facility contains a meeting/dining room and kitchen. Citizens for Seniors provides lunch
programs, recreational activities, and other services for Rio Vista seniors—particularly for those
on low or limited incomes. For the most part, residents of Trilogy do not participate, as the
Trilogy homeowner’s association provides a recreation center and community and recreation
services for its residents. The current citywide facility is in need of expansion and renovation.
          RECREATION CENTER
Rio Vista currently provides for youth recreation programs in a building located on Sacramento
Street downtown, known as the “Youth Center.” Constructed prior to 1940, the building was
donated by the Lions Club in the 1970s. The facility is approximately 6,000 sq. ft. and is in need
of extensive repairs and upgrades to be fully functional. It consists primarily of a large meeting
or sports room, a stage, and a kitchen. The kitchen also needs repairs and new equipment.
Parking is limited. Some community meetings and events take place in the building.
          PUBLIC WORKS MAINTENANCE/CORPORATION YARD
A maintenance facility for the Public Works Department is located on the west side of St.
Francis Road, adjacent to the County Corporation Yard, near the Business Park. The property is
5 acres and contains a garage/vehicle repair building, office, and crew quarters. A modular
building serves as the Public Works Director’s office. The facility will need to be expanded or
replaced sometime during the planning period of the General Plan. No programming or
estimation of future size needs has been done and it is not known for how long the current
facility will be adequate.
          CITY SWIMMING POOL
The City owns and maintains a public swimming pool in Bruning Park. The pool has five lanes
for competitive swimming and is used by Rio Vista High School, local youth swim clubs, and
the public at large. The pool is open seasonally from March to May for high school swim team
use and from May to late August for swim club and public use. The pool was built in 1951 and
will need to be replaced and expanded in the future.
          OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
Veterans Memorial Building. Solano County operates a meeting hall facility used by various
groups, primarily for veterans’ activities. The building is available for rental and use by the
public.
Solano County Library. Solano County operates the library system, which includes a facility in
Rio Vista (see discussion below).

          RIO VISTA AIRPORT
The Rio Vista Airport is located north of Airport Road and west of Church Road. The facility
has two runways, one 4,200 feet and the other 2,200 feet ,as well as a helipad. The facility is
now 10 years old. Recent upgrades include water, sewer, and additional utility improvements;
an improved 12-acre business park; and a new office/administration building. Several “fixed
base operators” (FBOs) are located onsite, including a mechanic. The City operates a fuel
concession at the site, as well as hangars of various sizes for rent. Approximately 50 aircraft are
located at the site. The new office building and one hangar building recently were occupied by
a private company not related to airport operations. The 12-acre business park can
accommodate up to 100,000 sq. ft. of building development sites or pads. The future Fire Station
No. 2 will be located here.
          WATER SYSTEM
Figure 12-2 shows the existing water delivery system. The City’s municipal water system
consists of a series of wells tapping into a deep aquifer. Treatment of the well water occurs at
the well head, primarily through the addition of hypochlorite (by a direct injection system).
Due to the purity of the deep aquifer source, there is no central treatment facility. Water is
distributed by a series of pumps and underground pipes, and is collected in a 2-million-gallon
central storage tank located behind Esperson Court—at the southwest corner of the existing
community (see Figure 12-2).
The storage tank was built in 1965. There are 12 wells. The age of the wells and distribution
lines ranges from many decades (the oldest facilities that serve the downtown and historic
neighborhoods) to less than 10 years (the Trilogy development).
Existing data from the California Department of Water Resources were cited in the
environmental impact reports for the 1991 annexations. Although general, the State data
indicate that capacity is adequate for some time to come. The aquifer is the subject of a more
specific and comprehensive study by the City Engineer to determine its size and capacity for
future growth.
Supplemental water sources include the Sacramento River and the North Bay Aqueduct (NBA).
An agreement with the Solano Water Authority, which controls the North Bay aqueduct water
in Solano County, allows for access to that source. Due to the distance from Rio Vista to the
NBA facility, however, it is more likely that the City would “trade” its rights to the NBA source
for additional Sacramento River water, if needed. The Sacramento River may be tapped into
only for emergency purposes (fire fighting). If river water were to be used for potable water, a
water treatment plant would need to be built.
The City’s current needs are related more to delivery than capacity. Presently, most of the
newer, higher capacity wells are located on the north side of Highway 12. Only one 8-inch line
crosses Highway 12 at Gardiner Way, creating potential reliability problems in emergencies. A
10-inch line is anticipated to cross the highway at Drouin Drive, which would be constructed by
private development on the north side of the highway. This line would create a much-needed
loop that would provide better access from the southside storage tank to the northside wells.
Future growth needs are discussed in the “Outlook” section.

          WASTEWATER SYSTEM
Like the water system, the existing collection system for wastewater varies from less than
10 years in newer developments to more than 100 years old in some of the historic
neighborhoods. A series of gravity-fed and pressurized lines and lift stations connect to two
plants: the main plant, located next to the river on Beach Drive, south of the city limits and east
of Montezuma Hills Road; and the Trilogy plant, a small facility (200,000 gallons per day
capacity) located on the Trilogy property. Although the Trilogy plant is on private property, the
City owns and operates the plant.
The Beach Drive plant is currently in the final stages of an upgrade to approximately 0.65
million gallons per day (mgd) capacity and is operating at about 90 percent of that capacity.
Between 0.05- and 0.1-mgd capacity remains for the Business Park; commercial construction on
Highway 12 and downtown; and the Vineyard Bluffs Project, 50 homes currently under
construction. Actual capability to connect homes, assuming 300 gallons per day as a household
demand, ranges from 150 to 300 homes. Removing a margin for error of half and assuming
some need for commercial purposes, less than 100 residential units’ equivalent of capacity
remains.
The Trilogy plant is currently at about one-third of its capacity, with an additional 600–800
residential units’ equivalent capacity remaining, at the rate of current use. (This assumes that
the Trilogy development continues as a seniors-only project and only senior households are
connected in the future.) Some additional capacity also will be taken up by the new
clubhouse/recreation center currently under construction.
Figure 12-3 shows the existing wastewater collection system and Beach Drive plant. The City is
planning a new plant east of the airport and north of Airport Road. The City recently completed
an engineering programming study and is funding a financing study. Environmental review
has begun; design is expected to begin by the end of 2001, with construction in 2003. The goal is
to bring the new plant on line before the Trilogy plant running out of capacity. As design
progresses, the City will apply to the Regional Water Quality Control Board for a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.
          WATER AND ENERGY CONSERVATION
The water system is discussed above; it is presently thought, pursuant to existing State data,
that the aquifer used by Rio Vista has capacity for future growth. The City Engineer’s study will
confirm or refute this and provide much more specific and useful information for planning.
Public awareness and concern about energy supplies in the state have increased over the past
year. PG&E provides electricity and natural gas to Rio Vista; no power plant is located near the
city.
Like many cities in the Central Valley of California, Rio Vista has not metered residential water
use in the past. Water rates for residential customers are a flat rate, regardless of use. It is
estimated that significant water conservation could be achieved by instituting metering and a
usage-based rate system. Meters are being installed in all new subdivisions, although they are
not now being read.

July 18, 2002

The City of Rio Vista has discussed the eventuality of power blackouts affecting energy supply
and has incorporated measures into its emergency response planning. Conservation in general
can reduce energy demand statewide between 5 and 20 percent, depending on which source is
quoted. Any energy saved due to conservation will free up capacity and reduce the immediate
need for new power plants, although conservation alone will not solve the problem. The City
presently employs energy conservation measures in its public buildings through the use of light
timers, reduction in the hours of lighting, and conducting energy audits. The City plans to
incorporate energy-efficient windows and heating and cooling systems in City Hall and
elsewhere.

FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
          SCHOOLS
Rio Vista is in the River Delta Unified School District (RDUSD). RDUSD covers a large area that
includes portions of three counties (Solano, Yolo, and Sacramento) and the communities of
Clarksburg, Walnut Grove, Isleton, Birds Landing/Collinsville, and Rio Vista. Three schools are
currently located in Rio Vista: D. H. White Elementary School (K–4; Riverview Middle School
(5–8); and Rio Vista High School (9–12). D. H. White has a site of about 11 acres; Riverview’s site
is approximately 7 acres and the high school site is about 26 acres. Figure 12-1 shows the existing
school sites.
The current enrollment at D. H. White is approximately 300 students, with a building capacity
of 450 and a site capacity of approximately 500 at K–4 and 700 at K–6. Riverview School
currently has about 400 enrolled, with 425 building capacity and 300 site capacity (by State
standards this site is undersized for the present building capacity). Rio Vista High School
currently enrolls 450, with a capacity of 621 in existing buildings and about 625 on the site. All
building and site capacities are calculated according to California Department of Education
standards.
          PUBLIC LIBRARY
The Solano County Library System operates its Rio Vista Branch on Second Street, downtown.
The library is conveniently located near City Hall, downtown commercial, and the majority of
Rio Vista’s residents who live in the existing community neighborhoods. The existing facility is
approximately 5,370 sq. ft.
FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR
          TRILOGY
The Trilogy senior housing development under construction has private clubhouses,
recreational facilities, and small private park sites available for use by its residents and guests.
The development contains the following facilities:
          •   A Small Clubhouse (about 7,000 sq. ft.) contains meeting rooms, exercise equipment,
              an outdoor swimming pool, and tennis courts.
          •   A large Clubhouse/recreation center (about 27,000 sq. ft.) that is under construction
              contains an indoor pool; large exercise rooms; facilities, banquet, and meeting halls;
              tennis and other racquet courts; and social rooms.
          •   Various smaller private park sites (equivalent to neighborhood parks) contain
              walking paths, water amenities, picnic areas, and active/passive facilities such as
              bocce ball courts and horseshoe pits.

          RIO VISTA GOLF CLUB
Located at Trilogy, the Rio Vista Golf Club is a privately operated 18-hole golf course that is
open to the public. The facility includes a clubhouse and restaurant and pro shop.
          UTILITIES
          ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS
Electricity and natural gas in Rio Vista are provided by PG&E. While natural gas coverage is
good in all residential neighborhoods, much of the industrial and commercial areas from River
Road to the airport do not yet have natural gas service. Propane is used in these areas. There
are no plans to build any new power plants or transmission facilities in Rio Vista; however,
some discussion has been held regarding small “peaker” plants or the possibility of a bio-fuels
plant that could supply Rio Vista’s needs independently of the larger utility companies. (See
Chapter 10 for reference to bio-fuels.) A new wind farm (wind-powered energy generation) of up to
60 megawatts (MW) has been proposed for a site in the Montezuma Hills about 10 miles
southwest of Rio Vista.
          TELEPHONE SERVICE
Citizens Communications provides local telephone service to Rio Vista and several other Delta
communities between Rio Vista and Elk Grove, near Sacramento. Because Rio Vista is not a
large service area, access to newer technology lags behind service in some other Solano County
communities. New technologies, such as wireless internet and telephone service, may provide
additional alternatives.
          CABLE TELEVISION AND INTERNET SERVICES
Cable television and internet services are provided by two national companies: AT&T and
Charter Communications. AT&T serves the pre-1990 neighborhoods and downtown; Charter
Communications serves Trilogy. That the two cable services are not linked is becoming an
increasing problem with the continuing buildout of Trilogy. Trilogy residents do not have
access to important community event coverage, such as City Council meetings.
In addition to AT&T and other nationwide providers, several local internet providers are in the
area.
          SOLID WASTE
Solid waste disposal services are provided by Rio Vista Sanitation Service (RVSS) to Rio Vista
residents and businesses. The City does not have an active landfill; a former landfill is currently
being closed, with construction underway. Solid waste is presently transported to the Potrero
Hills Landfill (PHLF) in Contra Costa County. A household hazardous waste collection facility
is located at the City corporation yard, with transport and disposal provided by outside
agencies and private carriers.

CURRENT FINANCIAL MECHANISMS
          DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
The City has adopted a fee schedule that is intended to fund the capital facilities necessary to
serve future growth. Pursuant to State Government Code Section 66000, et seq., as amended,
these fees have been evaluated and applied through development agreements and ordinance.
The latest revisions have occurred through the development agreement adoption and
amendment process; because little growth is occurring outside properties subject to these
agreements, the citywide fee structure has not been updated recently.
Table 12-1 shows the City’s current fee structure for a three-bedroom, single-family home in
various development agreement areas and citywide, as adopted by ordinance.

Other public agencies that collect development impact fees in Rio Vista include the RDUSD and
Solano County. The County’s fee is similar in purpose to the City’s municipal facilities fee,
providing for administrative buildings, courts, jails, and libraries. The RDUSD charges a fee
that pays for the new schools and facilities required to house the students generated by growth.
The fee also pays for administrative and service facilities, such as offices and transportation.
The County’s fee is now set at $2,395/single-family home in Rio Vista. State law and specific
agreements with individual developers set the school fee; the fee is currently $3.20/sq. ft. of
residential building area and $0.30/sq. ft. for commercial uses.
          OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Providing the initial capital facility is only the beginning. Capital costs are a one-time
expenditure that is suited to financing from a one-time revenue source, such as development
fees that are paid only when permits are issued for new construction. Operation and
maintenance costs are ongoing for the life of the facility or service and must be funded by an
ongoing, reliable revenue source. Typically, those sources are general fund tax revenues or user
fees paid by those receiving the service, such as water and sewer rates and assessments.
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                            12-15                                Public Facilities & Services
July 18, 2002

The City has had difficulty keeping up with recommended maintenance schedules and service
levels due to fiscal problems dating to the mid-1980s. City buildings, parks, streets, and other
assets have been maintained to at least minimal standards; but some maintenance has been
deferred. Modernization of existing facilities or upgrades to current standards must be paid for
by revenues raised from the existing population. Development impact fees can be used only for
new capital needs directly related to growth. For future needs, it is crucial to ensure that not
only can capital be raised to build the facility but also that operations and maintenance
revenues are in place by the time the facilities are complete. Likewise, the RDUSD and other
public agencies such as the County often face restricted budgets and deferred maintenance
issues.
In 1990, prior to the annexations, a conceptual-level fiscal impact study was conducted for
anticipated growth. At that time, the Marks Ranch (Trilogy) was not yet designated as a
development restricted to seniors, with private streets. The report considered police and fire
service needs, and administrative and public works maintenance and service costs. Park
maintenance and most capital facilities were not considered, but equipment and some building
expansions were included. The report concluded that the City could generate sufficient
revenues for the costs of operating and maintaining the additional facilities and provide the
services necessary to accommodate the projected growth at buildout, under 1990s land use
assumptions, provided that an ongoing tax assessment on all new and existing homes and
business properties be enacted to support the additional needs of the Fire Department. New
annual revenues would be needed beyond the City’s existing sources and those reasonably
anticipated to be generated by the new growth at buildout. In other words, new growth would
fall short of paying for itself unless the additional revenues were created.

E.        Outlook
CITY CAPITAL FACILITIES
          CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
          CITY HALL AND POLICE STATION
The additional staffing and space needs created by the anticipated buildout population in 2020
can be estimated by using average standards for other cities similar in size to that of Rio Vista at
buildout. Rio Vista’s current City Hall and Police Station is about 7,000 sq. ft. The Police
Department estimates a current need for about 4,000 sq. ft. to suffice for 5–10 years. The current
City Hall structure, with the removal of the Police Department, has sufficient floor area to
accommodate Council Chambers and administrative offices for the same period of time. After
that, a new facility will need to be built to serve the City’s needs to 2020.
No site for the ultimate facility has been chosen; that will be the subject of community
discussion in coming months. However, there is consensus that the facility needs to be in the
Downtown, perhaps on or adjacent to the existing site or on another site in the immediate area.
The clustering of other related facilities, such as the library, recreation/community center,
senior center, and police station, has advantages of proximity and convenience but is not
essential. A master plan for a civic center site or sites in downtown needs to be created in the
near future. Current expectations for 2020 space needs are for up to 20,000 sq. ft. for City Hall
and about 8,000 sq. ft. for the Police Station.
Unlike fire stations, police are on patrol in the neighborhoods and are dispatched from a central
location; multiple facilities are not necessary, but substations may be desired for specific
neighborhoods. This element assumes that one central station is required; any desired
substation will be housed in a joint use facility, such as a community center or fire station.
Equipment needs are considered as an operations cost, since police vehicles typically are rotated
out after about 2 years due to severe wear and excessive mileage.
          FIRE STATION AND EQUIPMENT
A station programming study recommends that a second facility be located adjacent to Airport
Road near Liberty Island Road. The new facility is projected to be about 6,000 sq. ft. and will
contain training rooms, sleeping quarters, and various equipment.
          AIRPORT
The City’s airport represents both a valuable public facility asset and an economic development
opportunity. (The Economic Development element contains a discussion of the economic development
potential and policies specific to the airport.) The facility is expected to continue to serve an
increased number of aircraft. Services for aircraft and pilots will need to increase to keep up
with the demand for use. Additional services, such as repair and maintenance, car rental, wash
facilities and the like, will need to be added. The airport’s Master Plan is now 14 years old and
needs to be updated, with an eye toward operational services. An FAA grant has been received

July 18, 2002

for this purpose; the Master Plan update is expected to be completed within the 2001-02 fiscal
year.
          WATER SYSTEM
The projected population increases will require a reliable source for additional water. The
aquifer study will determine the capability of the existing well system to continue to expand in
order to meet anticipated demand. As discussed in the “Setting” section, there is reason to
believe that the aquifer is adequate; if this turns out to be a false assumption, new sources will
be sought. The NBA and Sacramento River offer limited sources to cover shortfalls in
groundwater supply. If a shortage is significant, new agreements must be negotiated with water
agencies before the aquifer is seriously affected. The delivery system will be improved as new
development takes place. Figure 12-2 shows the proposed water delivery facilities.
          WASTEWATER SYSTEM
The current population is served by the existing Beach Drive plant and Trilogy plant (see Setting
discussion). Anticipated population growth will require the new Northwest Waste Water
Treatment Plant (NWWTP) to be constructed soon. This new plant will be constructed in
phases; the first phase likely will have a capacity of 1.0 mgd, approximately half of the projected
2020 population demand for this plant. A second phase is currently proposed to be constructed
after 2010 that likely will be the same size as the first phase, with a total planned capacity at
buildout of 2.0 mgd. Other phasing options may be considered if shown to be cost effective. The
first phase of the plant is expected to be completed in 2003.
Figure 12-4 shows all of the City’s wastewater service area and proposed facilities, including the
proposed NWWTP and distribution system.
          WATER CONSERVATION
It is anticipated that, at some point in the future, meters will be used for billing water. How
important conservation is to maintaining the City’s water supply will be better known when the
City Engineer’s aquifer study is complete. However, conservation measures, as discussed in
more detail in the Resource Conservation & Management element, should be implemented to
better use natural resources in general, regardless of the impact on the City’s particular needs.
FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
          SCHOOLS
The River Delta Unified School District (RDUSD) Facilities Master Plan (RDUSD, 2000) projects the
need for two new elementary school sites and one conversion to serve the projected Rio Vista
population, provided Trilogy continues to build out in the senior community concept. If Trilogy
were to convert a large portion of its site to family housing, at least one additional elementary
school would be needed. Some 1,940 K–8 students and 979 students in grades 9–12 are
estimated to attend Rio Vista schools by the 2020 planning horizon.

about 15 percent smaller. The number of sites should be increased after a particular size is
reached, rather than further increases to the size of facilities. The guidelines are shown in Table
12-2.
 Future school sites are shown in Figure 12-1. The new elementary school would be located on
either the Brann or Gibbs Ranch sites and would serve both of those neighborhoods. The new
middle school is anticipated to be located on the Esperson site, near the existing neighborhoods
off Drouin Drive, west of Drouin Park. The new middle school would need to be approximately
12–20 acres, depending on whether formal track and football fields are added and reduced class
sizes are mandated. The high school would need to add approximately 20 acres to the site in
order to meet State requirements for the projected enrollment.
          LIBRARY
The Solano County Library Facilities Master Plan (County of Solano, 2001) projects a need for an
additional 11,500 sq. ft. as an addition to the existing facility, a new facility on another site, or a
second facility—either co-located with a RDUSD facility or another City facility, or standing
alone. Consistent with the policies of the Land Use and Economic Development elements, the
City would prefer the new facility to be developed as one of the following options:
          •   Add on to the existing facility in its current location.
          •   Construct a new facility of 16,000+ sq. ft. at another site downtown, possibly in
              conjunction with a future City Hall/civic center campus.
          •   Add on to the existing facility or construct a new facility but not to the entire need,
              with a smaller branch facility constructed in one of the Neighborhood Core District
              sites or possibly in conjunction with a future school facility. The total of the two

              branches would be the needed 16,000+ sq. ft., and the main branch would be located
              downtown.
          •   The current County policy provides operation, maintenance, equipment, and
              inventory (books and materials), and the city where the library facility is located
              provides the building space. Cities own or arrange for space to accommodate the
              library facility; this presumes a partnership in funding the building. A number of
              mechanisms are possible, ranging from one entity’s providing the entire building
              fund to joint efforts in securing grants or other public funds between a variety of
              agencies, including the county, library, school district, city, and nonprofit
              organizations.
FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR
          UTILITIES
          ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS
Californians have become more energy conscious since the energy crisis in 1972. The advent of
deregulation, rapidly escalating cost of energy, and ever-decreasing availability of fuel sources
have prompted government agencies to conserve energy and look for alternatives to the use of
non-renewable resources. Strategies used by the State and local communities include
improving the efficiency of transportation systems, replacing fixtures that use a lot of energy
with newer and more efficient equipment, and promoting recycling. These strategies also are
discussed in the Resource Conservation & Management element and other sections of this
element.
Communities throughout the State presently are experiencing rolling blackouts as a result of the
imbalance at certain times between the supply of and demand for electricity. The Indpendent
Systems Operator (ISO), which serves as a power brokerage, operates the State’s electricity
power grid and tells the distributors of electricity they need to shed some load (blackout certain
areas to reduce the demand or “load” on the system) when there is not enough available power
to supply the entire State’s demand. This is when “rolling blackouts” occur.
As electricity demand continues to outstrip the available supply in California, Rio Vistans need
to change the way they use and manage these limited power resources. Reports from the ISO
indicate that statewide energy conservation is significantly reducing the demand. Until
additional or alternative power generation sources come online, energy conservation will
become increasingly important to the community.
There is a potential for using bio-fuels or bio-solids (organic material such as discarded
agricultural products [e.g., corn stalks and wheat grasses]) from the Delta to power a generating
plant in the vicinity (also refer to the Resources Conservation & Management element). Current Rio
Vista demands are about 4-5 MW; future demand will grow to about 20 MW at today’s energy
usage rates. If feasible, a biofuel plant might provide a large portion of Rio Vista’s demand or
perhaps even excess capacity. Various solid wastes might also be used for co-generation. As a
rule of thumb, electrical service requires 1 MW per 1,000 population. The 5– to 10–MW bio-fuels

plant mentioned above or a typical small “peaker” plant (50–60 MW) could supply all or at least
a major portion of Rio Vista’s projected 20+–MW demand in 2020.
Natural gas is available from PG&E. Although numerous gas wells exist in and around Rio
Vista, local end-use supply is distributed from main lines not controlled locally. If the supply of
natural gas becomes limited and subject to interruption like electricity, the need may arise to
consider similar conservation measures and local production facilities in addition to those being
discussed for electrical power.
          TELEPHONE SERVICE
Increasingly, access to current high-speed communication services is becoming essential in all
business sectors, not just technology. To date, the existing provider has not been able or willing
to provide services that use the most recent technologies, which urban areas have become
accustomed to having available (e.g., digital subscriber line [DSL], broadband, and fiber-optic
capabilities). The City may need to explore alternatives in order to attract new businesses.
          CABLE TELEVISION AND INTERNET SERVICES
Although the cable television and internet service systems are currently adequate, there are
growing concerns about the ability to serve emerging needs, particularly in the
telecommunications area. The existence of two cable television companies is problematic in that
the Trilogy project is cut off from public access TV events; other future projects in the northwest
area (Gibbs and Brann Ranches) may have problems gaining access if the situation continues. So
far, AT&T has been unwilling to extend service to these areas and may not be interested as long
as Charter Communications continues to serve the large Trilogy population. Citizens
Communications telephone service is adequate for basic telephone service but lags behind
providers in other parts of Solano County in availability of latest technologies, such as DSL
internet connection capability. This may make cable television all the more important since
high-speed internet cable connections also are being provided by the cable television
companies.
          SOLID WASTE
The City will continue to contract for solid waste disposal with private service providers. Key
issues with future franchise agreements include recycling, hazardous waste disposal, service
frequency, and community benefit (free dump days, household hazardous waste collection
events, and green waste removal).
Future development as proposed with this General Plan would not affect Rio Vista Sanitation
Service’s (RVSS) ability to provide solid waste service to the City of Rio Vista. RVSS and its
affiliated solid waste collection, transfer, and recycling companies would be able to support the
project growth in Rio Vista for the next 20 years. There are no special issues or standards related
to expanding services to new developments.

The Potrero Hills Sanitary Landfill will continue to be closely monitored under regulations of
the Integrated Solid Waste Management Board, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and

          DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
It is the City’s intent to update the fees citywide and ensure that all future development
agreements and agreement amendments contain updated and adequate fees in order to fund
the infrastructure needed to serve new growth. Table 12-3 shows the anticipated facilities that
must be funded by the municipal impact fee over the planning period, to buildout.
The City’s water and sewer funds are enterprise funds; connection fees are charged to pay for
the cost of projected new facilities, such as wells, pumps, water storage tanks, treatment tanks,
delivery and conveyance systems (pipes and mains), and other capital expenses associated with
expansion. For large projects, such as Trilogy, the developer is credited with the cost of
providing the needed facilities against the connection fees otherwise owed. The City must be
careful, however, to ensure that the fees are set at a sufficiently high level to cover the needs at
buildout and to ensure that early credits do not preclude needed facilities later on.
Although parks and arterial streets are the subjects of other elements, these facilities also are
funded by development impact fees. These fees recently have been evaluated and adjusted for
the Marks and Gibbs Ranch Development Agreements that were amended last year. As new
agreements are created and other existing agreements amended, fees should be evaluated and
adjusted to meet anticipated needs. Fees should remain flexible rather than being “locked in” so
that needs arising after the date of the agreement can be met.

          OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE
The City needs to conduct a thorough analysis of the service costs of future growth before a
large new demand arises. The City should determine an adequate and desirable level of service
and identify, at intervals throughout the planning period, whether known revenue sources are
able to cover anticipated costs relating to the increase in population. Such a cost-revenue
analysis should further identify which services will pay for themselves and which will not;
potential new revenue sources to cover the additional costs; and the potential for increasing
existing sources. A strategic financing plan for facilities and maintenance should be devised to
address the needs identified by the cost-revenue study.

SCHOOLS
Provision of quality school facilities and educational opportunities is a community priority.
Schools are both educational facilities and important components of community and
neighborhood infrastructure. Schools must be developed in a cost-effective manner and take
advantage of joint-use opportunities in combination with other public resources. They should
be perceived as community assets and function as integral parts of the neighborhoods in which
they are located.

               City may require new development to
               participate in the provision of school
               facilities in a timely manner.
  12.3.B       The City shall encourage joint-use of       PF-5    Interagency Coordination
               facilities in all cases, unless overriding  PF-11   Joint-Use Study and Agreements
               circumstances make joint use

  12.3.F       The City and the school districts shall     PF-4    Development Review
               develop criteria for the designation of     PF-5    Interagency Coordination
               school sites and opportunities for          PF-10   Development Agreements
               reducing land and development costs         PF-11   Joint-Use Study and Agreements
               while developing schools as neigh-
               borhood resources. The City shall
               make every attempt to ensure that the
               locations, design, and development of
               new school sites are consistent with this
               General Plan and neighborhood
               concerns
  12.3.G       In order to be consistent with other City   PF-4    Development Review
               policies and the Rio Vista Principles       PF-5    Interagency Coordination
               (Preserve the small-town character), the    PF-10   Development Agreements
               City’s preference is to maintain small
               schools at a similar size as today.
               Rather than increase the size of schools
               to a point that is not consistent with
               today’s quality of life, Rio Vista schools
               should be smaller than the typical
               “standard” in larger suburban districts.
               The number of sites should be
               increased after a particular size is
               reached, rather than further increases to
               the size of facilities. The guidelines are
               adopted as shown in Table 12-2.

G.        Implementing Actions for Public Facilities & Services (PF)
Each of the following actions will be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and
policies of the Public Facilities & Services element.
PF-1               CIVIC FACILITIES MASTER PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare a Civic Facilities Master Plan. This plan will assess the central staffing
and facility needs for administrative and community functions; facilitate coordination of
operation between interdependent departments; and emphasize efficiency through
centralization and “one-stop service” for public activities whenever possible. Financing
mechanisms will be outlined in the plan’s implementation program.
PF-2               DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to collect and adjust all of the City’s development impact fees, including
connection fees for water and wastewater plants and distribution/collection facilities; the park
development fee; and the municipal facilities fee. These fees are used to fund infrastructure,
park and recreation facilities, and civic and community facilities pursuant to adopted master
plans.
PF-3               CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop a 5-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for all City public capital
projects that identifies priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction, and
operations. The CIP will be developed in conjunction with the budget and will cover a period of
5 years from its inception. The CIP will be reviewed, amended, and adopted with the City’s
budget on an annual or biannual basis, as applicable. The CIP should include Redevelopment
and grant-funded projects, as well as projects funded from City sources.
PF-4               DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
                   (Existing)
The City will use the development entitlement review process to provide for adequate facilities
and to ensure their consistency with the General Plan and all applicable policies and
regulations.
The City will consider service delivery and fiscal impacts of both private development projects
and public projects as allowed by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City’s
environmental policies, and this General Plan. The City will continue to consider the
environmental and policy impacts of projects. The City will provide for mitigation measures
where potentially significant impacts are identified.
Prior to completion of the AB1600 citywide master analysis (PF-27), the share of financial
responsibility for the facilities costs and impacts on the community will be determined on a
Rio Vista General Plan 2001                     12-35                        Public Facilities & Services

project by project basis. The project sponsor or developer will be responsible for the cost of this
analysis. The City may require a particular project to fund the master study, with
reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the particular project through credits
against developer fees when building permits are issued.
PF-5               INTERAGENCY COORDINATION
                   (Existing)
The City will coordinate recreation, library, and planning efforts with the River Delta Unified
School District, Solano County, and other applicable agencies. Such coordination will help to
ensure the clustering of community activities and should emphasize expansion and diversity of
services and facilities, rather than duplication.
PF-6               PARKS MASTER PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will prepare a Parks Master Plan as specified in the Open Space & Recreation element.
The plan will define standards that will result in adequate provision of parklands and facilities.
The plan will permit flexibility in designating active and passive recreation areas, depending on
resident characteristics and needs, with emphasis on clustering and interconnecting community
facilities, including schools. The plan will be consistent with the goals and policies of the Open
Space & Recreation element. A short-term (5 years) facilities plan is already underway.
PF-7               LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL FUNDS
                   (Existing and Proposed)
The City will continue to pursue existing and alternative sources of funding in order to provide
parklands and facilities that will adequately meet community needs. The City will identify and
evaluate financial mechanisms that can be used to maintain and operate recreational facilities
and protect the City’s investment in them. The City will identify funding to obtain easements in
order to accommodate the facilities and construct trails and paths through floodway and
floodplain areas as needed along the length of all waterways, as shown on the adopted Trails
and Pathways Map (see the Open Space & Recreation element). Other sources may include State
bond acts, federal and state grants, assessment districts, and public/private partnerships.
Neighborhood groups may be an additional source of finance and voluntary labor to meet
recreational needs.
PF-8               PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
                   (Existing)
The City will actively solicit public involvement in the siting of community facilities and
identification of programs through the public meeting and review process. The City will
consult community–based organizations, including Friends of the Library, and involve them in
the decision-making process to strengthen support for library programs.

PF-9               OTHER FUNDING SOURCES
                   (Existing)
Pursue any other funding sources, such as nonprofit grants, private sector funding, or
partnerships that create funding opportunities.
PF-10              DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
                   (Existing)
The City will use development agreements for larger projects to provide for specific
mechanisms and financing of infrastructure, facilities, and services, as appropriate. The City
will ensure that both new agreements and amendments to previous agreements are consistent
with City policies and standards, as well as the particular needs of the projects that are the
subject of the agreements.
PF-11              JOINT-USE STUDY AND AGREEMENTS
                   (Existing)
The City will prepare a joint-use study for all school sites, starting with existing sites and
continuing with new sites as they are proposed and developed. The study will establish the
feasibility of pursuing a joint-use agreement among service providers, including the River Delta
Unified School District and the City. This study will identify opportunities to maximize public
use of the facilities, minimize duplication of services provided, and facilitate shared financial
and operation responsibilities. If shared use is determined to be advantageous to the parties,
they should enter into a joint-use agreement. This agreement will specify joint-use policies,
provision of services, and obligations of each party with respect to finances, operations, and
maintenance. The park facilities portion will be done in conjunction with the Parks Master Plan.
PF-12              STATE EDUCATION FUNDS
                   (Existing)
The City and River Delta Unified School District will continue to actively pursue state funds for
school facilities. State funds may provide partial support to school facilities funding.
Contingency funding will be identified, should state sources be reduced or eliminated. A
higher priority for the eligibility for state funds, if and when such funds are available, may be
provided to school districts that choose to adopt year-round school programs
PF-13              LOCAL SCHOOL FEES
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to cooperate with the River Delta Unified School District in collecting the
fees legally permitted under State law and as agreed through specific agreements between the
District and developers.
PF-14              SCHOOL FACILITIES MASTER PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will observe the River Delta Unified School District (RDUSD) Facilities Master Plan
(RDUSD, 2000) and participate in its periodic update. The plan is a 20-year capital

July 18, 2002
improvement plan detailing school and related facilities needed to accommodate projected
student population increases in the District during the 1999-2019 period. The City will keep
abreast of changes; coordinate proposed siting facilities with the District; and attempt to
influence the District’s planning in relation to the General Plan policies.
To the extent possible under State law, the City can indirectly affect siting of schools by
allowing certain sites or locations to be used for schools on planned unit development maps,
specific plans, tentative maps, and in development agreement language (the last is most
effective, since it is a binding, negotiated agreement).
PF-15              ZONING ORDINANCE REVIEW AND UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include specific standards that ensure, to the
extent feasible, that location choices for installation of cables and utilities are compatible with
the goals and policies of the Utility component of the Public Facilities & Services element and
the Land Use element. In addition, the City will address standards for the siting of energy
facilities in the Zoning Ordinance.
PF-16              FRANCHISE ORDINANCE AND NEGOTIATIONS
                   (Proposed)
The City will establish and review its franchise ordinance and regulations to ensure that the
maximum control and leverage can be exercised over telecommunications services, both in the
manner and means of service provision and the granting of easements on City property and
rights-of-way. This review will overlap into development standards and regulations, such as
the Subdivision Ordinance and other development standards. The City will use expert
assistance in reviewing contract and franchise proposals and in conducting negotiations with
utilities and private service providers.
PF-17              POWER PLANT AND PUBLIC FINANCING FEASIBILITY STUDY
                   (Proposed)
The City will conduct an analysis of the feasibility of locating a power plant in or near the City
and providing for a priority service for Rio Vista to preclude local blackouts. The study should
consider the feasibility of joint powers agreements or public facilities districts in conjunction
with other agencies. Physical, environmental, fiscal, financial, and socioeconomic factors should
be addressed in the analysis.
PF-18              AQUIFER STUDY
                   (Existing)
The City Engineer is currently overseeing the preparation of a study of the aquifer that
underlies the City and surrounding area. The study will evaluate the depth, size, recharge rate,
and capacity of the aquifer to accommodate the City’s projected future growth. The study will
be completed in Fall 2002 and will determine the need to develop additional water sources
during the planning period of this General Plan.

PF-19              UTILITIES MASTER PLAN UPDATE
                   (Proposed)
A Master Plan for water and wastewater was prepared in 1985 and has not been updated since.
The 1991 and 1997 Northwest service area studies, and the 2001 Northwest Wastewater
Treatment Plant programming study consider the existing plant as well as the service area for
the new plant. These studies should be integrated into a cohesive, coordinated document. The
same process should be followed for water facilities, particularly as infrastructure plans are
developed for the new growth areas.
PF-20              LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop and adopt an ordinance that provides standards for the use of drought-
tolerant and water-conserving landscape practices. The ordinance will provide for water
conservation while ensuring an appropriate appearance and function of landscape installation.
Requirements will specify the use of trees and other vegetation in new development in order to
provide shade and reduce energy demands for cooling. This ordinance will be applied in the
design and development of community facilities and will be consistent with the provisions of
the Resource Conservation & Management element.
PF-21              WATER AND ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM
                   (Proposed)
As part of the City’s proposed Water and Energy Conservation Program, the City will prepare a
water conservation ordinance that creates conservation restrictions and incentives when
drought conditions warrant significant reductions in usage. The ordinance also will restrict
wasteful uses of water at all times. The City will incorporate water and energy conservation
measures into the design of community facilities. The ordinance will conform to the
conservation standards set forth in the Resource Conservation & Management element.
PF-22              WATER METERING AND USAGE-BASED RATE STRUCTURE PLAN
                   (Proposed)
The City will develop a plan for a transition from a flat-based rate structure to a metered, usage-
based water rate structure. The plan will phase in the new rate structure over time. New
development will continue to be constructed with meters in place.
PF-23              WASTEWATER REUSE
                   (Existing)
The City will continue reviewing uses for effluent, such as the irrigation of the Trilogy golf
course. The City will consider irrigation or other uses of effluent during the design of the new
wastewater treatment plant.

PF-24              AIRPORT MASTER PLAN UPDATE
                   (Existing)
The City will continue to implement the Airport Master Plan and update the plan as needed.
The Master Plan is a tool for programming future facilities and operational needs on the airport
property; it includes both a site development plan and a programming description that
provides for modernization, expansion, and necessary support facilities for the airport. An
FAA grant has been received for this purpose; the Master Plan update is expected to be
completed within the 2001-02 fiscal year.
PF-25              COST/REVENUE ANALYSIS
                   (Proposed)
The City will conduct a study of City service costs and funding sources with the following
priorities:
       1. Identify deficiencies in existing service levels and the cost of providing an adequate
            level of service.
       2. Evaluate the ability of existing revenue sources to fund the desired levels of service.
       3. Project the cost of providing the desired level of service to future residents, operating
            and maintaining the facilities necessary to deliver those services.
       4. Project future revenues that can reasonably be expected from new growth and
            compare to costs of service at various points in the planning period.
       5. Identify and recommend new revenue sources or mitigations that will allow the City to
            establish and continue to provide the services necessary to accommodate future
            residents and businesses.
PF-26              AB 1600 ANALYSIS
                   (Proposed)
In accordance with Government Code Section 66000 et seq., as amended, the City will conduct a
thorough analysis of the City’s development impact fee structure (commonly referred to as the
AB 1600 Analysis) to ensure that fees are (1) adequate to fund capital projects and facilities, (2)
based on expansion or provision of new facilities required by growth, and (3) meet all
requirements of State law. The AB 1600 analysis will be initiated at the same time as the first
Capital Improvement Program, and fees will be adjusted annually to keep up with inflation and
construction costs. Prior to completion of the AB1600 citywide master analysis (PF-27), the share
of financial responsibility for the facilities costs and impacts on the community will be
determined on a project by project basis. The project sponsor or developer will be responsible
for the cost of this analysis. The City may require a particular project to fund the master study,
with reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the particular project through credits
against developer fees when building permits are issued.
