   Vision Statement
Our Vision Statement expresses our shared ideals and desires for the future of
Oakdale, and establishes the foundation for the 2030 General Plan. This vision
evolved through community and decision maker input as an integral component of
the General Plan Update process. The 2030 General Plan builds upon the existing
strengths and values of our community, while balancing new opportunities,
challenges, and initiatives. The 2030 General Plan recognizes that change must be
managed carefully to sustain our community’s quality of life, economic vitality,
social well-being, and environmental resources.
Beyond the 2030 General Plan, our vision is intended to influence all activities
which shape the future of our community. Our success will ultimately be measured
by our ability to achieve our vision, and the spirit by which we do so.
Our vision for Oakdale in the future includes…

   A SMALL TOWN CHARACTER AND SENSE OF COMMUNITY
   We are a distinct family-oriented community with a prosperous small town
   character that defines our strong sense of place. We have successfully balanced
   tradition and progress, embracing our unique heritage. We are enriched by the
   diversity of our residents, including seniors and youth, and are dedicated to
   protecting and enhancing our quality of life. We have a high level of community
   pride, and a shared sense of responsibility for our well-being.
   A VITAL AND DISTINCT DOWNTOWN
   Our historic downtown serves as the civic, social, and symbolic center of our
   community. It has been enhanced through the revitalization and reuse of historic
   storefronts, and the introduction of new buildings and parking designed to fit in
   with its architectural character. It is a walkable destination, with a wide variety of
   mixed-use, residential, shopping, restaurant, and entertainment options. Small
   businesses are encouraged, and community events are common.
   WELL PLANNED AND MANAGED GROWTH
   We have maintained a careful growth strategy promoting development that is
   beneficial to both our economy and small town quality of life. Growth and
   revitalization areas are clearly defined and surrounding rural lands protected.
   Growth is located where appropriate service levels can be provided, and is
   required to pay its own way. We emphasize high-quality, fiscally sustainable
   development and a compact community form that incorporates smart growth
   principles.
   AN ATTRACTIVE COMMUNITY
   We have a positive visual image and an attractive community. Our buildings,
   public spaces, and streetscapes are well designed and landscaped. We have
   beautified and created visually distinguishable districts along our primary
   transportation corridors, Yosemite Avenue and F Street. We have high design
   expectations, but implement those expectations with sensitivity and flexibility.

DIVERSE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
We have a variety of distinct, well maintained, residential neighborhoods. Our
neighborhoods provide for a diversity of densities and quality housing choices to
accommodate residents at all income levels and stages of life. Neighborhoods
have tree-lined streets, are interconnected and walkable, and are integrated with
parks, open space, and schools. Residential growth has been balanced with job
growth.
RETAIL, SERVICE, AND ENTERTAINMENT CHOICES
We have been successful in attracting a variety of quality retail shops, restaurants,
and unique local services. Theater and other cultural and entertainment venues
thrive. Neighborhood retail and services exist throughout the City close to where
people live, including the previously underserved west side of town. Sales tax
leakage to other communities has been reduced, and we have capitalized on
pass through tourism services. We support a local business-friendly environment.
BROAD OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT
We have diverse employment opportunities allowing residents to work in the
community, and reducing commutes to distant jobs. We have successfully
retained existing industries and built upon our historic job base to attract new
opportunities. We have taken advantage of our assets including the adjacent
agricultural areas, easy railroad access, connectivity to the North County
Corridor, and nearby airport. We support vocational training and education to
enhance and expand the skills of the local workforce.
A SAFE COMMUNITY WITH QUALITY PUBLIC SERVICES
We are a safe community with reliable law enforcement and fire protection. We
have great hospital and medical services, schools, libraries, and community
centers. We have easy access to parks, trails, and recreational activities
promoting healthy lifestyles for all ages. The City provides cost-effective and
sustainable infrastructure and services.

   TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS
   Traffic flows efficiently through the community considering high levels of regional
   pass-through travel. Our roads accommodate multi-modal transportation options
   and connect to regional transportation improvements such as the North County
   Corridor. Bike and walking trails are conveniently located and linked to adjacent
   uses. Transit is accessible and reliable to all, including seniors and students. We
   have maximized opportunities to improve traffic flows as feasible and promote
   alternatives to the automobile.
   A GREEN COMMUNITY
   We have preserved significant habitat, open space, and scenic resources along
   the Stanislaus River corridor. This corridor is a community asset with public access,
   trails, and vistas with restaurants and entertainment options. We have maintained
   rural and agricultural lands around the City to provide separation from other
   communities and enhance our distinct identity. We are recognized as leaders in
   protecting air and water quality, resource conservation, and green practices.
   RESPONSIVE GOVERNANCE AND REGIONAL LEADERSHIP
   Our citizens are active and engaged, and our elected officials listen and respond
   to the interests of the community. The City is fiscally responsible working within
   available resources to provide for the cost effective delivery of services and
   allocating fair share costs to those who benefit. We profit from partnerships
   between government, business, service providers, developers, and citizens. We
   continue to face our regional responsibilities, and lead intergovernmental efforts to
   address our collective needs.

OAKDALE 2030 GENERAL PLAN
INTRODUCTION

                                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
                                          Introduction
The Oakdale 2030 General Plan (2030 General Plan or General Plan) presents a
vision for the City’s future and a strategy to make that vision a reality. It serves as a
long-term policy framework to guide the City’s growth and conservation in a
manner that sustains the community’s quality of life, economic vitality, social well-
being, and environmental resources. This document is the result of the collective
efforts of numerous stakeholders including elected and appointed officials, City staff,
public agencies, utility companies, local school districts, and the City residents who
have articulated their hopes, values and expectations for Oakdale’s future.
  What is a General Plan?
State law requires each city and county to prepare and adopt a comprehensive,
long-range general plan to guide its future. A general plan directs the physical
growth and conservation of resources within a jurisdiction. A general plan must
contain an integrated and internally consistent set of goals, policies, and
implementation programs that seek to achieve a community’s shared vision, and
address those issues of greatest importance to the City.
Much of a general plan’s content is established by statutory requirements. The legal
adequacy of a general plan is critical, since all development projects, subdivisions,
zoning regulations, specific plans, capital improvements, and other related plans,
regulations, and actions are required to be consistent with a community’s general
                                                     INTRODUCTION                        I-1

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    plan. A general plan provides a jurisdiction with a consistent decision-making
    framework for determining whether specific land use and development proposals
    reflect the community’s physical, economic, social, and environmental goals. A
    general plan also presents guidance to decision-makers in establishing priorities for
    the allocation of resources, provision of public services, and initiation of public
    improvements.
    State law requires that general plans address seven topics, also referred to as
    “elements”. These required elements include land use, housing, open space,
    conservation, safety, circulation, and noise. A jurisdiction may also choose to
    include optional elements that address other topics of local interest. Once adopted,
    these optional elements carry the same legal weight as the required elements. Under
    State law, a jurisdiction may amend or update all or part of its general plan at a
    given time.
      General Plan
      Organization & Content
    OVERALL PLAN ORGANIZATION
    The City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan includes all information required in the
    seven state mandated elements. In some cases, the City has chosen to consolidate
    required information and/or reorganize content by common topics. In addition, the
    2030 General Plan includes optional elements that address economic vitality, public
    facilities, and community services.
I-2                   INTRODUCTION

                                                City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
The Oakdale 2030 General Plan is organized as follows:
               Introduction presents information on the General Plan’s organization,
               summarizes the planning context, and describes the General Plan
               update process.
               The Land Use & Community Form Element establishes the desired
               pattern of growth, revitalization and conservation, with specific
               direction on the type, location, extent, form and key design
               expectations for different land uses.
               The Economic Vitality Element includes goals and policies to enhance
               the economic well-being and sustainability of the City and to attract,
               grow and retain a stable and diverse range of businesses.
               The Mobility Element provides a framework that supports a balanced,
               multi-modal transportation network accommodating motor vehicles,
               bicyclists, pedestrians, public transit, rail and air travel.
               The Public Facilities Element establishes policies and standards for the
               planning and provision of water, wastewater, storm drainage, solid
               waste, energy and telecommunications services and infrastructure.
               The Community Services Element establishes requirements for the
               delivery of police and fire protection, parks and recreation,
               educational facilities, libraries and health care.
               The Natural Resources Element provides goals and policies to
               protect, enhance, and manage the City’s natural resources including
               open space and biological resources, agriculture, air quality, water
               resources and quality, minerals, and visual resources.
               The Public Health & Safety Element establishes goals and policies
               that minimize the risk of personal injury, loss of life, and property
               damage associated with flooding, geologic, and seismic hazards, as
               well as hazardous materials.
               The Noise Element provides policies and standards to control and
               minimize noise from transportation and stationary sources.
               Implementation summarizes the Standard Implementation Tools and
               Specific Implementation Programs required to carry out the goals and
               policies of the General Plan.
               Glossary of Terms & Acronyms defines terminology used in the 2030
               General Plan.
The Housing Element establishes the strategy to address the City of Oakdale’s
identified housing needs and quantified objectives. The Housing Element is required
by state law to be updated every eight years, necessitating a different review
process and implementation programs than the remainder of the General Plan. The
City’s Housing Element for the 2007– 2014 period was adopted by the City Council
and certified by the State Housing Community Development Department in advance
                                                      INTRODUCTION                     I-3

                                       City’s Housing Element is provided under separate cover (not bound with the

    RELATED DOCUMENTS
    Documents prepared in support of and as companion pieces to the Oakdale
    2030 General Plan include the Technical Background Report, Climate Action
    Plan, and Environmental Impact Report. These documents should be referred to
    for more extensive information on existing conditions, potential impacts and
    mitigation.
    Technical Background Report
    The Technical Background Report (TBR) provides a descriptive profile and analysis
    of existing conditions and trends for the City of Oakdale and its surrounding area
    (2030 General Plan Study Area) at the initiation of the General Plan update process
    (2009). The TBR presents physical, social and economic information that established
    the foundation for issue identification, policy development, and the setting for the
    2030 General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
    Climate Action Plan
    The Oakdale Climate Action Plan (CAP) serves to outline strategies, goals, and
    actions for reducing municipal and community-wide greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions. The CAP has been structured to ensure that the City does its part to meet
    the mandates of California’s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), while
    taking into account the City’s 2030 General Plan vision for future growth. AB 32
    requires jurisdictions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to be at or below 1990
    levels by 2020.
    The CAP provides a roadmap for the City to be proactive in reducing GHGs
    through a series of local actions. Although the CAP is considered a “stand alone”
    policy document, the strategies presented in the CAP are incorporated into the
    2030 General Plan, where appropriate, and are consistent with the goals, policies,
    and implementation included in the General Plan.
    The CAP includes the following components:
        A GHG inventory for 2005 and for future forecasted years 2020 and 2030;
        A GHG reduction goal of 29% below business-as-usual emissions for 2020;
        Identification and transparent quantification of state-level GHG reduction
         strategies;
        Identification and transparent cost/benefit quantification of feasible reduction
         strategies and actions;
        Identification of implementation steps and financing mechanisms to achieve the
         GHG reduction goal;
        Procedures for monitoring and updating the GHG inventory and reduction
         measures every five years; and
        Identification of an implementation schedule and responsible parties for
         implementation.

                                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
Environmental Impact Report
A program environmental impact report (EIR) was prepared for the 2030 General
Plan, consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.
The EIR assesses the potential adverse environmental impacts from implementation
of the General Plan, identifies actions that will be undertaken to reduce or avoid
significant impacts where feasible, and evaluates the comparative impacts of a
range of alternatives. Some mitigation measures identified in the EIR are
incorporated as policies or implementation programs in the 2030 General Plan.
The EIR may support project-level environmental analysis for later projects
determined consistent with the General Plan, or the EIR findings may be used to
determine the appropriate level of environmental review that should be performed
when subsequent projects consistent with the General Plan are proposed.
   Planning Context
REGIONAL CONTEXT
The City of Oakdale is located at the base of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains in eastern Stanislaus County, California, approximately 15 miles northeast
of Modesto, 20 miles north of Turlock, 22 miles east of Manteca, and 30 miles
southeast of Stockton. Other smaller cities surrounding Oakdale include Escalon (9
miles northwest), Riverbank (5 miles west), Waterford (10 miles southeast), Hughson
(13 miles south), and Ceres (18 miles southwest). Oakdale’s location is reflected on
Figure I-2, Regional Location.
The topography of Oakdale is generally flat, with rolling hills southeast and northwest
of the City limits. Historically the City and surrounding area have been used for
orchards and other agricultural operations. There are pockets of active agricultural
lands within the city limits, with a majority of the lands surrounding Oakdale still in
agricultural or rural uses. Some lands both within and outside of the City have
been designated as Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance, and
Unique Farmland by the California Department of Conservation Farmland
Monitoring and Mapping Program (FMMP). Some of these properties are under
Williamson Act contracts (California Land Conservation Act of 1965).
The Stanislaus River winds through the northern edge of the City offering
recreational opportunities at designated parks and recreation areas. While outside
of the river corridor, much of the natural habitats in the City have been lost or
altered due to development and agricultural operations, scattered areas of
perennial grasslands, riparian woodlands, oak woodlands, and a variety of
wetlands including vernal pools, seasonal wetlands, freshwater marshes, ponds,
streams, and rivers still exist.

OAKDALE PROFILE
Development of the town of Oakdale began in 1871 when the Stockton and
Visalia Railroad (later absorbed by the Southern Pacific Railroad) established a
terminal in the area. With the arrival of the railroad, Oakdale was transformed
from a small agricultural settlement into a center for the transport of people and
goods to support mining and lumbering operations in the nearby Sierra
foothills. These businesses required the development of stables, warehouses, and
other freight-related businesses, which in turn led to the establishment of
merchandise stores, hotels, blacksmith shops, and other commercial enterprises
to support Oakdale’s growing population.
Much of Oakdale’s early residential growth was generated by testimonials that
the area boasted the healthiest weather and finest farming land in the valley.
These testimonials persuaded many individuals and families from nearby
Knights Ferry, Sonora, and Copperopolis to relocate to Oakdale, which was
named for the abundant Oak trees in the area. The growth of Oakdale is
believed to have resulted in the demise of the nearby town of Langworth, which
had been plotted as a town in 1860.
A second major impetus for growth in Oakdale was the formation of the
Oakdale Irrigation District in 1888. The District built a dam at Wildcat Creek,
two miles below present Tulloch Dam in Tuolumne County, which brought water
to the area. The establishment of a reliable water supply created a boom in
farming and ranching activity, with wheat, barley, and grains being the most
abundant crops. The agricultural boom resulted in substantial growth of the
residential population, as well as expansion of commercial and service-related
businesses to support the growing populace.
The steady growth that had characterized Oakdale since its inception

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    encountered a setback in 1897 when the Sierra Railway extended its tracks to
    nearby Jamestown. Although many businesses related to the transport of goods,
    services, and people to the foothills closed or relocated to Jamestown, Oakdale
    continued to serve as a supply center for local agricultural operations.
    Oakdale was incorporated as a City in 1906. Four years later the Oakdale
    Irrigation District increased water supplied from the Stanislaus River, which
    enabled the development of numerous nut and fruit orchards, vineyards, and
    other lucrative crops that are important to Oakdale’s and the surrounding area’s
    economy to the present day.
    The development of industrialized food production in the early twentieth century
    brought about the largest period of growth in Oakdale’s history. The Pacific Pea
    Packing Plant was established in Oakdale in 1906, followed by numerous other
    processing and packing operations, which attracted a large workforce and
    resulted in an expansion of service industries and residential neighborhoods. By
    the mid-twentieth century, Oakdale’s economy and population were rooted
    firmly in the agricultural production, processing, and packing industries.
    Large areas of industrial land were annexed to the south of Oakdale beginning
    in 1965 and more recently with the 2006 South Oakdale Industrial Specific Plan
    area. Recent residential specific plan area annexations include the Burchell Hill
    Specific Plan area (1997), the Bridle Ridge Specific Plan area (1999), and the
    East F Street Specific Plan area (2006). At the time of adoption of the 2030
    General Plan, the City of Oakdale (City limits) was approximately 6.1 square
    miles. Annexation of the Crane Crossing and Sierra Pointe Specific Plans is
    anticipated shortly following adoption of the 2030 General Plan, further expanding
    the City.
    Over the years, Oakdale has experienced a healthy rate of growth, emerging
    as a distinct freestanding small urban community. This growth reflects the City’s
    desirable qualities as a livable community and its success in planning the pace,
    location, and character of new development. The first General Plan for the City
    of Oakdale was adopted on May 4, 1959. Numerous amendments and
    modifications have been made to the General Plan over the years. Prior to the
    current General Plan update, the last comprehensive update of the General Plan
    (2015 General Plan), was adopted in January 1994 with subsequent amendments
    though December 2003.
    Existing land uses within the City are generally characterized by established and
    newer suburban style residential neighborhoods, an historic Downtown,
    commercial corridors, a large industrial area, public/semi public uses, and
    parkland. Uses surrounding the City, including its future sphere of influence,
    consist primarily of agriculture with active field crops, orchards, dairy
    production, pastureland, and/or livestock grazing. Some of these areas also
    include large lot suburban or rural estate homes.
    F Street and Yosemite Avenue comprise the foundation of Oakdale’s transportation
    network and serve much of the City’s commute and regional traffic between the
    Sierra Nevada Mountains and the San Joaquin Valley. F Street and Yosemite
    Avenue north of F streets are designated as state highways (SR 108 and SR 120).
    Oakdale is often referred to as “The Gateway to Yosemite,” a reference to Yosemite

National Park and the Sierra Nevada Mountains accessible via SR 120 heading
east from the City. Due to the number of professional cowboys who have lived in
Oakdale and the annual Oakdale Rodeo established in 1954, the City has also
picked up the moniker of the "Cowboy Capital of the World."
Oakdale is served by four rail lines: the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF)
Railroad, the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad, the Oakdale Traction Corporation (OTC),
and the Sierra Railroad. These lines extend east-west and north-south through the
City, primarily serving the movement of commerce. In addition, the Oakdale
Municipal Airport is located southeast of the City. The airport was originally
constructed in 1945, and has been owned and operated by the City of Oakdale
since 1960.
The City of Oakdale provides a range of quality public facilities and community
services. Within its corporate limits, the City provides water, wastewater, storm
drainage, police, fire, parks & recreation, and general administrative services. The
Oakdale Joint Unified School District (OJUSD) serves Oakdale residents and
portions of the surrounding area, and libraries are provided by Stanislaus County.
Solid waste, energy, and telecommunications are supplied by various outside
providers.
According to the 2010 census, the largest racial/ethnic groups in Oakdale are
White (68.1 percent) followed by Hispanic (26.1 percent). The median age for
Oakdale residents is 34.9 years, with approximately 27.9 percent of the
population under 18 years of age, and 12.3 percent over 65. Slightly over 89
percent of the City’s residents completed high school, with almost 38 percent
obtaining a college degree. Approximately 61.1 percent of the homes in the
City are owner occupied, and 38.9 percent occupied by renters. The medium
household income in 2010 was $59,842.
Oakdale’s current economy centers on agriculture, food manufacturing, and
tourism. The City is home to large food manufacturing operations including Ball
Western Can Company; ConAgra Foods, one of the largest tomato processing
plants in the world; and Sconza Candy Company. The top non-manufacturing
employers in the City are Oakdale Joint Unified School District, Oak Valley
Hospital, the City of Oakdale, and Burchell Nursery.
While the economy had significantly slowed at the time of this General Plan’s
adoption, Oakdale is projected to grow at a steady pace in the future. The
City’s population is estimated to increase from approximately 20,839 residents
in 2011 to 35,000 in 2030. This growth will result in the demand for
approximately 4,800 new residential units, a majority of which are anticipated
to be low and medium density residential. Employment in the City is estimated to
increase from 4,969 employees in 2011 to over 9,500 in 2030. This growth
will result in the need for approximately 2.7 million square feet of new non-
residential uses, a little more than 50 percent of which is anticipated to be
industrial, 20 percent public/semi-public and other similar uses, 15 percent
retail-oriented, with the remainder constituting various forms of office
development. (Goodwin Consulting Group, 2012).
The additional growth projected in Oakdale will provide both opportunities and
challenges to the City and its residents, resulting in the need to continue to
                                                    INTRODUCTION                    I-11

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    thoughtfully manage growth and community character. The 2030 General Plan
    provides a policy framework to help the City maximize key opportunities and
    direct resources to improve its quality of life, provide new opportunities and
    foster a vibrant economy.
    PLANNING AREAS
    Under State law, a general plan must address the entire area within the
    jurisdiction’s boundaries and any lands outside its boundaries that bear relationship
    to its planning efforts. The planning boundaries considered as part of the 2030
    General Plan are illustrated on Figure I-3, and include:
        2030 Planning Area encompasses the area that is the focus of the General
         Plan, including the City limits and Oakdale’s existing and potential future
         spheres of influence. The General Plan designates land uses to all properties
         within the Planning Area. It is anticipated that the full Planning Area may
         ultimately be incorporated into the City to accommodate growth through 2030
         and beyond.
        Study Area encompasses a larger boundary extending beyond of the 2030
         Planning Area. The Study Area was considered as part of the General Plan
         Update, and background information was collected for the entirety of the area.
         County land uses apply to lands within the Study Area outside of the 2030
         Planning Area.
    For planning purposes, the General Plan establishes 2030 as the horizon year for
    buildout of the plan. It is recognized that the General Plan includes land use
    capacity that extends beyond 2030. Unless otherwise noted, goals and policies are
    structured to address ultimate buildout conditions.
    SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS
    Specific plans implement the general plan by applying planning policy that refine
    general plan policies applicable to the area and directly regulating land use.
    Oakdale has six adopted and four identified future specific plan areas located
    within and immediately adjacent to the City, as shown in Figure I-4. The six
    adopted specific plans include:
        Bridle Ridge Specific Plan: located south of Highway 108 along the western
         edge of the City, consisting primarily of low density residential homes, parks,
         schools, and commercial uses;

District, and Future Specific Plan Areas 2, 5, and 8, as shown in Figure I-4. These
future specific plan areas are intended to accommodate new growth and
revitalization during the 2030 General Plan horizon. It is envisioned that the
Downtown District will be redeveloped to include a broader mix of local and
regional serving retail, goods, services, offices, restaurants and entertainment, as
well as higher density housing and mixed use development. Future Specific Plan
Areas 2, 5, and 8 are envisioned to accommodate single- and multi-family
residential units along with commercial uses, parks and schools (see Land Use and
Community Form Element for additional detail).

      General Plan Update
    GENERAL PLAN UPDATE PROCESS
    The Oakdale 2030 General Plan represents the first comprehensive update of the
    City’s General Plan since 1994. Conditions and considerations within and outside
    the City have changed considerably since 1994. The 2030 General Plan responds
    to these changes to reflect present day issues, values, and compliance with evolving
    state laws. It also ensures that the Plan is based upon the latest data (e.g., growth
    projections and economic indicators) and up-to-date (GIS) mapping.
    The City of Oakdale began the process of developing a new General Plan in the
    latter half of 2009. The update process included the following key steps:
I-16                   INTRODUCTION

                                                 City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
COMMUNITY OUTREACH
A community outreach program was implemented as part of the General Plan
update process to solicit thoughts and ideas from the public regarding Oakdale’s
future. This input has directly shaped the City’s vision for the future and the 2030
General Plan. Components of the community outreach program included:
    Community Workshops: Three community workshops were held during the
     General Plan update process. At the first workshop, input was solicited on the
     community’s vision for the future and identification of key issues. At the second,
     participants were asked to formulate citywide land use alternatives, and identify
     specific areas of desired change. At the last workshop, participants were asked
     to help define policy direction for both the General Plan and Climate Action
     Plan.
    Public Meetings and Hearings: Several joint City Council and Planning
     Commission Study Sessions were held throughout the update process to provide
     input on major milestones and confirm the direction of the 2030 General Plan.
     Each of these study sessions were open to the public and served as an
     opportunity for the community to provide input.
    Landowner Requests: City staff solicited requests from interested landowners
     regarding potential land use changes. These requests were considered as part
     of the development of the preferred Land Use Plan.
    Notice of Preparation Scoping Meeting: A scoping meeting was held during
     the Notice of Preparation comment period for the EIR. Participants were asked
     to comment on the scope of the EIR.
    Stakeholder Interviews: Several interviews were held with key stakeholders
     selected by City staff to define their initial perspectives on the City’s key assets
     and issues. The stakeholders represented a range of community interests.
    Newsletters: General Plan newsletters were distributed in mailings to City
     residents during major project milestones to convey information on the progress
     of the General Plan update, and to identify upcoming opportunities to provide
     input.
    Website: A website dedicated to the 2030 General Plan was established to
     keep the community informed of progress, and to allow for the downloading of
     information and opportunity to provide comments at any time during the
     General Plan update process. (http://ci.oakdale.ca.us/gp/)
The input received during the General Plan update process significantly influenced
the overall shape and direction of the 2030 General Plan, helping to ensure that it
reflects the community’s values and aspirations for the future.

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
      Community Form
    The City of Oakdale is formed by a mix of established and newly developed
    suburban neighborhoods, substantial commercial and industrial districts, and
    undeveloped lands. The City’s growth in recent decades is reflective of its reputation
    as a livable community and its success in determining the pace and location of new
    development. Additional growth is projected for Oakdale through the General Plan
    2030 horizon year, resulting in the need to continue to thoughtfully manage growth
    and community character.
    The current and planned land use pattern in the City and surrounding planning
    area is schematically illustrated on Figure LU-1 (Community Form). This pattern is
    defined by the following form elements, all of which are the focus of General Plan
    policies:
    Established residential neighborhoods, several with a grid of tree-lined streets
    containing some of the first homes constructed in the City. The General Plan
    promotes preservation and enhancement of older neighborhoods.
    Newer suburban residential neighborhoods, many located within the City’s
    specific plan areas, consisting largely of single family homes with integrated parks
    and schools. The General Plan supports the creation of new neighborhoods that are
    diverse, walkable, and complete.

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    Unique historic downtown business district that contributes to the City’s character
    and helps distinguish Oakdale from other surrounding valley towns. The General
    Plan advocates continued renewal of Downtown as a vital, pedestrian oriented
    place.
    Commercial corridors along the City’s major roadways, with an assorted pattern of
    local, regional, and tourist related services providing a hub of retail activity. The
    General Plan directs intensification, revitalization and expansion of commercial
    corridors.
    Large industrial and manufacturing presence concentrated in the southern portion
    of the City within and adjacent to the South Oakdale Industrial Specific Plan. The
    General Plan encourages a wide range of new and existing industries to create
    local jobs.
    Stanislaus River open space corridor winding along the northern edge of the City
    encompassing varied natural and visual resources. The General Plan provides for
    preservation of and improved public access to the Stanislaus River Corridor.
    Special planning areas within the City’s existing and proposed sphere of influence
    intended to be planned and annexed to address Oakdale’s additional growth
    opportunities through 2030. The General Plan directs well planned, regulated and
    sustainable new growth, and positions the City to proactively address the future
    North County Corridor (NCC).
    Greenbelt consisting of agricultural and rural lands separating Oakdale from
    Riverbank and the expanding Modesto area. The General Plan supports
    coordination with other agencies to ensure the retention of agricultural and rural
    lands around the City, including maintaining of the formal Oakdale and Riverbank
    Greenbelt west of the City.
    The General Plan promotes growth, revitalization and change beneficial to both the
    local economy and small town quality of life. It supports a balance of uses integral
    to sustaining revenue for the City to provide essential services, and directs a
    renewed inward focus on enhancing the City’s existing assets.
      Land Use Diagram
    The City’s Land Use Diagram (Figure LU-2) identifies the location of all land uses
    within the 2030 Planning Area. The Land Use Diagram is to be used and
    interpreted in conjunction with the text and policies included in the General Plan to
    direct land use decisions that integrate the community’s vision. Parcel level land use
    information may be obtained through the City’s Community Development and
    Services Department.

   Land Use Designations
The City’s General Plan land use designations are broadly structured to allow for
flexibility in defined land use types, densities, and intensities to account for changes
in housing, employment, and retail characteristics over time. Typically a single land
use designation will be applied to a given area. However, to encourage a variety of
complementary uses and capture unique development opportunities, two or more
land use designations may be combined, and/or specialized land use designations
created, through an adopted specific plan.
Intensity standards are expressed as an allowable range of residential densities and                           RESIDENTIAL DENSITY

While densities and FAR’s define overall intensity, they do not specify the form or               square footage of all buildings on
character of development. Different interpretations of the same density or FAR can                  a lot to the gross square footage
result in neighborhoods and buildings of very different character. For that reason,                                           of the lot.
Community Form Principles and Design Expectations are identified in the Policy
Framework section of this element. The intent is to facilitate a common
understanding of the form, character, and quality of development desired in
Oakdale.
        INTERIM ZONING CONSISTENCY
        In areas where zoning has not been brought into conformity with the 2030 General
        Plan and a discretionary permit is required for development, the City shall allow
        property owners to either:
        1.   Develop consistent with existing zoning provided the City makes a finding that
             approval of the project would not interfere with the long-term development of the
             area consistent with the General Plan; or
        2.   Develop under the General Plan designation, in which case the City and property
             owners will facilitate a rezoning consistent with the General Plan.
        Any inconsistencies between the 2030 General Plan and City’s Zoning Code are to be
        remedied within a reasonable timeframe as required under Government Code Section
        65860 (c).

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
                      Rural Estate (RE)
                      The RE designation accommodates large lot detached single-         Density: 2 or less dwelling
                      family homes intended to maintain a low density, rural living      units per gross acre
                      environment. This designation is to be applied in very limited
                      circumstances to address specific issues such as buffering
                      between agriculture and more dense residential neighborhoods,
                      and in other focused locations where large lot sizes are
                      appropriate and/or urban services are limited. The City may
                      approve the clustering of RE units to preserve significant open
                      space resources.
                      Very Low Density Residential (VLDR)
                      The VLDR designation accommodates detached single-family           Density: 2 to 5 dwelling
                      residential neighborhoods with generally larger to moderate lot    units per gross acre
                      sizes. This designation is to be applied sparingly as a transition
                      between rural and more intense uses, and in areas where
                      constraints or other considerations limit smaller lot development.
                      Low Density Residential (LDR)
                      The LDR designation accommodates traditional residential           Density: 4 to 8 dwelling
                      neighborhoods consisting predominantly of detached single-         units per gross acre
                      family homes on moderate to smaller lot sizes. Two family homes
                      and other attached housing types are also permitted. This
                      designation is applied to most neighborhoods in Oakdale and is
                      the City’s primary residential land use designation.
                      Medium Density Residential (MDR)
                      The MDR designation accommodates a variety of small lot single-    Density: 7 to 14 dwelling
                      family, two-family, and attached multiple-family residential       units per gross acre
                      housing types. This designation may be applied to promote a
                      diversity of housing choices within neighborhoods, and as a
                      transition to more intensive residential and non-residential uses.
                      High Density Residential (HDR)
                      The HDR designation accommodates higher density residential        Density: 14 or more
                      housing types including apartments, condominiums, and              dwelling units per gross
                      townhomes. This designation should be applied close to major       acre
                      transportation corridors, within and nearby the Downtown
                      District, and in proximity to commercial, employment, and
                      community service uses.

COMMERCIAL, EMPLOYMENT & MIXED USE
                      Central Business District (CBD)
                      The CBD designation accommodates a unique mix of retail, service          Intensity: FAR 0.3 to 3.0
                      commercial, entertainment, restaurant, lodging, office, civic, and
                      potential upper floor residential uses. This designation is applied
                      within or near the Downtown District, and is intended to promote a
                      pedestrian-oriented and active street environment, as well as
                      enhance historic character.
                      General Commercial (GC)
                      The GC designation accommodates a broad range of local,                   Intensity: FAR 0.2 to 0.4
                      regional and visitor serving retail, office, civic and related uses. This
                      designation is applied to all commercial areas outside of the Central
                      Business District. Local serving GC areas should be sited to be easily
                      accessible by foot or bicycle to adjacent residents, with more
                      intensive GC areas located along major travel corridors.
                      Office (OFF)
                      The OFF designation accommodates professional, medical and                Intensity: FAR 0.3 to 0.7

                       comprehensive planning through a specific plan and annexation
                       into the City. City Council approval is required prior to initiating
                       planning of each Future Specific Plan Area. Agriculture is the
                       interim permitted use.

                       alignments being considered for the future NCC. The designation         Plans
                       does not denote any specific new land uses, but rather represents a
                       geographic area in which land use decisions or other governmental
                       actions of one local agency (the “Acting Agency” – Stanislaus
                       County) impact directly or indirectly upon another local agency (the
                       “Concerned Agency” – City of Oakdale). Upon reasonably
                       foreseeable implementation of the NCC, the City Council may
                       consider comprehensive planning of some or all of this area through
                       one or more specific plans, or may choose to retain lands for
                       agricultural or rural uses.

   Development Potential
General Plan land uses have been allocated considering projected future housing
and employment demands. The General Plan provides capacity beyond projected
2030 needs in order to maximize opportunities for new job and revenue generating
uses, and in recognition that not all lands will be available for development at a given
time. An adequate supply of employment and revenue generating land uses is a key
component of a healthy and prosperous community.
The estimated development potential allocated by the General Plan within the
Planning Area is illustrated on Figure LU-4 and summarized on Table LU-1. Given
typical variations in the intensity of individual projects, assumed “average” density
and FAR assumptions are applied for purposes of calculating development potential.
The resulting level of development is considered the “buildout” potential of the
General Plan.
The General Plan provides for a total of 15,504 dwelling units resulting in a
population of approximately 42,792 residents. The General Plan also provides for a
total of approximately 18 million square feet of nonresidential uses accommodating
approximately 31,849 employees. When jobs and housing are compared, the
General Plan provides for a ratio of 2.0 jobs for each housing unit (household).

           into an agreement to retain a greenbelt along the Highway 108 corridor between the two
           communities. This agreement reflects the interests of all the parties to maintain a
           separation between Oakdale and Riverbank, and to preserve the rural character of the
           Highway 108 corridor. The agreement specifies that within the greenbelt area:
                 The County will maintain agricultural land uses
                 The Cities will not request extensions of their respective SOIs
                 The parties will encourage agricultural landowners to enter non-regulatory
                  programs, such as the Williamson act, to conserve farmland
                 The parties will consider planning and developing non-motorized trails between
                  the communities
                 The agreement was extended in June 2011 for a 10 year period through June
                  2021.

                                        Urban-Rural Edge
                                        New development along the planned urban edge of the City adjacent to active
                                        agricultural land designated for long-term production may be required to provide
                                        buffer treatments as appropriate. The intent is to ensure treatments adequate to
                                        minimize the impacts of new development on agricultural operations, and the impacts
                                        of agriculture on new development. Buffer treatments may consist of transitional lot
                                        sizes, setbacks, walls, berming, vegetative screens, and other measures provided by
                                        the new development. The width, type and ongoing maintenance of buffer treatments
                                        will be as specified in an adopted Specific Plan or as otherwise determined on a
                                        case‐by‐case basis, considering crop types, agricultural practices, prevailing winds,
                                        topography, the type of development and other relevant factors. Buffer setback areas
                                        may include roadways, utilities, drainage facilities, trails, parks, landscaping, open
                                        space and other uses compatible with ongoing agricultural operations. Where feasible,
                                        views to adjacent agricultural lands from new development should be retained.

   Targeted Planning Areas
The Targeted Planning Areas provide additional direction for specific locations in
Oakdale that will accommodate much of the City’s anticipated redevelopment and
potential new growth. These areas are organized into two broad categories:
1. Opportunity Corridors
2. Special Planning Areas
Direction in this section expresses specific intentions for use, design and character
unique to each area. This direction supplements and is in addition to other General
Plan policies.
LU-9: OPPORTUNITY CORRIDORS
The opportunity corridors are located along Oakdale’s major roadways, F Street
and Yosemite Avenue. These corridors are a key part of the City’s urban framework
and contain a varied mix of residential, commercial, industrial and related uses
including some sites that are vacant, underutilized, or in need of revitalization. The
opportunity exists to remake the corridors into more intense, efficient, pedestrian
friendly and visually pleasing destinations. The intent is to bring new vitality to the
areas, encouraging public and private investment/reinvestment. Some of the areas
beyond these corridors are specifically addressed in several of the City’s specific
plans.
For planning purposes the corridors have been divided into seven distinct segments
(see Figure LU-6). Each segment has a slightly different set of conditions, challenges,
and opportunities. Although the linear extent of each corridor segment is defined, its
depth from the adjacent roadway purposely is not. In general, the direction in this
section applies to properties that directly front the corridors and any adjacent
properties that could reasonably contribute to achieving defined objectives. This
depth will vary dependent upon existing and planned uses, lotting patterns,
adjacent street connections, and the specific objectives for the corridor.
While the General Plan provides broad direction and intent for each corridor, it is
anticipated that more detailed plans will be prepared for each corridor either
individually or in combination to further define objectives, strategies and specific
actions. All subsequent planning efforts should actively engage local business
owners and residents to address land use; market feasibility/strategies; mobility;
utilities/infrastructure; streetscapes; parking; design guidelines and development
standards; regulatory strategies and incentives; and implementation/financing
programs. The City will pursue grants and other available funding sources to help
finance such planning efforts.

WEST F STREET CORRIDOR
Location:
F Street from the Bridle Ridge and Crane Crossing Specific Plans on the west, to
Mann and Blankenship Avenues on the east. This section of F Street (SR 108) is
scheduled for relinquishment from state to local control. The south side of F Street
from Wood Avenue east was within the City’s Redevelopment Area (as it existed).
Adopted Land Use:
General Commercial (GC) with a mix of Low Density Residential (LDR) and Medium
Density Residential (MDR)
Existing Character:
F Street consists of 2 lanes with an unimproved median, widening to 4 lanes west of
Lee Avenue. There is significant variation in paved street width and pedestrian
improvements along the corridor. Residential uses and some vacant properties exist
to the west, transitioning to a scattered mix of retail, service, and related uses
traveling east. Parcel sizes are varied, with many lots on the north side of the
corridor oriented at an angle to F Street. The style and quality of development varies
representing different eras of growth with no consistent architectural, setback,
landscaping, signage or streetscape treatments. Both the Riverbank Oakdale Transit
Authority (ROTA) and Stanislaus Regional Transit (StaRT) have transit routes along
this corridor.
Planning Opportunities:
Development and redevelopment along the West F Street Corridor should promote
the following:
New uses and businesses, including opportunities for:
    Local serving retail, offices and services.

         Additional higher density residential and mixed use development.
         Possible senior housing and medical related services in proximity to the
          hospital.
     Beautification and intensification of development, including opportunities for:
         Renovation and reuse of existing development through façade
          improvements, upgraded landscaping, consistent signage, screening and
          shading of parking areas, and improved pedestrian access from streets to
          storefronts.
         Consolidation of small, underutilized lots into larger parcels to support viable
          and cohesive development projects.
         Creation of distinct mixed use activity nodes in key locations along the corridor
          distinguished by their mix of uses, intensity, compact development form, and
          greater emphasis on pedestrian and transit access.
         New development that presents a storefront along the corridor with building
          frontages oriented to and framing the street, minimal setbacks, front entries,
          transparent storefronts, appropriate building heights, and interior parking lot
          configurations.
      Pedestrian mobility and alternative transportation modes, including opportunities
      to:
         Improve and widen sidewalks and eliminate unimproved gaps west of Oak
          Avenue.
         Enhance pedestrian crosswalks to safely accommodate pedestrians and cyclists
          through clearly identified markings and/or pavers, bulb-outs at corners (where
          on-street parking exists), signage and traffic controls, in particular near the high
          school and other locations expected to generate significant pedestrian traffic.
         Add bike routes along the full length of the corridor.
         Consolidate driveways to minimize curb cuts.
         Enhance transit stops, shelters and connectivity to corridor uses.
         Strengthen pedestrian linkages to adjacent neighborhoods.
      Attractive, functional and maintainable streetscapes, including opportunities to:
         Add street trees to maximize shade and sense of enclosure.
         Provide enhanced and consistent landscaping, street furnishings, paving
          materials, public signage, and lighting.
         Underground overhead utility lines west of Oak Street.
         Incorporate signage, decorative banners and other techniques to create a
          unique identity for the corridor.
         Ensure consistent property, landscape and public improvement maintenance.

F STREET HISTORIC TRANSITION CORRIDOR
Location:
F Street from Mann and Blankenship Avenues on the west, to 1st Avenue on the
east. This section of F Street (SR 108) is scheduled for relinquishment from state to
local control. The majority of this corridor was within the City’s Redevelopment Area
(as it existed), with the exception of the north side of F Street west of Laurel Avenue.
Adopted Land Use:
Central Business District (CBD) with General Commercial (GC) on the west end.
Existing Character:
F Street consists of 2 lanes with an unimproved median. Sidewalks exist on both
sides of the road, with a varied and inconsistent street tree pattern. Uses include
older, historic homes on the west and east ends of the corridor that have been
converted to business uses, with a mix of more traditional retail and services uses
sandwiched in between. Prominent church buildings also exist, with a newer retail
center at the northeast corner of Laurel Avenue. The style and quality of
development varies along the corridor between the converted residential structures
and the more traditional retail development. Both ROTA and StaRT have transit
routes along this corridor.
Planning Opportunities:
Development and redevelopment along the F Street Historic Transition Corridor

         Incorporate distinctive and consistent streetscape treatments that tie the corridor
          together, acting as a bridge between the converted residential uses on the west
          and east ends, and include street trees, enhanced landscaping, street
          furnishings, paving materials, and public signage.
         Extend the existing historic acorn street lighting fixtures found east of South
          Church Street west to Mann and Blankenship Avenues.
         Incorporate signage, decorative banners and other techniques to create a
          unique identity for the corridor in itself and as an entry to Downtown.

NORTH YOSEMITE GATEWAY CORRIDOR
Location:
Yosemite Avenue from the Stanislaus River on the north to E Street on the south. The
majority of this corridor was within the City’s Redevelopment Area (as it existed).
Adopted Land Use:
A mix of General Commercial (GC), Medium Density Residential (MDR), Park (P),
and Industrial (IND).
Existing Character:
Yosemite Avenue is a key entry and travel route in the City, transitioning from 3
lanes just south of the Stanislaus River Bridge, to 4 lanes along the remainder of the
corridor. Yosemite Avenue (SR 120) connects Bay Area and Central Valley cities

     with several Sierra Nevada foothill towns and Yosemite National Park. As a result,
     this roadway experiences large volumes of tourism-related traffic during the summer
     and shoulder seasons. The development pattern is extremely mixed and fractured.
     The east side of Yosemite Avenue includes a landscaped corridor (Cottle Multi-Use
     Trail) south of the bridge followed by industrial uses that immediately abut the
     roadway with no sidewalks or landscaping. The west side includes a suburban
     shopping center set far back from the street, older commercial buildings with lesser
     setbacks and limited landscaping, apartments, auto repair, and a vacant parcel.
     The style and quality of development varies substantially with no consistent
     architectural, setback, landscaping, signage or streetscape treatments.
     Planning Opportunities:
     Development and redevelopment along the North Yosemite Gateway Corridor
     should promote the following:
     New uses and businesses, including opportunities for:
         Local serving and regional retail, offices and services.
         Travel and Tourism uses including related retail, restaurant, services and lodging.
         Additional higher density residential and mixed use development, particularly
          in proximity to downtown.
      Beautification and intensification of development, including opportunities for:
         Renovation and reuse of existing development through façade improvements,
          upgraded landscaping, consistent signage, screening and shading of parking
          areas, and improved pedestrian access from streets to storefronts.
         Integration of the industrial uses on the east side of the roadway into the
          corridor. Designs should embrace rather than attempt to hide these uses,
          incorporating aesthetic and functional upgrades to enhance appearance,
          improve vehicular access, and allow pedestrians and bicyclists to conveniently
          and safely enter and pass by the sites.
         New development that presents a storefront along the corridor with building
          frontages oriented to and framing the street, minimal setbacks, front entries,
          transparent storefronts, appropriate building heights, and interior parking lot
          configurations, in particular in proximity to Downtown.
         Enhanced views of and connectivity to the Stanislaus River corridor for uses
          adjacent to that corridor.
      Pedestrian mobility and alternative transportation modes, including opportunities to:
         Improve and widen sidewalks, in particular on the east side of the roadway
          connecting to the Class 1 bike trail (Cottle Multi-Use Trail) within the landscaped
          corridor.
         Provide trail access to the Stanislaus River and participate in the implementation
          of the Stanislaus River Corridor Access Plan (also see Community Services
          Element).
         Enhance pedestrian crosswalks to safely accommodate pedestrians and cyclists
          through clearly identified markings and/or pavers, signage and traffic controls,
          in particular at locations expected to generate significant pedestrian traffic.
         Add bike routes along the full length of the corridor.
         Strengthen pedestrian linkages to adjacent neighborhoods.

Adopted Land Use:
Industrial (IND) with General Commercial (GC), Public Semi-Public and
FLEX/Industrial (FLEX/IND) north of Greger Street.
Existing Character:
Yosemite Avenue consists of a combination of 2 lane and 4 lane segments, with
bike routes along a portion of the corridor. This roadway provides a major linkage
between Oakdale and the nearby cities on Modesto, Ceres and Turlock, as well as
potential connection to the future NCC. There are crossings of the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific rail lines south of J Street. The development
pattern includes a combination of large industrial uses, specifically ConAgra and
Sconza (chocolate manufacturer), as well as business parks, gas stations, scattered
residential uses, and large vacant parcels. Sidewalks are limited, with varied
building setbacks and landscaping. In some cases buildings, parking lots and
fencing are located immediately adjacent to the roadway. There is a StaRT transit
route along this corridor.
Planning Opportunities:
Development and redevelopment along the South Yosemite Industrial Corridor
should promote the following:
New uses and businesses, including opportunities for:
   A diverse range of industrial and business park users.
   Employee serving commercial uses and businesses, consolidated into easily
    accessible activity nodes along Yosemite Avenue when feasible.
Beautification and intensification of development, including opportunities for:
   Renovation and reuse of existing development through façade improvements,
    upgraded landscaping, consistent signage, screening and shading of parking
    areas, and improved pedestrian access from streets to building entries.
   To the extent appropriate, new development may be subject to development
    standards and design guidelines compatible with those from the South Oakdale
    Industrial Specific Plan (as may be modified by the City). Such requirements
    address lot configurations, setbacks, landscape corridors and plantings, street
    trees and lighting, pedestrian facilities, building massing, screening, walls and
    fences, signage, energy efficiency and other provisions to enhance street
    frontages and minimize impacts to adjacent uses.
   Development of distinct employee serving commercial activity nodes in key
    locations along Yosemite Avenue distinguished by their mix of uses and
    emphasis on pedestrian access.
Pedestrian mobility and alternative transportation modes, including opportunities to:
   Improve and widen sidewalks and eliminate unimproved gaps.
   Enhance pedestrian crosswalks to safely accommodate pedestrians and cyclists
    through clearly identified markings and/or pavers, signage and traffic controls,
    in particular at locations expected to generate significant pedestrian traffic such
    as commercial nodes.
   Add bike routes along the full length of the corridor consistent with the cross
    sections specified in the South Oakdale Industrial Specific Plan.

              LU-11: FRINGE COMMUNITIES
              Several unincorporated neighborhoods located within Oakdale’s SOI are
              considered “fringe” communities, as shown on Figure LU-8. Unincorporated fringe
              communities are inhabited and unincorporated territory that is within a city’s SOI as
              defined by State law (SB 244). It is anticipated that requests for annexation of these
              communities into the City of Oakdale may be considered during the planning
              horizon of the 2030 General Plan. Annexation requests are subject to approval of
              the Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), and involve
              an evaluation and determination of the City’s ability to serve the lands proposed for
              annexation, including the fringe communities. The following provides a general
              analysis of water, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire protection
              needs or deficiencies for each of the unincorporated fringe communities, along with
              an analysis of potential funding mechanisms that could make the extension of
              facilities and services to identified communities financially feasible. This analysis is
              intended as a starting point for potential future LAFCO study.

Sunset Park Subdivision
This 30 parcel community is comprised of single-family residences located on Iris
Avenue, Charles Street and Magnolia Street adjacent to Oak Avenue on the west
side of Oakdale. At approximately 10.5 acres, the Sunset Park Subdivision is
situated just west of the City limits, but within the existing SOI and Crane Crossing
Specific Plan (CCSP). Land in this community is currently used and designated for
Very Low Density Residential uses at 2 to 5 dwelling units per acre under the
Specific Plan and 2030 General Plan. Also included within the community are a
church/private school, and several vacant lots.
Water
Domestic water is provided by the City of Oakdale from a point of connection in
Oak Avenue. The extent and size of the distribution mainlines is unknown.
Upgrading the system to meet City standards will require installation of
approximately seven fire hydrants throughout the community.
Wastewater
All of the parcels within the Sunset Park Subdivision use private septic systems, with
no public sanitary sewer services provided.
In order for the City of Oakdale to provide sewer service to this community it will be
necessary to construct approximately 1,770 feet of 8-inch sanitary sewer mainline,
30 services, four manholes and cleanouts as needed. The point of connection for
sanitary sewer service will be an existing stub at Oak Avenue.
Storm Drainage
All storm drainage is collected by roll over curb and gutter. Runoff flows to several
drainage inlets within the community. Each drainage inlet appears to be connected
directly to its own drywell for subsurface percolation. Additional storm drainage
improvements are not anticipated.
Dry Utilities
The site is served by underground electrical, cable, natural gas, and telephone.
Fire Protection
The Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District currently provides emergency and fire
protection services to the greater Oakdale area (outside of the City limits). Upon
annexation this community would be served by the City of Oakdale Fire
Department. The nearest fire station to this community is Station #4 located at 450
South Willowood Drive in the City of Oakdale.
Access
Access to this community is available via Oak Avenue and is sufficient for public
safety services.

     As the Sunset Park Subdivision is part of the CCSP, annexation of this existing
     community would occur as part of a larger application to be submitted and
     approved by the Stanislaus County LAFCO. A Fiscal Analysis/Public Facilities
     Financing Plan was prepared for the entire Specific Plan area. The Fiscal Analysis
     assesses impacts of development on the City’s ability to fund services. Overall,
     development of CCSP would be adequately provided public services and utilities by
     the City of Oakdale after annexation. The Public Facilities Financing Plan identifies
     the cost of backbone infrastructure to serve the specific plan area, the allocation and
     ability of properties to support those costs, and the potential funding and financing
     mechanisms that can used to construct the infrastructure and facilities for the CCSP.
     Based on this Financing Plan, a Financing Strategy was prepared.
     Potential financing mechanisms to improve water and wastewater infrastructure to
     City standards in this community include: city impact fees; developer financing;
     and/or a community facilities district (CFD). The City of Oakdale has adopted a set
     of development impact fees (i.e., Community Facilities Fees) to finance capital
     improvements. Fees are collected prior to issuance of a building permit for water,
     wastewater, storm drainage, and fire protection. Future updates to the City’s fee
     program may include certain improvements within the CCSP and Sunset Park
     Subdivision. Developer financing is another mechanism that may be required to
     fund backbone infrastructure and facilities for shortfall financing and for in-tract
     subdivision improvements. A CFD may also be established to help pay for
     improvements. The 1982 Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act enables cities to
     establish a CFD to fund various facilities and services. The proceeds from a CFD
     bond sale can be used for direct funding of improvements. Other fee, assessment or
     alternative funding mechanisms focused upon improvements associated with the
     Sunset Park Subdivision may be implemented, as negotiated with the impacted
     landowners.
     Country Club Heights
     Country Club Heights consists of a 14 lot single family residential subdivision
     located west of the intersection of Jackie Court and North Stearns Road, north of
     East F Street. This community is located within Future Specific Plan Area 8, which is
     in the City’s existing and future SOI. The lot sizes range between 1.0 and 1.4 acres.
     This subdivision is fully developed with the exception of one lot. The Future Specific
     Plan designation is applied to those locations intended to accommodate new growth
     during the horizon of the General Plan, and is subject to future comprehensive
     planning through a specific plan and annexation into the City.
     Water
     Domestic water is provided by individual ground water wells. If annexed into the
     City, Oakdale would provide water service to Country Club Heights. Potential points
     of connection to the City’s water system include the supply lines located on the west
     side of the Belsera Subdivision, located just south of this community. Future water
     systems are also anticipated to be constructed for the Trieste subdivision, located
     between the Belsera Subdivision and Highway 108, and may provide alternative

                                              City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
points of connection. Full domestic/fire system development will be required for the
Country Club Heights community in order to meet City standards.
Wastewater
Wastewater is disposed of by individual septic systems. If annexed, the City of
Oakdale would provide wastewater service. Potential points of connection into the
City’s system include the supply lines located on the west side of the Belsera
Subdivision, located just south of this community. Future sewer collection systems
are also anticipated to be constructed for the Trieste subdivision, located between
the Belsera Subdivision and Highway 108, and may provide alternative points of
connection.
Storm Drainage
The storm drainage system for the County Club Heights community consists of drain
inlets connected to dry wells. The subdivision map for this community shows a 7.5
foot wide drainage easement between lots 8 and 9, although no evidence of any
storm drainage facilities exist based upon a field survey.
Dry Utilities
The Country Club Heights community is served by underground electrical and
telephone service, as well as underground natural gas by PG&E. However, there is
no evidence of cable television service. Street lights meeting City standards are
present in the community.
Fire Protection
The Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District currently provides emergency and fire
protection services to the greater Oakdale area (outside of the City limits). Upon
annexation this community would be served by the City of Oakdale Fire
Department. The nearest fire station to this community is Station #5 located at 325
East G Street in the City of Oakdale.
Access
The street network appears to comply with current city and fire standards and it is
not anticipated that additional upgrades would be necessary.
Financing
Future annexation of Country Club Heights would likely occur as part of the Future
Specific Plan Area 8 annexation to be approved by Stanislaus County LAFCO.
After annexation, water, wastewater, and storm drainage infrastructure
improvements will be required, and fire protection service will need to be provided
by the City of Oakdale.
Potential financing mechanisms to improve water and wastewater infrastructure to
City standards include: city impact fees; developer financing; and/or a community
facilities district (CFD). The City of Oakdale has adopted a set of development
impact fees (i.e., Community Facilities Fees) to finance capital improvements. Fees
are collected prior to issuance of a building permit for water, wastewater, storm
drainage, and fire protection. Future updates to the City’s fee program may include

     City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
     certain improvements within the Future Specific Plan Area 8 and the Country Club
     Heights community. A CFD may also be established to help pay for improvements.
     The 1982 Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act enables cities to establish a CFD to
     fund various facilities and services. The proceeds from a CFD bond sale can be
     used for direct funding of improvements. Other fee, assessment or alternative
     funding mechanisms focused upon improvements associated with Country Club
     Heights may be implemented, as negotiated with the impacted landowners.
     Belsera Subdivision
     The Belsera Subdivision contains 61 dwelling units located on the east side of
     Oakdale on north Stearns Road across from the Oakdale Golf and Country Club.
     This community is located within Future Specific Plan Area 8, which is in the City’s
     existing and future SOI. It is a private, gated, senior community incorporating
     common areas that include a park, a banquet room, and a swimming pool. The
     Future Specific Plan designation is applied to those locations intended to
     accommodate new growth during the horizon of the General Plan, and is subject to
     future comprehensive planning through a specific plan and annexation into the
     City.
     Water
     Domestic water is provided by the City of Oakdale from the Burchell Hill
     Subdivision, located west of the Belsera Subdivision. No upgrades are anticipated
     to be required if this community is annexed into the City.
     Wastewater
     Wastewater collection is currently provided by the City of Oakdale from the Burchell
     Hill Subdivision, located west of the Belsera Subdivision. No upgrades are
     anticipated to be required if this community is annexed into the City.
     Storm Drainage
     The Belsera community owns and maintains a private street network and storm
     drain system. The storm drain system includes a basin. No upgrades are
     anticipated to be required if this community is annexed into the City.
     Dry Utilities
     The site is served by underground electrical and telephone, as well as underground
     natural gas by PG&E. However, there is no evidence of cable television service.
     Fire Protection
     The Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District currently provides emergency and fire
     protection services to the greater Oakdale area (outside of the City limits). Upon
     annexation this community would be served by the City of Oakdale Fire
     Department. The nearest fire station to this community is Station #5 located at 325
     East G Street in the City of Oakdale.

                                              City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
Access
The street network appears to comply with current city and fire standards and it is
not anticipated that additional upgrades would be necessary if annexed into the
City.
Financing
Future annexation of this community would likely occur as part of the Future Specific
Plan Area 8 annexation to be approved by Stanislaus County LAFCO. Since the
City of Oakdale currently provides water, wastewater, and fire protection service to
the Belsera Subdivision community, and storm drain infrastructure already exists, no
infrastructure improvements and/or upgrades or necessary.
Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive Community
This 42 parcel, single-family residential community is located on Twildo Avenue and
Seaman Drive west of Stearns Road on the east side of Oakdale. South of Highway
108, this community is situated within the City’s existing and future SOI and the
Sierra Pointe Specific Plan (SPSP) area. Both the specific plan and the 2030
General Plan designate this community as Very Low Density Residential, at two to
five dwelling units per acre.
Water
The Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive community forms Improvement District 22,
which was created to provide domestic water to members of the district by use of a
community owned well and distribution system. The system is operated and
maintained by the Oakdale Irrigation District. The existing water system consists of
8-inch mainlines, fire hydrants, a well, a pump station, and an 8,000 gallon
pneumatic tank. Although the system capacity is sufficient for providing domestic
water needs, it is not capable of providing adequate fire flows to the community.
Fire hydrants have been installed at a frequency that appears to meet City
standards at 300 feet maximum spacing.
If this community were annexed into Oakdale, upgrading of the community water
system to meet city standards would be necessary. This would require a connection
to the City’s water system. Currently, the nearest point of connection available is at
Orsi Road approximately 1,200 feet west of the community. It would be necessary
to acquire easements for construction of a water line through private property as
there are no public rights of way available to accomplish this connection. Future
points of connection may become available as other development in the SPSP east
of the community occurs. Connection to the City water system would provide
sufficient capacity to meet fire flow demands assuming there is adequate capacity
within the City’s system at these points. The existing tanks, wells, and pumps would
require abandonment.
Wastewater
All of the parcels within the community use private septic systems, with no public
sanitary sewer services provided.
                                    LAND USE & COMMUNITY FORM                         LU-63

     City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
     In order to provide City wastewater service to this community, it would be necessary
     to construct approximately 3,500 feet of 8-inch sanitary sewer mainline, 42
     services, 15 manholes and cleanouts as needed. It may be necessary to include
     lifting capabilities for some of the houses in low lying areas. The nearest point of
     connection available is at Orsi Road approximately 1,200 feet west of the
     community. It would be necessary to acquire easements for construction of a
     wastewater line through private property as there are no public rights of way
     available to accomplish this connection. Future points of connection may become
     available as other development in the SPSP east of the community occurs.
     Storm Drainage
     There does not appear to be any storm water collection infrastructure in the
     community, and all drainage appears to be surface runoff. If this community were
     annexed into Oakdale, storm drainage improvements would need to be made to be
     consistent with City standards, which would require curb and gutter to be installed
     along both sides of the streets within the community. Storm drainage would be
     accomplished through an underground storm drain system consisting of 12-18 inch
     mainlines, drywells or retention/percolation systems, and drainage inlets.
     Dry Utilities
     The Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive community is served by overhead electrical
     and telephone. There does not appear to be cable television, natural gas or
     propane service in the community.
     Fire Protection
     The Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District currently provides emergency and fire
     protection services to the greater Oakdale area (outside of the City limits). Upon
     annexation this community would be served by the City of Oakdale Fire
     Department. The nearest fire station to this community is Station #5 located at 325
     East G Street in the City of Oakdale.
     Access
     Significant improvements would be necessary to provide access by fire apparatus.
     Both Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive are dead end roads. It would be necessary
     to construct roads that allow fire apparatus full access for turn-around movements
     (cul-de-sac or hammerhead).
     Financing
     As the Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive community is part of the SPSP, annexation
     of this existing community would occur as part of a larger application to be
     submitted and approved by Stanislaus County LAFCO. A Fiscal Analysis/Public
     Facilities Financing Plan was prepared for the entire specific plan area. The Fiscal
     Analysis assesses impacts of development on the City’s ability to fund services.
     Overall, development of SPSP would be adequately provided public services and
     utilities by the City of Oakdale after annexation. The Public Facilities Financing Plan
     identifies the cost of backbone infrastructure to serve the specific plan area, the
     allocation and ability of properties to support those costs, and the potential funding

and financing mechanisms that can used to construct the infrastructure and facilities
for the SPSP. Based on this Financing Plan, a Financing Strategy was prepared.
Potential financing mechanisms to improve water, wastewater, and storm drainage
infrastructure, and to provide fire protection services, to City standards in this
community include: city impact fees; developer financing; and/or a community
facilities district (CFD). The City of Oakdale has adopted a set of development
impact fees (i.e., Community Facilities Fees) to finance capital improvements. Fees
are collected prior to issuance of a building permit for water, wastewater, storm
drainage, and fire protection. Future updates to the City’s fee program may include
certain improvements within the SPSP and the Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive
community. Developer financing is another mechanism that may be required to
fund backbone infrastructure and facilities for shortfall financing and for in-tract
subdivision improvements. A CFD may also be established to help pay for
improvements. The 1982 Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act enables cities to
establish a CFD to fund various facilities and services. The proceeds from a CFD
bond sale can be used for direct funding of improvements. Other fee, assessment or
alternative funding mechanisms focused upon improvements associated with the
Twildo Avenue and Seaman Drive community may be implemented, as negotiated
with the impacted landowners.
Tioga Road (Improvement District 41)
This 38 parcel community is located on Tioga Road east of Crane Road on the west
side of Oakdale. It is located within the City’s existing and future SOI, and is
designated as Rural Estate by the 2030 General Plan with a density of two or less
dwelling units per acre. This community forms Improvement District 41, which was
created to provide domestic water to members of the district by use of a community
owned well and distribution system.
Water
The water system serving the Tioga Road community is operated and maintained by
the Oakdale Irrigation District. The system consists of 8-inch mainlines, two wells
and pump stations, and two pneumatic tanks. The tanks are 5,000 gallons and
2,500 gallons each. The tank sizes and well capacities are not sufficient to provide
adequate fire flows to the community; however, fire hydrants have been installed at
various locations within the community.
If the Tioga Road community is annexed into Oakdale, improvements would need
to be made in order to meet city standards. It would be necessary to connect the
Improvement District’s system to the City’s water system at each end of Tioga Road.
This would provide a looped system and is anticipated to provide adequate
capacity to meet fire flow demands assuming there is adequate capacity within the
City’s system at these points. The existing tanks, wells, and pumps would be
abandoned. It will also be necessary to install additional fire hydrants every 300
feet to provide adequate fire flows to serve the community.

     City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
     Wastewater
     All of the parcels within the district use private septic systems, with no public
     sanitary sewer services provided.
     In order to provide wastewater service to this community if annexation occurs, it will
     be necessary to construct approximately 3,700 feet of 8-inch sanitary sewer
     mainline, 38 services, 10 manholes and cleanouts as needed. It may be necessary
     to include lifting capabilities for some of the houses in low lying areas. Crane Road
     does not contain any sanitary sewer mainlines, so it would be necessary to connect
     to the City system at the eastern side of the community.
     Storm Drainage
     Approximately 2,700 feet of curb and gutter was constructed as part of the
     Vineyards Subdivision, located adjacent and to the north of the Tioga Road
     community. The curb and gutter collects runoff for most of the eastern part of the
     community and discharges it into French drains under the park basins within the
     Vineyards Subdivision. A small amount of runoff is collected at the intersection of
     Tioga Road and Crane Road and discharges into the City’s Crane Road mainline,
     which flows to the Stanislaus River outfall.
     As noted above, approximately 2,700 feet of curb and gutter currently exists on the
     north side of Tioga Road. Storm drainage improvements would need to be made to
     meet City standards, which would require curb and gutter to be installed along the
     remainder of Tioga Road. It is anticipated that drainage inlets would be installed at
     a maximum frequency of 400 feet. Further investigation will be required to confirm
     that the existing storm drain system within the Vineyards Subdivision was designed
     to accommodate this area. Underground piping would be required for cross
     connections to the existing system along the north side of Tioga Road. Additional
     mainline storm drain pipelines may be required at each end of the community.
     Dry Utilities
     The Tiago Road community is served by overhead electric, telephone and cable as
     well as underground natural gas. Some of the overhead utilities are in Tioga Road
     and some are located in the alley to the south of the community. There is no street
     lighting along Tioga Road.
     Fire Protection
     The Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District currently provides emergency and fire
     protection services to the greater Oakdale area (outside of the City limits). Upon
     annexation this community would be served by the City of Oakdale Fire
     Department. The nearest fire station to this community is Station #4 located at 450
     South Willowood Drive in the City of Oakdale.
     Access
     Tioga Road is a 20 feet wide dead end street. There is also an existing gravel alley
     running along the back of the dwellings on the south side of the community.
     Significant improvements will be necessary to provide access by fire apparatus. For
     a dead end road of this length, special approval will be required. It may be

necessary to provide a minimum of 26 feet paved width with turn-around (cul-de-
sac or hammerhead) for Tioga Road. Alley access may not be a viable form of
access for fire apparatus. An emergency access roadway exists on Tioga Road for
access to the Vineyard Subdivision.
Financing
If the Tioga Road community is annexed into the City of Oakdale, water,
wastewater, and storm drainage infrastructure improvements will be required, and
fire protection service will need to be provided by the City of Oakdale.
Potential financing mechanisms to improve water, wastewater, and storm drain
infrastructure to City standards in this community, as well as roadway improvements
for emergency access include: city impact fees; and/or community facilities district
(CFD). The City of Oakdale has adopted a set of development impact fees (i.e.,
Community Facilities Fees) to finance capital improvements. Fees are collected prior
to issuance of a building permit for water, wastewater, storm drainage, streets and
fire protection. Future updates to the City’s fee program may include certain
improvements within this community. A CFD may also be established to help pay
for improvements. The 1982 Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act enables cities to
establish a CFD to fund various facilities and services. The proceeds from a CFD
bond sale can be used for direct funding of improvements. Other fee, assessment or

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
      Context
    The City of Oakdale has identified economic growth as a key priority. It is the
    community’s collective vision to not only retain and grow its existing businesses, but
    to attract new revenue and job generating uses. Such economic growth can help to
    satisfy unmet local retail and service demands, capture regional and pass through
    sales tax, stimulate new and diverse job growth, increase disposable household
    income, and generate revenue to support local services. While the City cannot
    control larger market forces and cycles, it can strategically position itself to
    maximize potential opportunities, foster a climate attractive to businesses, and
    ensure responsible and efficient use of available fiscal resources.
    Oakdale’s economy is centered around manufacturing goods and food products,
    retail sales, and providing services to residents and visitors. During the 1990’s and
    early 2000’s, the City experienced rapid residential development that was not
    matched by corresponding job growth. In recent years the number of jobs in the
    City has declined, the most notable example being the closing of the Hershey
    Chocolate Factory in 2008. The combination of recent job losses and rapid
    residential construction has led to a reduction in Oakdale’s jobs-housing ratio to
    less than one job per household. At this level, some Oakdale residents must
    commute outside the City for employment. In addition, the City must provide
    services to residents without as much revenue support from employment-related
    land uses.
EV-2                  ECONOMIC VITALITY

                                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
Industrial activity is a major component of the City’s economy. Manufacturing and
food processing, packaging, and shipping companies are some of Oakdale’s
largest employers. The City is an attractive location for these businesses because of
its proximity to productive farmlands and nearby rail lines that transport raw
materials and agricultural products for processing and wholesale distribution.
Opportunities exist for the City to build upon and diversify its existing job base,
leverage its increasingly educated workforce, and capitalize on access to the future
North County Corridor and the Oakdale Municipal Airport. Positioning for future
job growth industries will require a clear set of economic development priorities and
strategies.
Oakdale’s retail expenditure patterns give the City one of the highest rates of
taxable sales per capita in Stanislaus County, but sales growth has increased less
than some cities, suggesting potential for expanded City retail offerings. For future
retail positioning, the City will need to decrease leakage in regional- and
community-level retail sales to other areas, particularly Riverbank and Modesto.
Expansion of Oakdale’s retail offerings is most likely in highway commercial uses
(pass through trips to Yosemite and the Sierras) and in additional regional retail
outlets such as auto dealers, apparel, furniture, restaurants, and entertainment and
leisure outlets, as discussed in the Oakdale Retail Analysis prepared by MTN Retail
Advisors in May 2012. Oakdale has the potential to increase its capture of regional
and highway commercial spending by identifying adequate sites meeting the traffic,
access, and visibility requirements of these types of retailers. Increased retail
spending generates increased sales tax revenue which can help fund City services.
A former economic development tool and funding source for revitalization of
Oakdale’s downtown and portions of its commercial corridors was the City’s
redevelopment program, which was administered by the Oakdale Community
Redevelopment Agency (City Council). However, all redevelopment agencies in
California were dissolved effective February 1, 2012, and the City now serves as
the Successor Agency to the Oakdale Community Redevelopment Agency. As the
Successor Agency, Oakdale is responsible for overseeing the wind down of the
City’s redevelopment activities. An Oversight Board consisting of seven regionally
appointed representatives reviews and approves actions taken by the Successor
Agency. The State Department of Finance may review the actions of the Oversight
Board. While alternatives to redevelopment have been discussed, at the time of this
General Plan’s adoption, no comparable programs had been initiated. The
elimination of redevelopment further challenges funding sources available to the
City to support revitalization and economic development.
The General Plan includes policies to help guide the long-term economic growth of
the City in a manner that capitalizes on potential market opportunities. Emphasis is
placed on the need to develop and implement a comprehensive economic
development strategy that supports business attraction, growth and retention. In
addition, guidance is provided to further the management and delivery of

     Context
   The Mobility Element guides the improvement, operation and maintenance of the
   City’s transportation network. The ability to efficiently, safely and conveniently
   travel within and through Oakdale is critical to the City’s economic growth,
   health, character and sustainability. The term “mobility” acknowledges that the
   transportation needs of the community are defined by a range of travel options.
   The attractiveness of certain travel options is directly influenced by the type and
   pattern of land uses as well as the availability of transportation facilities and
   services. While it is acknowledged that the automobile is and will continue to be
   the primary mode of travel, the General Plan Land Use and Mobility elements
   combine to promote increased accessibility to and use of alternative
   transportation modes.
   The City’s mobility system includes the following components:
      Roadways and Highways – The roadway network in Oakdale is
       characterized by high traffic volumes along the two major arterials through
       the City, F Street and Yosemite Avenue, with relatively low volumes on the
       remainder of the City’s streets. F Street and the northern portion of Yosemite
       Avenue are designated as state highways (SR 108 and SR 120) and as such
       are under Caltrans jurisdiction. These roadways serve much of the City’s
       cross-town and commute travel, and carry significant volumes of traffic
       between the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada destinations including
       Yosemite. In addition, Yosemite Avenue provides Oakdale’s only bridge
       over the Stanislaus River. The City has no ability to unilaterally make
       improvements to state highways.

                                          City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
  The North County Corridor (NCC) is a planned state freeway/
  expressway connecting SR 99 north of Modesto to SR 120 east of
  Oakdale. This facility is intended to serve as a bypass to F Street and will
  become SR 108, reducing traffic congestion within the cities of Modesto,
  Riverbank and Oakdale. At the time of this General Plan approval, a
  final alignment for the NCC has not been adopted. Alignments being
  studied lie south and east of the City, with connections to Crane Road,
  Yosemite Avenue, and Stearns Road. Once the NCC is constructed, SR
  108 (F Street west of Yosemite Avenue) would be relinquished to the City.
  In anticipation of relinquishment, the City is a participant with the cities of
  Modesto and Riverbank in the SR 108 Relinquishment and Reinvestment
  Plan. This plan is intended to identify strategies to stimulate and revitalize
  the SR 108 corridor once relinquished to local control.
  The City of Oakdale’s streets and highways are organized in a hierarchy
  according to their functional classification. This hierarchy recognizes the
  type, volume and character of intended traffic service. The City’s
  roadway classifications are summarized on Table M-1. Oakdale’s
  planned roadway system (arterials and collectors) is illustrated on the
  Circulation Diagram, Figure M-1. In addition to new roadways planned
  as part of the City’s specific plans, existing City roadways will need to be
  modified to implement the Circulation Diagram, which is summarized on
  Table M-2. Planned roadways are based upon buildout of the General
  Plan and assume construction of the NCC.
  The Circulation Diagram and General Plan policies reflect the City’s
  acceptance of reduced roadway levels-of-service where required
  improvements are determined infeasible or would conflict with other City
  goals. As an example, roadway widenings to add lanes within
  Downtown would adversely impact existing structures/businesses and
  impede pedestrian/bicycle circulation. The General Plan recognizes that
  in some instances, accepting added congestion along select roadways is
  less disruptive to community character than the roadway improvements
  that would be required to increase capacity. Three roadway segments
  were identified through the environmental review analysis that would
  operate below the City’s base Level of Service standard and where
  roadway improvements could not be feasibly implemented (see Policy M-
  2.6). Public roads and streetscapes are to present pleasant settings scaled
  to pedestrians with strong relationships to adjacent buildings.
 Bicycle & Pedestrian System – A safe, efficient, and well-connected
  bicycle and pedestrian system provides options to automobile travel.
  Biking and walking offer both an enjoyable activity, as well physical
  exercise which has added health benefits. A majority of roadways in the
  City provide sidewalks and crossings for pedestrians. In 2006, the City
  adopted a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. That plan outlines the
  goals and policies associated with implementing the City’s desire to
  provide residents and visitors with a connected bikeway and trail system
                                                       MOBILITY                   M-3

       that accommodates both commute and recreational trips throughout the
       City. This effort was coordinated with the Stanislaus County Non-
       Motorized Transportation Plan. The City’s existing and planned bicycle
       facilities are illustrated on Figure M-2. At the time of General Plan
       adoption there were limited existing connections along the major arterials
       through Oakdale for bicyclists, and no existing facilities along the
       Stanislaus River corridor.
      Public Transit – Transit also offers an alternative transportation mode.
       Oakdale is served by two transit providers, Stanislaus Regional Transit
       (StaRT) and Riverbank-Oakdale Transit Authority (ROTA). StaRT offers fixed-
       route service, and ROTA offers Dial-A-Ride services. Given relatively low
       demand and continued funding challenges, opportunities to use transit in
       Oakdale are limited and ridership relatively low. The General Plan calls for
       continued coordination with local transit providers to maintain and expand
       timely, affordable and responsive transit services.
      Truck Routes and Rail – The efficient movement of goods is critical to the
       economy. There are a number of designated truck routes in the City,
       including SR 108 and SR 120. In addition, the City is served by four rail
       lines: the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad, the Union
       Pacific (UP) Railroad, the Oakdale Traction Corporation (OTC), and the
       Sierra Railroad. The railroad tracks through the City primarily serve the
       movement of commerce, however, the Sierra Railroad tracks have passenger
       trains that provide various services. Truck routes and rail lines through
       Oakdale are illustrated on Figure M-3.
      Airport - The Oakdale Municipal Airport is located southeast of the City.
       The airfield was originally constructed in 1945, and has been owned and
       operated by the City of Oakdale since 1960. The 117 acre airfield contains
       a single 3,020 foot runway which serves single and twin engine aircraft, as
       well as business jets. There are also aviation related businesses located at the
       field. At the time of General Plan adoption, The City was in discussions to
       update the Oakdale Municipal Airport Master Plan, which could change the
       planning vision of the field. Several areas of study, including the
       expandability of the airport, adjacent development opportunities, and the
       creation of industrial parks or an airpark community, may be studied.

    Policy Framework
M-1:              MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION
                  CHOICES
Goal M-1
Expanded multimodal transportation choices that improve the
ability to travel efficiently and safely throughout the city and region.
  MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION POLICIES
M-1.1           Multimodal Options. Establish an interconnected transportation network
                that offers safe and convenient mobility options including adequate
                streets, transit services, pedestrian walkways, bike routes, equestrian
                facilities, commercial rail connections, and aviation services. (RDR, MP,
                IGC, JP, NR-IP5)
M-1.2           Range of Users. Ensure that the transportation network meets the needs
                of a variety of users eliminating barriers, where feasible, to allow access
                by people of all abilities. (RDR, MP, IGC, JP)
M-1.3           Complete Streets. Design and construct both new and reconstructed
                streets with adequate rights-of way and facilities to support the full range
                of locally available travel modes, compliant with the California Complete
                Streets Act (AB 1358). (RDR, MP, IGC, JP)
                                                                        MOBILITY                        M-9

                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
COMPLETE STREETS
                                 Assembly Bill 1358, also known as the California Complete Streets Act of 2008, requires cities
                                 and counties to include “complete streets” policies in their general plans. Complete streets are
                                 designed and operated to enable safe access for all users including motorists, bicyclists,
                                 pedestrians, and public transit riders of all ages and abilities. Typical components of complete
                                 streets may include sidewalks, bike lanes, special bus lanes, comfortable and accessible transit
                                 stops, frequent crossing opportunities, median islands, accessible pedestrian signals, curb bulb-
                                 outs, and similar. Such components can be incorporated into the design of new streets, as well
                                 improvements to existing roadways.
Also See Land Use & Community M-1.4         Smart Growth. Integrate transportation and land use decisions to
                  Form Element              enhance opportunities for development that is compact, walkable and
                                            transit friendly. (RDR, JP, NR-IP5)
                               M-1.5        Multimodal Access. Promote the provision of multimodal access to
                                            activity centers, such as commercial and employment uses, Downtown,
                                            higher density and mixed use projects, schools, and parks. (RDR, MP, JP)
                               M-1.6        Consider all Users of Transportation System. Use multi-modal evaluation
                                            methods to ensure that projects do not result in worsening facilities or
                                            service for transit, bicyclists, and pedestrians. (MP, OFB, M-IP1)

                               Goal M-2
                               An interconnected roadway/highway system that ensures the safe
                               and efficient movement of people, goods, and services on multiple

M-2.5 Relinquishment. Coordinate with Caltrans on the relinquishment of SR
      108 within Oakdale to the City. (IGC, M-IP2)
 ROADWAY LEVEL OF SERVICE POLICIES
M-2.6 Level of Service (LOS) Standard. Maintain operations on most roadway
      segments and intersections in the City at Level of Service D or better at
      peak travel times. Allow reduced LOS standards of E or F on the
      following roadways:
              F Street (SR 108): Willowood Drive to Yosemite Avenue (LOS F)
              Yosemite Avenue (SR 120): Stanislaus River Bridge to F Street (LOS F)
              Yosemite Avenue: F Street to Southern City Limit (LOS E)
      Additional exceptions to the LOS D standard may be approved when
      determined by the City Council that: (1) the improvements necessary to
      maintain LOS D or better would be infeasible and/or conflict with the
      achievement of other community goals; and (2) provisions are made to
      improve other parts of the citywide transportation network in order to
      increase system-wide roadway capacity and/or enhance non-vehicular
      travel modes. (RDR, MP, M-IP1)
        LEVEL-OF-SERVICE
        The primary method used to analyze the performance of a roadway facility is level of
        service (LOS). LOS ranges from A through F, which represents driving conditions from
        least congested to most congested, respectively. The LOS grades for roadway types and
        facilities are generally defined as follows:
               LOS A represents free flow travel for vehicles.
               LOS B represents stable flow, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream
                begins to be noticeable.
               LOS C continues to represent stable flow, but interactions with others in the traffic
                stream significantly increases.
               LOS D represents high-density, stable flow, but approaching unstable conditions.
               LOS E represents unstable operating conditions at or near the capacity level where
                maneuverability is severely limited.
               LOS F defines forced traffic flow. Roadway volumes exceed the maximum capacity
                for the particular roadway classification.
                                                                 MOBILITY                          M-11

           calming techniques include: landscaped curb bulb-outs to reduce the distance
           required for a pedestrian to cross a roadway; narrow streets; street islands and
           marked, signalized crossings to enhance pedestrian safety; street trees; speed

                                               TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
                                               Transportation Demand Management (TDM) is a mix of measures promoting
                                               alternatives to the single occupant vehicle for employment related trips. TDM is
                                               intended to maximize the use of existing transportation infrastructure by influencing
                                               the time, route or mode selected for a given trip. TDM programs reduce vehicle
                                               miles traveled, parking demand, air quality impacts, and greenhouse gas
                                               emissions. Typical TDM measures may include employer promotion of and/or
                                               incentives for carpooling, vanpooling, transit use, walking, bicycling,

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
      Context
    The ability to deliver and maintain sufficient infrastructure contributes to Oakdale’s
    quality of life and level of attractiveness to economic growth and investment. The
    provision of infrastructure can influence the amount, type, intensity, pattern and
    quality of growth in the community. Infrastructure services in Oakdale are supplied
    by a combination of City and outside agencies:
       Water - The City of Oakdale provides water service within the City limits, and
        the Oakdale Irrigation District (OID) provides rural water service outside the City
        limits. The source of potable water for the City is exclusively groundwater,
        extracted from the Modesto Groundwater Subbasin. Water users that are not
        connected to a public water system utilize private wells, typically serving
        individual properties. Groundwater in the Oakdale area is known for its high
        quality, making treatment to comply with drinking water regulations unnecessary.
        The total volume of water supply projected and accounted for within the City’s
        Urban Water Management Plan is sufficient to meet the demands of the 2030
        General Plan. As a result, there are no immediate plans for use of surface water
        for potable water supply. The City of Oakdale could, however, be a possible
        future user of the New Melones Reservoir surface water, depending on escalating
        future demands and/or diminishing groundwater quality or quantity. Existing
        groundwater wells and water tanks are shown in Figure PF-1.
        The City developed the water-related goals and policies in coordination with all
        district and city agencies that have developed, served, controlled, managed, or
        conserved water of any type for any purpose in Oakdale.

   Wastewater - The City of Oakdale wastewater system provides service within
    the City limits. Some older properties within the City boundaries and areas
    outside of the City utilize septic systems. The Oakdale wastewater treatment
    plant (WWTP) is located on the north side of the Stanislaus River, as shown in
    Figure PF-1. This plant has been upgraded to provide tertiary treatment
    capability. Treated effluent may be reused for Reclaimed Water for Beneficial
    Reuse (RWBR) should distribution systems ultimately be developed. Existing sewer
    lift stations in the City are also shown in Figure PF-1. Future expansion of the
    City’s WWTP may require upgrades to existing transmission pipes and/or the
    installation of additional lift stations and force mains. A second treatment plant in
    the southern portion of the City, or decentralized wastewater treatment, may be
    considered.
    Storm Drainage - The City of Oakdale provides storm drainage within the City
     limits. Oakdale’s storm waters are either: 1) conveyed directly to the Stanislaus
     River through various pipe networks; or 2) collected and allowed to percolate into
     the ground through detention and retention basins, drywells, or French drain
     piping systems. Existing stormwater drainage basins in the City are shown in
     Figure PF-1. The City operates under a National Pollution Discharge Elimination
     System (NPDES) permit. Future legislation may require more stringent water
     quality standards and discharge regulations, possibly necessitating additional
     storage or treatment facilities.
    Solid Waste - Solid waste generated in the City of Oakdale is collected by
     Gilton Solid Waste Management. The City’s municipal solid waste is delivered
     to the Gilton Resource Recovery/Transfer Facility (GRR); a State permitted solid
     waste facility that provides a full range of transfer and diversion services. A
     majority of the City’s municipal solid waste delivered to GRR that is not diverted is
     sent to a landfill, with the bulk going to Forward Landfill in Manteca and a small
     portion going to Fink Road Landfill near Crows Landing (or to other state-
     approved landfills). The remainder of the City’s solid waste requiring disposal is
     sent to the Covanta Energy waste-to-energy cogeneration facility at the Fink Road
     Landfill.
    Energy & Telecommunications – Oakdale residents and businesses have a
     choice of electric and telecommunications providers. Electric service is provided
     to the City by both the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and Pacific Gas and
     Electric (PG&E). Natural gas service is provided by PG&E. Several companies
     offer telephone, television, internet and other telecommunication services within
     the City.
The General Plan includes polices to ensure that the City and new development plan
and allocate resources for efficient and dependable infrastructure systems. In
addition, water conservation, recycled water use, stormwater pollution control,
recycling, energy conservation, local production of renewable energy, and other
efforts are identified to promote environmental sustainability.

          STORMWATER QUALITY
          Low Impact Development
          Low Impact Development (LID) emphasizes the use of small-scale, natural, constructed,
          and proprietary drainage features to capture urban runoff and precipitation. LID
          practices promote the use of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and
          reuse of rainwater. These practices can effectively remove nutrients, pathogens, and
          metals from stormwater, and reduce the volume and intensity of stormwater flows.
          Typical LID elements include:
                Disconnected roof drains
                Disconnected and separated pavement (e.g., detached sidewalks)
                Bioretention facilities, rain gardens, and bioswales
                Tree planting
                Grass swales and channels
                Curb cuts and vegetated filter strips
                Impervious surface reduction – permeable/porous pavements
                Stream buffers
                Soil amendments

      Context
    Community services play a critical role in health, livability and economic growth.
    The City of Oakdale seeks to provide a broad range of quality facilities and services
    to meet diverse community needs. Facilities and services are to be located and
    programmed to provide efficient, equitable and consistent levels of service.
    Community services in Oakdale are supplied by a combination of City and outside
    providers, with key facilities illustrated on Figure CS-1:
       Police Protection - The Oakdale Police Department provides law enforcement
        services within the City, and the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department
        provides law enforcement services outside the City. The Oakdale Police
        Department has one centrally located station, and is organized within three
        different divisions: Administrative Services, Field Services, and Special Services.
        The Police Department works closely with the Office of Emergency Services, and
        it is normal practice for the Department to provide law enforcement assistance
        in nearby areas. Future growth will necessitate additional staffing, facility,
        equipment and associated funding needs.
       Fire Protection - The City of Oakdale Fire Department, augmented by Oakdale
        Rural Fire Protection District staff, is the first responder on fire and medical
        emergencies within the City limits and for areas outside of the City limits.
        The City Fire Department has reciprocal Mutual Aid and Automatic Aid
        agreements with the Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District and the
        Stanislaus Consolidated Fire Protection District, which enhance level of

        service. The City is served by two fire stations, and has a Class 4 Insurance
        Service Office (ISO) rating. Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District also has
        one fire station in the City. Future growth will require additional resources to
        meet established response time standards. In addition, coordination between
        the City and Oakdale Rural Fire Protection District will continue as the City’s
        boundaries expand.
       Parks & Recreation - The City of Oakdale Parks and Recreation Department
        is responsible for providing and maintaining all City parks, recreation
        facilities and programs. The City’s park system includes community,
        neighborhood, mini and linear parks, as well as a community center and
        plaza, senior center, and multi-use buildings. Immediately outside the City
        limits along the Stanislaus River are the Oakdale Recreation Area, Valley
        Oak Recreation Area, and Stanley Wakefield Wilderness Area. Future
        growth will necessitate additional land, staffing, facility, program,
        maintenance and related funding needs.
       Educational Facilities - The Oakdale Joint Unified School District (OJUSD)
        serves Oakdale residents and portions of the surrounding area. The OJUSD
        provides elementary schools, a junior high school, a comprehensive high
        school, and alternative high school and adult education facilities. Student
        generation and school capacity will need to continue to be closely
        monitored as the City grows. Yosemite Community College District (YCCD)
        encompasses the City of Oakdale and surrounding area. The YCCD offers
        general education courses through the Oakdale Outreach site at Oakdale
        High School, and has approached the City with possible plans to build a
        satellite educational center in Oakdale.
       Libraries - The Stanislaus County Library system provides library services
        throughout the County, including a centrally located branch in the City of
        Oakdale. The libraries in Stanislaus County are funded in large part by a
        1/8-cent dedicated sales tax first passed by the voters in 1995, again in
        1999 and in 2004. The current tax is in effect until June 30, 2013.
       Health Care – Oak Valley Hospital, a full service nonprofit public hospital,
        is located within the City of Oakdale. Oak Valley recently completed a new
        replacement hospital facility within the City.
    The General Plan includes polices that advocate adequate police and fire services
    and facilities to protect the long-term health, safety and well-being of the
    community; accessible parks, schools and libraries that promote life-long activity
    and learning, serving as focal points of community interaction and identify; and
    high quality health care facilities for the City’s residents.

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
       Context
    The City of Oakdale values its natural and cultural resources and promotes
    environmental sustainability as a core principle. The community is committed to
    protecting and enhancing its unique habitats, nearby agricultural lands, air and
    water quality, mineral and visual resources, and its historic and cultural roots. A
    healthy natural environment contributes directly to existing and future quality of
    life. Key resources addressed by this element include:
         Open Space and Biological Resources – Natural habitats within the City
          and surrounding area include perennial grasslands, riparian woodlands,
          oak woodlands, and a variety of wetlands including vernal pools, seasonal
          wetlands, freshwater marshes, ponds, streams, and rivers (see Figure NR-1).
          Though much of these habitats have been lost or altered due to agriculture
          or urban development, the presence of scattered portions of undeveloped
          habitat and proximity to the Stanislaus River and its tributaries does provide
          suitable habitat for a variety of common and special-status plant and animal
          species.
         Agricultural Resources – Farming is important to the economy of both
          Oakdale and Stanislaus County. There are pockets of active agricultural
          lands within the city limits targeted primarily for future urban use. A majority
          of the lands outside the City, and north of the Stanislaus River within the
          City’s Sphere of Influence, are designated for long-term agricultural
          production. Principal agricultural products within the area include milk,
          almonds, chicken, cattle, and walnuts. Farmlands in the Planning Area,

                                     City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
 Water Resources and Quality - The Stanislaus River is the only major
  surface water body in the City. From its headwaters in the Sierra, the
  river flows in a west-southwesterly direction, emptying into the San
  Joaquin River and ultimately the San Francisco Bay. Two major dams
  are located along the Stanislaus River upstream of the City, the
  Tulloch and the New Melones Reservoirs. Water quality in the
  Stanislaus River is relatively good. There are also a number of
  local/minor surface water bodies in the City and adjacent areas (See
  Figure NR-3). Oakdale primarily overlies the Modesto Groundwater
  Subbasin. Groundwater levels within this basin have fluctuated over
  the last 40 years within approximately 20 feet of 1970 levels, with
  some portions of the basin showing a general decline over the last 20
  years. Groundwater quality is generally good, with some localized
  areas of hard water and high chloride, boron, Dibromochloropropane
  (DBCP), nitrate, iron, and manganese. Areas that contribute to
  groundwater recharge are also shown on Figure NR-3.
 Mineral Resources – The California Geological Survey has defined
  areas along the Stanislaus River within the City and surrounding area
  as Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2). This designation indicates a high
  likelihood for occurrence of significant mineral deposits. While there
  are no active mining operations in the City or immediately surrounding
  area, historical mineral production included construction aggregate
  along the Stanislaus River. In addition, three plugged and abandoned
  oil wells are located outside of the City limits.  
 Visual Resources –  Key visual resources within Oakdale consist of
  buildings within the City’s historic Downtown, its nearby historic
  neighborhoods, and views of the Stanislaus River corridor. Other
  important visual resources include views to the extensive agricultural
  and rural lands surrounding the City, as well as distant views to the
  east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Development within the
  City does produce light and glare that can impact views of the night
  sky.
 Cultural Resources – The City and surrounding area contain various
  paleontological, archaeological, and historic resources. Included are
  a number of identified historic and prehistoric archaeological sites.
  Built environment resources in Oakdale include some of the first homes
  constructed in the City dating from the 1870s and 1880s, early-
  twentieth-century homes, early brick buildings in the Downtown dating
  from the 1910s to 1920s, and buildings and structures associated with
  the railroad and the processing of agricultural goods.
  A number of these structures have previously been identified as
  potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP).
  The First National Bank Building, built in 1909 and located at the
  northwest Corner of F Street and Yosemite Avenue, is the only NRHP
  listed building in the City.

     City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
       Context
     The City of Oakdale is committed to sustaining the long-term health and safety of
     the community through protection from natural and man-made disasters. A
     healthy and safe Oakdale contributes to the well-being of residents, and is an
     important consideration in retaining and attracting quality businesses. Key topics
     addressed by this element include:
        Disaster Preparedness & Emergency Response – The Oakdale Fire
         Department and Oakdale Police Department provide first response to the
         City in the event of disasters and emergencies. Both Departments have
         mutual and automatic aid agreements with Stanislaus County, neighboring
         agencies, and surrounding jurisdictions. In addition, the City participates in
         the Stanislaus County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, which
         identifies risks posed by disasters and ways to minimize damage from those
         disasters. Oakdale periodically conducts disaster preparedness exercises to
         test and improve emergency response.
        Flood Protection – The entirety of the Stanislaus River channel within
         Oakdale contains 100-year flood and 500-year flood zones, per the
         Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate
         Maps (FIRM), as illustrated on Figure PHS-1. A 100-year event is defined as
         a flood that has a one percent chance of annual occurrence, and a 500-
         year event has a 0.2 percent chance of annual occurrence. Flooding along
         the Stanislaus River is largely mitigated by the New Melones Reservoir, the
         operation of which effectively limits downstream releases of water.

                                           City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
Figure PHS-1 identifies FEMA Flood Zones, Awareness Floodplains, and
Designated Floodways within the Planning Area:
    FEMA Flood Zones. Key FEMA regulated flood zone areas include Zones
     A and AE, both of which require mandatory flood insurance purchase
     and application of floodplain management standards. Zone A includes
     areas subject to 100-year flood events generally determined using
     approximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have
     not been performed, no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are
     available. Zone AE also includes areas subject to 100-year flood events,
     but as determined by detailed methods. Therefore, identified BFE’s and
     flood depths are available.
    Awareness Floodplains. Awareness floodplains are generated by the
     California Department of Water Resources, and are intended to identify
     100-year flood hazards currently not mapped as a FEMA regulated
     floodplain. The intent of awareness floodplain information is to provide an
     additional tool in understanding potential flood hazards. The awareness
     maps identify the 100-year flood hazard areas using approximate
     assessment procedures, and are simply shown as flood prone areas without
     specific depths and other flood hazard data.
    Designated Floodways. Designated floodways include the channel of the
     Stanislaus River and the adjacent land areas that would be under water
     during a flood. Designated floodways are to be maintained in order to
     discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
     elevation more than a designated height. Oakdale is required to regulate
     development in these floodways to ensure that there are no increases in
     upstream flood elevations, and obtain an encroachment permit from the
     Central Valley Flood Protection Board if a project is within 300 feet of a
     designated floodway.
Other information regarding flood hazards including data from the US Army
Corps of Engineers, Levee Flood Protection Zones, and historical data was either
not available or not applicable to the City of Oakdale. State regulations require
200-year flood protection in Oakdale, and other urban areas within the Central
Valley, within three years after adoption of the Central Valley Flood Protection
Plan. That Plan is anticipated to be adopted in July 2012. 200-year floodplains
have a 0.5 percent chance of annual occurrence of flooding, and have been
delineated for some regions of the Central Valley. At the time of General Plan
adoption, the lower Stanislaus River had not yet been delineated by the State
Department of Water Resources.
Two major dams, Tulloch and New Melones, are located upstream of the City. In
the rare event of dam failure, Oakdale would be inundated with water. As
reflected on Figure PHS-2, the northern portion of the City is located within the
Tulloch Dam inundation area, while the majority of the City is within the New
Melones Dam inundation area.

        Geologic & Seismic Hazards – Oakdale’s topography varies, but is
         generally flat with relatively steep slopes along the Stanislaus River. Several
         soil types can be found in the City, some of which could cause geologic
         hazards associated with erosion and expansive soils.
         Although Oakdale is located in a region (within 100 kilometers) that is
         subject to seismic activity from a number of faults, no active or potentially
         active faults are known to underlie the City itself. Oakdale is not located
         within an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, and no surface evidence of
         faulting has been observed. However, in the event of an earthquake in the
         region, groundshaking could affect the City and potentially cause property
         damage.
        Hazardous Materials – Hazardous materials are routinely used, stored, and
         transported into and out of Oakdale. These materials are associated with
         industrial and commercial uses, as well as educational facilities, hospitals,
         medical/dental facilities, residential uses, and agriculture. Another major
         source of hazardous materials in the City includes underground fuel tanks,
         which are primarily associated with retail gasoline stations. A number of
         federal, State, and local laws regulate the management of hazardous
         materials.
         In the event of the release of a hazardous material into the environment, the
         Oakdale Fire Department is responsible for the containment and clean-up of
         small scale releases. In the event of a large hazardous materials incident, the
         Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources would assist.

                                                               Noise
The Noise Element presents a set of goals, policies and standards to ensure that
exposure to harmful noise is minimized in Oakdale. It is the intent of this element to
make certain that development allowed under the 2030 General Plan will be
compatible with the existing and future noise environment, and diminish potential
exposure to excessive or harmful noise.
    Our noise vision includes…
      Minimized exposure to excessive noise and vibration
      Land uses compatible with the existing and future noise
       environment
      Protection of noise-sensitive land uses
      Establishment of consistent noise standards
                                                                                       CONTENTS

   City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
     Context
   The City of Oakdale recognizes the relationship between noise and the well-being
   of the community. Excessive noise levels can affect the physical health, property
   values, and economic productivity of Oakdale’s residents, businesses, and visitors.
   As such, regulating noise is essential to creating a safe, compatible, and productive
   environment.
   Noise sources are generally classified in one of two major categories:
   stationary/non-transportation sources; or mobile/transportation sources. A
   stationary noise source includes fixed equipment such as HVAC or heavy industrial
   equipment. Mobile/transportation noise sources can be generated from traffic,
   trains, and aircraft.
       Traffic Noise. Throughout Oakdale, the primary noise sources is and will
        continue to be transportation related. Vehicle traffic along SR 120 and SR 108
        are the greatest noise source, and cause sustained noise levels. Existing
        roadway noise exposure and contour distances in Oakdale are presented in
        Table N-1. Future roadway noise exposure and contour distances based on
        development allowed under the 2030 General Plan are presented in Table N-
        2. At the time of this General Plan’s approval, a final alignment for the NCC
        had not been adopted. Should an alignment be adopted that generates noise
        within the Planning Area, the policies in this element will be applied.
       Aircraft Noise. The Oakdale Municipal Airport is an “island” extension of the
        City limits, located over 1 mile to the southeast of the City. Future development
        under the 2030 General Plan will be consistent with the Airport Land Use
        Commission Plan (ALUCP) as was being updated by the County at the time of
N-2                    NOISE

                                                      City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
      General Plan approval. Based upon information generated for the ALUCP
      update, no conflicts between airport operations and the City’s noise regulations
      were identified. Existing and future airport noise contours are shown in Figure
      N-1. It is anticipated that future airport operations will be similar to existing
      operations and minimal changes in noise contours would occur.
     Rail Line Noise. The City of Oakdale is served by four rail lines: the Burlington
      Northern and Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad, the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), the
      Oakdale Traction Corporation (OTC), and the Sierra Railroad. Estimated
      existing and future rail line noise exposure and contour distances are presented
      in Table N-3. As shown in Table N-3, train operations are not considered to be
      a dominant source of noise within the City.
     Stationary Sources. Stationary noise sources also contribute to the ambient
      noise environment in Oakdale. Residential areas can generate noise through
      the use of heating and cooling equipment, and through landscape maintenance
      activities such as gasoline-powered lawnmowers. Commercial uses can
      generate noise through the operation of rooftop heating and cooling
      equipment, and other activities, such as trash collection, and deliveries.
      Stationary noise sources at industrial uses include shipping and loading
      facilities, as well as large-scale manufacturing and processing equipment.
      Outdoor sports facilities that attract large numbers of spectators, such as high
      school football fields, can produce noise that affects nearby receptors.
  NOISE DEFINITIONS
  Decibel (dB): A logarithmic unit of sound intensity where 0 dB is the    Maximum Sound Level (Lmax): The Lmax is the highest instantaneous
  threshold of normal hearing and 130 dB is the threshold of pain.         sound level measured during a specified period.
  Decibel (dBA): Measurement unit for A-weighted decibels, which are       Day-Night Average Level (Ldn): The Ldn is the energy-average of A-

  Policy Framework
N-1: NOISE REGULATION
Goal N-1
Minimal exposure of residents and businesses to harmful noise and
vibrations.
 NOISE AND LAND USE COMPATIBILITY POLICIES
N-1.1         Land Use Compatibility. Consider the compatibility of new developments
              with the existing noise environment when reviewing discretionary proposals.
              (RDR, N-IP1)
N 1.2         New Noise-Sensitive Development. Require development of new noise-
              sensitive land uses to mitigate noise impacts where the projected exterior or
              interior environmental noise levels appropriate to the land use types exceed
              those shown in Tables N-4 (Maximum Allowable Environmental Noise
              Standards from Transportation Sources) and/or N-5 (Noise Level Standards
              for Stationary Sources). (RDR, N-IP1)
                NOISE SENSITIVE USES
                Noise sensitive uses are defined as homes, daycares, schools, convalescent homes,
                medical facilities, and hospitals.
N 1.3         New Stationary Noise Sources. Require new stationary noise sources to
              mitigate noise impacts on noise-sensitive uses where the noise from that
              source alone exceeds the exterior levels specified in Table N-5 (Noise Level
              Standards from Stationary Sources). (RDR, N-IP1)
N 1.4         Frequent, High-Noise Events. Require development of noise-sensitive uses
              proposed in areas subject to frequent, high-noise events (such as aircraft

OAKDALE 2030 GENERAL PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION

                                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
                             Implementation
The ultimate measure of an adopted general plan is how effectively its policies are
carried out to achieve the community’s vision and goals. The purpose of this chapter
is to describe the actions the City of Oakdale will undertake, and will require of new
developments, to achieve the city’s vision of its future. This chapter also discusses
monitoring, amending, and maintaining consistency with the General Plan.
   General Plan
   Administration
REVIEW AND MONITORING  
The City of Oakdale will regularly review the 2030 General Plan to evaluate
progress in implementing its goals and policies. Since issues the General Plan
addresses will continue to evolve over time, a regular review and reporting of
implementation will help ensure the City is moving forward in achieving the General
Plan’s vision. This review will report on the status of each implementation program,
                                                    IMPLEMENTATION                    IM-1

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    and consider any new planning tools, policy approaches, funding sources, and
    feedback from monitoring activities. The findings of the review will be sent to the
    Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, as required by Government Code
    Section 65400.
    GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS  
    As conditions and needs change, the City may want to consider proposed
    amendments to the General Plan. Some of these amendments may consist of
    changes to the Land Use Diagram, while others may include or consist of policy
    changes. Each of these changes will need to be carefully evaluated for merit,
    potential impacts, and for consistency with the remainder of the General Plan. State
    law requires that the General Plan be an integrated and internally consistent set of
    goals, policies, and implementation programs.
    State law also limits the number of times per year that a general law city, such as
    Oakdale, can amend mandatory elements of the General Plan. An element may not
    be amended more than four times in a one calendar year except in certain
    circumstances as described in Government Code Section 65358. Each amendment
    may include more than one change to the General Plan. All proposed General Plan
    Amendments are to be processed consistent with the City’s standard review
    requirements.
    GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY  
    The City of Oakdale will use the General Plan to guide a wide range of actions. All
    actions and decisions made by the City should be consistent with the adopted
    General Plan to ensure that its policies are systematically implemented. City actions
    that must be consistent with the General Plan include, but are not limited to: master
    plans; capital projects; subdivision approvals; development code and zoning;
    specific plans; development projects; and development agreements.
      Implementation Tools and
      Programs
    The City will implement a majority of the 2030 General Plan’s goals and policies
    through a number of routine actions, regulations, and operations. These “Standard
    Implementation Tools” can be grouped into the following six categories:
         1. City Regulations and Development Review;
         2. City Master Plans, Programs and Other Documents;
         3. City Operations, Financing and Budget;
         4. Intergovernmental Coordination;
IM-2                  IMPLEMENTATION

                                              City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
     5. Joint Partnerships; and
     6. Public Information
Where a particular policy is not implemented, or fully implemented, by the standard
actions or tools above, “Specific Implementation Programs” have been identified.
The Specific Implementation Programs are focused actions to implement individual
policies or a series of related policies. Each Specific Implementation Program
includes identification of City departments responsible for implementation. Timing of
Implementation Programs will be determined by the City based upon the availability
of funding and prioritization of resources.
Every policy within the 2030 General Plan is linked to one or more implementation
tool or program. Two- to three-letter identifiers (italicized and in parentheses) are
shown after each policy, indicating the tools or programs that will implement the
policy.
STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS  
City Regulations and Development Review (RDR)
The City’s Zoning Code is one of the primary tool for implementing the General
Plan. The Zoning Code provides permitted uses, development standards, and other
regulations that direct development and support implementation of General Plan
policies. In addition to the Zoning Code, there are other City regulations, plans and
policies in place to ensure growth and change occur in a consistent manner that
furthers the direction of the General Plan. The City’s Zoning Code and other
regulations also establish development review processes that provide for City review
of individual project proposals and authorize the City to approve, deny, or
condition projects based on their consistency with the General Plan and other
considerations.
Regulatory plans and ordinances that will commonly be used by the City of
Oakdale to implement General Plan policies include, but are not limited to:
          Zoning Code (and other chapters of the City’s Municipal Code)
          Specific Plans
          Subdivision Ordinance
          Building and Safety Codes
          Development Review
          Design Expectations
          City Standard Specifications
          California Environmental Quality Act
Subsequent to adoption of the General Plan, the City will review and update its
regulatory plans, ordinances, and processes, as appropriate, to be consistent with
and further implement the 2030 General Plan and associated Climate Action Plan.
                                                  IMPLEMENTATION                     IM-3

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
    Immediate priority should be given to updating the City’s Zoning Code and
    implementing the financing plans for CCSP and SPSP.
    City Master Plans, Programs, and Other Documents (MP)
    Oakdale has adopted various master plans, programs, and other documents that
    direct City services and facilities. Key amongst these is the City’s Capital
    Improvement Program which is the primary mechanism to schedule and fund
    improvements of citywide benefit. Master plans, programs, and other documents
    that will commonly be used by the City of Oakdale to implement the General Plan
    include, but are not limited to:
              Capital Improvement Program (within the Capital Facilities Fee Updated
               Nexus Study)
              Oakdale Municipal Airport Master Plan
              Urban Water Management Plan
              Sewer Master Plan
              Storm Drainage Study
              Storm Water Management Program
              Fire Master Plan
              Stanislaus County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan
              Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Master Plan
              Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan
              Stanislaus County Non-Motorized Transportation Plan
              Climate Action Plan
              Oakdale-Riverbank Corridor Area Agreement
              Oakdale Enterprise Zone
    Subsequent to adoption of the General Plan, the City will review and update its
    master plans, programs, and other documents, as appropriate, to be consistent with
    and further implement the 2030 General Plan and associated Climate Action Plan.
    Immediate priority should be given to creating a long-term Capital Improvement
    Program, updating the Capital Facilities Fee, and updating the utility master
    plans/studies/programs.
    City Operations, Financing and Budget (OFB)
    The City provides a broad range of services to its residents, businesses, and visitors
    and manages and operates public facilities to meet community needs. The type,
    quantity and quality of services and facilities provided by the City should account
    for General Plan policy, and can make a significant difference in how effectively the
    General Plan is implemented. Services and facilities require financial resources from
    a variety of sources. The City’s projected revenues and recommended spending are
    accounted for in its annual budget.
IM-4                  IMPLEMENTATION

                                               City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
The following are some of the revenue sources that have been used by or are
available to the City of Oakdale to support development, maintenance, or operation
of public facilities and services consistent with the General Plan:
       Property tax revenue
       Sales tax revenue
       User fees
       Capital Facilities Fee/Development fees
       Quimby Act (Park) dedications
       School impact fees
       County impact fees
       Business improvement districts
       Community facilities and special assessment districts
       Municipal bonds
       Special taxes
       County, state, and federal funding
Subsequent to adoption of the General Plan, the City will review and update its fee
and other revenue generating programs, to be consistent with and further
implement the services, facilities and programs identified in the 2030 General Plan
and associated Climate Action Plan.
Intergovernmental Coordination (IGC)
For a number of policies, implementation of the General Plan will depend upon or
be enhanced through coordination with and potential actions by other agencies.
Decisions made by the City affect the region, and activities outside of Oakdale have
varying impacts on the City. Implementing General Plan policies necessitates
intergovernmental coordination and collaboration in order to achieve wide-ranging
goals. The City must coordinate with numerous local, regional, state, and federal
agencies that provide services, facilities, funding and/or administer regulations that
directly or indirectly affect General Plan implementation.
Public agencies that the City of Oakdale will commonly need to coordinate with to
implement General Plan policies include, but are not limited to:
           Local agencies such as Stanislaus County; City of Riverbank; City of
            Modesto; special districts; and school districts
           Regional agencies such as Stanislaus County Local Agency Formation
            Commission (LAFCO); San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District;
            Regional Water Quality Control Board; Stanislaus Council of
            Governments (StanCOG); and Stanislaus County Airport Land Use
            Commission
                                                    IMPLEMENTATION                    IM-5

    City of Oakdale 2030 General Plan
                State agencies such as Caltrans and Native American Heritage
                 Commission (NAHC)
                Federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS); U.S.
                 Army Corps of Engineers; and Federal Emergency Management Agency
                 (FEMA)
    Joint Partnerships (JP)
    Partnering with non-governmental public and private organizations provides
    additional opportunities to implement the General Plan in an effective and efficient
    manner. A coordinated approach to addressing various General Plan policies with
    agencies and organizations that have expertise in specific areas will allow Oakdale
    to better serve its residents. Non-governmental agencies and organizations that the
    City may coordinate and partner with include, but are not limited to, utility
    companies, transit providers, solid waste services, private schools, higher education
    institutions, healthcare providers/hospitals, railroad operators, chamber of
    commerce, development interests, and businesses.
    Public Information (PI)
    The City can use a wide range of tools to keep Oakdale residents informed of City
    services, activities and issues that directly relate to implementation of General Plan
    policies. The City of Oakdale may distribute public information through media such
    as brochures, pamphlets, the city’s website, workshops, seminars, public access
    television, radio, newspapers, public hearings, neighborhood and community
    meetings, customer service hotlines, and similar.

    easements on the private property of individuals to be able to install and maintain
    utility facilities.
    Easement, Agricultural Conservation. A voluntary, legally recorded deed restriction
    that is placed on a specific property used for agricultural production. The goal of an
    agricultural conservation easement is to maintain agricultural land in active
    production by removing the development pressures from the land. Such an
    easement prohibits practices which would damage or interfere with the agricultural
    use of the land. Because the easement is a restriction on the deed of the property,
    the easement remains in effect even when the land changes ownership
    Easement, Conservation. A voluntary, legally recorded deed restriction that is
    placed on a specific property to limit or restrict development. The intent is to protect
    and preserve the land and associated resources. The activities allowed by a
    Conservation easement depend on the landowner's wishes and the characteristics of
    the property. In some instances, no further development is allowed on the land. In
    other circumstances some additional development is allowed, but the amount and
    type of development is less than would otherwise be allowed.

by Dillon’s rule which is a doctrine that says that a unit of local government may
exercise only those powers that the state expressly grants to it.
Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). The California State Legislature
adopted Assembly Bill (AB) 32 in 2006, which focuses on reducing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions in California. AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board
(California ARB), the state agency charged with regulating statewide air quality, to
adopt rules and regulations that would achieve GHG emissions equivalent to statewide
levels in 1990 by 2020.

Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). As defined under Assembly Bill 32, greenhouse gases
include all of the following: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. These gasses occur
naturally in the environment and act to trap solar energy and warm earth’s lower
atmosphere. This “greenhouse effect” is a natural phenomenon, without which the
planet would be significantly colder and unable to sustain life as we know it. A broad
scientific consensus has been reached that concludes that addition of greenhouse gases
to the atmosphere by human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels but also
land use changes, is increasing the potency of the greenhouse effect and leading to
global climate change and increased temperatures on the planet.
