Impact pile driving has the potential of generating the

to structural damage. Other project construction activities,
such as caisson drilling, the use of jackhammers, rock drills,

equipment (tracked vehicles, compactors, etc.) can
generate substantial vibration levels in the immediate
vicinity.
Options for Noise Reduction
Because ground transportation noise is the dominant
source of noise in East Palo Alto, it is unlikely that
proposed actions would cause a substantial increase in
noise in the community. There is currently ongoing
research on the effects of different types of pavement
surfaces on the noise generated by vehicular traffic. The
interaction of tires and pavement is the main source of
traffic noise. The City of East Palo Alto has no jurisdiction
over the noise generated by automobiles, the types of tires
drivers select, etc., but the City can select the type of
pavement that it uses to repave its streets. The
consideration of quiet pavement surfaces in the City’s
repaving plans provides an opportunity to make a
noticeable reduction in traffic noise along City streets in
East Palo Alto.

Issues and Opportunities
Geography
The Westside area – shown in Figure 11-1 – is bounded
by Highway 101 to the northeast, San Francisquito Creek
and the City of Palo Alto to the southwest, and a
meandering boundary line shared with Menlo Park to the
west and northwest. The Westside area encompasses
107 acres, approximately eight percent of the City’s land
area but has a relatively high population density,
containing 22 percent of East Palo Alto’s residents. The

the neighborhood is also hidden from public view behind
an unassuming three-story apartment complex and the
dense growth along the San Francisquito Creek. While
being very prominent on Highway 101 and University
Avenue, the University Circle project is set back from the
street and buffered by landscaping and surface parking
along both University and Woodland Avenues. The
setback nature of the project and the walls created by
the structured parking on Manhattan Avenue sets the
project off from the rest of the Westside neighborhoods.
The structure and development pattern of the Westside,
outside of the recently developed University Circle
project, follows historical patterns of development. Prior
to the construction of Highway 101, in the Willows
neighborhood, O’Connor Street and Donohoe Street fed
into the retail core on University Avenue with single-
family homes with orchards behind. During a period of
strong growth, O’Keefe Street was added between the
streets, and multi-family housing was developed in the
open orchard land. The area south of University Avenue
had much less development prior to the construction of
Highway 101 and consisted of houses located along
Woodland Avenue and mainly agricultural lands east of

13) Improve public safety. Reducing crime and
    promoting a safe environment throughout the
    Westside should be a top priority. Increased police
    patrolling and street lighting should be improved in
    areas of high crime.
14) Beautify the Westside. The physical environment of
    the Westside should be enhanced to become more
    attractive. This includes adding street trees,
    renovating streets to add curbs and gutters,
    improving the visual character of buildings, requiring
    high-quality design for renovation and new
    buildings, and adding parks and open space,
    including recreation opportunities along San
    Francisquito Creek.

          •   New streets. If significant redevelopment
              of the Westside occurs through a master
              planning process, seek opportunities to
              create new streets in the Westside that
              provide for improved vehicular access and
              pedestrian and bicycle circulation. New
              streets also increase the opportunity for
              new open space.
5.13 Existing building renovation. Encourage existing
     buildings to conduct small and large-scale
     renovations. This could range from minor
     improvements to facades and interiors to
     structural improvements to complete renovations
     of individual units. Any renovation or
     rehabilitation shall comply with requirements for
     replacement housing as set forth in Policy 5.9.
5.14 Gradation of height. Design new development so
     that there is transition in building height. The
     greatest height and intensity should be focused
     towards Highway 101 and University Avenue,
     transitioning to lower heights no more than three
     stories near San Francisquito Creek and along the
     western portion of O’Keefe Street that is adjacent
     to residential neighborhoods.
5.15 Neighborhood transitions and character. For new
     multi-family development in the Westside that is
     adjacent to existing single-family residential
     neighborhoods, provide transitions in height,
     increased build setbacks and landscaping to
     minimize the impact on adjacent low density
     residential uses.

residential neighborhoods are near University Avenue’s
retail uses, or near the Ravenswood 101 Shopping Center.
There is also a relatively significant amount of vacant land,
primarily concentrated along Bay Road within the area of
the Ravenswood TOD Specific Plan, where previously
industrial businesses were located. Institutional uses,
public facilities, and parks and recreational facilities
account for approximately 10 percent of the land area in
the City.                                                     Gateway from Menlo Park at the intersection of Newell

centers with clusters of similar or active uses – located in
close proximity to one another throughout the City. These
hubs are shown in Figure 4-1. These hubs function as focal
points and destinations in the City, and are important
places to encourage pedestrian activity and active land
uses. The most important ones are:
   • Bell Street Recreation Hub. Recreational uses and
       social services, including the YMCA, Senior Center, a
       Community Health and Law Center, Bell Street Park
       and the School District.

Neighborhoods, Districts,
and Corridors
The neighborhoods, districts and corridors concept sub-
divides the City into unique areas since strategies for
change, growth and prosperity will vary by area. Each and
every parcel in the City is located in one of the identified
sub-areas and goals and policies for growth and
preservation are provided with each sub-area. The sub-
area goals and policies supplement the citywide goals and
policies presented on the previous pages. A map of the
sub-areas is presented in Figure 4-3. Note that the
Westside areas of Woodland and Willow are not included
in this section but are included in the Westside Area Plan
chapter of the General Plan.

University Corridor
Existing Conditions
University Avenue is a major corridor that bisects East
Palo Alto, creating a barrier between the two sides of the
City. This important street is used as a cut-through route
for traffic accessing the Dumbarton Bridge to the north
and 101 Bayshore Freeway to the south. The uses on
corridor vary from multi-family housing to single story
retail with surface parking to single family homes. Several
public and institutional uses also front the corridor,
including the County civic center and East Palo Alto City
Hall, a fire house, the Senior Center and the YMCA. The
parcel sizes vary and many are relatively small thus
making it more difficult to revitalize the corridor with new,
higher intensity development.

Infill Development Example #1: New development that occupies both the front and back parcels, allowing the
front building to present a 3- to 5-story mixed-use facade to University Avenue, while the building in the back is
more compatible in scale and character to adjacent residential dwellings.

4 Corners/Bay Road Corridor
Existing Conditions
The 4 Corners neighborhood is centered on the
intersection of University Avenue and Bay Road. Uses
around this intersection are primarily in the form of small
neighborhood stores with parking in front. East Palo
Alto’s City Hall and the San Mateo County library are
located in a county building to the north of this
intersection. Across from the civic area is a six-acre vacant
lot that formerly housed the Nairobi Village Shopping
Center. Multi-family housing (townhouses, duplexes,
triplexes, and apartment buildings) have been developed
on the south side of Bay Road. It is an area that is
expected to experience substantial changes and its future
will be guided through implementation of the
Ravenswood TOD Specific Plan. Opportunities for 4
Corners identified in the Specific Plan include the creation
of a main street/downtown, improved connections and
streetscapes, and additional mixed-use development in
the area.

Weeks Neighborhood
Existing Conditions
The Weeks neighborhood began as part of the original
Runnymede agricultural community under County
jurisdiction. Its rich agricultural heritage remains evident
today in the form of greenhouses and historic farmstead
homes that remain in the neighborhood. Overall, the area
has an eclectic feel and, unlike other parts of the City,
Weeks has many large, deep parcels which provide ample
opportunity for new development. Clarke Road and Pulgas
Avenue are well-used north-south corridors with high
traffic volumes.

          Figure 6-8: Street Network
As described above on page 6-12, the City's street network contains a variety of types intended to support a wide spectrum of users and
adjacent land uses. Combined, the types represent a hierarchical network linked to typical design standards and anticipated traffic levels.

 CHAPTER 6: TRANSPORTATION
Figure 6-13: Neighborhood Street and Neighborhood Connector
Numerous local residential streets throughout the City are designated as Neighborhood Streets. Neighborhood Streets are wide enough
to allow slow-flow operation, allowing vehicles moving in opposite directions to pass each other at slow speeds. Clarke, Euclid, Fordham,
Pulgas and portions of Cooley, Glen Way, Runnymede and O’Connor are designated as Neighborhood Connectors. The typical physical
dimensions and elements of these two street types are similar, and typical elements are illustrated in the figure above. The primary
difference between the Neighborhood Connector and the Neighborhood Street type is that the Neighborhood Connector type is intended
(a) to serve more destinations (such as local schools) than the Neighborhood Street, and (b) to distribute local traffic to neighborhood
streets. Neighborhood Connectors are therefore designated to accommodate low-to-medium traffic volumes. By contrast, the
Neighborhood Street serves primarily local traffic and is designated for low volumes. These street types are collectively referred to in the
NACTO Urban Street Design Guide as “Neighborhood Streets”. Additional information on this street type is provided on page 16 of the
Urban Street Design Guide. (Image source: NACTO Urban Street Design Guide.)
                                                                          CITY OF EAST PALO ALTO: GENERAL PLAN 2035 | 6-17

 CHAPTER 6: TRANSPORTATION
Figure 6-14: Yield Street
The most slender local residential streets in the City are designated as Yield Streets. The Yield Street type is distinguished by a slender
curb-to-curb width, and typically includes segments where two-way traffic is not possible when vehicles are parked at the curb: in such
segments, some drivers must stop and yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. This is referred to as yield-flow operation. As noted in
the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Residential Streets, Third Edition, “Yield flow occurs when two-way traffic is impossible
where parked vehicles are present. Thus, some motorists must stop and yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles. For decades prior to
the 1960s, yield flow was the widely accepted norm for local streets. Thus, the vast majority of local streets throughout the United States
operate at yield flow.” Recent research has confirmed the traffic calming and safety benefits of this street type. Additional information
on this street type is provided on page 17 of the Urban Street Design Guide and pages 12-50 of the ITE’s Residential Streets, Third Edition.

Historic Resouces                                                Figure 8-6: Potential Historic Resources
In 2015, the City Council adopted the inventory of
resources in a 1994 Historic Resources Report as the ‘Local
Register of Historic Resources.’ The public interest in
preserving historic resources dates back to the adoption of
the City’s first General Plan in 1986, which includes a
Historic Element as Chapter 9 in the Table of Contents that
was not completed. Later, in 1994, East Palo Alto residents,
historians, and members of the East Palo Alto Historical
and Agricultural Society (the “Historical Society”) worked
with the San Mateo County Historical Association
(“SMCHA”) to identify historic resources within the City of
East Palo Alto. Funded by a grant from the Peninsula
Community Foundation, the SMCHA completed a Historic
Resources Report that identified 52 historic resources,
some of which include multiple buildings, and details why
the inventory of properties qualify as historic.
The inventory contained in the 1994 Historic Resources
Report was included in the 1997 Weeks Neighborhood
Plan (Neighborhood Plan), which was an effort by
Historical Society and other community members to craft a
unique vision for the Weeks Neighborhood. Among other
things, the Neighborhood Plan calls for the City to adopt
the inventory contained in the 1994 Historic Resources
Report and to impose less restrictive building regulations
on historic properties. Although the Neighborhood Plan
was never adopted, the 1999 General Plan included goals,
policies, and an implementation program that articulates
the community’s interest in the preservation of historic
resources.
Of 52 resources included in the 1994 Historic Resources
Report, seven were classified as “3,” meaning they had
potential to be listed on the National Register of Historic
Properties. Eight of the properties were classified as “4,”
meaning that they might be eligible for listing. The other
37 properties were classified as “5,” signifying that they
are likely ineligible for listing but still have local interest.

resources.

City of East Palo Alto Housing Element
1 INTRODUCTION
 Housing is a basic human necessity and the need for housing is shared by all residents. People want         
 living spaces where they feel a sense of dignity, where they can express their individuality, and where
 they can be comfortable and healthy. Safe, well-maintained housing is a basic need that transcends
 age, race, income, and marital status. As such, the City of East Palo Alto encourages a diversity of
 housing types, costs, and locations to serve the variety of needs and wants of local residents.
 1.1       ROLE OF HOUSING ELEMENT
 The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
 environment for every citizen as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the important role of
 local planning programs in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and
 counties prepare a Housing Element as part of the comprehensive General Plan. Section 65583 of the
 Government Code sets forth the specific components to be contained in a Housing Element. State law
 further requires Housing Elements be updated at least every eight years to reflect the changing housing
 needs of a community. As East Palo Alto’s Housing Element was last updated in 2009, this Update is
 for the planning period of 2015–2023.
The Housing Element Update consists of the following major components:
Analysis of East Palo Alto’s demographic profile, housing characteristics, and existing and future
housing needs (Chapter 2).
Review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to housing development
(Chapter 3).
Evaluation of the land, financial, and organizational resources available to address the identified housing
needs (Chapter 4).
Housing plan to address the identified housing needs, including a statement of goals, policies, and
actions (Chapter 5).

1.2       DATA SOURCES
Various sources of information contribute to the Housing Element, including the American Community
Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau that provides the basis for population and household
characteristics. In addition, several data sources were used to supplement the survey include economic
and demographic projections by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and population
estimates by the California Department of Finance (DOF).
Housing market information is based on City surveys and property tax assessor's files, such as home
sales, rents, and vacancies.
Public and non-profit agencies input on data regarding special needs groups and the services available
to them or gaps in the service delivery system.
1.3       PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND PROCESS
East Palo Alto has a long history of extensive community involvement, and the 2015–2023 City of East
Palo Alto Housing Element is no exception. It was developed with the collaborative efforts of residents
and elected/appointed officials. Equally importantly, East Palo Alto has held dozens of meetings about
housing policy in recent years as part of the Ravenswood / 4 Corners Transit Oriented Development
(TOD) Specific Plan, the ongoing General Plan update, and during policy implementation. Several
opportunities for input on the Housing Element were provided through various forums as discussed
below.
Planning Commission considered the draft Housing Element in October 2014, followed by City Council
review in February 2015. The document was then sent to the California Department of Housing and
Community Development for Review in March. Concurrently, the city conducted required
Environmental Review.
The Planning Commission then held a public hearing in April 2015 and recommended that City Council
adopt the document. The City Council adopted the Housing on May 5th, 2015.
The Housing Element will be updated again in 2015/2016 as part of the General Plan update. This will
be an opportunity to add or modify policies and programs.

RAVENSWOOD / 4 CORNERS TOD SPECIFIC PLAN
The Specific Plan reflects extensive community input. From October 2009 through March 2011, the
City led a community process that included 15 public meetings, of which three were highly interactive
public workshops. A citizen’s advisory committee met five times and the Specific Plan was discussed
before the Planning Commission and City Council five times.
For example at one meeting participants created their preferred alternative by mixing and matching
elements from the other alternatives. Each small group then presented its preferred alternative to the
workshop as a whole. After all small groups presented, the project team worked with all participants to
identify areas of consensus among the groups, as well as areas where consensus had not yet been
reached. This resulted in a single map that formed the basis for the Community Preferred Alternative.
The Specific Plan outlines how the Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan area can be transformed
into thriving development districts that provide places to live; employment opportunities; parks and
open spaces; and amenities for all of East Palo Alto, such as expanded library service and a new
community center.
GENERAL PLAN OUTREACH AND WESTSIDE PLANNING
Starting in 2010, the City of East Palo Planning Agency (Planning Commission and Planning Division)
held a series of meetings to develop a scope of work to update the 1999 General Plan and to implement
it through new Zoning and Subdivision regulations. Acknowledging the need to measure the
effectiveness of the update over ten years, the City formed a core group of ten Bay Area partners whose
ideas were presented to the community with the goal of developing indicators which could meet the
City's need to establish new levels of service as measures of effectiveness. These partners wrote letters
of support for the City's grant application to the Strategic Growth Council and included 1) Youth United
for Community Action (YUCA), 2) the City/County Association of Governments of San Mateo County,
3) San Mateo County Health System, 4) the Palo Alto Housing Corporation, 5) the Ravenswood City
School District, 6) San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority, 7) San Francisco Bay National
Wildlife Refuge Complex, 8) the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, 9) the East Palo Alto
Bicycle Club, and 10) the Stanford University School of Medicine. The twenty-six indicators measure
tangible physical characteristics demonstrative of transformative change for the betterment of the
community's health and economy. After publicly vetting the ideas before the City's legislature (and its
advisory bodies), which passed several supportive resolutions, the City adopted a Capital Improvement
Program that bridges the 1999 General Plan to the future update by incorporating funding to improve,

among other things, mobility through new non-motorized byways and air-quality by an expansion of
the City's canopy of trees.
Since mid-2013, the City has been very focused on the General Plan Update process which has been
funded in large part by a $1 million grant from the State's Strategic Growth Council. The General Plan
Update process relies on advisory committees and other outreach opportunities. The City has hosted
many well-attended community events to help guide development of this plan for the City’s future. A
common theme throughout all these meetings has been the community’s strong desire to retain and
improve its affordable housing stock. Both rent-stabilized and permanent affordable housing units
remain a priority for the community, and some General Plan update meetings have focused almost
entirely on this subject.
Of particular note, in March 2014, the City held a meeting of its Westside Area Plan Advisory
Committee (WAPAC) that was attended by over 100 community members. The WAPAC provides
guidance and advice for the General Plan update as it relates to the Westside. The Westside is of
particular concern because the majority of East Palo Alto’s affordable housing is located in this area.
The purpose of the meeting was to provide an overview of the existing housing conditions in the city,
particularly in the Westside area, educate the community about the State and local laws, regulations and
programs that impact housing in the city, and discuss potential future scenarios for housing. The goal
was to develop a common understanding of housing constraints and opportunities upon which to build
a consensus for future housing policies to include in the General Plan update.
Subsequently, and building upon that March meeting, in June 2014, the City hosted a Town Hall
workshop attended by over 120 community members to prioritize guiding principles for the Westside
Area Plan, and discuss potential tradeoffs between different levels of permanent affordable housing,
including acceptable levels of density. Although the focus of the meeting was on the Westside, many
of the participants came from throughout the City and some lessons learned are applicable throughout
the City as well. Among the outcomes of this meeting:
Participants ranked Guiding Principles for the Plan. The top three were: 1) provide affordable rental
housing; 2) avoid displacement; and 3) on-going community participation in the Decision-Making
processes.
Participants ranked Community Needs and Priorities for the Plan. The top three were: 1) long term
affordable housing; 2) no displacement of existing renters; and 3) stronger tenant protection laws.

Participants generally indicated a willingness to consider higher density development in exchange for
more permanent affordable housing. Participants generally indicated a preference for low, very low and
extremely low income housing units, as opposed to moderate income units.
Participants generally agreed with the following prerequisites for higher density development in the
Westside:
1.       Permanent affordable housing;
2.       Prevent displacement of existing residents;
3.       Preserve “right of return” for existing residents – similar size and rent;
4.       Maintain the city’s rent stabilization program;
5.       High-quality new development;
6.       Health and safety improvements such as new sidewalks, parks, community centers, street
lighting, safer access across Highway 101, and other similar improvements; and
7.       Improved fiscal health of the City.
In December 2014, the community met again to address housing issues. This time they reviewed a
preliminary financial analysis of development scenarios for the Westside to help understand what level
of affordable housing and other community benefits the community could reasonably anticipate if
additional density were allowed under the General Plan update.
21 ELEMENTS COLLABORATIVE OUTREACH
East Palo Alto participated in the 21 Elements-coordinated outreach activities from October 2013 through
April 2014. 21 Elements facilitated four panel presentations and discussion with advocates representing
people with developmental disabilities and other special needs, affordable housing developers and
advocates, and funders. The panelists discussed their perspective on the unique housing needs of San
Mateo County, and provided some policy suggestions.

HOUSING ELEMENT SPECIFIC OUTREACH
The City held a community meeting on September 30th , 2014 to gather input on the Housing Element.
In particular, the City discussed the idea of updating the Housing Element in time for the January 31,
2015 deadline and again shortly afterwards as part of the General Plan update. 1The goal of this approach
is to give the community more time to provide input and to reflect the directions identified in the General
Plan.
East Palo Alto has received and considered letters from the Building Industry Association and the
Housing Leadership Council of San Mateo County.
On September 30, 2014, the City held a community workshop to discuss the relationship between, and
processes for, this current Housing Element update and the General Plan Update, provide an overview
of the existing Housing Element, and gather input from the community on the subjects that should be
addressed in each. The public was supportive of the idea of setting general direction in this housing
.element update and reserving the further development of the housing-related policies for when the
General Plan is adopted later in 2015.
HOW PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE CONSIDERED
Comments from community workshops and correspondence received during the update process have
helped to identify housing needs and issues of concern in the community and possible strategies for the
City to pursue in addressing housing needs.
The most common comments from the community were:
      Need for affordable housing – The community is very concerned about promoting more
          affordable housing, particularly in light of rapid increases in prices in East Palo Alto. They want
          the Rent Stabilization and renter protection ordinances protected.
      Overcrowding – Because prices are so high, many residents are forced to share apartments.
          This causes overcrowding and associated problems.
      Condition of homes – Many residents had concerns about the condition of their apartments.
          They feel they are not being maintained at an acceptable level.

  While the Housing Element refers to the January 2015 deadline, per state law the City has until May 2015
to have the final version adopted.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                        1-6

These issues, and others will be further addressed when East Palo Alto updates its General Plan in the
summer of 2015. This version of the Housing Element is intended to meet all the required aspects of state
law but not make significant policy shifts. Additional policies and programs will be added when the
Housing Element is adopted again along with the rest of the General Plan.
1.4       RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element update is a required Element of the City of East Palo Alto General Plan, which is
currently being updated. The changes to the document were carefully reviewed against the existing
General Plan and found to be consistent. Additionally, the Housing Element is consistent with the
Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan. A new Housing Element will be produced when the
General Plan is updated later in 2015.

2        HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Please see the existing conditions report, prepared for the 2015 General Plan update, for housing,
demographic, and economic data about the city.
           AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AT-RISK UNITS
Existing housing that receives governmental assistance or is generated through governmental policies
is often a significant source of affordable housing in many communities. This section identifies the
affordable housing in East Palo Alto and evaluates the potential for conversion to market rate between
2015 and 20251. Resources for preservation/replacement of these units are described in Chapter 4, and
housing programs to address preservation are described in Chapter 5.
When we discuss affordable housing, we mean housing that lower income households can afford
without paying more than 30 percent of their income to rent. The definition of lower income household
varies by location and household size, but the following conventions are used with most state and federal
programs:
Extremely Low Income = Households that make 30 percent of area median income ($33,950 for a family
of four)
Very Low Income= Households that make 50 percent of area median income ($56,550 for a family of
four)
Low Income = Households that make 80 percent of area median income ($90,500 for a family of four)
See the Existing Conditions Report for more detail.
INVENTORY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Compared to its surrounding communities, East Palo Alto has a large supply of affordable housing
developed through the use of federal, State, and local policies and assistance programs. Table 2-1
presents East Palo Alto’s supply of affordable rental units, most which receive Section 8 funding.
Currently, there are also over 80 below market rate homeownership units in the City of East Palo Alto.

AT-RISK AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS
Affordable housing options for most lower-income households are limited primarily to rental housing.
Therefore, preserving the existing affordable rental housing stock is an important goal for East Palo
Alto. Most affordable rental housing units are achieved through subsidy contracts and deed
restrictions/affordability covenants in exchange for construction and mortgage assistance. From time to
time, affordability restricted units are at risk of losing their affordability controls and may revert to other
than low-income uses. There are three main sources of “at-risk” rental units: (a) expiration of funding-
related affordability restrictions, (b) turnover of rent-stabilized units, and (c) foreclosure of BMR units.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                                                            2-2

FUNDING-RELATED AFFORDABILITY RESTRICTIONS
The following are some scenarios that may cause units to lose their affordability restrictions tied to
governmental funding expiring:
        Prepayment of HUD loans: In the mid-1960s, the federal government provided low-interest
         financing or mortgage insurance to housing developers in return for guaranteeing that rents
         remain affordable to lower-income households. After 20 years, the owners could prepay the
         mortgages and lift their rent restrictions, or maintain the affordability controls until their
         mortgages were paid off.
        Section 8 Program: In the mid-1970s, the federal government provided two approaches to
         encouraging the production of affordable rental housing. Under the Section 8 program, HUD
         provided a 15- or 20-year agreement on rental subsidies to property owners in return for making
         the units affordable to very low-income households. The income is typically the difference
         between 30 percent of the household’s income and a negotiated fair market rent for the area.
         Due to expiring Section 8 contracts and the uncertainty of future Section 8 funds, the future of
         an affordable complex receiving Section 8 funding is inherently uncertain.
        Section 236 Program: This program provided rent subsidies, in the form of interest reduction,
         through which multi-family housing could be produced. Two rent schedules were utilized:
         market rent, based on a market-rate mortgage; and basic rent, based on a one-percent mortgage.
         Tenants were required to pay the basic rent or 25 percent of their income, whichever was
         greater, with rent payments never to exceed market rents. Units were restricted to households
         that met the low- and moderate-income limits established for the program. The subsidized
         housing moratorium imposed by President Nixon in January 1973 brought an end to additional
         Section 236 construction.
        Bond Financed Projects: State, county, and local governments have the authority to issue tax-
         exempt mortgage revenue bonds to provide below market rate financing for rental housing
         construction. State and federal law requires that multi-family projects built with tax-exempt
         bond proceeds set-aside a portion of units as affordable to lower-income households for a
         specified period of time. The typical contractual period is 10 to 15 years. After the term expires,
         the property owners may rent the units at market rates.

           In many communities, bond-financed projects typically convert to market rates. Over time, rent
           levels increase in the community and the differential in market versus restricted rents increases
           to the point that unless additional financial benefits are offered, property owners have no
           incentive to maintain the units as affordable.
AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS AT-RISK BETWEEN 2015 AND 2025
State law requires that the City assess the risk of losing affordable rental housing over a ten-year
planning period. For this Housing Element Update, the at-risk analysis covers the ten-year period from
2015 through 2025. According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation and the City of East
Palo Alto, there are no affordable rental units with affordability contracts expiring over the ten-year
planning period.
Though the City of East Palo does not have any affordable rental units with contracts expiring between
2015 and 2025, the City is faced with a unique situation concerning the affordability of a significant
share of its rental housing stock. In late 2006, Page Mill Properties, a Palo Alto-based real estate
investment firm, assumed management of over 1,800 rental units in the Woodland Park neighborhood
of East Palo Alto. The property management group purchased the units at market value with the intent
to rehabilitate many of the units with deferred maintenance issues. In order to pay for the improvements,
including new roofs, gates, seismic upgrades, night security, and surveillance cameras, many tenants’
rents were increased twice in 2008, an average of 9 percent in the first rent change and an average of
7.7 percent in the second increase.2 Some tenants’ rents were raised considerably more than others; an
article in the San Mateo County Times reports that, while most rent increases were below 10 percent,
some exceeded 15 percent and one was 47 percent.3
East Palo Alto’s 1988 Rent Control Ordinance (repealed by the 2010 Rent Stabilization Ordinance but
which still applies to Mobile Home Park tenancies) stated that rents could be increased annually at 100
percent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the United States Department of Labor for the
San Francisco/Oakland Metropolitan Area (approximately 2.9 percent in 2008). However, as the
previous property owner did not annually increase rents, the property manager claimed to be able to
legally recapture the unused annual rent increases. Despite the City of East Palo Alto’s efforts to place
a six-month moratorium on rent increases and to declare the rent change unlawful, the San Mateo
County Superior Court ruled in favor of the property owner.

Page Mill Properties, however, defaulted in its loan obligations in 2009. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank
took title of these rental properties after foreclosure proceedings in 2010. Wells Fargo Bank then sold
them to Equity Residential, a Chicago based corporation, in December 2011. During the last few years,
many families have been forced out and rents have reached historic levels. The community has been at
fear of losing these rent controlled units to redevelopment driven by the high demand for housing in the
area.
As presented in the General Plan Existing Conditions Report, rental prices in the surrounding
communities are considerably higher than those in East Palo Alto. Consequently, residents unable to
afford the rent increase may be forced to leave the community, and the City of East Palo Alto could lose
a significant share of its affordable rental units.
MODERATE INCOME UNITS
Fifteen units in the City of East Palo Alto are income-restricted to moderate income households (90
percent of AMI), as they were purchased through the City’s Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing
Program. Due to the decline in home prices associated with the recession, moderate-income BMR units
may be at-risk of losing their continued affordability. If home prices in the city fall below a BMR
homeowner’s purchase price, a homeowner may have difficulty reselling the unit due to the resale
restriction. The City’s resale restrictions state that the maximum sales price permitted of a BMR unit
must be the lowest of the following amounts:
         the amount which would result in the maximum permitted affordable housing cost at the time
          of resale for a household of the maximum income level permitted to purchase that unit when
          initially sold;
         the seller’s lawful purchase price, increased at one-third the rate of increase in the consumer
          price index for the period the seller has owned the unit;
         fair market value, provided that in no event shall the seller be required to sell the home at a
          price lower than the seller’s lawful purchase price plus the seller’s reasonable cost of sales and
          the value of any capital improvements.
As resale restrictions limit a homebuyer’s ability to benefit financially from home appreciation,
homebuyers may not be interested in purchasing a unit with restrictions if they are able to purchase
other units in the City at the same price or lower without restrictions. Resale restrictions authorize the
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                       2-5

City to purchase any affordable owner-occupancy unit at the maximum price which could be charged
to a purchaser household at the time the owner proposes sale. If a BMR homeowner is unable to find a
buyer for his or her unit, he or she may seek assistance from the City to either remove the resale
restriction or purchase the unit.
When faced with a home that is both difficult to sell and has a value lower than the borrower’s
outstanding mortgage debt, some moderate-income, below market rate homeowners may choose to
default on their mortgage and enter foreclosure. As the City’s resale restrictions do not indicate whether
the restrictions survive foreclosure, BMR units of all income levels may be at - risk of losing their
continued affordability in the event of foreclosure. Since 2012, two units were sold because of
foreclosures, but the city was able to recapture the different between the market price and the affordable
price. This money was returned to the city’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
AT-RISK RENT-STABILIZED UNITS
In 2010, the voters of the City of East Palo Alto approved a ballot measure that sought to strengthen its
Rent Stabilization Program in existence since 1988 and to further stabilize rents, with certain
exemptions, over rental units within the jurisdictional limits of the City. Rent-stabilized units are an
important component of the City’s affordable housing stock. However, even these units are at-risk of
losing their affordability restrictions.
East Palo Alto has approximately 2500 rent stabilized apartments. The majority of these units are studios
or one bedrooms, and they tend to be affordable to very low or low income residents. Three quarters of
tenants have lived in their apartments for one to four years. There is a small group, approximately five
percent of tenants, who have lived in their homes at least ten years.
Recently de-controlled units in East Palo Alto rent for an average of $1,300 per month, about half the
rents found in San Mateo County and Santa Clara County. Rent control units generally rent for less,
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                     2-6

with the exact amount depends on the length of tenure and other factors. On average it is about 20
percent below market.
There are three primary means by which the loss of affordability may happen. First, affordable rental
units can turnover after a tenant moves out of a rent-stabilized unit. In those instances, under state law
(Costa-Hawkins Act), a landlord is permitted to raise the rent on such a unit to the market rate.
Second, a landlord is permitted under state law (Ellis Act), an under local law counterparts (“mini” Ellis
Act), to withdraw affordability restricted units from the rental market. Section 16(A)(9) of East Palo
Alto’s Rent Control Ordinance recognizes a landlord’s right in “good faith to recover possession of the
rental unit to remove the rental unit permanently from rental housing use under the Ellis Act” as a just
cause for eviction.
Third, similarly, under Section 16(A)(10) of East Palo Alto’s Rent Control Ordinance (owner-move-in
exemption), a landlord may move into an affordable rental unit and evict the existing tenant to occupy
the unit, if certain other conditions are met. .
ENTITIES QUALIFIED TO PRESERVE AT-RISK UNITS
There are several organizations in the region that have the capacity to own and manage affordable rental
projects. There organizations include EDEN Housing, Mid-Peninsula, and BRIDGE. The City can also
directly purchase at-risk units, although the management, processing, and maintenance of these units
may be cost prohibitive for the city.
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
While most of the Housing Needs Data is in the Existing Conditions Report, State law requires
additional analysis for people living with Developmental Disabilities.
SB 812, signed into law in 2010, requires Housing Elements to include an analysis of the special
housing needs of people with developmental disabilities. Additionally, SB 812 requires that individuals
with disabilities receive public services in the least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to
their needs
California defines developmentally disabled as a “severe and chronic disability that is attributable to a
mental or physical impairment. The disability must begin before the person’s 18th birthday, be

expected to continue indefinitely, and present a substantial disability.” Some development disabilities
cause mental retardation and some do not. Common developmental disabilities include Down’s
syndrome, autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy.
People with developmental disabilities in San Mateo County have various diagnoses. The common
ones are summarized below. Because people can have multiple diagnoses, the numbers total more than
100 percent. The information below has been provided by the Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC),
which covers the San Francisco Bay Area.

People with developmental disabilities tend to be younger than the general population. There are
several reasons for this: for some diagnoses there is a shorter life expectancy; more importantly,
starting in the 1990s there was an “autism wave” with many more young people being diagnosed with
the disorder, for reasons that are still not well understood. The racial demographics of the
developmentally disabled population mirror that of the population of the Bay Area.

Many people with developmental disabilities are unable to secure long-term employment. This results
in many people relying on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and many earn 10-20 percent of the
Area Median Income (AMI).
People with developmental disabilities have various housing needs and housing situations. Almost all
(90 percent) of East Palo Alto residents with disabilities live with a parent or legal guardian. The
remaining residents with developmental disabilities live independently or with some supportive
services.

According to the Golden Gate Regional Center (GGRC), trends that are affecting people with
developmental disabilities include California’s moves to reduce institutionalization, ageing family
caregivers not being able to continue providing in-house care and the growing wave of people with
autism.
Deinstitutionalization – In 1977, California passed the Lanterman Developmentally Disabled
Services Act, to minimize the institutionalization of developmentally disabled people, help them
remain in their communities, and to allow them to live their lives as similar to non-disabled people as
possible. To accomplish this end the State has been closing large institutional care facilities, resulting
in more people with disabilities being integrated into the community. However, this has increased the
demand for community-based independent living options to serve the needs of the developmentally
disabled.
Aging Baby Boomers Unable to Care for their Children with Developmental Disabilities – As
displayed in the table below, almost three quarters of people with developmental disabilities live with
a parent or caregiver, and many of these caregivers are baby boomers. As these caregivers age their
ability to continue to care for their developmentally disabled children will decrease to the point where
it is no longer possible. This trend is also going to be a factor in the increased need for community-
based independent living options for the developmentally disabled. Many service delivery systems and
communities are not prepared to meet the increasing need.
Increasing Numbers of People with Autism - A large number of people with developmental
disabilities have autism. They have been brought up as independent members of the community and
want to remain independent and involved in the community. There is a coming need to supply
community-based independent living options for these individuals.

City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                        2-11
3        HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
To facilitate the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing (especially affordable
housing), the Housing Element must assess the potential constraints imposed by both City regulations
and policies, and by market conditions (governmental and non-governmental constraints). This
assessment must address housing for all income levels, including housing for persons with disabilities.
Therefore, this Element analyzes the potential impacts of governmental regulations and policies on
housing, including land use controls, fees and exactions, building codes, processing and permit
procedures, codes and enforcement, and on/off-site improvement standards. Likewise, it also assesses
nongovernmental or potential market impacts, including land costs, construction costs, and the
availability of financing. The findings of the analysis are outlined below. For any constraints to housing
found within this section (via regulatory and/or market conditions), a program has been included in the
Housing Plan (Chapter 5) to address and mitigate the constraint.
3.1      NONGOVERNMENTAL MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing reinvestment and
can sometimes hinder the production of new affordable housing. Although many constraints are driven
by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in instituting policies and programs to address
potential constraints.
LAND COST
A key component of residential development costs is the price of raw land. The diminishing supply of
residential land, combined with fairly high demand, generally keeps land cost relatively high in the Bay
Area. Land prices decreased substantially during the recent recession, but recently have turned around.
A recent survey by David Rosen Associates found land prices ranged from $17 to $291 per square foot.
The median price was $49 per square foot.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                 3-1
SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The costs to develop new housing involve both land improvement costs, the expenses to prepare the site
for housing construction, as well as the actual cost to construct the housing itself. A portion of the total
cost to develop new housing is also associated with government fees that mitigate the impact of new
development on local infrastructure and services; these costs are discussed later in this chapter.
A typical single-family unit would cost approximately $419,650 to build, including land.1 A 50-unit,
multifamily apartment complex would cost approximately $17.5 million to build, with each 870 square
foot unit costing approximately $349,300. These estimates reflect the cost to build a basic home or unit
in East Palo Alto and may not reflect the actual cost to build new homes currently for sale, as home
prices also depend on the home finishes, amenities, and location-specific costs (such as environmental
mitigation), among other factors. Developer profit of 10 percent is included in the costs.
MORTGAGE AND REHABILITATION FINANCING
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. In the early 2000s,
mortgage interest rates reached new lows and access to mortgage financing expanded significantly.
Many new homebuyers were able to purchase homes with little money down, lower credit scores, and/or
with low initial monthly payments, primarily as a result of adjustable rate mortgage financing options.
In        2005,          the         average          30-year           fixed        mortgage           was         approximately
5.8 percent compared to 7.2 percent in 2001; in 2009, the average 30-year fixed loan was at a 5.7 percent
annual interest for all loans (approximately 5 percent for conventional loans) for a borrower with a credit
score of at least 660.2 In 2014, rates ranged from 4.0 – 5.0 percent for a 30 year fixed interest loan.
As a result of more lenient lending practices during the early to mid-2000s, changing economic
conditions in the late 2000s, and falling home prices, many homeowners faced difficulties in making

   This analysis assumes that a single developer would purchase raw land, provide the necessary infrastructure and improvements for
   home construction, and build the homes. In many cases, the development process is performed by two separate entities: the land
   developer who purchases, entitles, and makes site improvements, and the homebuilder who purchases the lots and builds the
   homes. In this scenario, overall costs may increase, as both the land developer and the homebuilder expect to achieve profits.

  HSH National Monthly Mortgage Statistics, accessed April 2009. HSH Fixed-Rate Mortgage Indicator includes jumbo loans and
   second mortgages. This provides a combined average mortgage interest rate, which is often higher than conventional loans that are
   under $417,000.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                                            3-2

their monthly mortgage payments were are unable to refinance their home loans or sell their homes to
pay off their mortgages. In response, lenders have tightened loan standards, returning to practices that
prevailed prior to 2000. More stringent underwriting and tighter loan standards have led to an increase
in loan denials as lenders more closely scrutinize household income, credit history, and the overall risk
of the loan. Furthermore, the City has observed a change in lenders regarding homebuyers receiving
down payment assistance; as down payment assistance is not part of the borrower’s earned income,
some lenders have required the homebuyer to provide a significant percentage down in addition to the
assistance received from the City.
Thus, while interest rates have fallen since 2008, access to home financing has reduced the pool of
buyers able to purchase a home. The lack of credit not only affects home buyers and homeowners but
also developers and rental property owners who want to improve their properties. Conversely, lower
housing prices have increased the pool of options for potential first-time homebuyers with good credit
and cash for a down payment.
Home Loans
Mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) have increased in recent months as a
result of the shoring up of available credit and more stringent loan requirements. Currently, in addition
to meeting income and credit history requirements, many lending institutions require a 20 percent down
payment; this significant down payment prohibits many potential homebuyers—particularly first time
homebuyers—from achieving homeownership. FHA-backed mortgages typically require a lower down
payment (recent figures cite as little as 3.5 percent)3, increasing homeownership opportunities for
homeowners with limited liquidity. However, FHA-backed mortgages require the home purchase price
to be no more than 29 percent of the home purchaser’s gross monthly income. Given the City’s median
home price, FHA loans do not increase the opportunity for homeownership for the City’s very low- and
low-income residents, but do provide ownership opportunities for moderate income households who
may have been priced out of the home buying market since the early 2000s.

3.2      GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental policies and regulations can result in both positive and negative effects on the availability
and affordability of housing. This section describes City policies and regulations that could potentially
constrain the City’s ability to achieve its housing objectives. Potential constraints to housing include
land use controls (General Plan policies and zoning regulations), development standards, infrastructure
requirements, residential development fees, and the development approval processes. While
government policies and regulations are intended to meet legitimate public purposes and further the
public good, it is possible that they indirectly constrain the availability and affordability of housing to
meet the community’s future needs.
Many of the non-governmental constraints described in the previous section can be further exacerbated
through unintentional actions by a jurisdiction. For example, the cost of land is partially a function of
the amount of land zoned for development, intensity of zoning, and the availability of infrastructure and
services provided by local government.
The governmental constraints analysis focuses on factors the City can control and does not include State,
federal, or other governmental policies or regulations that East Palo Alto cannot affect or modify. These
City policies and regulations typically affect the City’s ability to meet future housing needs and secure
adequate funding for the construction of affordable housing.

LAND USE CONTROLS
General Plan
East Palo Alto’s General Plan, especially its Land Use Element adopted in 1999, includes policies that
lay the foundation for all other land use regulations in the city. Residential uses are allowed in six general
plan designations that correlate to five zoning categories. Table 3-1 shows the densities associated with
each land use designation that allows residential uses.

The General Plan established goals and policies to encourage mixed-use development. Under the
General Plan, three commercial designations (General, Neighborhood, and Office) allow for mixed-use
residential development of up to 16 units per acre, along with commercial uses.

Residential Development Standards
The East Palo Alto Zoning Ordinance designates the land uses, height, bulk, density, and parking
standards throughout the city. Table 3-2 shows the zoning categories that allow residential uses and the
development standards for each zone.

Density
Density ranges are established through the Land Use Element of the General Plan; the Zoning Ordinance
dictates the minimum lot size but does not contain density ranges separately from the Land Use Element.
The maximum density allowed under the Land Use Element is 40 dwelling units per acre. For East Palo
Alto, the appropriate default density established under Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B),
deems zoning allowing 30 dwelling units per acre as adequate for accommodating lower-income
housing. East Palo Alto’s multifamily zone, R-M, and Urban Residential zone exceeds this threshold
because it allows for up to 40 units per acre.
Building Heights
Building heights vary within East Palo Alto, depending on the zoning district. Single-family residential
districts have the lowest limit, with a maximum height of 26 feet. The tallest possible development (up
to 225 feet) requires a Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit. Height limits in the densest residential
zone (R-M) allow up to 75 feet, with no limits on the number of stories. This height limit can easily
accommodate the maximum allowed density of 40 units per acre, as 75 feet is sufficient for at least a
six-story building.
Parking Requirements
The Zoning Ordinance also establishes parking requirements for residential uses (See Table 3-3). East
Palo Alto’s parking requirements are graduated based on the number of bedrooms in a dwelling unit,
and further refined based on the type of unit. The graduated requirements are an appropriate method to
ensure that parking does not add excessively to the cost of building higher-density housing. Parking
requirements are not considered to be a constraint.
Parking facilities in R districts for more than 10 spaces must be screened from neighboring residential
uses with solid masonry walls. Screen planting or wooden fences may be substituted in cases of practical
difficulties or unusual hardship. Although this will add some cost to the development of multifamily
housing, it is not an unusual requirement for communities of the same size and location.

Zoning For a Variety of Housing Types
An important indicator of how well East Palo Alto can accommodate residents of all income levels and
housing needs is how well it ensures a variety of housing types, including multifamily rental units,
second units, and residential care homes. This section describes the City’s zoning regulations as they
relate to accommodating housing for diverse populations; Table 3-4 shows the zones allowing
residential uses and indicates which types of residential uses are allowed in each zone.

Second Units
State legislation requires jurisdictions to allow second units in any single-family or multifamily
residential zone through ministerial review without discretionary review or a hearing. According to
Government Code Section 65852.2 (a), a city may provide for the creation of second units through an
ordinance. This ordinance may direct where second units could be located, impose standards, and
provide that second units do not exceed the allowable density for the lot on which they are situated. East
Palo Alto has a Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance which directs second units into the R-1 district,
requires an application for a second unit permit, imposes development standards, and allows for
modification of development standards if the restrictions will result in extreme hardship for the owner
or occupant of the property.
East Palo Alto’s Second Dwelling Ordinance now fully complies with State law. Previously, the City’s
Second Dwelling Ordinance only applied to second units to the R-1 district. However, in 2011, the
City’s Second Dwelling Ordinance was amended in a number of ways, including to broaden its
applicability to all residential zoning districts, as required by State law.
The process to permit second units is accomplished by applying to the Planning Director for a second
unit permit. The permit process directs the density, lot size, unit size, parking standards, sewer
requirements, access, and entrance requirements for second units. Second units must abide by the
following standards:
        Must comply with the density allowed in the General Plan Land Use Element Map
        The lot size for second units attached to main units must be at least 5,500 square feet and
         unattached second units must be at least 7,500 square feet (sq. ft.)
        The unit size limits range from up to 700 sq. ft. in size (5,500 to 6,500 sq. ft.) to up to 1,000 sq.
         ft. on lots larger (6,500 to 7,500 sq. ft.)
        Must comply with applicable Uniform Building, Health and Fire codes
        Must include at least one uncovered off-street parking space
        Must be served by sanitary sewer
        Must be served by the same driveway access to the street as the main dwelling
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                   3-10

         Must use the same entrance as the main dwelling, or be located on the side or rear of the
          main dwelling.
These standards allow for an appropriate level of review and do not cause a constraint to the
development of second units. If the applicant feels that some of these standards should not apply to their
application, the applicant may apply for a use permit to modify any of these standards, which requires
review by the Planning Commission. Typical exceptions requested and granted include a reduction of
the lot size requirement.
As this level review is only required if an applicant desires to modify the standards, this process is not
considered a constraint. Additionally, occupancy standards (main dwellings must be occupied by the
owner and second units may be occupied by up to three people) do not constitute a constraint as second
units are not intended by State law for family housing, especially since applicants can seek relief from
this requirement by requesting a modification from the Planning Commission (Sections 6430(b), 6432
of Second Dwelling Ordinance). Three persons is an adequate number of residents for a second
dwelling.
In 2014, the city eliminated the covered parking requirement, reduced setbacks (e.g. allowed second
units to be built closer to the property line), permitted the units in all residential zones, and allowed
second units and guest houses on smaller lots. Guest houses are separate living quarters without kitchens
that cannot be rented (e.g. they are for relatives and guests).
Mobile Homes
Mobile homes are an inexpensive alternative for providing affordable housing for low- and moderate-
income households. Within East Palo Alto, mobile homes are included in the definition of a single-
family dwelling and therefore allowed in all districts allowing these dwelling units. In 2014, in order to
balance the interests of tenants and owners of mobile home parks, including the recognition that mobile
home parks are an important source of affordable housing, the City enacted a mobile home closure or
change of use ordinance, in addition to amendments to the existing conversion ordinance, which governs
the process by which mobile home park is converted to resident ownership.

Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities with six or fewer persons are allowed by right in all residential zones, while
those facilities serving more than six persons must have a use permit and must comply with the
following standards:
        Must meet applicable requirements of the Uniform Building, Housing, and Fire codes
        May not post a sign that calls attention to the fact that the property is a residential care facility
        May not locate within 500 feet of another residential care facility
        (For facilities with ten or more residents) may not locate within 1,000 feet of another such
         facility, nor within 500 feet of a residential care facility of more than six residents
        (Applicant) must submit a statement with the application indicating they have read the
         provisions of the ordinance, and either agree with the distance requirements or are requesting
         a waiver of the requirements.
Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
According to State law, cities must identify at least one zone that permits emergency shelters without a
conditional use permit or other discretionary action. Additionally, the zone must have sufficient capacity
to accommodate at least one year-round shelter.
In 2011, the City amended its zoning ordinance to allow emergency shelters in the Industrial Transition
zone, as of right, without any other discretionary review. The M1 zone represents 9.3 acres, with 16
parcels ranging from less than a tenth of an acre to over two acres. More than half of M-1 is outside of
the Special Flood Hazard Area, which is identified as ‘Flood Hazard Zone’ in California Government
Code Section 65302. Therefore, M-1 land is sufficiently large in size to provide one or more shelters.
Specifically, the Planning Commission found that: 1) M-1 is sufficiently large to accommodate shelters;
2) M-1 provides greater flexibility to reduce incompatible uses; 3) environmentally sensitive areas
would not be impacted; and 4) encouraging shelters outside of the floodplain (SFHA), prone to
liquefaction, implements a best practice, since wet weather or seismic events may damage or make these
structures uninhabitable, just when they are needed most.

The City does not have a permanent homeless shelter, but in late March 2009, the first homeless
warming shelter opened in East Palo Alto. The Lord’s Gym Community Center, located in the General
Industrial General Plan designation and zone M-1 (Light Industrial), serves as an athletic facility for
East Palo Alto’s at-risk youths during the day. In case of rain or cold weather, the gym functions as a
warming shelter for 30 homeless individuals.
Also according to State law, transitional and supportive housing must be considered a residential use of
property, and may be subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the
same type in the same zone. Accordingly in July 2011, the City Council amended the Zoning Ordinance
so that it includes the definitions of transitional and supportive housing as a residential use, and states
that both transitional and supportive housing are permitted in any zone that allows residential uses.
Additionally, in December 2014, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the
City Council adopt a Zoning Text Amendment to the Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan to
clear the barrier for transitional and supportive housing in all residential zones within the Specific Plan
area. Finally, the City received funds to support transitional housing for persons who were incarcerated.

Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
Housing Element law requires cities to analyze potential governmental constraints to the development,
improvement, and maintenance of housing for persons with disabilities. Persons with disabilities may
have special housing needs that can be constrained by regulations in the City’s Zoning Ordinance. For
example, disabled persons may need to modify their dwelling units by adding ramps to accommodate
wheelchairs or allow easy access for those with limited mobility. Other modifications may also be
needed to comply with current ADA requirements.
An important consideration in the definition of family is how it is applied to the number and type of
people allowed in a dwelling unit. Historically in some cities, definitions of family discriminated against
people with disabilities. The City of East Palo Alto defines family as “one or more persons occupying
a premise and living as a single non-profit housekeeping unit as distinguished from persons occupying
a hotel, club, fraternity, or sorority house. A family shall be deemed to include necessary servants.” This
definition allows for group homes that may serve the disabled, does not discriminate and is not a
constraint.
Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities
The City complies with all provisions of the Fair Housing Act; all fair housing laws are appropriately
followed and Planning Division staff makes exceptions to the Zoning Code when appropriate. The city
recently amended its zoning ordinance to provide Reasonable Accommodation for people with
disabilities. Specifically, the Planning Manager has authority to modify the rules and standards in order
to eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of
his or her choice.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
Several City requirements for providing on- and off-site improvements apply to housing development,
such as:
         Street right-of-way dedications
         Street frontage improvement (e.g., curb, gutter, sidewalks and street lights)
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                 3-14

         Water line improvement, including the water main installation along the property frontage and
          lateral service line with meter boxes and fire hydrants
         Sanitary sewer main installation along property frontage and lateral service lines; each parcel
          must be served by sanitary sewer or an individual sewage disposal system
         Storm water drainage lines along property line street frontage
         Street trees
         Regulated street widths for public urban residential roads, varying from 18 feet for a residential
          one-way loop to 40 feet for a residential collector
         New subdivisions and large development projects require sidewalks, curbs, and gutter on both
          sides of the street, unless the street is one-way; not required for infill projects or design review
          projects where a concrete drainage swale along each side of the road at the pavement edge
          carries surface storm drainage and protects the edge of the asphalt paving.
         Private urban roads require berms to direct the flow of storm runoff
         Rural roads require less width and no curbs.
         Water, provided through a connection to a water supply system or through establishing a new
          water system; if neither is feasible, the Planning Director may allow the subdivider to provide
          water through an on-site well.
Street frontage improvement costs per residential unit vary depending upon the developed or
undeveloped nature of the area. When vacant land is developed, full street improvements are required
with right-of-way dedication and utility improvements. In urban infill situations, where streets are
already improved to their ultimate right-of-way, minor street frontage improvement or the payment of
in-lieu fees is required.
In regards to subdivisions, East Palo Alto has adopted the Subdivision Ordinance of San Mateo County,
which contains similar requirements and standards to other cities. Therefore, East Palo Alto does not
consider its on- and off-site improvement requirements as constraints to residential development.
Codes and Enforcement
Building codes establish minimum standards for the structural safety of buildings. State law (California
Code of Regulations, Title 24) requires cities to adopt minimum residential construction standards based
on industry uniform codes.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                    3-15

East Palo Alto enforces the most recently adopted edition of the Model Building Code. The City
Building Division sees that new residences, additions, auxiliary structures, etc., meet all of the latest
construction and safety standards. The division enforces building, plumbing, mechanical, electrical
installations, accessibility, and energy compliance; building permits are required for any construction
work. As the City has not adopted building standards beyond those specified in the California Building
Code, its enforcement is not considered a constraint to housing development or affordability.
Building permits must be secured before commencement of any construction, reconstruction, addition,
conversion, or alteration. Approval of permit applications is based on conformity with the Zoning
Ordinance, although the City has the power to grant variances from the terms of the Ordinance within
the limitations in the Ordinance.
Rent Stabilization and Eviction for Good Cause Ordinance
The purpose of residential rent control in the City of East Palo Alto is to protect tenants from
unwarranted or unreasonable rent increases and from arbitrary, discriminatory, or retaliatory evictions,
in addition to protecting a landlord’s right to a fair rate of return.. The City’s first Rent Stabilization and
Eviction for Good Cause Ordinance was adopted in 1986 (“Rent Stabilization and Eviction for Good
Cause Ordinance”) and amended in 1988 in response to steadily increasing rents and a shortage of
housing, resulting in the displacement of low- and moderate-income tenants. In June of 2010, a majority
of East Palo Alto voters approved a revised Rent Stabilization Ordinance (“Rent Stabilization and Just
Cause for Eviction Ordinance of 2010, or “New Ordinance”) that expanded rent stabilization coverage
to more units and left the old (1988) Ordinance intact for mobile home park rental pads. One of the main
purposes of the New Ordinance is to bring the City’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance in line with State
law, specifically the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act (Civil Code 1954.50 et seq., “Costa-
Hawkins”).
Under the New Ordinance, landlords are permitted to increase rents once each year by up to 80 percent
of the percent change in the consumer price index for the San Francisco/Oakland Metropolitan Area
(annual general adjustments). The City also recognizes that landlords have a right to a fair return on
their investment and need sufficient income to properly operate and maintain their properties. Therefore,
landlords can petition to adjust the rent ceiling of individual controlled rental units if, for example, their
operating and maintenance expenses were particularly high in comparison with other years.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                     3-16

The New Ordinance is implemented by the Rent Stabilization Board. The Board is empowered to:
require landlords to register covered units, set and collect registration fees from landlords, set rent
ceilings, make annual general adjustments and individual adjustments in the rent ceilings, issue orders
and make rules and regulations, hold public hearings, conduct necessary surveys and investigations,
seek injunctive relief and pursue civil remedies. Rent Board members are appointed by the City Council,
and the City Manager has ultimate authority for hiring Rent Stabilization Program staff and preparing
the budget. The New Ordinance requires the Board to annually certify rents for covered units beginning
in 2011.
This Housing Element includes a program to implement the new New Ordinance. As Costa-Hawkins
exempts new housing constructed after 1995 from local rent controls, the New Ordinance will not be a
constraint to new housing development. Furthermore, as landlords can petition to adjust the rent of a
unit above the rent ceiling for significant improvements to the units under its fair rate of return
provisions, the New Ordinance does not discourage the maintenance of rental housing.
Affordable Housing Program
After conducting a nexus study and a feasibility report, East Palo Alto adopted a fee of between $22 -
$44 per square foot to support new affordable housing. The money from this fee will go into an
affordable housing trust fund. The feasibility study showed that fees at this level will not adversely
impact development and therefor do not serve as a constraint.
Condominium Conversion Code
The City’s Subdivision Regulations require a vacancy rate of 4.15 percent before an application for
condominium conversion can be accepted. This criterion (vacancy rate) is the only factor considered for
the acceptance of a condominium conversion application. The Code does not give policy guidance or
criteria to guide the processing of a condominium conversion application.
The City requires property owners to pay relocation assistance of between $7,500 and $10,000 for
residents if a property is removed from the rent control system (e.g. demolished or converted to a condo).
It also requires advanced notice for tenants, a slower timeline to protect tenants, and payment of moving
costs (up to $2,500). The City also charges an affordable housing fee if a property owner converts their
rental apartment to a condominium and limits conversions when rental vacancy rates are low. When
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                               3-17

enacting these regulations, the City balanced the needs of property owners and other communities to
create the current program, which is not a constraint to the construction of new housing.
The City will also ensure that the Condominium Conversion Ordinance will not bar the redevelopment
and reconstruction of Rent Stabilization Program units, as provided for in State law (Ellis Act).
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES
The development review and permit process allows the City to ensure that residential development is
accomplished in an orderly manner and complies with adopted building standards. This process can
potentially act as a constraint to development if the associated time delays or costs place an undue
burden on the developer. Figure 3-1 illustrates the typical process an applicant must follow if they are
submitting an application for a development in East Palo Alto.
The typical process varies depending on whether the process is administrative or discretionary; the main
difference is the addition of a review and decision by the Planning Commission. If an applicant is
submitting an application for a second unit, the process is administrative. City staff reviews the
application, works with the applicant to address comments, and approves the application if the
comments are addressed.
If the applicant desires to modify any of the standards for second units, a discretional permit review is
required. Discretionary permits are required prior to issuance of variances for second units, building
permits for new residential development, and all substantial modifications of residential buildings (e.g.
second-story additions). A public hearing with the Planning Commission is required for all discretionary
permits. The hearing must be advertised in a local newspaper with separate notices sent to property
owners within 300 feet of the property subject to the permit.

East Palo Alto requires developers to obtain a series of approvals, or entitlements, before constructing
any new development in the city, in order to ensure that new development is consistent with the City
standards of design, health and safety. The entitlement process can be lengthy depending on the
environmental analysis required for the project and requires payment of Planning Division permit and
Engineering and Building Division plan check and permit fees.
The entitlement and development process for East Palo Alto is expeditious and comparable to
surrounding communities. The City places an emphasis on efficient service and providing developers
with assistance early in the development process. Tools such as on-line display of development
standards on the City’s website, project review by City Departments at monthly Development Review
Committee (DRC) meetings assist developers in assuring that application submittals are complete and
in compliance with Zoning and Municipal Code requirements upon initial application for a development
permit. Developers also have the option of having pre-application meetings with Community and
Economic Development Department staff members, which helps to provide a sense of the potential
issues for a project that must be resolved prior to review by the Planning Commission or the City
Council.
Applicable submittal requirements for all application types are outlined in the Zoning Ordinance and in
the Planning Department “Submittal Checklist” handouts. All applications, submittal requirements, and
fee information are available at the Permit Counter at 1960 Tate Street in East Palo Alto and are all
available from the City’s website. The process is further streamlined by the practice of asking the
Planning Commission to review all development applications as a whole (for example, an application
for a rezoning is typically taken to the Commission along with a subdivision, design review and other
entitlements). The Planning Commission meets once each month, and projects subject to a CEQA
categorical or statutory exemption are usually acted upon within two to four months of submittal of a
complete application. (A second meeting in a month is held if necessary.) The City is able to expedite
the planning review process for housing projects because the Planning Commission has both quasi-
judicial land use and design review approving authority.

Typical Entitlement Process for Single Family Residential Development
Developers seeking approval of a new for-sale single-family development consistent with applicable
General Plan and Zoning need only file tentative map (if applicable) and a design review application.
Smaller projects (four or fewer units), typically take approximately two to six months to process
depending on the complexity of the parcel map and the level of environmental analysis required for the
project. Residential projects of five or more units would require additional time, due to the processing
of a major subdivision map if required. These applications typically take approximately six to twelve
months to process, and typically include concurrent design review of the project. It is essential to note,
however, that a parcel map or subdivision map is only required if the development is being sold to the
occupant such as for sale single family residential and multi-family residential development sold as
condominiums.
Typical Entitlement Process for Multi-Family Residential Development
Developers seeking approval of multi-family rental developments consistent with applicable General
Plan and zoning requirements need only file a design review or architectural supervision application.
For a typical multi-family housing development proposed in a multi family district (RM4) an
Architectural Supervision permit would be required by the Planning Commission. The following would
be the process to construct a multi family project:
      1.    Pre-application meeting with staff
      2.    Application submittal
      3.    Review of application by City staff.
      4.    Planning Commission Hearing.
      5.    City Council Hearing (if applicable).
      6.    Building Permit issuance.
  Pre-application meetings occur with staff during normal business hours and applicants are provided the
  submittal requirements on forms provided by the East Palo Alto Planning Division. Staff provides
  initial project comments within thirty (30) days as required by the Permit Streamlining Act with
4
   Duplex structures are allowed by right within the R2, Duplex Residential District, but per Section 6560(a)(1) of the Zoning Ordinance these structures would require an Architectural Supervision
    permit. Similarly, within the OR (Office Residential); O (Office); C1/C2(Commercial); and PUD (Planned Unit Development) zoning districts, the same permit is required to construct multi-
    family housing.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                                                                                                           3-21
 subsequent reviews required if revisions to the development plans are requested. Once the project is
 complete, the item is placed on the next available meeting of the Planning Commission (“PC”), which
 meets up to twice each month with the exception of August, when there are no meetings, and December,
 where there is one. After the issuance of findings consistent with the California Environmental Quality
 Act which, when no exemption applies, seeks to reduce project impacts to less than a significant level,
 projects are approved, denied, or approved with modification by the Planning Commission within two
 to four months of complete application submittal. These project include, but are not limited to,
 Architectural Supervision such as exterior design elevations, security, landscaping and layout plans;
 circulation plans, such as driveway layout, parking exceptions, loading area design, and pedestrian
 walks. Housing projects can be expedited, as authorized by statute. Pursuant to Section 6561 of the
 City Zoning Ordinance, approval is based on the following findings of fact:
Finding #1-That the design and construction of the building not be of unsightly, undesirable or
obnoxious appearance to the extent that they will hinder the orderly and harmonious development of
the City.
Finding #2-That the design and construction of the building will not impair the desirability of residence,
investment or occupation in the City.
Finding #3-That the design and construction of the building will not impair the desirability of living
conditions in adjacent residential areas.
Finding #4-That the design and construction of the building will not otherwise affect general prosperity
and welfare.
The General Plan, the long range document that guides development, is implemented by the Zoning
Ordinance, which specifies precise design standards for building height, lot coverage, and property
setbacks for each zoning district. Prior to either approving or denying a development permit, findings
of fact are necessary. These demonstrate that the action would be consistent with City policy, as
identified in the Nuisance Ordinance, the General Plan, and the Zoning Ordinance.
For multifamily housing projects, findings of fact shall: (1) provide the framework for principled
decisions to ensure approval or denial of a project is not arbitrary or capricious; (2) ensure a development

Policy 3.1 Preserve and enhance the quality of East Palo Alto neighborhoods by avoiding or abating the
intrusion of disruptive, nonconforming building and uses.
Policy 3.2 Ensure new development is compatible with the physical characteristics of its site,
surrounding land uses and available public infrastructure.
Section 6101 of the East Palo Alto Zoning Ordinance
Section 6101 of the Zoning Ordinance also provides guidance for preparing findings of fact. This section
of the Zoning Ordinance provides clear direction to the Planning Manager or his designee to ensure
projects provide adequate light, air, privacy and do not impair the social welfare and prosperity of the
community.
(a)      To guide, control, and regulate the future growth and development in the City of East Palo Alto.
(b)      To protect the character and the social and economic stability of residential, commercial,
industrial, and other private and public areas within the City, and to assure the orderly and beneficial
development of such areas.
(c)      To obviate the menace to the public safety resulting from the locating of buildings, and the use
thereof, and the use of land, adjacent to streets and highways which are a part of the Circulation Element
of the General Plan of the City, or which are important thoroughfares, in such manner as to cause
interference with existing or prospective traffic movements on said streets and highways.
(d)      To provide adequate light, air, privacy, and convenience of access to property, and to secure
safety from fire, inundation, and other dangers.
(e)      To prevent overcrowding the land and prevent undue congestion of population.

Multi Family Residential Development CEQA Review
Exemptions are used whenever applicable for housing developments constructed on sites of less than
five acres and the environmental effect is reduced to less than a significant level pursuant to CEQA
provisions of Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines Section (Infill Development Projects).
Use Permit Process
“Use” is defined as the purpose for which a site or structure is arranged, designed intended, constructed,
erected, moved, altered, enlarged, or for which either a site or a structure is or may be occupied or
maintained. The East Palo Alto Zoning Ordinance contains land use regulations for each Zoning District
within the city. Within each Zoning District a use is either a permitted use or a conditional use subject
to limitations as outlined in the Zoning District or other sections of the Zoning Ordinance. Chapter 24
of the Zoning Ordinance identifies the specific steps that must to taken by City staff in processing a
conditional use permit.
A use permit is typically processed in 4-6 months depending on the completeness of the application.
Applications for a use permit are made to the Planning Department, along with a fee (per the adopted
fee schedule). In addition to the application and fee, the applicant must submit a written description of
the business, a site plan, and floor plan and additional material. If the use permit is for the sale of
alcoholic beverages, City staff would also request a security and lighting plan.
Granting of a use permit is a discretionary decision by the Planning Commission, who must make
specific findings that the use will not be detrimental to the city or surrounding neighborhood; is
consistent with the Zoning and General Plan and will not create a nuisance or enforcement problem,
among other findings (Zoning Ordinance section 6503). The Commission may impose reasonable
conditions (Conditions of Approval) to the granting of a use permit as it considers necessary to carry
out the purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance and the land use district in which the property is
located.
Post Planning Entitlement Procedures
Plan check review of construction level site development documents submitted to the Engineering
Department after tentative map and/or design review approval may take up to four months and require
review of grading and improvement plans, soils reports, hydrology calculations, compliance check with

conditions of project approvals, and approval of final maps. Plan check review of building permits by
the Building Division may take 30-45 days and entails review for compliance with conditions of
approval and adopted building codes. Permits for large single-family subdivisions may take one to three
weeks longer due to additional review and approval of individual plot plans for compliance with
building code, Planning Conditions of Approval required by the approval, and mitigation measures
identified in the CEQA documentation.
Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan Area
A summary of the specific plan is provided below. Please see the full plan for more information.
The Plan Area encompasses approximately 350 acres and is generally bounded at the west by University
Avenue; at the north by a rail line, where future Dumbarton Rail passenger service is planned; at the
east by the baylands along the San Francisco Bay; and at the south by Weeks Street. The Specific Plan
Area also extends south from Weeks Street to Runnymede Street in the southeast along Pulgas Avenue.
Bay Road is envisioned as an active and vibrant spine that serves as a focal point for Ravenswood and
4 Corners, as well as for East Palo Alto as a whole. These mixed-use areas, indicated in orange, will
become the “living room” of East Palo Alto and provide a cohesive Downtown experience for East
Palo Alto. Vibrant storefronts and other active ground-floor uses are envisioned to stretch down most
of Bay Road within the Plan Area, bookended by the University Avenue/ Bay Road intersection on the
west and Cooley Landing on the east.
The Plan Concept shows multi-family residential uses in several locations south of Bay Road. These
locations relate to and extend the existing residential neighborhoods south of the Plan Area. Multi-
family development is allowed in several different forms under the Specific Plan. For example,
townhouses, duplexes, four-plexes, and a wide range of multi-family apartment buildings are all
permitted on residentially designated land in the Plan Area. New single-family residential
development is also possible in this designation, but it must consist of small-lot single-family houses.
The plan assumes up to 825 residential units.

FEES AND EXACTIONS
Developers are required to pay several types of fees as part of the development process. Planning and
application fees offset the costs the City incurs in the development review process. Current planning
and permit fees were adopted by City Council in 2014 after an extensive evaluation of costs for services
by an outside firm.
Impact fees help to distribute the City’s cost of providing development with services and facilities.
These fees are determined by the various agencies; school impact fees are set by local school districts
and the State, while other impact fees are based on the estimated cost to construct improvements. This
allows the City to cover costs while not unduly burdening development. As mentioned above, the typical
costs for developing a single-family home are over $419,650, including an average of $36,551 per unit
in permitting and impact fees (nine percent of the total development cost of the unit). Typical fees for
multifamily units average $36,089 per unit, or ten percent of their total average cost of $349,300.
21 Elements distributed a survey to the jurisdictions of San Mateo County in 2013 to learn more about
the fees involved in a multi-family subdivision development application. The jurisdictions were asked
to estimate fees for a development given the following assumptions:
Single Family Home
A new home on an empty lot in an existing neighborhood, no significant grading or other complicating
factors, 2400 sf and 500 sf garage, two stories, four bedrooms and three bathrooms.
East Palo Alto fees totaled $36,551 for the hypothetical development. Entitlement fees cost
approximately $9,300, and construction fees cost approximately $19,300. Additionally, there is a school
fee of $7,680 collected by the school district.
Multifamily
The project will be comprised of 96 two and three bedroom units in 16 buildings on eight acres of land:
a total of 145,500 square feet. See 21elements.com for a full list of assumptions.
Entitlement fees are approximately $113,300, construction fees are $269,800 and impact fees are
$3,031,428. Approximately one million of the impact fees are for parks and the remainder are for
schools. There is an affordable housing requirement of 20 percent of units or $13.47 per inhabitable
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                   3-30

square foot. The cost per unit is $36,089 per unit including school fees and $31,239 not including school
fees.
Summary
East Palo Alto’s fees are comparable to other communities. The per unit fees for multifamily housing is
lower than the fees for single family homes. Based on the recent work by David Rosen and Associates,
the fees do not constitute a constraint on new housing (Table 3-6).

INFRASTRUCTURE
The City has sufficient water and sewer capacity, either current or planned, to meet its RHNA need and
beyond.
The City of East Palo Alto receives practically all of its potable water from the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) Hetch Hetchy System. The City’s water systems services practically the
entire City, or about 2.5 square miles, and approximately 4,200 residential, commercial and industrial
customers, which accounts for approximately 93 percent of the water customers within the City limits.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                     3-32

Other portions of the City are served by two mutual water companies: the Palo Alto Park Mutual Water
Company and the O’Connor Tract Cooperative , which provide water to the remaining seven percent of
water customers living in the City. Some groundwater from the Gloria Bay well (at the corner of Gloria
Way and Bay Road) is used by the City for street cleaning and median irrigation.
The City has an Interim Supply Guarantee (ISG) from the SFPUC of 1.963 million gallons a day (mgd),
or 2,199 Acre Feet a Year (AFY). An AFY is defined as the volume of one acre of surface area to a
depth of one foot. The City has no storage capacity, other than the system pipes. In sum, the City water
system relies solely on water from the SFPUC system for storage, fire flow, and emergency use.
Historically, the City has utilized practically all of its ISG, and in some years, exceeded it. However,
due to economic conditions, population decline, and a very low per capital water use (79 gallons average
[2001-2010] per capita daily), the City had not exceeded its ISG since 2009, until 2012
Assuming that no additional supply source is secured, the City projects a shortfall of approximately
1,200 AFY by 2035. These demand projections include the expected growth contemplated in the
Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan. This will impact development, because new housing is not
possible without access to water.
The City’s Urban Water Master Plan (the Master Plan) contemplates that the City could meet the
projected demand by developing approximately 1,200 AFY from additional groundwater wells,
complemented with recycled water usage.
City of Palo Alto Tie In
In the short term, the most viable option for securing more water may be to purchase it from another
city that does not use its full allocation. The cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View and Sunnyvale all have
substantial unused capacity. The cities is investigating a purchase agreement with these cities.
Gloria Bay Well
The city currently has a well and pumping station at the corner of Gloria Way and Bay road, called the
Gloria Bay well. The Gloria well is a potential source of additional water. It was put in operation in the
summer of 1981. However the water exhibited higher hardness and relatively high levels of iron and
manganese, and as a result of complaints, the well stopped operations in 1989. Currently the well
discharge line is physically disconnected from the domestic water supply line on Bay Road.
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                     3-33

A pump test conducted in 2012 indicated the well’s sustainable pumping rate to be approximately 300
gallons per minute (gpm) (Todd Engineers, 2012), or 484 AFY. Depending on the pumping rate, the
well could provide 13% to 40% of the shortfall projected in 2035. The City is planning to rehabilitate
the Gloria Bay Well by installing a water treatment system to treat the water for manganese and iron.
Pad D Well
Another potential option is to drill an additional well at site near Clarke Ave and East Bay Shore Drive,
referred to as Pad D. A test well was drilled, and its hydrogeological evaluations indicate that a
production well at Pad D could sustain a 500 gpm pumping rate, or 807 AFY. A fully operating well,
including the cost of the test well and treatment facility is estimated to cost $3,250,000, and potentially
could have $200,000 in annual operations and maintenance costs.
Recycling and Conservation
There is currently no use of recycled water within the City of East Palo Alto. However, there are plans
to construct wastewater treatment plants than will treat and redirect wastewater into public irrigation
systems. The recycled water would then be used to water parks and facility landscaping, as well as for
dust control and soil compaction remediation. The East Palo Alto Urban Water Management Plan
calculates that the potential use of recycled water could reach 150 AFY by 2035.
East Palo Alto is proactively aiming to reduce water use and ensure adequate water supply for the City.
Under the 2010 East Palo Alto Urban Water Management Plan, the City plans to implement multiple
water Demand Management Measures (DMM) and Best Management Practices (BMP). Some
management measures include: a Residential Plumbing Retrofit program to replace plumbing
infrastructure with new water conservation equipment such as low flow showerheads; Large Landscape
Conservation Programs and Incentives that promote design, installation, and management of landscapes
that reduce water demand and sustain high quality design; home appliance rebate programs for water
efficient appliance installation; and Conservation Pricing. The combined water conservation efforts
could ease water demand to some degree.
Summary
Securing more water is a high priority for the city. The city is moving quickly to reopen the Gloria Bay
well and negotiate agreements with neighboring cities.

4        HOUSING RESOURCES
This chapter analyzes the physical, administrative, and financial resources available for the
development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in East Palo Alto. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 evaluate
the availability of residential land (vacant and underdeveloped) within the City, as well as the City’s
progress to date in meeting its share of the Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for new housing
unit production in the Bay Area through mid-2014 (units built, in-progress, or approved). Sections 4.3
and 4.4 discuss the financial and administrative resources available to support housing activities,
programs, and construction, and to assist in implementing the Housing Plan outlined in Chapter 5 of
this Housing Element Update. Section 4.5 discusses housing construction and energy conservation
techniques.
4.1        AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for developing the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA). The RHNA assigns a share of the region’s projected future housing unit
production need to each community in the ABAG region. The current RHNA is planned within an 8
year planning period, from 2014 through 20221. For this period, ABAG determined the RHNA for San
Mateo County and then, the County’s jurisdictions worked together to allocate each city’s share. East
Palo Alto’s RHNA share for the current period is 467 of the 16,418 new housing units needed in San
Mateo County (Table 4-1).

  Although the policies and programs cover 2015-2023, the analysis for the available sites inventory starts in 2014.

State law requires communities to demonstrate that an adequate amount of developable land is available
to accommodate their share of the RHNA. Housing units permitted, built, or that have received
Certificates of Occupancy since January 1, 2014 can also count toward the City’s RHNA. This section
outlines the City’s accomplishments to date toward meeting the RHNA, as well as potentially
developable land available that is now available.
RAVENSWOOD / 4 CORNERS TOD SPECIFIC PLAN
As detailed in the accomplishments section, completing the Ravenswood / 4 Corners Specific Plan was
a major accomplishment and provides the opportunity for many new homes. The plan calls for a both
mixed use and exclusively residential developments in the 350 rezoned acres. Specifically, the plan
envisions 835 new units, 816 of which will be multifamily. To help encourage development, the plan
created a new zoning category, Urban Residential, which requires at least 20 units per acre and permits
up to 40. Additionally, development is allowed by right in this area.
SMALL SITES
The City has recently developed residential projects on small sites and is adept at improving the
feasibility of small sites for residential development. Small-site projects include the mixed-use project at
907 Newbridge and the seven single-family residences developed at 872 Runnymede. Through a General
Plan Amendment and a Planned Community Permit, the 907 Newbridge site was given a variance to
reduce the front yard setback, enabling the development of three residential units above office space on
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                       4-2

a 9,240 square foot site. At 872 Runnymede, the floor area ratio for the site was increased with a variance,
allowing two additional lots to be developed on this 38,000 square foot site. The individual lot sizes for
the single-family residences vary from 3,300 to 4,045 square feet.
Additionally, East Palo Alto has recently implemented a number of policy changes to encourage
development on small lots as described in the previous Housing Element, including a reducing the legal
size of lots, relaxing the development standards (set-backs, minimum lot size) on parcels less than one-
half acre in size and a developing a small lot toolkit.
PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING HOUSING NEEDS
No new units, aside from secondary units, were produced in 2014.
SECOND DWELLING UNITS
Second dwelling units are an important affordable housing opportunity for East Palo Alto. Between
2010-2014, the City approved an average of 5.4 secondary dwelling units per year. The number of new
second units has increased since the City updated the standards in 2011. For this Housing Element, we
assume the average will continue, see Error! Reference source not found.
East Palo Alto is using the assumptions developed by 21 Elements regarding second unit affordability.

RESIDENTIAL SITES INVENTORY
The City’s evaluation of adequate housing sites contains a list of individual sites/parcels by zone and
General Plan designation. The site suitability analysis demonstrates that these sites are currently
available and unconstrained in order to provide realistic development opportunities prior to the end of
the planning period. To demonstrate the viability of the sites, the analysis also took into account (1)
whether appropriate zoning is in place, (2) the applicable development standards and their impact on
projected development capacity and affordability, (3) existing constraints, including any known
environmental issues, (4) the availability of existing and planned public service capacity levels, and (5)
historic unit yield within identified land use categories.
Map 4.1 illustrates housing opportunity sites the Specific Plan area, where most of the future growth is
expected to go. These opportunity sites represent vacant or underutilized land, designated as Residential
or General Commercial (allows mixed-use) that is available for new development.

Parcel Data
State Housing Element law requires that cities provide detailed information regarding their inventory
of land suitable for residential redevelopment (see Appendix), including:
            A listing of identified properties by parcel number
            The size, general plan designation, and zoning of each property
            (Non-vacant sites) a description of the existing use of each property
            A general description of existing or planned infrastructure improvements, and any
             environmental constraints.2

  All sites with environmental constraints were removed from the land inventory and were not considered for development.

Density and Affordability Assumptions for Vacant Parcels
For purposes of determining the additional residential development potential on vacant and
underdeveloped parcels based on existing General Plan land use designations, existing projects were
examined to determine the actual densities achieved. The average density achieved for each General
Plan land use designation was then calculated (Table 4-4). Many of the densities achieved exceed the
allowed density. For example, while the allowed density in the General Commercial zone is
16 dwelling units per acre, the developments built at 2896 University Avenue and 1761 East Bayshore
Road achieved densities of 25 and 30 dwelling units per acre, respectively. In the calculations for
development capacity on vacant sites, both the maximum allowed density and the average achieved
density were considered; the lower of the two was used to provide a conservative estimate of the capacity
for development. The development capacity by land use designation and density used (defined as
“realistic density”) to achieve the estimate of capacity is provided in Table 4-5. Because the Urban
Residential zone is new, there is no history to refer to. This zone permits a range of 20 – 40 dwelling
units per acre. We assume there will be 34 units, the same as Medium/High Density Residential.

Consistent with State Housing provisions, areas that allow a minimum density of 30 dwelling units per
acre are considered adequate for meeting the low-, very low-, and extremely low-income need level.
Table 4-6 shows a summary of the available land by zoning category as it applies to the RHNA. The
City’s inventory of vacant land designated for residential or mixed-use (Commercial/Office land use
designations) development provides more than enough sites to accommodate the City’s RHNA for all
income levels.

Available Land Including Non Vacant Land
In addition to the vacant land, there is significant land in the Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific
Plan area that is likely to redevelop. The plan identifies a capacity of 835 units and the vacant land only
accounts for 303 of these units. Specifically, the plan expects 819 of the new dwelling units to be
multifamily and 16 to be single family.
The remaining 532 units are expected to come from two sources: underused land zoned Urban
Residential and mixed use developments.
This Housing Element identifies 28 parcels totaling 9 acres that are most likely to redevelop during the
planning period. These can accommodate 306 new units. Most of these sites have single family homes,
but the zoning would permit five or more units. Smaller parcels were removed from the analysis because
they are less likely to redevelop.

The zoning standards in the Urban Residential and Mixed Use zones are designed to facilitate
development. For example, three to five stories are permitted with a maximum density of 40 units per
acre. Setbacks and parking requirements are intentionally kept low.
As Table 4-7 shows, Nonvacant land provides a buffer so East Palo Alto is well over its RHNA.

Density Bonus
The adoption in November 2009 of the Density Bonus Ordinance is an accomplishment that increases
the likelihood of meeting the City’s 467 unit requirement by 2023. This Ordinance removes constraints
by reducing the number of required affordable units to qualify for a density bonus and providing for
other incentives.
          At least 5 percent of the units are affordable to very low-income households; the density
           bonus for very-low-income units ranges from 20 to 35 percent, depending on the provided
           percent of affordable units:
                o    If at least 5 percent of the units are affordable to very low-income households, the
                     developer is granted a bonus of 20 percent

  The lower income housing surplus more than compensates for the shortfall in the above moderate income category

              o   If at least 11 percent of the units are affordable to very-low-income households, then
                  the developer is granted a bonus of 35 percent.
        At least 10 percent of the units are affordable to low-income households; the density bonus
         for low-income units ranges from 20 to 35 percent, depending on the provided percent of
         affordable units.
              o   If at least 10 percent of the units are affordable to low-income households, the
                  developer is granted a bonus of 20 percent.
              o   If at least 20 percent of the units are affordable to low-income, the City would grant a
                  35 percent density bonus.
        The development is restricted to senior citizens; the density bonus for senior housing is
         20 percent.
        At least 10 percent of the units of a newly constructed common interest development
         project are affordable to moderate-income households; the density bonus ranges from 5
         percent for providing at least 10 percent of the units to 35 percent for providing at least 40 units
         affordable to moderate income households.
        The development includes a child day care facility larger than the minimum required;
         projects containing child care facilities receive a density bonus equal to the greater of the square
         footage of said facility.
Condominium conversion projects are granted a 25 percent density bonus or other financial incentives
if the applicant agrees to make 33 percent of the units affordable to low- or moderate-income
households, or 15 percent of the units affordable to very low-income households.
If an applicant donates land to be used for affordable housing construction, the applicant is entitled to a
15 to 35 percent increase in density. The land must be sufficient to permit construction for very low-
income households for units equal to 10 to 30 percent of the units in the development—land sufficient
to allow for 10 percent will result in a 15 percent density bonus, while land sufficient to allow for
30 percent will result in a 35 percent increase.

4.2       FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The City has limited local financial resources that can be used to facilitate affordable housing
development. Resources available as of the writing of this Update include the Affordable Housing
Program impact fee program.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEE
As previously mentioned, the City recently adopted a fee ranging from $22-$44 a square foot to support
affordable housing.
FINANCING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
One of the major constraints facing the City is the lack of affordable housing funds to acquire properties,
finance construction and long-term below market rate mortgages, provide affordable ownership
opportunities, among others. The City has been actively pursuing a variety of resources to overcome
these financing constraints, as outlined below. Table 4-8 provides a summary of other federal, State,
local, private, and non-profit financial resources available to support housing activities in the City of
East Palo Alto.
California Housing Finance Agency
In 2003, the City approved a $504,000 loan for site acquisition and predevelopment for 77 low-income
tax credit apartments, referred to as The Courtyard at Bay Road. Remaining funds from the CHFA
HELP program are available to provide for predevelopment costs and assist in property acquisition. The
City’s Community and Economic Development Department continues to explore opportunities to
submit proposals to the Housing Finance Agency to address specific housing needs in East Palo Alto.
There has not been any additional loans in recent years.
County of San Mateo HOME Funds
In 2003, the City was awarded $126,300 from the County HOME Consortium to provide down payment
assistance for first-time, low-income homebuyers. Starting in March of 2004, all of the funds were
loaned to first-time homebuyers in the City’s BMR program. The City did not receive any HOME funds
in recent years.

Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART)
The City has been supporting the efforts of the Housing Endowment and Regional Trust (HEART)
efforts to raise $100 million over ten years for affordable housing in San Mateo County. HEART is
focused on providing financing for affordable housing development throughout San Mateo County.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to
very-low income persons in need of affordable housing. Section 8 vouchers pay the difference between
the payment standard and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30 percent of gross monthly income). A
voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above fair market rent, with the tenant paying
the extra cost. The Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo applies to HUD for Section 8
vouchers and administers this program directly; in 2015, it provided housing vouchers to 453
households in East Palo Alto.

The following are nonprofit organizations with recent projects in East Palo Alto:
Community Housing Developers Inc.
Established in 1979 as the first community based, not-for-profit developer of affordable housing in
Santa Clara County, Community Housing Developers, Inc., has created over 2000 units of affordable
rental and for-sale housing during its 30-year history. Community Housing Developers recently
developed the Courtyard at Bay Road, a 77-unit affordable housing development located at 1730 Bay
Road in East Palo Alto. A distinctive feature of Courtyard at Bay Road is the solar energy system by
Eco-Energies of Sunnyvale, CA (now known as REC Solar), which installed 125 photovoltaic roof
panels to supply the development with all of its non-residential energy requirements.
BRIDGE
Based in San Francisco, the non-profit BRIDGE is one of the leading affordable housing developers in
California. BRIDGE builds a variety of affordable housing types that ideally act as a catalyst for
revitalizing and strengthening neighborhoods. The organization prides itself on creating high-quality,
affordable homes for working families and seniors. As part of a major redevelopment effort by the City,
the non-profit completed Peninsula Park Apartments in East Palo Alto in 2000. Peninsula Park resulted
from a master plan created by BRIDGE, local partner East Palo Alto Community Alliance, and
Neighborhood Development Organization (EPA CAN DO). The project is a mix of 200 single-family
homes and 129 rental apartments, 87 of which are affordable units.
EDEN Housing
Based in Hayward, EDEN Housing assists communities through an array of affordable housing
development and management services, as well as social services that meet the needs of lower income
households. The agency serves low- and moderate-income families, seniors, people living with physical,
and developmental disabilities or mental illness, the formerly homeless, and existing homeowners.
Along with EPA CAN DO, the nonprofit completed Nugent Square Apartments in 2005, a 32-unit below
market rate apartment complex.

EPA CAN DO
EPA CAN DO’s portfolio includes the development of over 336 affordable housing units. Over the next
five years EPA CAN DO, in partnership with MidPen Housing, expects to produce between 200-300
units of new housing, and acquire and rehabilitate between 150-200 units of existing housing. Both will
be affordable to low- and moderate-income families and individuals. EPA CAN DO is currently
planning to develop a transitional housing project for at-risk youth and post-foster care individuals. The
City approved financial assistance for this project.
Habitat for Humanity
Habitat for Humanity is a national non-profit agency, with local chapters, dedicated to building
affordable housing and rehabilitating homes for low-income families. Habitat builds and repairs homes
with the help of volunteers and partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner families at no profit,
with affordable or no-interest loans, and a commitment of sweat equity from the family. Volunteers,
churches, businesses, and other groups work with Habitat and the partner families to provide significant
portions of the labor for the homes; land is often donated by government agencies or individuals.
MidPen Housing
MidPen Housing is one of the nation’s leading non-profit developers, owners and managers of high-
quality affordable housing. In the forty years since MidPen was founded, they have developed over 100
communities and 7,500 homes for low-income families, seniors and special needs individuals
throughout Northern California. MidPen owns and operates the City’s affordable senior housing at
Raimy Gardens, and is collaborating with EPA Can Do a new senior 41 unit apartment project on
University Ave. In 2014 they completed a $20.9 million Rehabilitation of units on Woodland Avenue .

4.4       OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the residential sector accounts for 21 percent of the
country’s annual energy use.6 Within the home, 43 percent of residential energy is used for space heating
and cooling, 12 percent for water heating; and 11 percent for lighting.7 Energy conservation provides
the dual benefits of promoting environmental sustainability and reducing monthly energy costs, which
is a component of long-term housing affordability.
Opportunities for residential energy conservation exist at all scales, from individual home appliances to
city design. Building design, construction techniques, street layouts, and zoning patterns all effect
energy consumption and can therefore support its reduction. Constructing new homes with energy-
conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing energy-inefficient structures, can result in lower
monthly utility costs. Additional energy conservation may be achieved through the following pursuits:
         Sealing building envelopes (doors, windows, walls, foundation, roof, and insulation) to prevent
          energy leaks that increase heating and cooling costs
         Installing energy efficient appliances, lighting, and mechanical systems (heating, ventilation,
          and air conditioning)
         Installing a “cool roof” that reflects solar radiation to lower heating costs and reduce the urban
          heat island effect
         Designing and orienting buildings to take advantage of natural systems such as sun, shade, and
          wind, which provides heating, cooling, and energy generation opportunities
         Supporting attached housing design, which reduces the number of exterior walls per unit and
          results in lower per-unit heating and cooling costs
         Promoting infill development, especially along transportation corridors, to use existing
          infrastructure and services, and minimize automobile trips.

In California, State law (Government Code Section 65583 [a][7]) requires local governments to address
energy conservation issues when updating a Housing Element. According to the California Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD), these elements should contain an analysis of
opportunities for residential energy conservation. It is the intent of this requirement to promote energy
efficient housing systems and building design, as well as the use of energy saving features and materials
during construction.
FEDERAL
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program
Signed into law in 2007, Title V of the Energy Independence and Security Act (H.R. 6) established an
Energy and Environment Block Grant program. These grants are intended to reduce total energy use, as
well as improve energy efficiency and conservation in the transportation and building sectors. The grants
can be used for a variety of purposes, from planning and building, to providing incentives for efficient
energy use. Allowable housing-related activities include: developing and implementing efficient energy
and conservation strategies; updating building codes and inspection procedures (energy audits);
conservation programs; retrofitting to increase energy efficiency; and smart-growth planning and
zoning. While East Palo Alto falls below the size threshold of 35,000 residents to qualify for the
program, San Mateo County is eligible to receive some of the additional funds designated in the
February 2009 Federal Economic Stimulus Legislation.
Energy Efficiency in Publicly-Assisted Housing
The Federal Economic Stimulus Legislation also identified $8.75 billion for investments in various
types of publicly assisted housing, (including Section 8, HOME, and Public Housing) with $4 billion
directed toward building repair and modernization, including critical safety repairs and energy
efficiency upgrades, and $250 million for financing new green construction. The legislation also
identified $2.25 billion for a new program to upgrade HUD-sponsored low-income housing
to increase energy efficiency, including new insulation, windows, and furnaces, and allocated
$2.25 billion to the HOME Program to help local communities build and rehabilitate low-income
housing using green technologies.

U.S. Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program reduces energy costs for low-
income families by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes. This program has been in existence
since 1976; however, funding was greatly increased under the 2009 American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act to help achieve the President’s goal of weatherizing 1 million homes per year. To
date, California has been granted $185,811,061 under this program.
STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Two major State initiatives focus on energy conservation, and directly relate to housing issues: energy
efficient building code standards and greenhouse gas reduction. These are described below.

All new construction in East Palo Alto is subject to the requirements of the California Energy
Commission’s Title 24 energy efficiency standards. Each city and county in the State must enforce these
standards as part of its review of building plans and issuance of building permits. These standards apply
to building components, such as wall and ceiling insulation, thermal mass, and window to floor area
ratios, and are designed to reduce heat loss and energy consumption. The Title 24 requirements also
apply to major remodeling projects, such as home additions.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction (Assembly Bill 32)
The threat global warming poses to California’s public health, and economic and environmental well-
being prompted the California Legislature to adopt the California Global Warming Solutions Act
(Assembly Bill [AB] 32) in 2006. The legislature has found human activity to be one of the leading
contributors to increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide and methane.
The State has declared that GHGs contribute to increasing average global temperatures and worldwide
climate change. The purpose of the Act is to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 (25 percent
reduction over current levels) and then to further reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels
by 2050.
The California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA), which represents local air
districts, produced a report on methods to reduce GHGs at the local level, including steps that cities and

counties can take to contribute to the goals of AB 32. At the local level, CAPCOA recommended the
adoption of General Plan policies and implementation measures that encourage energy conservation
through community layout and design. Many of the recommendations are relevant for residential energy
conservation, including:
        Promote walkability through a highly-connected street system with small blocks
        Promote mixed-use neighborhood centers and transit-oriented development
        Promote the use of fuel-efficient heating and cooling equipment and other appliances
        Encourage green building designs in both new construction and building renovation, including
         reflective roofing and energy-efficient building materials.
        Encourage building orientation and landscaping to enhance natural lighting and sun exposure.
        Encourage the expansion of neighborhood-level retail and services, as well as public transit
         opportunities, throughout the area to reduce automobile use.
        Encourage the development of affordable housing throughout the community, including
         development of housing for elderly and low- and moderate-income households near public
         transportation services.
ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) offers several programs to promote energy conservation
and assist lower income residential customers with their home energy costs. PG&E offers incentives for
energy conservation, including rebate programs for old appliances and free energy audits. It also
provides public education and outreach programs that teach energy saving tips. The PG&E customer
assistance programs for lower income households are listed below:
        California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) is PG&E’s discount program for low-income
         households and housing facilities. CARE provides a 20 percent discount on monthly energy
         bills and waives recent surcharges for low-income households. The program applies to single-
         family homeowners, tenants who are metered or billed by landlords, and group-living facilities.

        Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) is a discount program for low- to moderate-income
         families of three or more persons. It is available to both single-family and multifamily
         residential customers.
        Energy Partners Program is a financial assistance program that provides qualified low-income
         customers free weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to reduce gas and
         electricity usage. The work usually involves attic insulation, door replacement, door weather-
         stripping, and minor home repair.
        Relief for Energy Assistance for Community Help (REACH) is a one-time energy assistance
         program for low-income homeowners who cannot pay their utility bill because of a sudden
         financial hardship. The program is targeted to the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and
         unemployed. Eligibility is determined by the Salvation Army and requires a household income
         that does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
        Reduced rates for residential customers dependent on life support equipment, or with special
         heating and cooling needs caused by certain medical conditions. The utility also offers a
         balanced payment plan for customers who experience higher heating or cooling costs during
         the extreme weather months.
In addition to the programs above, the California Department of Community Services and Development
has a Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to assist low-income homeowners with
weatherization and energy bills. The LIHEAP Weatherization Program provides free weatherization
services such as attic insulation, caulking, water heater blanket, heating/cooling system repair, and other
conservation measures. LIHEAP also provides payments for weather-related or energy-related
emergencies and financial assistance to eligible households.
The City has worked closely with nonprofits to reduce the energy costs and consumption of residents.
The City is working with Sustainable Silicon Valley on potentially establishing a new net positive
neighborhood.
This Housing Element Update includes one goal, one policy, and two actions to promote energy
efficiency in existing and new housing development as a means of reducing housing costs.

5       HOUSING PLAN
The Housing Plan is a statement of East Palo Alto’s commitment to maintaining, preserving, improving, and
developing housing opportunities for all segments of the community. The Plan contains the goals and policies,
as well as the implementing actions to achieve a high-quality, balanced housing stock that accommodates the
needs of existing and future East Palo Alto residents.
5.1       ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THE 2007–2014
          HOUSING ELEMENT
A critical part of the City’s housing strategy is to evaluate the program achievements of the current
2007–2014 Housing Element in relation to its stated goals, policies, and actions. The purpose of this
assessment is to determine the effectiveness of current housing policies and programs, how successful
these programs have been in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and whether
modifications are appropriate.
To devise a new housing plan that will effectively address the current and projected needs of the
community, the City must evaluate the following:
        Appropriateness of the existing housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
         local, regional, and statewide housing goals
        Effectiveness of the 2007-2014 Housing Element in attainment of East Palo Alto’s specific
         housing goals and objectives
        Progress of the City in implementation of the 2007-2014 Housing Element
The 2007–2014 Housing Element has four main housing concentration areas divided into 12 goals:
    1. Increase the Availability of Housing
    2. Mitigate the Cost of Housing
    3. Minimize Resident Displacement
    4. Implement Administrative Remedies

The following discussion summarizes the City’s major accomplishments under each concentration to
date; the Appendix contains a more detailed review of these accomplishments under each Housing
Plan policy.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Rent Stabilization and Just Cause Eviction, 2010
The city renewed the Rent Stabilization and Just Cause Eviction in response to a lawsuit that alleged
violations of the California Environmental Quality Act. Also, the City permitted property owners to
recoup some of the cost of upgrades, a step necessary to avoid further court challenges. The City
continues to implement the ordinance and has been working to ensure that all eligible properties are
properly registered.
Infill on Small Lots, 2011
The City prepared an infill and small-lot development design toolkit with ideas and examples of
techniques to assist developers of small parcels while providing usable open space.
The City also redefined a legal parcel to allow property owners to allow more lots to be conforming.
This was important because previously the owners of nonconforming lots may have had trouble
getting approval to build new homes. Additionally, the change made it easier for an eligible property
owner to split their lot in two.
Special Needs Populations (2011)
Senior Housing
East Palo Alto created standards for senior housing. Previously, senior housing was not recognized in
the zoning code. The new code encourages developments to be located near transit and reduces the
parking standards to one spot per unit (compared to variable rate of 1-2+ spaces for non-senior
housing).
Persons with Disabilities
East Palo Alto developed procedures for property owners to provide reasonable accommodations for
people with disabilities.
The City adopted an ordinance to reduce the distance (from 1,000 to 750 feet) required between
residential care facilities that serve ten or more residents, with lower standards (500 feet) for
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                5-2

development with 6-10 units. Per state law, the city allows residential care facilities with five or fewer
units to be treated as a single family.
Emergency, Transitional and Supportive Housing
The city passed an ordinance allowing emergency shelters in the industrial transition zone. This land
use is permitted by right, with no discretionary land use permits.
There are 17 parcels with this zoning containing 6.8 acres. All of the sites are in the Ravenswood / 4
Corners TOD Specific Plan area and therefor centrally located near transportation resources.
Single Room Occupancy hotels are now permitted in RM 500 zone single allowed.
Demolition Prohibition, 2014
The city tightened the standards regarding demolition of apartments. Specifically, they added penalties
for owners who demolish their rent controlled property and re-rent them at market rates. Landlords
can face fines and penalties depending on the specific timeline.
Condominium Conversion and Tenants Protections, 2011, 2012 and 2014
The city now requires property owners to pay relocation assistance of between $7,500 and $10,000 for
residents if a property is removed from the rent control system (e.g. demolished or converted to a
condo). It also requires advanced notice for tenants, a slower timeline to protect tenants, and payment
of moving costs (up to $2,500). The city also charges an affordable housing fee if a property owner
converts their rental apartment to a condominium and limits conversions when rental vacancy rates are
low.
The city passed a law that ensured that rental parking is only available for renters and guests (and
cannot be rented to others).
Affordable Housing Programs, 2011 and 2014
The City passed several ordinances updating the Below Market Rate unit program. In response to the
Palmer Lawsuit, the city allowed staff more flexibility in applying the requirements to rental
developments. In 2014, the program was renamed the Affordable Housing Program, and is now based
on impact fees backed by a nexus study.
After conducting a nexus study and a feasibility report, East Palo Alto adopted a fee of between $22 -
$44 per square foot to support new affordable housing. The money from this fee will go into an
City of East Palo Alto Housing Element                                                                     5-3
affordable housing trust fund. The feasibility study showed that fees at this level will not adversely
impact development.
Second Units Ordinance, 2011 and 2014
East Palo Alto made it easier for residents to build second units (also known as converted garages,
granny suites, etc.). Specially, the city eliminated the covered parking requirement, reduced setbacks
(e.g. allowed second units to be built closer to the property line), permitted the units in the R2 zone,
and allowed second units and guest houses on smaller lots. Guest houses are separate living quarters
without kitchens that cannot be rented (e.g. they are for relatives and guests).
Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan Details, 2012 with updates later
The City passed the Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan, which envisions a walkable
downtown along Bay Road between University Ave. and Pulgas Ave.; an employment center with up
to 5,000 jobs; and a network of parks, trails, and community facilities. The vision was created through
a community-based process with 23 major public meetings. The Specific Plan envisions 1.6 million
square feet of office, R&D, industrial, and retail development; 835 residential units; 30 acres of parks;
and 4.5 miles of trails.
In September 2012, the City Council adopted the Specific Plan and certified the accompanying
Program EIR. The Specific Plan was funded by the City of East Palo Alto and the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission.
Expedited Processing
In February of 2014 the City rededicated the Permit Center as a One Stop development review center
for expedited review of all permits including residential development. The Community and Economic
Development Department has made the expedited processing of affordable housing projects a priority.
For example, on November 13, 2012 Mid Peninsula Housing Corporation submitted an application for
exterior and interior modifications to six building at 44-48 Newell and 1761 Woodland Avenue. These
six buildings contain 49 units which are owned and operated by Mid Peninsula Housing and provide
affordable housing for households earning 60% of the area median income (AMI). On January 28,
2013, by a unanimous vote the Planning Commission approved the project. The total review time was
less than ninety days. The expedited nature of review and approval by the City of this project
implements Housing Element Action 4.1 which encourages the City to improve the permit processing
procedures for residential development especially for affordable housing projects.

Affordable Housing
As mentioned above, the city supported Mid-Peninsula Housing in the renovation of 49 units of low
income housing on Newell Court.
The City approved a transitional housing project for ten (10) emancipated youth who were at risk for
homelessness at 2150 Poplar.
The City has started the process of redeveloping the Olson site (965 Weeks) for affordable housing.
The process was initially delayed by a disagreement with the state about control of the property in
light of the elimination of redevelopment agencies. On February, 2012 the Successor Agency
determined that the property was rightfully owned by the City of East Palo Alto. Beginning in July of
2014 the City started receiving Letters of Interest/Statement of Qualifications from qualified firms for
the construction of an affordable housing project. Upon selection by the City Council of a qualified
firm later in 2015, the City would anticipate receiving a formal submittal from an applicant by April
2015 with final construction completed by 2017. The entire site is anticipated to be below market rate
units with a density bonus attached to the site.
As a result of the Senior Housing Ordinance the City has begun processing a senior housing project
for 41 units with reduced parking standards. Final entitlements are expected to be granted in 2015.
This project will be built with a density bonus and the City will be granting waivers and concessions
from the Zoning Ordinance in accordance with State law.
Additional Accomplishments
Additional accomplishments are summarized below:
        Creation of a Housing Consortium to discuss partnerships with local non-profit housing
         organization in light of the loss of Redevelopment housing set aside funds.
        Preparation of a Housing Strategy Report to discuss long term housing goals for the City in
         the post Redevelopment environment.
        The City partnered with Rebuilding Together and the County of San Mateo to refer 15
         residents to the Minor Home Loan Repair program in 2013.

CHALLENGES
The biggest challenge the City faces is the scale of the housing need in the community1. Because
housing prices are so expensive compared to what residents can afford, many residents are at great
risk for displacement. The city does not have the resources to fully meet this challenge.
The situation was made significantly worse with the loss of redevelopment agency funding. When
Redevelopment agencies were eliminated in 2012, East Palo Alto lost over $3 million per year in
funding for affordable housing. The city was forced to lay off housing staff and transfer its
responsibilities to the Community Development Department.
Most of the policies that were not accomplished were directly related to the loss of the Redevelopment
Agency. For example, Action 4.3, Explore the possibility of providing low-interest loans and/or grants
to pay for housing affordable to extremely low-, very low- and low-income households, was not
accomplished because there were no resources.
REZONING FOR AVAILABLE SITES
Overview
In its previous Housing Element, East Palo Alto had a shortfall of 146 units in its sites inventory (all
low or very/extremely low income). The city had a program to rezone three sites in the Ravenswood
Industrial Area, totaling 6.5 acres. As part of the Ravenwood / 4 Corners TOD Specific Plan, East
Palo Alto rezoned several hundred acres, but the original three parcels identified ended up not being
the best locations for residential development.
Details of the rezoning approved by HCD before it was finalized.
Instead, the city created a new zoning category called “Urban Residential” that allows up to 40 units
per acre by right (without discretionary permits). Commercial uses are not allowed in this district
(except for ancillary uses like home offices).
The city applied this zoning to almost 100 sites with a capacity for almost 1000 units. A total of 11 of
these sites meet all the criteria for rezoning. (Two of the sites were in the previous Housing Element,
five of the sites are vacant and four of the sites have strong development potential.)

  There are 2,049 owner households and 2,385 renter households overpaying for housing.

 In total, East Palo Alto rezoned more than twice the amount of land it needed to satisfy the
 requirements. Specifically, eligible parcels have capacity for an increase in 408 units, much larger
 than the 146 required. Paul McDougall, HCD, reviewed the proposed rezoning and found that it would
 allow East Palo Alto to fully meet its need from the previous Housing Element cycle.

Sites Likely to Redevelop
There are four sites with a total comprising 3.8 acres that are most likely to redevelop, with a capacity
for 152 units. We included properties in this list if there was a large difference in the number of
additional units that could be built on the site compared to the existing conditions. Additionally, the
analysis took into account the condition of the building. Also, the Ravenswood / 4 Corners TOD
Specific Plan relaxes a number of zoning standards and processes to facilitate the redevelopment of
land. None of these sites were in the previous housing inventory.

5.2       HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
The goals, policies, and actions in this Housing Plan Update are built upon the 2007–2014 Housing
Element and modified to reflect the current and projected housing needs, existing and potential
constraints and opportunities, as well as the effectiveness and relevancy of existing programs. This
Update also reflects input generated from the City’s community outreach process, during which the
community voiced opinions about housing priorities and policy adjustments to reflect its changing
needs. The 2015-2023 goals, policies, and actions are outlined below by concentration area and
summarized in Table 5 at the end of this chapter with quantifiable objectives for the next period.
Because East Palo Alto is updating its General Plan, these goals will change in late 2015.
INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING
In general, the increase of housing units in East Palo Alto is lagging behind the increase in population,
resulting in overcrowding, and housing affordable to lower income households is particularly limited.
Goal 1.0
Sufficient numbers and varieties of housing units (houses, townhomes, condominiums, and
apartments) needed to: meet the State’s mandate to replace affordable units/bedrooms
demolished due to Redevelopment Agency action; address the City’s Regional Housing Needs
Determination; and facilitate housing development for all incomes segments within East Palo
Alto, including extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and above-moderate income housing.
Policy 1.1: Work collaboratively with the development community to facilitate the development of a
range of housing choices (by type, size, and price range) that meet the City’s needs.
Action 1.1: Meet with local non-profit and for-profit developers to promote the affordable housing
              goals outlined in this Housing Element.
              Time Frame: Annually

Action 1.2: Support the continuation of a consortium of non-profit affordable housing developers to
             acquire and maintain property as affordable housing and to redevelop property for the
             purpose of preserving or developing housing.
             Time Frame: Meeting annually.
             Resources: Staff time, HEART of San Mateo County

Action 1.5: Secure at least $2,000,000 for housing development, and seek loan and grant funds from
             private, County, State, and federal sources. Funding will provide gap financing and/or
             infrastructure improvements, as necessary and appropriate for affordable housing
             projects.

Policy 3.1: Ensure adequate residential sites are zoned at appropriate densities and available for
development in order to accommodate the range of housing types and prices needed to meet the City’s
Regional Housing Needs Determination.
Action 3.1: On a regular basis, review City ordinances and programs regulating residential uses and
             construction practices to ensure consistency with the Housing Element and the rest of the
             General Plan and identify/correct any provisions that: (a) unnecessarily increase the cost
             of housing; (b) extend the time required for processing applications; or (c) preclude
             provision of housing to meet special needs.
             Time Frame: Annual review of City ordinances and programs

             Objective: 80 units, with 8 ext low, 32 very low, 32 low income, 8 moderate
             Resources: Staff time and nonprofit resources.
             Responsible Agencies: Planning and Housing Division
REDUCE DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
Confusing, conflicting, and time-constraining City procedures and programs sometimes delay the
processing of housing projects, thereby increasing development costs. Building permit and planning
fees are necessary to support the operation of government functions (including safety), but if
managed, need not contribute to an increased cost of housing or make it less affordable.
Goal 4.0
Reduced constraints and enhanced incentives for housing development within the city,
particularly in regards to affordable housing
Policy 4.1: Improve the permit processing procedure for residential development projects from initial
planning applications through local entitlement approvals, especially for affordable housing projects.
Action 4.1: Continue to process residential development permits expeditiously, providing priority
             review status for affordable housing to reduce holding and administration costs.
             Time Frame: Annual review of processing procedures
             Resources: Staff time
             Responsible Agencies: Planning and Housing Division, Engineering Division, and
             Building Services Divisions
Policy 4.2: Require residential developers to pay into an affordable housing fund to offset the
             impacts associated with their development.
Action 4.2: Continue to implement the Affordable Housing Program, which requires developers to
             pay into a fund that is used to mitigate the impacts of their development.

SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING
Although the City has a large number of residents with various special housing needs, the existing
housing stock does not contain an adequate variety of housing types, price range, or amenities that
accommodate the needs of these residents. Therefore, more housing that meets the requirements of
households where members have special needs is needed.

Adequate housing for special needs groups in the city, including seniors, physically
challenged, HIV positive or living with AIDS, homeless, at-risk youth (leaving the foster
care system), small and large families, veterans, farm workers, people with developmental
disabilities, and female-headed households.
Policy 5.1: Encourage the development of housing units suitable for persons with special needs,
especially for seniors, veterans, and large families as needed.
Action 5.1: Facilitate the development of project(s) in the City to serve special needs groups, with a
             goal of assisting at least 30 persons with special needs. Meet with advocates and
