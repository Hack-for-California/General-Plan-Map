City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                   I. Introduction
I.        INTRODUCTION
A.        Purpose of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. The Housing
Element is one of seven mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing Element law,
first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments plan to meet the existing and
projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The law
recognizes that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs,
local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result, housing
policy in California rests largely upon the effective implementation of local General Plans
and, in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element law also requires the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to review local
housing elements and to report its written findings with respect to the Housing Element’s
conformance with state law.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from
April 30, 2013 to April 30, 2021 1. This element identifies strategies and programs that focus
on the following major goals:
       •      Facilitate the development of a variety of housing types for all income levels
              to meet the existing and future needs of residents, including the homeless and
              persons with special needs;
       •      Address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
              constraints to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing;
       •      Maintain and enhance the quality of existing residential neighborhoods;
       •      Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color,
              national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, marital status, or familial status;
       •      Encourage new housing growth patterns that conform to local, regional and
              state policies for sustainable development and energy use.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
       •      An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
              (Chapter II);
       •      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
              address the City’s housing goals (Chapter III);
       •      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
              to meeting the City’s housing needs (Chapter IV); and
    As discussed in Chapter II, the “projection period” for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment process is
1
    11 years (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020).
                                                        I-1                                          April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    I. Introduction
       •    A Housing Action Plan for the 2013–2021 planning period, including housing
            goals, policies, programs and quantified objectives (Chapter V).
       •    A review of the City’s accomplishments and progress in implementing the
            previous Housing Element (Appendix A).
B.       Data Sources and Methods
In preparing the Housing Element various data sources are utilized. The decennial Census
and the American Community Survey (ACS) provide the basis for population and
household characteristics. Some population and housing unit data are also provided by
the California State Department of Finance (DOF). Housing market information is drawn
from both public agencies and private organiations. City records also provide data
regarding housing development and rehabilitation, program accomplishments, units at
risk of conversion, and housing construction and demolition activity in the Coastal Zone.
C.       Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies.
City residents and interested stakeholders had many opportunities to participate in the
Housing Element update process at meetings of the Planning Commission, Housing
Commission and City Council. Meeting notices were posted on the City’s website, and
notification was sent by direct mail to interested parties in advance of each meeting.
The notification list included organizations that represent the interests of low- and
moderate-income households and persons with special needs. Copies of the draft
Element were made available for review at City Hall and were posted on the City
website. Recognizing that not everyone has the time to attend public hearings or the
inclination to speak in a formal setting, City staff provided stakeholders the opportunity to
provide input at their own convenience and in a more conversational manner by
contacting Planning Division staff via telephone and/or email. This kind of ad hoc public
input was solicited through a flyer (in both English and Spanish) posted on the City’s
website and distributed at various public venues including City Hall, the City’s two
libraries and the weekly farmer’s market.
Please see Appendix C for more information regarding the public involvement process.
D.       Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The elements that comprise the Oceanside General Plan are required to be internally
consistent. For example, residential development capacities established in the Land Use
Element, as well as constraints to development identified in the Safety Element and Noise
Element, are incorporated into the land use assumptions contained in this Housing
                                               I-2                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  I. Introduction
Element. As the General Plan is amended from time to time, the City will review the
Housing Element for internal consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. Water and wastewater service in Oceanside
are municipal functions (under the charge of the City’s Water Utilities Department), and
thus conformance of water and wastewater operations with Housing Element policies
can be established and monitored through internal dialogue and coordination.
SB 244 of 2011 requires each city to update the Land Use Element of its General Plan to
include information regarding disadvantaged communities within its sphere of influence.
This required Land Use Element update must be completed prior to the due date of each
update of the Housing Element. Since LAFCO has not identified any unincorporated
territory within the sphere of influence for Oceanside, this new law is not applicable to
the city.
AB 162 of 2007 (codified in Government Code Section 65302) requires that the Land Use
Element be reviewed annually for consistency with Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and state Department of Water Resources (DWR) flood hazard maps,
and that amendments to the Safety and Conservation Elements that are required to
address flood hazard issues be adopted upon the first amendment to the Housing
Element after January 1, 2009. The City will comply with these requirements prior to or
concurrent with Housing Element adoption.
                                             I-3                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                    II. Housing Needs Assessment
II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter explores Oceanside’s demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in
relation to its housing supply and thereby lays the groundwork for policies and programs
to address housing needs. This Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data
from the U.S. Census, California Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment
Development Department (EDD), San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and
other relevant sources. Supplemental data was also obtained through field surveys or
from private sources.
A.      Community Context
Comprising 43 square miles adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, the cities of Carlsbad and
Vista, the unincorporated communities of Bonsall and Fallbrook, and Camp Joseph H.
Pendleton Marine Corps Base, the City Oceanside is situated in the far northwest corner
of San Diego County (see Figure II-1). In 1980, the City had 76,698 residents. By 2010, the
City’s population had more than doubled to 167,086, making it the third largest
jurisdiction in the region in both population and geographic size. 2 Figure II-2 provides a
demographic overview of the City.
With the City’s immediate coastal areas (west of Interstate 5) having been largely built
out several generations ago, most of the population and housing growth experienced
over the past three decades has occurred in central and eastern portions of the City,
including large master planned development in the Rancho del Oro, Ocean Hills and
Morro Hills neighborhoods. New housing has also materialized as scattered infill and
redevelopment in the City’s coastal neighborhoods and along the Mission Avenue,
Oceanside Boulevard and Vista Way commercial corridors. Over the past five years, the
City has seen new housing in conjunction with mixed-use development, both in the
downtown area and along the Highway 78 corridor. It is anticipated that mixed-use
development will account for a significant share of the City’s future housing growth over
the 2013-2021 Housing Element planning period.
In an effort to build its employment base, the City has in recent years attracted various
manufacturing enterprises and other job-generating land uses to its Rancho del Oro and
Ocean Ranch business parks. The City has also bolstered its hospitality industry with new
hotel and timeshare development. However, the City remains in many respects the
epitome of the bedroom community, with one of the lowest jobs-to-housing ratios in the
San Diego region. To address this jobs-to-housing imbalance, the City prepared an
economic development “dashboard” in 2008 that includes policies for maintaining the
City’s existing inventory of commercial and industrial land, encouraging high-paying
industry clusters such as biotech and environmental sciences, and increasing the City’s
share of the regional tourism market.

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                     II. Housing Needs Assessment
Oceanside was incorporated in 1888 coinciding with the arrival of the railroad between
San Bernardino and San Diego. Much of the original land grant property north of the City
was sold to the United States government in 1942 for the establishment of Camp Joseph
H. Pendleton Marine Corps Base. The City has long accommodated a significant share of
Camp Pendleton’s housing needs, while the City’s retail and service sectors provide for
the consumer needs of many active-duty Marines and other base personnel.
One of the San Diego region’s ten beachfront jurisdictions, Oceanside has 3.7 miles of
shoreline that attract vacationers from around the world. Other coastal amenities
include a small-craft harbor and California’s longest wooden fishing pier. With some of
the most consistent surf on the West Coast, the City hosts over 30 professional surfing
tournaments each year.
Today, Oceanside is a diverse community that provides all the conveniences of a
modern city without many of the disadvantages. Located just 35 miles north of San Diego
and 83 miles south of Los Angeles, Oceanside offers exceptional weather, scenic and
cultural resources, convenient transportation options, comparatively affordable housing
costs, available commercial and light industrial land, and, through Mira Costa
Community College, a wide range of higher education programs. The City also enjoys
significant agricultural resources in its northeastern quadrant, providing a local food
source and employment for an estimated 1,000 residents.
Interstate 5, one of California's main highways, runs through Oceanside, as does State
Route 78, which provides access to Interstate 15 to the east. State Route 76, which runs
northeast, also provides access to Interstate 15. With the Los Angeles area to the north
and the San Diego/Tijuana area to the south, Oceanside enjoys proximity to all major
Southern California destinations. At the same time, being bounded by the Pacific Ocean
to the west, the San Luis Rey River to the north and Buena Vista Lagoon to the south, the
City maintains a distinct geography
that contributes to a strong sense of
place.
In addition to being well-connected
to the regional roadway network,
Oceanside is also well-served by
bus and rail service. Rail service
through Oceanside includes the
Amtrak Pacific Surfliner as well as
the Coaster and Sprinter commuter
lines operated by the North County
Transit District (NCTD). The Coaster provides north-south service between Oceanside and
downtown San Diego, while the Sprinter, which began service in 2008, roughly parallels
SR-78 and provides a North County east-west mass transit link between the cities of
Oceanside, Escondido, San Marcos and Vista. NCTD bus service in Oceanside includes
high-frequency headways between the Oceanside and Vista Transit Centers along the
Mission Avenue and Vista Way commercial corridors, as well as half-hour service
between Oceanside and the University Town Center area of San Diego along Highway
101.

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  II. Housing Needs Assessment
Due in large part to the prevalence of transit service in Oceanside, the City has seven
designated Smart Growth Opportunity Areas on the San Diego Regional Smart Growth
Concept Map, established by the San Diego Association of Governments in 2005 and
updated in 2012. All situated within a quarter-mile radius of transit stations, these
opportunity areas are expected to accommodate much of the City’s future housing
growth in both mixed-use and exclusively residential mid-rise development.
B.       Population Characteristics
1.       Population Growth Trends
During the past two decades the population of Oceanside has increased from about
128,000 to approximately 170,000 in 2012 3. The pace of growth has decreased in recent
years, however, with only a 4% increase between 2000 and2010. During this same time
period, San Diego County experienced fairly steady growth, with an increase in
population of about 13% during the 1990s and another 10% during 2000-2010 (see Table
II-1).
Oceanside’s slower rate of population growth relative to what the county at-large
experienced between 2000 and 2010 is largely the result of diminishing land resources in
the City. This slower growth rate also stems from declining birth rates in Oceanside, which
are consonant with a rising median income and an aging demographic.
As seen in Figure II-1, the regional growth forecast projects that Oceanside’s population
will increase by 33% during the 50-year period between 2000 and 2050 while the housing
stock will grow by only 23% during this same period. This apparent discrepancy is due to
an expected increase in average household size from 2.70 to 2.95 persons per dwelling.
This demographic trend is being reflected in growing interest from property owners in
room additions and secondary units.

2.       Age Distribution
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups require different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level,
and housing preference. Table II-2 shows the city’s population distribution by age group.
The table shows that the city’s population characteristics are very similar to the county as
a whole. As the “Baby Boom” generation enters the retirement years, the needs for senior

housing are expected to increase significantly. As of 2010, approximately 13% of the
city’s population was age 65 or older. According to SANDAG’s growth forecast 4, the
county’s senior population (65+) is expected to be the fastest growing age group,
increasing from 11.3% to 14.8% of the countywide total in 2020. Several of the programs
included in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) provide assistance to lower-income
households for the development and rehabilitation of housing and respond to the needs
of seniors.

C.       Household Characteristics
1.       Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, military barracks, prisons, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group
living situations are included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type
for the city and San Diego County as a whole, as                                About one-quarter of all
reported in the 2010 Census. Household characteristics                          households in both Oceanside

county. Family households comprised approximately                               person living alone.
two-thirds of all households while about one-quarter of
all households consisted of a single person living alone
in both the city and San Diego County as a whole.
About one-quarter of households contained at least one elderly resident (65+).

2.      Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure (owner versus renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and owner
occupancy in order to accommodate a range of households with varying income,
family size, composition and lifestyle. Table II-5 shows that just over half of housing units in
both Oceanside and the county as a whole are owner-occupied. The rental vacancy
rate was reported at 6.2% for the city and 5.5% for the county as a whole, which
indicates a healthy market that provides options for mobility among renter households.

3.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table II-6 summarizes overcrowding
for the City of Oceanside compared to San Diego County as a whole.

The incidence of overcrowding for owner-occupied units is about 3% in both the City
and the county as a whole. For renter-occupied units, about 10% of units in Oceanside
and about 9% of units countywide reported overcrowding.
The relatively high cost of housing contributes to overcrowding. Many of the programs in
the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) provide assistance to the development and
rehabilitation of affordable housing and will also help to alleviate problems of
overcrowding.
4.      Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-7 displays estimates for overpayment for Oceanside
households by income category. According to Census data, 68% of all lower-income
renter households and 85% of all lower-income owner households in Oceanside were
overpaying for housing. These overpayment rates are significantly higher than for
moderate- and above-moderate-income households.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.

The high cost of housing throughout the region, and especially in coastal communities, is
the primary cause of overpayment. It is worth noting, however, that land and housing
values in Oceanside vary widely across the jurisdiction, with inland areas generally being
significantly less costly than immediate coastal areas.
                                                                  II-14                                                April 2013

Many of the programs in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) provide assistance to the
development and rehabilitation of affordable housing and will also help to alleviate
problems of overpayment.
Extremely-Low-Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely-low-income (ELI) households. Extremely low income is defined as less than 30%
of area median income. The 2011 area median income for San Diego County was
$74,900 5. For ELI households, this results in an income of $24,550 or less for a four-person
household, when adjusted for high housing costs. Households with extremely-low-
incomes have a variety of housing challenges and needs.
      Existing Needs
According to Census Bureau ACS estimates, approximately 2,660 ELI households resided
in Oceanside (Table II-7). Approximately 87% of ELI renter households were overpaying,
while about 94% of ELI owners were overpaying.
      Projected Needs
The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of the very-low-
income regional housing need of 1,549 units. As a result, the City has a projected need
for 775 ELI units. The resources and programs to address this need are the same as those
devoted to low-income housing in general and are discussed throughout the Housing
Element, including Chapter V, the Housing Action Plan. Because the needs of ELI
households overlap extensively with other special needs groups, further analysis and
resources for ELI households can be found in Chapter IV, Constraints, Section A.1.d.
(Special Needs Housing).
D.      Employment
Employment and job growth will have an influence on housing needs during this
upcoming planning period. Table II-8 shows that about two-thirds of the population aged
16+ were in the labor force during 2006-2010, both in Oceanside and in San Diego
County as a whole. About 3% of both city and county residents were in the armed
forces.

Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. SANDAG’s forecast of job growth for Oceanside and the San Diego
region from 2008 to 2050 is shown in Figure II-3 below. As seen in this chart, Oceanside’s
job growth is projected to be slower than the region as a whole during the next 40 years,
particularly after 2030, and the rate of job growth in the city is expected to slow
significantly from about 10% during the 2008-2020 period to only about 1% by the
decade 2040-2050.

Figure II-4 shows SANDAG’s projected growth trends to 2050 for population, jobs and
housing for the region as a whole. Population is expected to reach 4.38 million with 1.90
million jobs and 1.53 million housing units by 2050. The Regional Housing Needs

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                       II. Housing Needs Assessment
It should be noted that Oceanside is a “jobs-poor” city with just 0.68 jobs for each
housing unit in 2008 compared to 1.32 jobs per housing unit countywide. By 2050,
SANDAG’s forecast shows Oceanside’s jobs/housing ratio improving to 0.92, but this
would still be significantly lower than the 1.31 jobs/housing unit forecasted for the entire
county in 2050. This imbalance has significant implications for future land use policy.

E.      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the city’s existing housing
stock and helps to identify and prioritize needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, housing age and condition,
housing costs, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to expiration of affordability
covenants.

by unit type compared to that of San Diego County as a
whole. More than half the current housing stock in both the          About 80 percent of new

County between 2008 and 2050 will be higher-density attached housing 6. This trend
toward more compact development is consistent with the smart growth principles
encouraged by state law and embodied in regional plans and programs.

2.      Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 may contain lead-based paint in deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint
becomes hazardous to children under age six and to pregnant women when it peels off
walls or is pulverized by windows and doors opening and closing.
Table II-10 shows that about 21% of all housing units in Oceanside were constructed prior
to 1970, compared to about 33% of those in the County as a whole. A large majority of
homes in the City are newer than 40 years old, and housing conditions are generally
good to excellent on a citywide basis. Addressing substandard conditions in the City’s
current housing stock is primarily the task of the City’s Code Enforcement Division, which
enforces compliance with current building and safety standards as well as state and
local laws intended to alleviate public nuisances. The Code Enforcement Division seeks
to maintain a high quality of life for residents and visitors by addressing health and safety
hazards, visual blight and other deficiencies in the current housing stock. Most code
enforcement activities are either complaint-driven or the result of observations of City
staff. Based on the observations of City staff it is estimated that approximately 8% of
housing units (about 4,400 units) may be in need of some form of rehabilitation. Programs
15 (Acquisition/Rehabilitation), 16 (CDBG Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation), 17
(Manufactured Home Matching Grant) and 18 (Code Enforcement) in the Housing
Action Plan are intended to address these needs.

3.       Housing Cost
a.       Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. Each year the California Department of
Housing and Community Development 7 publishes guidelines for determining and
accommodating these income categories. Housing is generally considered “affordable”
if the total monthly payment (including utilities) is no more than 30% of a household’s
gross income. In some areas (such as San Diego County), these income limits may be
increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-11 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Oceanside (and San Diego County) 8 by income category. Based on state-
adopted standards, the maximum affordable monthly cost (including utilities) for a 4-
person extremely-low-income household is $614, while the maximum affordable rent for
very-low-income households is $1,024. The maximum affordable rent for low-income
households is $1,638, while the maximum for moderate-income households is $2,248.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-11 have been
estimated based on typical conditions. Purchase prices for extremely-low- and very-low-
income households have not been estimated due to the high housing costs in coastal
communities and the financial difficulties typically faced by these households.

b.      For-Sale Housing
Existing housing resale price statistics for December 2011 are shown in Table II-12. Based
on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-11, price statistics show
that many market-rate resale single-family houses in Oceanside should be affordable to
moderate-income households. The typical prices for resale condominiums may even be
affordable for low-income households in some areas of the City, although loan
qualification standards have tightened considerably since the financial crash of 2008.

When market rents are compared to the amounts households can afford to pay (Table II-
11), it is clear that many market-rate apartments are affordable to lower-income
households. However, at the very-low- and extremely-low-income levels, households
have a very difficult time finding affordable rentals.
F.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Oceanside
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities (including developmental disabilities), the elderly, large households, female-
headed households with children, homeless people, and farm workers. Many households
within these special needs groups also fall within the extremely-low-income category. This
section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing these groups as well as City
policies and programs that can help to address their needs.
1.      Persons with Disabilities
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a disabled person as having a physical
or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Disabled
persons may have special housing needs as a result of their disability. Problems may
include low income, high health care costs, dependency on supportive services, or a
need for special building accommodations such as access ramps or elevators.
Table II-14 shows recent disability data for Oceanside residents. As would be expected,
the highest rates of disabilities were reported by those aged 65 and over. Housing
opportunities for those with disabilities can be improved through housing assistance
programs and universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered
countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
      •    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
           and physical impairments;
      •    Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
      •    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
      •    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
           areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
           c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or
           g) economic self-sufficiency;
      •    Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
           interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
           assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
           planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
                                                                   II-22                                                 April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                         II. Housing Needs Assessment
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The San Diego Regional Center (SDRC) 9 is a private, nonprofit 501c3 organization that
contracts with the state of California to provide assistance and coordination of
supportive services to persons with developmental disabilities in San Diego County and
adjacent Imperial County. SDRC serves as a clearinghouse in the region through which a
person with a developmental disability and his or her family can obtain services and be
linked to other community resources in the area. It is the philosophy of the Regional
Center that each consumer shall be provided with the maximum opportunity to
participate in everyday living experiences that promote their development to the highest
potential and their full participation in the community.
As of today, San Diego Regional Center serves 20,810 clients, 18,408 of whom live in San
Diego County. Of those, 443 clients live in the Oceanside zip codes 92054, 92056, 92057
and 92058. Currently 182 of the clients who live in Oceanside are under the age of 18,
176 of these children live with their parents, 3 live in foster homes, and 3 live in a group
home. Of the 259 clients over the age of 18; 134 live with their parents, 44 live in their own
apartments with come-in support and assistance, 61 live in small licensed group homes (6
beds or less), 16 live in health care licensed facilities (nursing services provided) and 4 live
in certified family homes.
Many of the City’s programs described in Chapter V address the needs of lower-income
persons, and those that directly address the needs of persons with disabilities include
Programs 11 (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing), 21 (Removal of
Governmental Constraints), and 26 (Fair Housing). In 2012 the City Council adopted a
Reasonable Accommodation ordinance, which establishes administrative procedures for
reviewing and approving requests from disabled persons for modifications to planning or
building regulations when necessary to accommodate their needs.
2.       Elderly
The 2006-2010 ACS reported 10,805 owner-occupied households and 2,381 renter-
occupied households in Oceanside where the householder was 65 or older (Table II-15).
About 31% of homeowners and 11% of renters were age 65+ at the time of the survey.
Many elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be addressed through smaller units, second units on
lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, assisted living facilities and housing
assistance programs.

3.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Census data showed that about 12% of owner
households and about 13% of renter households in Oceanside had 5+ members (Table II-
16). This distribution indicates that the need for large units with three or more bedrooms is
relatively low compared to the need for smaller units.

4.       Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households represent about 8% of owner households and 19% of renter
households (Table II-17). Households headed by either a single male or single female
without a spouse present are likely to have lower incomes and more difficulty finding
affordable housing.

5.       Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal
agricultural work. Historically, San Diego County’s economy had a large agriculture
component. While there are still active farming areas, shifts in the local economy to
production and service-oriented sectors have curtailed agricultural production within the
county.
Census estimates of agricultural employment for Oceanside and San Diego County are
shown in Table II-18. About 10,200 persons were employed in agricultural occupations in
San Diego County, with about 8% of those residing in Oceanside. The state Employee
Housing Act 10 limits the extent to which local governments can regulate housing for
farmworkers. This issue is discussed further in the analysis of Governmental Constraints
(Chapter IV) and also in Program 8 in the Housing Action Plan.

6.       Homeless Persons
Overview. Throughout the country, homelessness is a serious problem. Factors
contributing to the rise in homelessness include: the general lack of housing affordable to
low- and moderate-income persons; increases in the number of persons whose incomes
fall below the poverty level; reductions in public subsidies for the poor; and the de-
institutionalization of the mentally ill.
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42, U.S.C. 1130, et seq. 1994) defines a
"homeless" person as an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime
residence, or an individual whose primary nighttime residence is:
       a.   A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
            temporary living accommodations;
       b.   An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
            be institutionalized;
       c.   A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, regular
            sleeping accommodations for human beings.
The McKinney-Vento Act (§725(2); 42 U.S.C. 11435(2)) defines a person “at-risk” of
becoming homeless as an individual who faces imminent eviction (within a week) from a
private dwelling or institution and who has no subsequent residence or resources to
obtain housing. People are also at risk of homelessness when they experience a sudden
drop in income, a rise in housing costs, and/or they do not have the skills necessary to
manage their limited resources. According to the National Coalition for the Homelessness
(NCH), most individuals at risk of homelessness are on a fixed income or are marginally
employed and have few ties to family and friends.
The San Diego Regional Continuum of Care Council. Each year the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocates homeless assistance grants to
organizations that participate in local homeless assistance program planning networks.
Each of these networks is called a Continuum of Care (CoC). The CoC process
encourages communities within a geographic area to collaborate to create a
comprehensive network of programs designed to meet the needs of the local homeless
population.
In San Diego this process is run by the San Diego Regional Continuum of Care Council
(RCCC). The RCCC is comprised of representatives of local jurisdictions, community-
based organizations, local housing authorities, the Regional Task Force on the Homeless 11

survey, conducted in late January each year, represents a snapshot of the total
homeless population, both sheltered and unsheltered. Sheltered homeless include those
occupying shelter beds or transitional housing facilities, while the unsheltered homeless
are counted by observation. The most recent available PIT survey data of unsheltered
homeless was conducted during the night and early morning hours of January 27-28,
2011.
The 2011 PIT estimate of the total homeless population in San Diego County by subregion
is shown in Figure II-5. The North County Coastal subregion, comprised of the cities of
Oceanside, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach and Del Mar, was estimated to contain
737 homeless persons, or about 8% of the county total.

Figure II-6 shows the estimated 2011 homeless population by jurisdiction. Oceanside’s
homeless population was estimated to be 452 persons, of which 375 were sheltered and
77 were unsheltered.

Senate Bill 2 of 2007 strengthened the local planning requirements for homeless shelters
and transitional/supportive housing. SB 2 requires every jurisdiction to designate at least
one zone where emergency shelters may be established “by-right” and that transitional
and supportive housing be permitted subject only to the same regulations as other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The City’s policies and regulations
regarding emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing are discussed in
Chapter IV. (Constraints) and actions that will be taken are described in Program 11 of
the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V).
G.      Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
Housing Element law requires jurisdictions to analyze the potential for assisted housing
developments to convert to market-rate during the next ten years, and to implement a
program to preserve the affordability of these projects whenever feasible. According to
City and California Housing Partnership Corporation data, the City of Oceanside has
eight affordable housing developments with 312 assisted units in which the earliest
                                            II-28                                    April 2013

potential date of subsidy termination could occur during the 10-year period 2013 to 2023
(Table II-19).
When rent subsidies and restrictions expire, lower income tenants may face steep rent
increases or even be displaced outright. The affected housing units are referred to as
“at-risk” of conversion. These units include projects receiving state and/or federal
assistance and units created through local inclusionary housing, redevelopment, density
bonus, or bond financing programs. In order to address this issue, Program 28 is included
in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V).
1.      Cost of Replacement Housing
State law requires the analysis of at-risk housing to identify “the total cost of producing
new rental housing that is comparable in size and rent levels, to replace the units that
could change from low-income use, and an estimated cost of preserving the assisted
housing developments.” Based on the City’s recent experience with affordable housing
projects, typical development cost is estimated at $280,000 per unit. Therefore, if all 312
of the at-risk units were lost during the next 10 years, the total replacement cost would be
approximately $87 million.
2.      Preservation Cost Analysis
Preserving the affordability of existing units is a primary goal of the City of Oceanside. This
part of the analysis estimates the potential cost of preserving the at-risk units through the
purchase of affordability covenants. Preservation cost is estimated as the difference
between market rent and affordable rent. Assuming an “affordability gap” of
approximately $550 per month per unit, the total cost of preserving 312 units would be
approximately $171,600 per month or $2 million per year.
The following nonprofit housing developers are active in North San Diego County and
could assist the City in the preservation of at-risk units:
      •     Interfaith Housing
      •     Habitat for Humanity
      •     Wakeland Housing and Development Corp.
      •     National Community Renaissance
      •     Wasatch Advantage Group
      •     North County Solutions for Change
There also are private developers in the North County, including the owners of the at-risk
projects themselves, who might be interested in participating in their preservation. Such
developers may have access to state and federal tax credit funding and to
rehabilitation loans through the City’s various programs.

Potential funding sources to assist in the preservation of at-risk units include CDBG and
HOME funds. The City could use these funds to provide gap financing to assist nonprofits
in acquiring an ownership share in the complexes containing at-risk units. In addition, the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has a multi-
family housing program that provides deferred payment loans for the acquisition and
rehabilitation of at-risk units. These funds typically are used to leverage additional
investment from the private sector. The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) also
may provide subsidy assistance for the acquisition of below-market projects.
The City also will explore direct negotiations with at-risk project owners to extend the
terms of the affordability restrictions. There may be financial incentives the City can offer,
or disincentives to raising the rents to market levels. This is particularly true if the owner is
seeking additional bond financing, rehabilitation assistance, or conducting other
transactions which require City approval or participation. To the extent feasible,
extensions of below-market rental agreements should try to keep the units affordable for
as long as possible.
H.      Housing Constructed, Demolished or Converted within the
        Coastal Zone
California Government Code §65588(d) requires that the Housing Element update take
into account any low- or moderate-income housing provided or required in the Coastal
Zone pursuant to Section 65590 (the Mello Act 12). State law requires that jurisdictions
monitor the following:
      •     The number of new housing units approved for construction within the Coastal
            Zone (after January 1, 1982);
      •     The number of low- or moderate-income units required to be provided in new
            developments either within the Coastal Zone or within three miles of the
            Coastal Zone;
      •     The number of existing housing units in properties with three or more units
            occupied by low- or moderate-income households that have been authorized
            for demolition or conversion since January 1, 1982; and
      •     The number of low- or moderate-income replacement units required within the
             Coastal Zone or within three miles of the Coastal Zone.
   The Mello Act in part requires replacement of affordable units demolished or converted within the coastal
12
   zone.

accommodate a significant number of new housing units in the next planning period.
I.       Future Housing Needs
1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the projected need for housing within
each jurisdiction in the San Diego region for the 11-year period from January 1, 2010
through December 31, 2020. Communities then determine how they will address this
need through the process of updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
The RHNA process began with consultation between the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD), the California Department of Finance
(DOF), and SANDAG regarding demographic trends and factors that should be
considered in estimating future housing needs. Future housing need is determined
primarily by the forecasted growth in households. Each new household, created by a
child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a healthy level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the
total construction need. At the conclusion of the consultation process, HCD issued its
                                                                      II-32                                 April 2013

determination of a total housing growth need of 161,980 new units for the San Diego
region during the 11-year projection period 13.
In accordance with Government Code §65584, the final RHNA plan was adopted by
SANDAG’s governing board on October 28, 2011 14. The RHNA plan distributes total
housing need for each jurisdiction among the following four income categories:
    •    Very low income (50% or less of county median income)
    •    Low income (51-80% of county median income)
    •    Moderate income (81-120% of county median income)
    •    Above moderate income (over 120% of county median income)
2.       2010-2020 Oceanside Growth Needs
The total housing growth need allocated to the City of Oceanside for the 2010-2020
Housing Element projection period is 6,210 units. This total is distributed by income
category as shown in Table II-21. While not explicitly addressed in the RHNA, state law15
now requires the Housing Element to also estimate the future needs of extremely-low-
income (ELI) households. As provided by state law, the ELI need has been estimated to
be 50% of the very-low category, or 775 units during this planning period.

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                    III. Resources and Opportunities
III.     RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A variety of resources are available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation
of housing in Oceanside. This chapter provides an overview of the land resources and
development opportunities available to address the City’s overall regional housing need
allocation, while describing the financial and administrative resources available to
facilitate the provision of affordable housing. Additionally, this chapter discusses
opportunities for energy conservation, which can lower utility costs and increase housing
affordability.
A.       Land Resources
As discussed in the previous chapter, Oceanside’s housing growth need for the 2010-
2020 period has been established as 6,210 units. State law 16 also requires that any portion
of the housing need from the previous planning period that was not accommodated
must be carried over to the next planning period. As discussed in Appendix B, while the
prior Housing Element included a program to rezone properties for multi-family
development, no carryover is necessary since adequate sites were available without
rezoning.
The Housing Element is required to identify adequate sites that can be developed for
housing within the planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s
share of the regional housing need for all income levels 17. This “adequate sites”
requirement may be satisfied in the following ways:
       •     New housing units completed after the beginning of the planning period
             (January 1, 2010);
       •     New projects “in the pipeline” that have been approved for development or
             are currently under review; or
       •     Potential new units that could be built on vacant or underutilized properties.
1.       Progress Toward the RHNA 2010-2012
The City’s progress toward the RHNA during 2010-2012 is described below and
summarized in Table III-1.
     •   New Units Completed. Table A-3 in Appendix A provides a summary of housing
         units completed since the beginning of the new planning period. These new
         developments include 168 very-low-income units and 48 moderate-income units.
     •   Pending Projects. Table B-2 in Appendix B summarizes pending residential projects
         that have not yet been approved. These pending projects are expected to result
         in 288 very-low-income units during the current planning period.
Table III-1 summarizes the City’s progress toward the RHNA when new units and pending
projects are credited.

2.      Sites Inventory Compared to the RHNA
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of potential development
sites is contained in Appendix B and summarized in Table III-2 below. The analysis
demonstrates that the City’s total land inventory provides adequate sites with
appropriate zoning to accommodate the RHNA allocation. As discussed in the analysis
of non-governmental constraints (Chapter IV), there are no infrastructure deficiencies
that would preclude development commensurate with the level of need identified in the
RHNA.

B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
1.      State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - Federal funding for housing
programs is provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The
CDBG program is flexible in that funds can be used for a wide range of activities
including acquisition and or disposition of real estate, public facilities and improvements,
relocation, rehabilitation and construction of housing, home ownership assistance, and
                                                              III-2                                             April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                  III. Resources and Opportunities
clearing activities. Oceanside is an “entitlement city” and receives CDBG funds directly
from HUD. The current level of CDBG funding is approximately $2.2 million per year.
Home Investment Partnership (HOME) Program – Activities that are expected to be
supported by HOME funds include acquisition/rehabilitation (Program 15), relocation
assistance (Program 27).
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The City applies to the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) for local allocations of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers,
which provide rent subsidies to low income residents. Under the Section 8 program, most
tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent. The remainder – the difference
between what the tenant pays and the actual rent – is paid directly to the landlord by
the public housing agency. The City’s ability to expand or even maintain this program at
its current level is dependent upon the annual Federal budget process. Recent
indications from HUD are that Federal support for Section 8 will not be expanded and
that program retrenchment is likely in the future. The number of vouchers allocated to
Oceanside has fluctuated based on federal funding levels but has been approximately
1,300 - 1,350 in recent years.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding
low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon
population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are
then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit
programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income, for a term of 15 years.
2.      Local Resources
Oceanside Redevelopment Agency - The Oceanside Redevelopment Agency was
formed in 1975. The Downtown Redevelopment Project Area is comprised of 375 acres
located west of I-5, north to Harbor drive and south to Wisconsin Avenue. On December
29, 2011, the California Supreme Court issued its decision in California Redevelopment
Association v. Matosantos. In its decision, the Court upheld the validity of AB 1X26, which
eliminates all redevelopment agencies in the state. The Court also struck down AB 1X27,
which would have allowed agencies to remain in existence by paying a specified fee.
The ultimate result is that AB 1X26 is constitutional and a successor agency has been
created to wind down the affairs of the redevelopment agency and ensure payment of
the agency’s enforceable obligations.
Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Matosantos, an Oversight Board has been
created in accordance with AB 1X26 and all seven members have been appointed. The
Board is conducting monthly meetings and has approved the Recognized Obligation
Payment Schedule (ROPS) for both of the two six-month periods in 2012. Those schedules
identify the enforceable obligations of the successor agency.
Set-aside funds have been used as a funding source to leverage other resources. Due to
the 2011 Supreme Court ruling regarding the dissolution of redevelopment agencies, the
final disposition of the City’s unallocated set-aside fund balance is pending additional
                                              III-3                                April 2013

legislation. Should the City retain the funds, it is anticipated that the balance will be
dedicated to 288-unit Mission Cove Project.
C.      Energy Conservation Opportunities
The primary uses of energy in urban areas are for transportation, lighting, water heating,
and space heating/cooling. The high cost of energy and the environmental impacts of
energy consumption demand that efforts be taken to reduce or minimize the overall
level of urban energy consumption.
Significant reduction in energy use can be achieved through the coordination of land
development and transportation infrastructure, a fundamental component of smart
growth. While housing development in Oceanside was historically characterized by low-
density neighborhoods without close proximity to transit service and other services, future
housing growth in the City is expected to occur primarily within existing transit corridors
and Smart Growth Opportunity Areas, as identified on the regional Smart Growth
Concept Map. New housing in these areas will allow residents to live within walking
distance of bus and rail transit as well as essential commercial services and recreational
amenities. Increased walkability is expected to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in
private automobiles, which constitutes a major source of non-renewable energy
consumption in Oceanside.
Title 24, Building Energy Standards for Residential Development, establishes energy
budgets or maximum energy use levels for dwelling units. The standards of Title 24
supersede local regulations, and mandate implementation by local jurisdictions. The City
will continue strict enforcement of local and state energy regulations for new residential
construction, and continue providing residents with information on energy efficiency.
The City’s goal is to achieve maximum use of conservation measures and alternative,
renewable energy sources in new and existing residences. By encouraging and assisting
residents to utilize energy more efficiently, the need for costly new energy supplies, and
the social and economic hardships associated with any future shortages of conventional
energy sources, will be minimized.
All of the properties included in the housing sites inventory (see Appendix B) are situated
within transit-served corridors and in close proximity to key public and commercial
amenities. Accommodating the City’s future housing growth in these walkable areas is
expected to reduce VMT and minimize energy consumption associated with the
provision of water and the disposal of both wastewater and solid waste.
In the spring of 2011 the City completed a greenhouse gas emissions inventory under the
auspices of the San Diego Foundation and Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI).
This inventory quantifies 2005 greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations,
private vehicle transportation, industrial activity, lighting and climate control in buildings,
and other emissions sources. Such inventories are commonly precursors to climate action
plans, which outline policies and programs intended to reduce a jurisdiction’s
greenhouse gas emissions. Should the City decide to pursue a climate action plan, the
inventory will provide baseline emission levels from which to measure progress toward
greenhouse gas reduction.

A.      Governmental Constraints
1.      Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The Land Use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the city’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the Land Use Element must provide suitable
locations and density allowances to implement the policies of the Housing Element and
accommodate the City’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA).
Last amended comprehensively in 1986, the Land Use Element sets forth the City’s
policies for guiding local land use and development. These policies, together with the
zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for
different uses within the City. Table IV-1 shows the eight General Plan residential land use
designations which support a variety of housing types, ranging from very-low-density
single-family estate residential development at 0.5 to 3.5 units per acre to high-density
multi-family development at 21 to 43 units per acre. Allowable densities for these
residential designations are expressed as density ranges that extend from a base density
to a maximum density achievable through the fulfillment of certain criteria intended to
promote high-quality development.

                 3. Potential density for projects that exceed standards established by established City policy.
In 2013 Policy 2.32 of the General Plan Land Use Element was amended to revise the
criteria and findings required for projects to exceed the base density in residential areas.
The new criteria, which are intended to reduce potential constraints to development of
affordable workforce housing, are as follows:
                                                                     IV-1                                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
        1) High quality architectural design and materials that mitigate the potentially
        adverse impacts of higher density and increased scale;
        2) High quality landscape/hardscape design and materials that soften the
        appearance of associated development and contribute to a sustainable,
        attractive, and pedestrian-friendly streetscape;
        3) Functional, sustainable and visually appealing common open space areas;
        4) Consolidation of existing legal lots to provide unified site design;
        5) Initiation of residential development in appropriate commercial zones;
        6) Participation in the City’s Housing, Conservation, Public Safety, and/or Historical
        Preservation programs; or
        7) Innovative design and/or construction methods which further the goals of the
        General Plan.
These changes have created a new standard of review for proposals to exceed base
density, establishing that such projects should demonstrate the same level of quality
expected of projects that conform to base density, rather than a superiority of design or
an abundance of amenities that would likely render the provision of inclusionary units
financially infeasible. With these changes, projects exceeding base density are no longer
expected to provide off-site improvements beyond those otherwise required, larger-
than-average dwelling units, or smaller-than average building footprints.
Like Policy 2.32 as previously articulated, the revised criteria are not applied wholesale to
all projects but instead selectively on a case-by-case basis. For instance, the lot
consolidation criterion (#4) would not be applied to restrict a viable small-lot project but
to encourage lot consolidation as a means of achieving higher densities through more
efficient site design (e.g. shared driveways, common open space). Similarly, Criterion #5
would be applied not to limit exceedance of base density in residential areas but to
encourage the congruous integration of housing into commercial districts, in order to
promote walkability and synergistic land use.
In addition to the residential land use designations, the General Plan identifies four
Special Management Areas which allow exclusive residential development or mixed-use
residential in designed areas. Three of these areas, Rancho Del Oro, Del Oro Hills, and the
Sterling Property are fully developed in accordance with adopted specific plans. The
fourth Special Management Area is the 375-acre Downtown Project Redevelopment
Project Area, which is regulated by the Downtown Zoning Ordinance. Recent state
legislation to eliminate redevelopment agencies has shifted implementation responsibility
from the Oceanside Community Development Commission to its successor agency, the
Oceanside City Council.
b.      Zoning Designations and Housing Opportunities
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan and
are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of

residents. The Zoning Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods.
The Oceanside Zoning Code is comprised of three components: 1) the 1992 Code, which
applies to those areas of the City located outside the coastal zone (with some
exceptions, those areas west of Coast Highway); 2) the 1986 Code, which applies to
those portions of the coastal zone that lie outside of the former Redevelopment Project
Area; and 3) the Oceanside Municipal Code (OMC) Article 12, which applies to what
was formerly the City’s Redevelopment Project Area District, portions of which lie within
the coastal zone.
Because each code uses a different set of zoning designations the analysis of residential
use types has been divided into three components.
1992 Zoning Code
The 1992 Zoning Code, which applies to over three-quarters of the City’s land area,
provides nine residential zones:
        Residential Estate A (RE-A)
        Residential Estate B (RE-B)
        Single Family Residential (RS)
        Medium Density Residential A (RM-A)
        Medium Density Residential B (RM-B)
        Medium Density Residential C (RM-C)
        High Density Residential (RH)
        Urban High Density Residential (RH-U)
        Residential Tourist (RT)
Under the 1992 Zoning Ordinance, allowable residential densities range from 0.9
units/acre in the RE-A district to 43 units/acre in the RH-U district.
Additionally, mixed uses are allowed in the Neighborhood Commercial (CN), Community
Commercial (CC), General Commercial (GC), and Special Commercial-Highway
Oriented (CS-HO) districts subject to a mixed-use development plan and conditional use
permit. The residential component of a mixed-use project can achieve densities up to 29
dwelling units per acre. The relationship between General Plan land use categories and
the 1992 Code districts is shown in Table IV-2.

Under the 1992 Code, base densities, at the lower end of the density range, are
permitted by-right while a conditional use permit is required to achieve densities up to
the high end of the density range. The additional density is granted for projects that
exhibit superior design and meet quality characteristics established by General Plan
policy.
Allowable uses range from single-family detached houses in the RE-A, RE-B, and RS
districts, to multi-family residential condominiums and apartments in the RM-A, RM-B, RM-
C, RH, and RH-U districts. As shown in Table IV-3, residential uses (at base densities) are
permitted by-right, without discretionary review or design review. Various types of special
needs housing may be permitted by-right or require a conditional use permit, as
discussed below under Special Needs Housing.
The 1992 Code also has 14 non-residential districts that allow various types of residential
uses along with commercial, industrial, agricultural, or open space uses (Table IV-4).
Mixed-use is allowed by conditional use permit in the CN, CC, CG, CS-HO districts. Many
of the non-residential districts also allow emergency shelters, transitional and supportive
housing, and large residential care facilities subject to a conditional use permit.

In order to reduce potential constraints to multi-family housing, Program 5 includes a
commitment to initiate amendment of the 1986 Zoning Ordinance to eliminate the CUP
requirement for residential projects involving 20+ units. Such projects would continue to
require approval of a Development Plan and Regular Coastal Permit, but discretionary
review would forthwith be limited to evaluation of conformance with development
standards and design guidelines, and no longer involve assessment of the
appropriateness of the residential use itself.
1986 Code
In May 2009, following discovery that the 1992 Zoning Ordinance was never certified by
the California Coastal Commission, the regulatory document commonly known as the
1986 Zoning Ordinance was reinstated as the operative zoning code for coastal zone
properties not governed by the downtown zoning ordinance.
The reinstatement of the 1986 Zoning Ordinance has significantly increased the potential
for housing development within those segments of the Coast Highway commercial
corridor bearing the C-2 zoning designation. Prior to the reinstatement of the 1986 Zoning
Ordinance, these segments of Coast Highway were designated CG (General
Commercial) under the 1992 Zoning Ordinance – a zoning designation that allows
housing at densities of 29 dwelling units per acre and only in conjunction with mixed-use
development. By contrast, the reinstated C-2 designation for these Coast Highway
properties allows for exclusively residential uses at densities up to 43 dwelling units per
acre. Furthermore, the building height limitations and other development standards for
the C-2 zoning designation are less restrictive than those of the previously applicable CG
designation. For example, while the 1992 Zoning Ordinance limited building height to 36
feet on CG properties in the coastal zone, the C-2 designation allows 45 feet of height on
these same properties, with additional height above 45 feet allowed under a “high rise”
provision.
Allowable residential uses in the 1986 Zoning Code for both residential and non-
residential districts in the Coastal Zone are shown in Table IV-5.

Downtown Zoning Ordinance (OMC Article 12)
Development regulations for the Downtown area are provided in Article 12 of the
Oceanside Municipal Code. Allowable residential uses in the OMC Article 12 for both
residential and mixed-use subdistricts are shown in Table IV-6.
Each subdistrict is designed to further individual land use objectives by emphasizing
intended use combinations. In general, sub-districts 5, 5A and 7A are intended primarily
for multi-family residential use, while subdistricts 4A and 4B are intended to provide a mix
of transient and permanent residential uses. The remaining zones all allow for mixed-use
development pursuant to a use permit. Of the 15 commercial sub-districts within the
Downtown District, 11 allow residential in conjunction with mixed-use development.
Densities up to 43 units/acre are permitted in the Downtown when projects comply with
development standards and General Plan criteria.

Effects of Zoning Regulations on the Provision of Low- and Moderate Income Housing
Zoning regulations have a considerable effect on the development of low- and
moderate-income housing. In urban areas, and particularly coastal jurisdictions,
insufficient densities can make affordable housing infeasible. In 2004 state law was
amended (AB 2348) to identify “default densities” that are considered suitable for lower-
income housing. For large metropolitan jurisdictions such as Oceanside, the default
density is 30 units per acre. All High Density Residential (RH), Urban High Density
Residential (RH-U, R-3) and all residential and mixed-use subdistricts within the
Redevelopment Project Area allow densities of 29 units per acre or more. Low-income
housing can be accommodated in all districts permitting residential use including
commercial/mixed-use districts.
As noted earlier in the preface to the housing sites inventory, much of the residentially-
zoned land in Oceanside, is already developed with relatively few vacant properties
remaining. Consistent with the City’s General Plan, Redevelopment Plan, and recent
planning initiatives such as the Coast Highway Boulevard Vision and Strategic Plan and
Oceanside Boulevard Corridor Study, much of the future growth in the City will be
directed to infill sites which have mixed-use and transit-oriented-development potential.
These policies are supported by the adopted SANDAG Sustainable Community Strategy
(SCS) and Smart Growth Concept Plan, which identify a large potential for residential in-
fill development within underutilized commercial areas. It is also important to note that
vacant and underutilized parcels in these and other areas of the City were heavily relied
upon by SANDAG in determining Oceanside’s capacity for new housing in conjunction
with SANDAG’s 2050 Regional Growth Forecast. These housing capacity figures were
subsequently used to justify the City’s RHNA share for the 2013-2021 Housing Element
planning period.
                                                                 IV-8                              April 2013

c.       Special Needs Housing
To further fair housing opportunities, the City provides for a range of housing opportunities
for persons with special needs, including those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, the elderly, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional or supportive
living arrangements, and single room occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall
under the category of extremely-low-income households. Tables IV-3a through Table IV-
3d above show how the City’s zoning codes accommodate special needs housing.
Chapter V, the Housing Plan, sets forth programs to revise the City’s zoning regulations
where necessary to comply with state law with respect to special needs housing. The
City’s provisions for each special needs housing type are discussed below.
Extremely-Low-Income Households
Many persons with special needs fall within the extremely-low-income (ELI) category,
which is defined as 30% or less of area median income, or up to $24,550 per year for a 4-
person household in San Diego County (2011).
Many of the policies and programs described in Chapter V address the needs of ELI
households, including persons with disabilities and those in need of residential care
facilities. Such programs include housing rehabilitation, preservation of existing
affordable units, Section 8 vouchers, provision of adequate sites for new multi-family
housing, administrative, regulatory and financial assistance to affordable projects,
programs to encourage and facilitate farmworker housing, emergency shelters,
transitional and supportive housing, single room occupancy (SROs) and second units.
However, it must be recognized that the development of new housing for the lowest
income groups typically requires large public subsidies, and the level of need is greater
than can be met due to funding limitations, especially during these times of declining
public revenues. In addition to these efforts, Program 5 includes a commitment to
prioritize assistance for ELI units whenever feasible.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities refer to any family home, group home, or rehabilitation facility
that provides non-medical care to persons in need of personal services, protection,
supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for daily living. Health and Safety
Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08 require local governments to treat licensed group
homes and residential care facilities with six or fewer residents no differently than other
single-family residential uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the
operator’s family, or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these licensed
residential care facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require
licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer clients to obtain conditional use permits
or variance that are not required of other single-family dwellings.
The City’s 1992 Zoning Code uses the term “Residential Care Facility, Limited” for facilities
serving six or fewer persons and “Residential Care Facility, General” for facilities serving
more than six persons. Under current zoning regulations residential care facilities that
serve six or fewer persons are a permitted use in the RE-A,RE-B, RS, RM-A, RM-B, RM-C, RH,
RH-U, RT districts (1992 Code) and the R-3 district (1986 Code) only. Additionally, the City’s
                                                 IV-9                                  April 2013

parking ordinance requires residential care, limited facilities to provide one parking
space per three beds.
Facilities serving more than six persons are allowed by CUP in the RM-A, RM-B, RM-C, RH,
RH-U, and CP zones (1992 Code). Additionally, senior residential care assisted-living units
are allowed by CUP in the CN, CC, CG, CL CS-HO and CS-L districts (1992 Code).
Facilities serving more than six persons are allowed by CUP in the R-1 district (1986 Code)
and the 8A and 8B subdistricts (Downtown Zoning Ordinance) only.
To comply with the provisions of state law, Program 21 of the Housing Plan (Chapter V)
provides that the City will amend its zoning regulations to allow licensed residential care
facilities for six or fewer persons as a permitted use in any residential zone. This would
include the R-1and R-3 districts of the 1986 Code and the 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, and 7A
subdistricts of the Downtown Zoning Ordinance.
With these amendments the City’s zoning regulations would not pose a significant
constraint to the establishment of residential care facilities.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when
such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. Additionally, §65008 of the Government Code
requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints, and include programs to
accommodate housing for disabled persons.
Building codes adopted by the City of Oceanside incorporate accessibility standards
contained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Compliance with building
codes and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may increase the cost of housing
production and can also impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties required
to be brought up to current code standards. However, these regulations provide
minimum standards that must be complied with in order to ensure the development of
safe and accessible housing.
Because many homes in Oceanside were built before modern accessibility standards, an
important housing issue facing people with disabilities is retrofitting existing homes to
improve access. For retrofitting homes, the City administratively permits unenclosed
ramps to protrude into required setbacks without a variance. The City allows a property
owner to build a ramp to allow people with disabilities access into a single-family home
upon securing a building permit. The City also administers a Housing Rehabilitation
Program that provides federally-funded loans to eligible homeowners or rental property
owners to make accessibility improvements.
Key planning requirements related to housing persons with disabilities are described
below:
         Definition of Family
                                              IV-10                                 April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   IV. Constraints
        The 1992 Zoning Code does not define “family.” The 1986 Zoning Code defines
        “family” as: “an individual or two or more persons related by blood or marriage, or
        a group of not more than five persons, excluding servants, living together as a
        single household unit in a dwelling unit.” The OMC Article 12 defines family as:
        “Two or more persons living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling
        unit, provided that this shall not exclude the renting of rooms in a dwelling unit as
        permitted by district regulations.” While the OMC Article 12 is consistent with
        current housing element law the 1986 Code definition is not. In order to comply
        with state Fair Housing Law, Program 21 of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) provides
        that the City will amend the 1986 Code and 1992 Code to include a definition of
        “family” consistent with current law.
        Separation Requirements
        The City’s zoning regulations do not impose any separation or maximum
        concentration requirements for group homes or residential care facilities.
        Site Planning Requirements
        The City’s zoning regulations do not impose any site planning requirements for
        residential care facilities that are different than the requirements for other
        residential uses in the same zone.
        Reasonable Accommodation
        A reasonable accommodation ordinance was adopted by the City Council in
        2012. The ordinance includes administrative procedures for reviewing and
        approving requests for modifications to building or zoning requirements in order to
        ensure reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
With the revision to the definition of “family” described above, the City’s zoning
regulations will be consistent with state law and do not pose a constraint to housing for
persons with disabilities.
Farm Worker Housing
Housing for agricultural employees occurs in two types of settings: housing
accommodations located on agricultural land that is used exclusively for farm workers; or
traditional housing that is intended for lower-income households but is not restricted to
farm workers.
The housing needs of resident farm workers are primarily addressed through the provision
of permanent affordable housing such as apartments, lower-cost single-family homes,
and mobile homes. The remaining farm laborers are migrant farm workers who are not
permanent residents of the City. To provide housing for migrant farm workers, the City
allows migrant farm worker housing as an accessory use in the A districts (1992 Code)
subject to a conditional use permit. Such housing is typified by (but not exclusively)
dormitory-style structures designed for temporary occupancy by migrant workers.
The California Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code §17021.5 and §17021.6)
regulates farm worker housing and generally requires that facilities with no more than 36

beds or 12 units be treated as an agricultural land use that is not required to obtain any
conditional use permit or other approval that is not required of other agricultural uses in
the same zone.
To comply with the California Employee Housing Act, Program 8 (Farm Worker Housing)
of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) includes a commitment to amend the Zoning Code to
allow farmworker housing with up to 36 beds or 12 units by-right in any district where
agriculture is a permitted use. Additionally, Program 8 includes policies and
implementing actions to facilitate the development of housing for farm workers.
Emergency Shelters
California Health and Safety Code (§50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied
emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
The passage of SB 2 in 2007 amended the requirements for local government regulations
regarding emergency shelters. Unless a city has sufficient existing shelter facilities to
accommodate its need, land use regulations must identify at least one zoning district
where emergency shelters are a permitted use, thereby avoiding the need for a
conditional use permit or other discretionary review.
The 1992 Oceanside Zoning Code defines “Emergency Shelter” as: “Overnight sleeping
accommodations intended to provide temporary housing to homeless families and/or
individuals. Such accommodations may include basic supportive services such as food,
shower, and rest room facilities, laundry room, storage areas, and limited administrative
or intake offices.” Emergency shelters are permitted in the RM-A, RM-B, RM-C, RH, RH-U,
CN, CC, CG, CL CS-HO, IL IG, IP and PS districts (1992 Code) subject to approval of a
conditional use permit.
In order to comply with state law, Program 11 of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) includes a
commitment to amend zoning regulations to identify at least one zoning district where
emergency shelters are permitted by-right subject to specific development standards in
conformance with the provisions of SB 2. Based on a preliminary assessment, the City has
identified the Light Industrial (IL) zone as the appropriate district where emergency
shelters may be established by-right. There are a total of 673 parcels totaling over 3,000
acres in this zone. Approximately 45 parcels are vacant, covering a total of about 130
acres. Typical parcel size is about 4 acres, and many parcels are located near transit
and commercial services. In addition to these vacant parcels, there are several
developed parcels with vacant building space that could be converted for use as
shelters. The IL zone is intended “To provide areas appropriate for a wide range of (1)
moderate to low-intensity industrial uses capable of being located adjacent to
residential areas with minimal buffering and attenuation measures and (2) commercial
services and light manufacturing, and to protect these areas, to the extent feasible, from
disruption and competition for space from unrelated retail uses or general industrial
uses.” (Municipal Code Sec. 1310) No heavy industrial uses with environmental
constraints that would be incompatible with emergency shelters are permitted in the IL
zone. As part of the public review process the City Council may identify a different district
                                            IV-12                                  April 2013

that is deemed more appropriate for emergency shelters. The proposed Code
amendment will include the analysis and findings required by SB 2.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional/supportive housing is normally temporary housing (generally six months to two
years) for a homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. This
type of housing can take several forms, including group housing or multi-family units, and
often includes a supportive services component (e.g., job training, rehabilitation
counseling) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent
living.
SB 2 requires that transitional/supportive housing be treated as a residential use subject
to the same standards and requirements as other residential uses of the same type in the
same zone.
The 1992 Zoning Code defines “Transitional Housing” as follows: “Transitional housing
encompasses both housing and appropriate supportive services for homeless persons
designed to enable them to move to independent living within a 24-month period”.
Transitional and Supportive Housing is permitted in the CN, CG, CL, CS-HO, and CP
districts (1992 Code) subject to approval of a conditional use permit. However,
transitional and supportive housing is not expressly permitted in residential zones.
In order to comply with state law, Program 11 of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) includes a
commitment to amend zoning regulations to allow transitional and supportive housing as
a residential use subject to the same standards and procedures that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single-room-occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units intended for one or
two persons. SROs can provide an affordable housing option for small households with
very-low or extremely-low incomes. In the City of Oceanside SROs are referred to as
Single Room Occupancy Residential Hotels. The 1992 Zoning Code defines single room
occupancy hotels as: “Buildings with six or more guest rooms without kitchen facilities in
individual rooms, or kitchen facilities for the exclusive use of guests, and which are also
the primary residences of the hotel guests.” SROs are allowed in the RH, RH-U, CC, and
CG districts subject to approval of a conditional use permit. Program 21 is included in the
Housing Plan (Chapter V) to review current regulations and amend the Zoning Code as
necessary to provide specific, objective development standards to encourage and
facilitate this type of use.
d.      Development Standards
The City of Oceanside regulates the location, density, and scale of residential develop-
ment primarily though Zoning Code development standards. Zoning Code development
standards are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of residents, as well as preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods.

  ** No maximum lot coverage within required setbacks
Minimum lot sizes for residential districts in the 1992 Zoning Code range from 6,000 square
feet to one acre for single-family residential districts and from 5,000 square feet to 10,000
square feet for multi-family residential districts. Each zone has a base density that is
achievable “as-of-right” and a maximum density that may be granted for projects that
satisfy certain design criteria as described in Section 2.32 of the General Plan Land Use
Element. Such design characteristics include:
           1) High quality architectural design and materials that mitigate the potentially
           adverse impacts of higher density and increased scale;
           2) High quality landscape/hardscape design and materials that soften the
           appearance of associated development and contribute to a sustainable,
           attractive, and pedestrian-friendly streetscape;
           3) Functional, sustainable and visually appealing common open space areas;
           4) Consolidation of existing legal lots to provide unified site design;
           5) Initiation of residential development in appropriate commercial zones;
           6) Participation in the City’s Housing, Conservation, Public Safety, and/or Historical
           Preservation programs; or
           7) Innovative design and/or construction methods which further the goals of the
           General Plan.
The Zoning Code also regulates the size of residential structures through lot coverage
and height limits. The 1992 Code has reasonable height limits for residential projects, with
a maximum height of 36 feet for all residential zones. The 36-foot height limit is adequate
to permit the base density of 29 units per acre in the RH-U and RT zones. The maximum
                                                                    IV-14                                               April 2013

height for residential mixed-use projects in the commercial zones is 50 feet, which is more
than adequate to permit the maximum residential density of 29 units per acre. Multi-
family coverage requirements are adequate ranging from 50% in the RM-A zone to
approximately100% in the RH zone.

                    1. Dwelling units per net acre.
In the 1986 Zoning Code minimum lot sizes are 6,000 square feet for both residential
districts. Maximum densities are approximately 7.2 units per acre in the R-1 district and 43
units per acre in the R-3 district. While the height limit of 35 feet and maximum coverage
of 60% could act as a constraint to the achievement of the maximum density allowed by
the ordinance, modifications to these standards may be approved through the density
bonus provisions required under state law.

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   IV. Constraints
In the OMC Article 12, which covers the Downtown area, the minimum lot size for all
property is 5,000 square feet. The maximum density is 43 units per acre for both residential
and mixed-use projects. Multi-family residential is a permitted use in four sub-districts (4A,
5, 5A, and 7A) of the downtown area. A conditional use permit is required to exceed the
base density of 29 units per acre. The standard height limit is 35 feet for residential
projects and 45 feet for residential/mixed-use projects. Additional height may be granted
through a conditional use permit on a case-by-case basis. Alternative maximum heights
pursuant to a conditional use permit range from 65 feet to 100 feet. The 35-foot base
height for residential projects and 45-foot base height for mixed-use projects is adequate
for the base densities of 29 units per acre. The OMC Article 12 does not impose any
coverage requirements for multi-family projects at the base height and density.
These development standards are reasonably necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare and to maintain the quality of life, and are not considered to be
constraints on the development of housing.
e.      Parking Requirements
Regulations for off-street parking are provided in Article 31 of the 1992 Zoning Code. The
City’s parking requirements for residential uses vary by residential type. Single-family
dwellings require two enclosed spaces per unit and garage space for three cars for new
single-family residential units larger than 2,500 square feet.
Multi-family dwellings require one covered space per unit for studios and one bedroom
units and two spaces for units with two or more bedrooms including one covered space.
Additionally, one guest space is required for the first 10 units with one additional guest
space required for every 5 units above 10. These parking requirements are summarized in
Table IV-10.

The required parking is reasonable and does not pose a constraint on the production of
housing. Additionally, the Planning Commission has the ability to grant reduced parking
for senior housing and other affordable housing projects through the conditional use
permit process.
f.       Second Units
Second units are attached or detached units that provide complete independent living
facilities for one of more persons including permanent provisions for living, sleeping,
cooking, and sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure. Second units
often provide affordable housing for extremely-low, very-low- and low-income
households, including seniors. Government Code §65852.2 (AB 1866) requires jurisdictions
to allow second units by-right (as permitted uses) in all single-family zones unless specific
findings are made.
In the City of Oceanside second units are regulated by Section 3006 of the 1992 Zoning
Code and referred to as Accessory Dwelling Units. As shown in Table IV-3a, second units
(accessory units) are currently allowed in the RE-A, RE-B, RS, RM-A, RM-B, RM-C, RH, RH-U
and RT districts of the 1992 Code subject to a conditional use permit issued by the
Planning Director.

In conformance with state law, Program 7 (Accessory Dwelling Units) of the Housing Plan
(Chapter V) includes a commitment to amend the Zoning Code to allow second units as
a permitted use (without a conditional use permit) in all residential districts that permit
single-family units including the 1992 Code, 1986 Code, and the OMC Article 12 where
applicable. Program 7 also includes a reexamination of the parking requirements to
determine if they are acting as a constraint on the production of accessory dwelling
units.
g.      Density Bonus
Under current State density bonus law (SB 1818 of 2005), cities and counties must provide
a density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the Municipal Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of
equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with
units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Throughout California,
affordable housing developers have taken advantage of locally administered, state
mandated density bonus programs to increase the number of affordable units that can
be built. The City amended its Density Bonus Ordinance in 2012 in conformance with SB
1818 and will continue to implement its provisions throughout the planning period (see
Program 3 of the Housing Plan).
h.      Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
The manufacturing of homes in a factory is typically less costly than the construction of
individual homes on site thereby lowering overall housing costs. State law precludes local
governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on permanent
foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home park to be a permitted
land use on any land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the
average density in a new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the
Municipal Code. A city or county may, however, require use permits for mobile home
parks.
                                                                 IV-18                                                   April 2013
City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
Regulations governing manufactured housing are provided in Section 3033 of the 1992
Code and in state regulations (Title 25, California Code of Regulations). A manufactured
home shall constitute a permitted use in all residential districts, provided that any such
manufactured home is certified under the standards set forth in the National
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 (42 USC 5401 et.
seq.), as amended at the time of any application for placement of such manufactured
home.
In the City of Oceanside a mobile home may be located in any A district or in any R
district where a conventional single-family detached dwelling is permitted subject to the
same restrictions on density and to the same property development regulations provided
that the mobile home meets design and location criteria specified in Section 3033. These
criteria generally require that mobile homes be compatible in design and appearance
with other residential structures in the vicinity and prohibit mobile homes from being
constructed on substandard lots. These development standards are consistent with state
regulations and do not present an unreasonable constraint to this type of development.
Mobile home parks are regulated under the Mobile Home Park (MHP) district which
requires a Mobile Home Park Development Plan. There are currently 17 mobile home
parks in the City of Oceanside with a total of 1,838 spaces. One park, La Playa Vista,
currently does not have any spaces leased to mobile home owners. The City also has a
Senior Mobile Home Park (SMHP) district. Eight of the City’s mobile home parks with a
total of 1,188 spaces are designated as senior parks.
The City recognizes mobile home parks for their contribution to affordable housing. The
City’s Manufactured Home Fair Practices Act protects residents of mobile home parks
from unreasonable rent increases while preserving for park owners a “just and
reasonable return” on their investment. The ordinance is administered by the
Manufactured Home Fair Practices Commission under the supervision of the
Neighborhood Services Department. The City also has a Mobile Home Park Conversion
Ordinance (Article 34) which requires notification of a pending conversion and a
relocation plan for displaced tenants.
Program 13 (Manufactured Home Rental Adjustment Program) and Program 17
(Manufactured Grant Program) of the Housing Plan (Chapter V) support continued
affordability for mobile home parks in the City of Oceanside. With these programs, the
current regulations for mobile homes and mobile home parks are viewed as reasonably
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare and are not considered to be
constraints on the development of housing.
i.      Condominium Conversions
The conversion of apartments to condominiums is regulated by Article 32 of 1992 Code.
The ordinance recognizes that conversions may significantly affect the balance between
rental and ownership housing within the City, and thereby reduce the variety of
individual choices of tenure, type, price, and location of housing; increase overall rents;
decrease the supply of rental housing for all income groups; and displace individuals and
families. The ordinance is applicable to all conversions of existing residential real property
to condominium stock cooperative projects except where a tentative parcel map has
                                             IV-19                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
been approved by the City Council prior to the effective date of the ordinance. All
condominium conversions require a use permit and tentative map.
The process and requirements for a condominium conversion are summarized as follows:
      •    Filing of a Preliminary Application with the Community Development
           Department.
      •    Department review and determination of acceptance for further review if any
           one of the following factors exist:
           o     The vacancy rate of multiple-family developments of three or more rental
                 units within the city, as determined by the Housing Director is equal to or
                 more than 5 percent.
           o     Tenants lawfully in possession of 75 percent of the units indicate in writing
                 to the City their desire to convert such units to condominium ownership.
           o     The applicant agrees to sell or rent at affordable prices 25 percent of the
                 units to low- and moderate-income households, with a minimum of 5
                 percent of the total units affordable to low-income households.
      •    Supporting Information. After preliminary applications are accepted for further
           discretionary review, the applicant must submit additional information
           required for a use permit and tentative map. The additional information
           includes: 1) a Physical Elements Report documenting that the project will be in
           good repair on the interior and exterior when offered for sale; 2) a declaration
           of the covenants, conditions, and restrictions which would be applied on
           behalf of condominium owners; 3) information concerning the demographic
           and financial characteristics of the project; and 4) signed copies from each
           tenant of the notice intent to convert as specified in the ordinance.
      •    Condominium conversions shall be in compliance with all zoning, building,
           housing, mechanical, and fire codes including parking requirements.
      •    Tenant Benefits. Tenants benefits include the following:
           o     Tenant’s Discounts. Any present tenant of any unit shall be given a
                 nontransferable right of first refusal to purchase the unit occupied at a
                 discount of the price offered to the general public. The amount of the
                 discount shall be based on the longevity of each tenant.
           o     No-increase in Rent. A tenant’s rent shall not be increased within two
                 months prior to a project application, nor for two years from the time of
                 the filling of the project application.
           o     Moving Expenses and Relocation Assistance. The subdivider shall provide
                 moving expenses equal to three times the monthly rent to any tenant
                 who relocated from the building to be converted. Relocation assistance
                 shall be provided by the subdivider to non-purchasing tenants for a
                 minimum period of four months following the tentative map approval.
                                               IV-20                                 April 2013

      •    Housing Assistance Fee. As a condition of approval of the use permit, all
           applicants for a condominium conversion shall be required to enter into an
           agreement with the City for payment of a Housing Assistance Fee at the time
           of sale of the individual units. The Housing Assistance Fee, equal to 2 percent
           of the sales price of each converted unit, shall be deposited in a Housing
           Assistance Fund to be used by the City exclusively to provide low-income
           housing opportunities.
      •    In reviewing the requests for the condominium conversion the Planning
           Commission or City Council shall consider the following:
           o     Whether or not the amount and impact of the displacement of tenants, if
                 the conversion is approved, would be detrimental to the health, safety, or
                 general welfare of the community.
           o     The role the apartment structure plays in the existing housing rental
                 market. Particular emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of rental
                 structures to determine if the existing apartment complex is serving low-
                 and moderate-income households.
           o     The need and demand for lower-cost home ownership opportunities
                 which are increased by the conversion of apartments to condominiums.
      •    Findings. The Planning Commission or City Council may approve an
           application for a condominium conversion if the following findings can be
           made:
           o     That all the provisions of the state Subdivision Map Act, Article 32, and
                 other applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the City Code
                 are met;
           o     That the proposed conversion is consistent with the General Plan and the
                 adopted Housing Element and any applicable specific plan;
           o     That the proposed conversion will conform to the provisions of this
                 ordinance and the City Code in effect at the time of the project
                 approval, except as otherwise provided in this section;
           o     That the overall design and physical condition of the condominium
                 conversion achieves a high standard of appearance, quality, and safety;
           o     That the proposed conversion will not displace a significant percentage
                 of low- or moderate-income, permanently or totally disabled, or senior
                 citizen tenants or delete a significant number of low- and moderate-
                 income rental units from the City’s housing stock at the time when no
                 equivalent housing is readily available in the Oceanside area;
           o     That the dwelling units to be converted have been constructed and used
                 as rental unit for at least three years prior to the application for
                 conversion.
                                              IV-21                                April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  IV. Constraints
No condominiums have been converted in the previous housing element period. These
requirements are consistent with state law and are designed to protect affordable rental
housing opportunities in balance with the potential need and demand for lower-cost
home ownership opportunities.
j.      Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
The City of Oceanside’s inclusionary housing program, codified as Chapter 14C of the
Oceanside City Code, requires that housing developers of three or more units reserve
10% of the total units in the development for sale to low- and moderate-income
households or for rent to low-income households. The goal of the program is to increase
the amount of affordable housing opportunities in the City. As an alternative to reserving
units, the developer may pay an in-lieu fee, subject to Council resolution, in an amount
sufficient to subsidize the price of a median sales price home in Oceanside to the extent
that it brings the sales price of such a home into the affordable range for a moderate
income household. The in-lieu fees collected must be used by the City exclusively to
provide housing opportunities for low- or moderate- households anywhere within the City.
The inclusionary housing program is administered by the City’s Housing and
Neighborhood Services Department. Current evidence suggests that the existing
inclusionary requirement is reasonable and does not act as a constraint on the overall
supply of housing. Program 4 (Inclusionary Housing) of the Housing Plan commits the City
to continue to monitor and assess the inclusionary program in order to insure that the
overall supply and cost of affordable housing is not unduly impacted.
k.      Smart Growth Planning Initiatives and SB 375
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2004 adopted a Regional
Comprehensive Plan (RCP) that provides a blueprint for accommodating the region’s
population growth while preserving natural resources and limiting urban sprawl. In 2006
SANDAG released a Regional Smart Growth Concept Map that identified over 200 smart
growth opportunity areas where new development could be directed consistent with the
RCP. These smart growth opportunity areas consist of seven place types including: the
Metropolitan Center, Urban Centers, Town Centers, Community Centers, Rural Villages,
Mixed-Use Transit Corridors, and Special Use Centers.
The City of Oceanside, being a major hub for rail and bus transit in northwest San Diego
County, has eight smart growth opportunity areas (see Figure IV-1):
    •   (OC-1) Downtown Oceanside (includes the Oceanside Transit Center served by
        Amtrak, Coaster, Metrolink, Sprinter, NCTD bus line, and Greyhound);
    •   (OC-2) South Coast Highway Sprinter Station;
    •   (OC-3) Crouch Street Sprinter Station;
    •   (OC-4) El Camino Real Sprinter Station;
    •   (OC-5) Rancho Del Oro Sprinter station;
    •   (OC-6) College Boulevard Sprinter Station;
    •   (OC-7) Melrose Sprinter station; and
                                             IV-22                                 April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
     •  (OC-8) San Luis Rey Transit Center.
In 2011, as required by SB 375, SANDAG adopted California’s first Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS). SB 375 requires that the regional land use plan and Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) be coordinated with the update of Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP). The SCS lays out how the region will meet greenhouse gas
reduction targets set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The SCS incorporates
the RCP and the smart growth opportunity area as the land use component upon which
the RHNA is based.
According to the SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast over 80% of new residential
unit growth in the region will be multi-family housing. At the same time the SCS requires
that much of this growth be directed to existing urban areas that have the potential for
transit oriented development. Many of the parcels in these areas (underutilized sites) are
inherently constrained by a variety of factors including: existing viable uses, small lot
patterns, outdated parking policy, inadequate planning tools and zoning, aging
infrastructure, and market risks for “first-in” projects. Yet regional and state policies now
place a much greater emphasis on realizing the potential of the underutilized sites in
fulfillment of RHNA. The challenge for City of Oceanside and other jurisdictions in the
region will be to take steps to “unlock” the residential development potential of these
properties and enhance their market readiness during the current housing element
cycle.

Since its adoption, the RCP and the smart growth concept map have informed General
Plan updates and other local planning initiatives for jurisdictions throughout the county.
Two smart growth planning initiatives in the City of Oceanside designed specifically to
enhance economic performance and increase the market readiness of underutilized
properties are the Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan and the Oceanside
Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan. The objectives and status of these initiatives are
summarized below.
Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan
The Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan (CHVSP) seeks to transform the Coast
Highway corridor and surrounding neighborhoods from a monotonous highway strip of
scattered auto-oriented development into a vital transit-, pedestrian-, and bicycle-
friendly corridor that can attract new investment. The plan identifies several catalytic
actions that are necessary to encourage new development and begin the
transformation process. These include implementation of a “complete street” design for
Coast Highway, zoning amendments to encourage mixed-use development, a transfer
of development rights (TDR) height program, a development incentives program, design
guidelines, and implementation of smart parking policies. As noted in the plan
“Restrictive and antiquated parking policies within the planning area make
development difficult, if not impossible. Stalled development, in-turn, has contributed to
a less than ideal public realm. Smart parking policies would allow development to
proceed smoothly, without obstruction from hard to reach quotas.”
The vision for the Oceanside Transit Center node is for a mixed-use pedestrian-oriented
development that becomes an extension of the downtown business area, providing
opportunities for additional commerce, employment, and supporting housing. For this
area the plan targets a land use intensity of 25-43 units/acre and 30-50 plus employees
per acre in accordance with SANDAG’s thresholds for smart growth. Small surface
parking lots and vacant parcels provide immediate infill opportunities. The proposed
parking reforms should improve the economics of redeveloping numerous underutilized
and underperforming sites within the area.
                                            IV-25                                  April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                        IV. Constraints
The CHVSP envisions the emergence of
a significant residential component
within the Coast Highway corridor,
particularly within the         “Avenue”
segments of Coast Highway that lie
between the nodes at Las Ramblas,
the Oceanside Transit Center, the
Coast Highway Sprinter Station, the
Loma Alta Creek Resort Area, and
South       Oceanside     Village.    The
“Avenue” segments are expected to
redevelop with medium to high-density
housing in conjunction with new urban
green      space    in the      form of
landscaped medians, parkways, and
pocket parks. Some of this new housing
will    be    in   vertical     mixed-use
development, while other projects will
be exclusively residential. Both forms of
housing will expand the market for
neighborhood-serving retail, medical/
professional     office     and     other
commercial       uses    along      Coast
Highway,       where     demand        for
commercial uses has for decades
been      weakened      by     expanding
commercial services in areas east of
Interstate 5.
In 2010, The Coast Highway Vision and
Strategic Plan won a California APA
Planning Award.
Oceanside Boulevard Corridor
In 2007, a 15 member Task Force
appointed by the City Council began
a collaborative planning process to
prepare a vision statement for the
Oceanside Boulevard Corridor and a
list of policy steps to guide its
transformation from an auto-oriented
strip commercial area to a “well
planned, beautiful, safe, prosperous,         Underutilized sites in the Coast Highway corridor
and place.” This effort was part of a
multi-phased planning process to
revitalize the Oceanside Boulevard Corridor, which due to the opening of the
North County Transit District’s Sprinter Rail service, created significant opportunities for
                                             IV-26                                       April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   IV. Constraints
new transit-oriented development. The first phase of this effort was to be the preparation
of a Specific Plan for the western portion of the corridor between I-5 and Crouch Street.
A major component of the Phase I effort will be the creation of mixed-use transit-oriented
development at the Crouch Street Sprinter Station (OC-3). A vacant 12-acre property
adjacent to the train station has the potential for a mixed-use residential development
that could serve as a catalytic project for the area. A specific plan is needed to establish
a road map to implement the vision over multiple market cycles and address
developer/investor concerns regarding “adjacency predictability.” As envisioned the
Specific Plan would be accompanied by “complete street” improvements for this portion
of Oceanside Boulevard and potentially a form-based code style of zoning.
Presently, the Phase I area is dominated by commercial zones that do not permit
residential and mixed-use development “as-of-right.” Additionally, setback requirements,
FAR limits, maximum coverage requirements, height limitations and parking requirements
detract from the public realm and prevent the type of mixed-use development and
pedestrian-friendly development envisioned for the planning area. While many of the
auto-oriented commercial uses in the area remain viable it is likely, over the eight-year
planning period, that with supportive zoning and revitalization strategies in place, new
residential development could be leveraged to enhance the economic performance of
underutilized properties in the area. This could potentially occur through retrofit scenarios
that utilize surplus parking areas for mixed-use housing integrated with existing
commercial buildings.
In support of efforts such as these SANDAG has instituted a Smart Growth Improvement
Grant program for planning and capital improvement projects that further the objectives
of the smart growth concept plan. Similar smart growth grants are available from the
state such as the Sustainable Communities Planning Grant Program administered by the
Strategic Growth Council. During the previous Smart Growth Improvement Grant cycle,
the City of Oceanside pursued funding to complete planning for the Oceanside
Boulevard Corridor and to implement new zoning and parking reforms for the Coast
Highway Vision and Strategic Plan (CHVSP). The City was awarded a smart growth
improvement planning grant to develop a specific plan and environmental impact
report for the Oceanside Boulevard Corridor, but due to budgetary constraints the City
has not had the resources to initiate this project. Implementation of new zoning and
parking reforms for the CHVSP has also been delayed by budgetary constraints.
However, notwithstanding the City’s inability to move these two projects forward, existing
zoning standards for both the Coast Highway and Oceanside Boulevard corridors
already allow for high-density housing in conjunction with mixed-use development, and
various parking provisions in both the 1986 and 1992 Zoning Ordinances (e.g. joint-use
parking allowances) provide a high degree of flexibility in dealing with the constraints
that parking requirements often place upon high-density housing.
There remains abundant opportunity for infill and redevelopment in both the Coast
Highway and Oceanside Boulevard corridors, given that existing development on most
properties is of considerably less intensity than allowed under current development
standards. With access to transit, proximity to the beach area, and adjacency to well-
established residential neighborhoods, these corridors are expected to see the
emergence of a significant residential component during the 2013-2021 planning period

as diffuse strip commercial land uses give way to a more compact and efficient
development pattern.
Program 10 (TOD and Smart Growth Implementation) of the Housing Plan (Chapter V)
commits the City to continue efforts to pursue smart growth improvement grants, state
grants and other funding sources and to complete implementation programs for the
Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan, the Oceanside Boulevard Corridor and to
initiate new specific plans, corridor plans and other planning efforts as City resources
allow to facilitate residential development in identified smart growth concept areas and
other appropriate smart growth areas in the City of Oceanside.
l.      Building Codes and Enforcement
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such changes to the
Department of Housing and Community Development with a finding that the change is
needed.
The City's building codes are based upon the 2011 California Building, Plumbing,
Mechanical, Electrical and Fire Codes. Local amendments to the state code have been
adopted to require fire sprinklers for some residential construction. No other additional
regulations have been imposed by the City that would unnecessarily add to housing
costs.
Code enforcement programs are implemented through the City’s Neighborhood
Services Department. Code enforcement staff investigates violations of building code
and property maintenance standards as well as other complaints. When violations are
identified, eligible property owners are referred to appropriate rehabilitation programs
providing grants or low-interest loans for property and building improvements. The City of
Oceanside is committed to increasing public awareness of rehabilitation and home
improvement programs and to coordinating these programs with code enforcement
efforts. This commitment is reflected in Program 18 (Code Enforcement) of the Housing
Plan. Program 15 (Acquisition/Rehabilitation) and Program 16 (CDGB Funded Owner-
Occupied Housing Rehabilitation) of the Housing Plan also provide support in this effort.
2.      Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
Development review procedures exist to provide a clear path to success and ensure that
proposals for new development comply with local regulations and are compatible with
adjacent land uses.
Processing times vary by permit type, the size and complexity of the project, and the
number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process. Table IV-12 shows the
typical processing times for the various permit types. Where multiple approvals are
required, the City allows for concurrent processing, which generally limits the total
processing time to that required by the most review intensive permit or approval.

Single family homes and duplexes can generally be built as-of-right unless a parcel map
or subdivision map is required. Residential developments with more than two units require
approval of a development plan by the Planning Commission. Review of a development
plan application consists of confirming that the project is consistent with applicable
development standards and would not substantially deteriorate property values,
unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties, or endanger
the public peace, health, safety or general welfare (OMC Sec. 1611).
Multi-family or mixed-use projects of 20 or more units in the Coastal Zone currently require
a conditional use permit. In order to address the potential constraint that could be posed
by the CUP requirement, Program 5 is included in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) to
initiate a Code amendment to replace the CUP requirement with a Development Plan
that focuses on confirming that the project complies with objective development
standards rather than examining the appropriateness of the use itself.
Processing times for administrative development plan review (8-12 weeks) and, where
applicable, conditional use permit (8-16 weeks) are considered reasonable and do not
pose a significant constraint to housing development. The ADP and ACP provided for
expedited, staff-level project review and approval.
b.      Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all developments meeting the definition of “project”
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Oceanside has a number of
environmental and development constraints due to its sensitive environmental resources
and coastal location. Because of these environmental constraints, larger residential
projects have typically required the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs).
The City has adopted environmental processing guidelines that closely follow the state
CEQA guidelines. Under state law, an EIR is required for any development that has the
                                                              IV-29                                            April 2013

potential of creating significant impacts that cannot be mitigated, which is typical of large
projects. Today, most residential projects are either Categorically Exempt or require only
an Initial Study and Negative Declaration. A Negative Declaration typically takes four to six
weeks to prepare, depending on complexity of the project and required technical studies,
followed by a state-mandated public review period. Categorically Exempt developments
require a minimal amount of time.
Although CEQA compliance can add complexity to the permitting process, City staff
assists developers through the process to cut down on processing time to the extent
feasible. The City of Oceanside supports current state efforts to streamline the CEQA
process for infill development.
3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and infra-
structure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system based on
the magnitude of the project's impact or the extent of the benefit that will be derived.
Development fees vary from project to project depending on the specific
characteristics.
a.      Planning and Development Fees
Housing construction imposes short- and long-term infrastructure costs on communities.
Short-term costs include staffing for planning services and inspections. In addition, new
residential developments can result in significant long-term costs to maintain and
improve infrastructure, public facilities, parks, and streets. In response to the taxing
constraints imposed by Proposition 13, many California cities rely on planning and
development impact fees to fund facilities necessitated by new housing.
In San Diego County, all jurisdictions collect planning and development fees, as well as
impact fees to assist in the construction of new schools and parks, and to help fund
infrastructure improvements. Impact fees in Oceanside are assessed for parkland
dedication, drainage, public facilities (various), traffic signals, thoroughfares, water
systems, and wastewater systems. Fees to other agencies include school facilities
mitigation fees, San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA) capacity fees and water
treatment capacity charges.
Table IV-13 summarizes the development and impact fees for typical single-family and
multi-family projects.

The City adjusts fees periodically based on the actual cost of services and modifications
to land development processes and procedures. City fees are based on the actual cost
of providing essential services and are not an unreasonable constraint to housing
development.
b.      Site Improvement Requirements
The City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to
serve their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility
extensions, street construction and traffic control device installation that are related to
the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-
of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities, and school sites, consistent with the
Subdivision Map Act.
                                                                            IV-31                                                                    April 2013

Where roadways are not present developers are required to construct all internal
roadways for a subdivision and provide connections to existing roadways in a manner
that assures that each new and existing roadway continues to function as it was
intended. As provided in the Circulation Element, the City also requires dedication and
improvement of necessary rights-of-way along Master Transportation Plan streets. This
usually will occur in fulfillment of a condition of approval for a tentative map or as a
condition of a building permit.
A typical local street requires a 60-foot right-of-way, with two 12-foot travel lanes. The
City’s road standards are typical for cities in San Diego County and do not act as a
constraint to housing development. Table IV-14 illustrates the City’s street improvement
standards.

The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improve-
ments including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the continued build-
out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public
improvements is coordinated with private development.
While site improvement requirements increase housing costs, they are typical for most
jurisdictions in San Diego County. Moreover site improvements are necessary to maintain
the quality of life desired by residents, and ensure the availability of needed public
services and facilities. The City of Oceanside can mitigate the cost of improvement
requirements for affordable housing developments by assisting with grant funding
applications or providing regulatory and financial incentives (see Programs 6 - Section
202 and 22 - Monitoring of Potential New Housing Funds. Additionally, future
development will occur primarily in already developed areas where roadway and other
offsite improvements will be a fraction of what they would be for “greenfield”
development.
B.      Non-Governmental Constraints
1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
                                                               IV-32                                       April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act).
The most noteworthy environmental constraints in Oceanside are the San Luis Rey River
Floodplain and the agricultural lands in the northeastern portion of the city. These areas
are largely protected from incompatible development by open space and agricultural
zoning.
In collaboration with the City, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has implemented an
extensive levee system along the San Luis Rey River that has allowed for new housing
development and reduced the risk of flooding for hundreds of existing dwelling units. The
Corps is currently engaged in removal of invasive vegetation (primarily Arundo donax)
within the San Luis Rey River channel between College Boulevard and the harbor area.
This project will significantly reduce the flood risk for existing neighborhoods adjacent to
the channel. The City itself has recently implemented improvements along Pilgrim Creek,
a tributary of the San Luis Rey River, that has reduced the risk of flooding for several
single-family neighborhoods in the North Valley Neighborhood Planning Area. Along
Loma Alta Creek, which parallels the Oceanside Boulevard corridor, the City has recently
constructed three detention basins that mitigate flood risk on several creekside
properties listed in the Housing Sites Inventory as available for high-density housing.
Development in steep hillside areas is also regulated by the City’s Hillside Development
regulations, which require a Hillside Development Plan to minimize grading and preserve
the natural appearance of the hillsides. Density reductions and identification of steep
slopes unsuitable for development may result.
The City’s land use plans have been designed to protect sensitive areas from
development, and also to protect public safety by avoiding development in hazardous
areas. While these policies constrain residential development to some extent, they are
necessary to support other public policy objectives and priorities. In Southern California,
nearly all development projects face potential community-wide environmental
constraints such as seismic, traffic, noise and air quality impacts, in addition to site-
specific constraints. None of the sites identified in the land inventory (Appendix B) have
known site-specific environmental constraints that would preclude the assumed level of
development.
2.      Infrastructure Constraints
The City of Oceanside has a limited amount of vacant land available for new multi-
family development. All currently available sites have necessary infrastructure such as
water, wastewater and drainage systems in place. Much of the new multi-family
development during the planning period is expected to be infill development in the
downtown area, along identified street corridors such as Coast Highway and Oceanside
Boulevard, and in transit-oriented development projects along the Sprinter rail line. Some
infrastructure upgrades will be needed to serve the new development; however, funding
mechanisms will be coordinated with the planning for these areas to ensure that
infrastructure requirements do not become a constraint to development.

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
Additionally, the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the
continued build-out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction
of public improvements is coordinated with development.
The City of Oceanside is served by the San Luis Rey Wastewater Treatment Plant, which
has a capacity of 13.5 MGD and the La Salina Wastewater Treatment Plan, which has a
capacity of 5.5 MGD. The San Luis Rey Plant serves areas east of I-5 and the La Salina
plant serves areas west of I-5. The City’s Water Division operates and maintains the City’s
water treatment, distribution and metering systems. Approximately 87% of the City’s
water is purchased from the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), which in turn
receives much of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The
remaining 13% comes from groundwater in the Mission Basin. Groundwater is purified
through a desalting process at the Mission Basin Groundwater Purification facilities.
Although subject to cost increases, Oceanside’s reliance on SDCWA water assures that
there will be a sufficient water supply to support projected population growth during the
planning period. Further, greater reliance on infill development promises to effectively
leverage existing water and wastewater infrastructure toward the fulfillment of the City’s
housing goals.
3.      Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and the recent downturn in the housing
market has affected land values. Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of
the residential real estate market. Even with the real estate downturn, the high price of
land throughout San Diego County still poses a significant challenge to the development
of lower-income housing. Density affects development feasibility by affecting land cost
per unit. As discussed in the Governmental Constraints section of this chapter, allowable
multi-family residential densities in Oceanside are sufficient to facilitate development of
affordable housing.
4.      Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. Development industry sources indicate that current
construction costs are approximately $120/square foot for Type 5 (wood frame)
construction and $200/square foot for steel frame construction. The City has no influence
over materials and labor costs, and the building codes in Oceanside are not substantially
different than most other cities in San Diego County. In recent years, construction costs
for materials and labor have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general rate of
inflation according to the Construction Industry Research Board.
5.      Cost and Availability of Financing
The crisis in the mortgage industry during the past few years will affect the availability and
cost of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable. It is clear that
one of the primary factors contributing to real estate recession was the lending policies
of “sub-prime” mortgage brokers who approved loans for borrowers without sufficient
equity and ability to repay the loans. As a result of these practices, there has been a
                                             IV-34                                   April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                         IV. Constraints
significant rise in foreclosure rates, and changes in mortgage underwriting standards is
likely to have greater impacts on low-income families than other segments of the
community.
C.       Fair Housing
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, resales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it does not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the city.
State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City contracts
its fair housing services to North County Lifeline, which includes discrimination complaint
investigation and education, and outreach to tenants, landlords, and property owners.
The City is an active sponsor of fair housing activities and participated in the Regional
Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice. Program 26 (Fair Housing Program) of the
Housing Plan (Chapter V) commits the City to continued advocacy, outreach, and
education to ensure compliance with fair housing laws.

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
This chapter of the Housing Element contains goals and policies the City will implement to
address a number of important housing-related issues during the 2013-2021 planning
period. While many of the programs have been carried forward from the previous
period, others have been revised or added to reflect the evaluation process (Appendix
A) and/or new circumstances.
The primary goal of the City of Oceanside is to ensure that decent, safe housing is
available at a cost that is affordable to all current and future residents of this community
at a cost which is within the reach of the City. To this end, the City will strive to maintain a
reasonable balance between rental and ownership housing opportunities, between
senior and family housing, and encourage a variety of individual choices of tenure, type,
and location of housing throughout the community.
To achieve this goal, the following sub-goals and policies are addressed in this element:
1) produce opportunities for decent and affordable housing for all citizens; 2) encourage
the development of a variety of housing opportunities; 3) protect, encourage, and
provide housing opportunities for persons of low and moderate income; and (4) promote
equal opportunity for all residents to reside in housing of their choice. Each issue area
and the supporting goals and policies are identified and discussed in the following
section.
A.      Housing Goals and Policies
A sound basis for any plan of action is a set of well-defined goals and policies to express
the desires and aspirations of the community. The City has established the following
housing goals:

        Policy 1.5:  Continue to utilize the City’s code enforcement program to bring
                     substandard units into compliance with City codes and to improve
                     overall housing quality and conditions in Oceanside.
        Policy 1.6:  Encourage higher-density housing development along transit
                     corridors and smart growth focus areas in order to encourage
                     preservation of natural resources and agricultural land; reduce
                                              V-1                                      April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                               V. Housing Action Plan
                      energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gasses and other
                      air pollutants; reduce water pollution occasioned by stormwater
                      runoff; and promote active transportation with its associated health
                      benefits.
Goal 2:        Encourage the development of a variety of housing opportunities, with
               special emphasis on providing:
                      •   A broad range of housing types, with varied levels of amenities
                          and number of bedrooms.
                      •   Sufficient rental stock for all segments of the community,
                          including families with children.
                      •   Housing that meets the special needs of the elderly and persons
                          with disabilities.
                      •   Housing that meets the needs of large families.
        Policy 2.1:   Designate land for a variety of residential densities sufficient to meet
                      the housing needs for a variety of household sizes and income levels,
                      with higher densities being focused in the vicinity of transit stops,
                      smart growth focus areas, and in proximity to significant
                      concentrations of employment opportunities.
        Policy 2.2:   Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist
                      in the production of housing with particular emphasis on housing
                      affordable and accessible to lower income households, persons with
                      disabilities, elderly, large families, female-headed households, and
                      homeless persons.
        Policy 2.3:   Encourage housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities near
                      public transportation, shopping, medical, and other essential support
                      services and facilities.
        Policy 2.4:   Encourage developers to employ innovative solutions to meet
                      housing needs, including adaptive reuse of existing non-residential
                      buildings.
Goal 3:        Protect, encourage, and provide housing opportunities for persons of low
               and moderate income.
        Policy 3.1:   Continue to utilize federal and state subsidies to the fullest extent in
                      order to meet the needs of lower income residents.
        Policy 3.2:   Use the City’s regulatory powers to promote affordable housing.
        Policy 3.3:   Provide support to nonprofit development corporations for the
                      development of affordable housing.
        Policy 3.4:   Ensure that the development of lower income housing meets
                      applicable standards of health, safety, and decency.
                                                 V-2                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                             V. Housing Action Plan
        Policy 3.5:  Encourage the development of housing for low and moderate
                     income households in areas with adequate access to employment
                     opportunities, community facilities, and public services.
        Policy 3.6:  Attempt to preserve restricted low income housing in Oceanside
                     that is at risk of converting to non-low income use by: a) identifying
                     financial resources available to preserve these units; and b) assisting
                     interested agencies and/or tenant groups in forming partnerships
                     and gaining access to financial and technical resources.
        Policy 3.7:  Encourage the disbursement of lower and moderate income
                     housing opportunities throughout all areas of the City.
Goal 4:        Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in housing of their
               choice.
        Policy 4.1:  Prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to
                     race, ethnic background, religion, disability, income, sex, age,
                     familial status or household composition.
        Policy 4.2:  Assist in the enforcement of fair housing laws by receiving and
                     investigating fair housing allegations, monitoring compliance with
                     fair housing laws, and referring possible violations to enforcing
                     agencies.
B.      Housing Programs
The programs contained in this section of the Housing Element describe specific actions
the City of Oceanside will carry out over the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle to satisfy
the community’s housing needs and meet the requirements of State law. Funds available
to implement these programs include: a portion of the City’s Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funds (estimated at $1.7 million per year), and HOME funds
(estimated at $400,000 per year). Mortgage revenue Bonds will continue to be an
important but decreasing source of housing revenue. The City’s quantified objectives for
the 2013-2021 Housing Element follow the program descriptions. The City’s potential for
making significant progress toward exceeding its affordable housing goals will be made
possible by utilizing a number of programs in combinations tailored to the project
specifics and could include revenue bonds, density bonuses, inclusionary housing, and
other programs to help offset land and housing costs.
The State’s elimination of redevelopment agencies in 2012 is expected to result in a
significant reduction in available funding for affordable housing. Unless the State
replaces redevelopment set-aside monies other sources of funding subsidies, it is unlikely
that local governments will be able to achieve previous levels of housing production for
low- and moderate-income households.
Program 1: Housing Revenue Bonds (Multi-Family)
This program provides housing revenue bonds for the development of affordable housing
multi-family housing for lower-income households.

Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division
Funding Source: Issuance of bonds by the City
Objectives and Schedule: The City plans to issue bonds in conjunction with other sources
of financing as needed for affordable housing projects.
Program 2: Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
The City will seek to gain funding for the development of affordable housing through the
LIHTC program. Investors receive a credit against federal tax owed in return for providing
funds to developers to build or renovate housing for low-income households. The capital
subsidy allows rents to be set below the cost of development and maintenance of the
property.
Under this program the City will continue to provide pre-development loans to nonprofit
developers, pro forma analysis through the City’s housing consultant, technical
assistance to nonprofit developers, and promotional venues. The City will continue to
assist in the preparation of pro forma analyses and/or providing prospective applicants
with demographic information. The City will promote the availability of housing
assistance funds to lower-income households and, as applicable, the local development
community through newsletters, City website and promotional brochures available at
various City departments and community locations. The City reports on a quarterly basis
on the availability of funding for new construction as well as all the other housing
programs.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division
Funding Source: California Tax Credit Allocation Committee
Objectives and Schedule: The City plans to use LIHTC in conjunction with other sources of
financing for affordable housing projects as individual projects are proposed.
Program 3: Density Bonus
The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance was revised in the spring of 2012 to comply with the
provisions of SB 1818, which will facilitate higher-density for developments that provide
affordable housing.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Planning Division
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: Continue to implement the Density Bonus Ordinance
throughout the planning period.

Program 4: Inclusionary Housing Program
The City’s inclusionary housing program requires that developers of three or more housing
units reserve 10% of the units for low-income households. The program includes the
following requirements.
      •     For-sale residential projects of three or more units must reserve 10 percent of
            the units as owner-occupied units affordable to low- and moderate-income
            households.
      •     An in-lieu fee option is available at the developer’s discretion. The
            methodology of calculating in-lieu fee has been updated to reflect a fee
            based upon square footage. In-lieu fees will be used to assist new construction
            consistent with the goals of the Housing Element.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division and Planning Division
Funding Source: Developer as condition of construction
Objective & Schedule: The City will continue to monitor and assess the Inclusionary
Program to determine if amendments are necessary in order to ensure that the overall
supply and cost of affordable housing is not unduly impacted.
Program 5: Facilitate New Affordable Housing Construction
As part of its direct financial contribution to affordable housing, the City previously set
aside 20% of tax increment revenues from the City’s redevelopment activities. Effective
February 1, 2012, redevelopment agencies were dissolved statewide. State legislation is
pending to preserve the City’s unallocated balance of set-aside funds.
While it must be recognized that local funding capacity for affordable housing has been
severely diminished by the dissolution of redevelopment agencies, the City will continue
to facilitate production of affordable housing, including units targeted to extremely-low-
income (ELI) households, through the following efforts:
    a. Provide administrative assistance upon request to developers seeking available
    state and federal funding and/or tax credits for the construction of low- and
    moderate-income housing;
    b. Facilitate projects that incorporate affordable units by granting modifications to
    development standards, expediting the review process, and/or providing financial
    incentives consistent with City regulations and state law;
    c. Contact affordable housing developers at least once each year to solicit interest
    and apprise them of available assistance programs; and
    d. Whenever feasible, provide targeted assistance for special needs housing and
    extremely-low-income (ELI) units will be provided through density bonuses and/or
    regulatory incentives, modified development standards and fee deferrals, whenever
    feasible. Establish an objective of 775 ELI units for the planning period, consistent with
    the City's regional fair share of such units.

In addition to these efforts, the City Council in January 2013 approved the following
amendments to the General Plan Land Use Element and zoning regulations in order to
reduce constraints and encourage affordable multi-family development:
    e. Amend the Land Use Element of the General Plan to modify the findings required
    to exceed base density in the non-coastal areas (coastal areas are exempt from
    these provisions);
    f. Increase the base density in the portions of the R-3 zone west of I-5 to 29 units/acre
    (up from 15 units/acre);
    g. Eliminate the current CUP requirement in non-coastal residential zones for projects
    exceeding base density when inclusionary housing requirements are satisfied through
    an option other than payment of in-lieu fees. Entitlement review for residential
    projects (culminating in Development Plan approval) focuses on conformance with
    development standards rather than examining the appropriateness of the use itself;
    and
    h. Provide additional incentives such as increased building height and reduced
    parking requirements for projects that provide affordable housing (in addition to
    Density Bonus incentives).
To further encourage affordable multi-family development, the following additional
zoning amendments will be initiated in 2013:
    i. Eliminate the CUP requirement for multi-family projects with 20 units or more in
    coastal areas, and limit required entitlements for such projects to normal Coastal
    Permits and Development Plan approvals, which focus on conformance with
    development standards rather than examining the appropriateness of the use itself.

developers, pro forma analysis through the City’s housing consultant, technical
assistance to nonprofit developers, and promotional venues. The City will continue to
assist in the preparation of pro forma analyses and/or providing prospective applicants
with demographic information. The City will promote the availability of housing
assistance funds to lower-income households and, as applicable, the local development
community through newsletters, City web site and promotional brochures available at
various City departments and community locations. The City reports on a quarterly basis
on the availability of funding for new construction as well as all the other housing
programs.
Funding Source: Section 202 Administrative Funds
Objectives and Schedule: While these funds will be difficult to obtain due to pending
federal budget cuts and the highly competitive nature of such projects, the City will
continue to pursue funding during the 2013 – 2021 Housing Element cycle.
Program 7: Accessory Dwelling Units
The City will continue to encourage accessory dwelling units as a source of affordable
housing opportunities, as mandated by California law. Zoning amendments will be
processed to ensure compliance with current state law (AB 1866). The zoning
amendment process will include a review of appropriate parking standards for accessory
units. The City will continue to promote the availability of accessory dwelling units through
newsletters, City web site and promotional brochures available at various City
departments and community locations. The City reports on a quarterly basis on the
progress of its various housing programs.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Planning Division
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: Process zoning amendments in 2012-13. The City expects
about 3-5 accessory units per year to be developed under this program.
Program 8: Farm Worker Housing
In conformance with the California Employee Housing Act, the City will amend zoning
regulations to allow farmworker housing with up to 36 beds or 12 units by-right in any
district where agriculture is a permitted use. The City will also continue to explore and
implement methods to facilitate the development of such housing through state farm
worker housing programs, including the following activities:
    a. Undertake a review of the development standards and permit processing
        procedures to determine how best to encourage and facilitate the development
        of housing for farm workers. This program will commence within 12 months of the
        adoption of the Housing Element. Methods may include providing fee waivers for
        the development of farm worker housing or partnering with a nonprofit to
        leverage funds for these types of projects.

    b. Work with service providers, nonprofits, and agricultural employers to identify sites
        or zones appropriate for the development of housing for farm workers. This step will
        be conducted in year two based upon the results of the review process with
        recommendations for City Council consideration at the end of this step.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division
Funding Source: State Farm Worker Housing funds
Objectives and Schedule: The City will amend zoning regulations in conformance with
the Employee Housing Act in 2013 and investigate options and opportunities as funds
and programs become available. This activity is reviewed by the City as part of its
quarterly housing program updates.
Program 9: Adequate Residential Sites to Accommodate the RHNA
While the City’s previous Housing Element indicated that meeting RHNA requirements for
the 2005-2010 planning period would require the rezoning of as much as 80 acres of land
to a high-density residential designation, it has since been determined that adequate
sites with appropriate zoning can accommodate the RHNA allocations for both the
previous and current Housing Element planning periods. This determination is based in
part on the fact that several of the City’s non-coastal commercial zoning designations
allow for housing in conjunction with mixed-use development, while commercial zones in
those portions of the City’s coastal zone not governed by the downtown zoning
ordinance allow exclusively residential development that achieves a minimum scale (i.e.
at least 20 dwelling units).
The City will continue to monitor its land inventory, especially residential land available for
multi-family development as well as commercial and redevelopment sites that may be
suitable for residential development. The City will continue to provide land use data,
including the residential component, to SANDAG as part of the regional growth forecast
process.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Planning Department
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: Continue to maintain adequate sites for new housing
development commensurate with the RHNA throughout the planning period.
Program 10: Transit Oriented Districts (TOD) and Smart Growth Focus Areas
The City will continue efforts to pursue smart growth improvement grants, state grants
and other funding sources to facilitate residential development in identified smart growth
concept areas and other appropriate smart growth areas in the City of Oceanside. As
funding and staff resources allow, the City will continue to pursue implementation
programs for the Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan, which calls for mixed-use
housing development within the Coast Highway commercial corridor.

Affordable housing development in these target areas will be enhanced through the
City’s expedited processing of lot mergers and development applications. Consolidation
of adjacent parcels to create unified development sites is a simple administrative review
process done concurrently with application review.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Planning Division
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: Seek available grant funding to facilitate TOD and smart
growth throughout the planning period.
Program 11: Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
a.             Permanent Emergency Shelters
New state legislation (SB 2) requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for
addressing the housing needs of the homeless, including the identification at least one
zone where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional
use permit. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the City will revise its current
regulations for emergency shelters as needed to comply with the provisions of SB 2. An
amendment to the Light Industrial (IL) zone regulations will be processed to permit
emergency shelters by-right subject only to the standards and requirements set forth in
Government Code Sec. 65583(a)(4).
b.             Temporary Winter Shelters
The City will waive the requirement of obtaining a Conditional Use Permit for churches to
shelter up to 50 persons during the winter shelter period defined by the Regional Alliance
for Solutions or the Neighborhood Services Director.
c.             Transitional and Supportive Housing
SB 2 defines transitional and supportive housing as residential uses that are subject only to
the same standards and procedures as apply to other residential uses of the same type
in the same zone. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the City will revise its
current regulations for transitional/supportive housing as needed to comply with the
provisions of SB 2.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services/Housing and Code
Enforcement Division and Planning Departments
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: Amend zoning regulations in conformance with SB 2 within
one year of Housing Element adoption.
Program 12: Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
The City will continue to apply to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) for local allocations of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, which
provide rent subsidies to low income residents. Under the Section 8 program, most
                                             V-9                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                         V. Housing Action Plan
tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent. The remainder – the difference
between what the tenant pays and the actual rent – is paid directly to the landlord by
the public housing agency. The City does not anticipate receiving any additional
Section 8 Housing Choice vouchers during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle.
Although the City will continue to administer its housing vouchers, the City’s ability to
expand or even maintain this program at its current level is dependent upon the annual
Federal budget process. Recent indications from HUD are that Federal support for
Section 8 will not be expanded and that program retrenchment is likely over the next
several years.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division
Funding Source: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Objectives and Schedule: Seek federal funding for Section 8 vouchers as part of ongoing
housing program activities throughout the planning period.
Program 13: Manufactured Home Rental Adjustment Program
The City will continue to consider petitions from mobile home park residents regarding
rent increases by the Mobile Home Fair Practices Commission as empowered by
ordinance. The City currently administers this program for approximately 19 mobile home
parks (a total of 3,436 units.)
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Division
Funding Source: Park Registration fees and General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: The City anticipates that it will continue to average about 17
applications per year under this program and make special adjustments in two to three
cases per year. This program is an ongoing activity that the City will continue to
implement throughout the planning period.
Program 14: Coastal Zone Replacement Housing
The City will continue its existing coastal zone program, which requires the replacement
of any units occupied by low- and moderate-income households lost through demolition.
The emphasis of this program will be on retention of affordable units with replacement
(Government Code 65590) on a unit-by-unit basis when removal cannot be avoided.
Implementing Agency: City of Oceanside Neighborhood Services Department/Housing
and Code Enforcement Division; Planning Division
Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives and Schedule: The City does not anticipate that any units will be lost during
both coastal zone and redevelopment agency activities during the 2013-2021 Housing
Element cycle.

The City will continue to attempt to acquire, or assist nonprofits in acquiring, buildings in
need of rehabilitation. The buildings will be rehabilitated and rented/sold to low-income
households. The City will continue to identify priority areas, provide NOFA and pro forma
evaluation and assistance, and enter into development partnerships. An example of this
effort is the development of the La Mision project that was completed in concert with
SoCal Housing. Under this program the City will continue to assist nonprofit developers
with pre-development loans, pro forma analysis through the City’s housing consultant,
technical assistance, promotional venues and demographic information. The City will
promote the availability of housing assistance funds to lower-income households and, as
applicable, the local development community through newsletters, City web site and
promotional brochures available at various City departments and community locations.
The City reports on a quarterly basis on the availability of funding for new construction as
well as all the other housing programs.

Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review of the housing goals, policies, and programs of
the previous housing element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period. This analysis also includes an
assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this
evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing
Implementation Program.

                              address one of the impediments identified in the
                              “Analysis of Impediments” Study completed in

                              has to do with the definition of family in the zoning
                              code. The City addressed that issue as part of an
                              update to its City Code during the past year. The
                              City no longer regulates residential land use by
                              discriminating between biologically related and

                              together as a single housekeeping unit in a
                              dwelling unit, provided that this shall not exclude
                              the renting of rooms in a dwelling unit as permitted
                              by district regulations.”
                         4. New state legislation (SB 2) went into effect January
                              1, 2008. This legislation requires local jurisdictions
                              to strengthen provisions for addressing the
                              housing needs of the homeless, including the
                              identification a zone or zones where emergency
                              shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a
                              conditional use permit. The City also must identify
                              a zone or zones that can accommodate at least
                              one year-round emergency shelter. The City will
                              revise its current provisions for emergency and
                              transitional housing for any potential constraints
                              including placing such housing within the
                              residential zoning categories (RM and RH) and
                              defining the related procedures and processing
                              comparable to the other residential categories and

                                      Land Inventory
This appendix provides an analysis of potential sites for housing development during the
current RHNA projection period (2010 – 2020), as well as an analysis of whether a RHNA
carryover from the previous planning period is necessary.
Government Code Section 65583.2(c) requires that local jurisdictions determine their
realistic capacity for new housing growth by means of a parcel-level analysis of land
resources with the potential to accommodate residential uses. The analysis of potential
to accommodate new housing growth considered physical and regulatory constraints,
including: lot area and configuration, environmental factors (e.g. slope, sensitive habitat,
flood risk), allowable density, and other development standards such as parking
requirements and building height limits. This analysis demonstrates sufficient capacity to
accommodate a jurisdiction’s regional fair share of new housing growth, as determined
by the RHNA with special attention to the very-low- and low-income segments.
The housing sites inventory includes both vacant and underutilized land with the
potential for additional housing development or redevelopment during the current
Housing Element cycle. The analysis of non-vacant properties included only those
properties with realistic potential for additional development or “recycling”, in light of: 1)
existing uses on the site; 2) prevailing market conditions; 3) recent development trends;
and 4) regulatory and/or other incentives to encourage recycling or intensification of
existing development.
Background
More than 125 years after its incorporation, the City of Oceanside has little vacant land
inventory remaining to accommodate new housing growth. With most of its 43 square
miles either developed or precluded from development due to sensitive habitat, steep
slopes, and/or significant flood risk, the following factors act to severely limit the City’s
land resources available for new “greenfield” housing development:
    •   More than three-quarters of the roughly 500 acres of vacant land zoned for estate
        residential uses is designated as protected habitat.
    •   Following the recent development of the Morro Hills Master Plan Area, fewer than
        100 acres of vacant property remain available for small-lot single-family
        development. Scattered throughout the City, much of this vacant property is
        constrained by steep slopes and watersheds.
    •   More than two-thirds of the roughly 100 acres of vacant land zoned for medium-
        density residential uses is either designated as protected habitat or situated on
        steep slopes.
    •   High-density residential zoning is largely confined to the City’s coastal areas and
        commercial corridors. About 40 acres of vacant land remains available for high-
        density housing development. While this would yield about 1,200 multi-family
        housing units, which represents a significant percentage of the City’s RHNA
        allocation, it should be emphasized that SANDAG assumed that potential
                                              B-1                                    April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                      Appendix B – Land Inventory
        redevelopment of underutilized properties would provide the majority of sites to
        accommodate the lower-income RHNA allocation.
     •  Nearly one-quarter of the City’s total land area is zoned for agricultural use.
        Situated in the northeastern quadrant of the City, this agricultural area allows for
        residential development at a maximum density of one dwelling unit per 2.5 acres.
        Conversion of these areas to higher-density residential use would not be consistent
        with smart growth planning principles because it is not located near transit or
        significant employment opportunities, and would further reduce the state’s
        shrinking supply of agricultural land.
The City’s coastal areas (west of Interstate 5), along with the Capistrano, Loma Alta and
Fire Mountain neighborhoods immediately to the east, have been largely developed
since the 1950s. The San Luis Rey Valley and the Highway 78 corridor experienced
substantial growth in the 1960s and ‘70s, while farmland in central portions of the City
(including Rancho del Oro) was transformed into housing tracts, strip commercial centers
and business parks during the 1980s and ‘90s. In the first decade of the new century, the
City saw what will likely be the final example of large-scale greenfield housing
development in Oceanside, with several hundred single-family homes built in the Morro
Hills Master Plan Area.
The dwindling of greenfield housing opportunities in Oceanside is illustrated by
population growth statistics for the past 40 years. Between 1970 and 1980, the City’s
population grew by nearly 90 percent. During the 1980s, the City’s population increased
by more than 67 percent. Between 1990 and 2000, population growth in Oceanside
slowed significantly, with the City registering only a 25 percent increase. In the first
decade of the new century, the City’s population grew by less than four percent – with
the City adding only 6,000 new residents. By comparison, between 2000 and 2010, the
nearby cities of Carlsbad and San Marcos, both of which maintain large inventories of
vacant land, experienced population increases of 52 and 34 percent, respectively. The
population of San Diego County increased by roughly 10 percent over this same period.
Further constraining greenfield housing growth in Oceanside is the City’s need to expand
its limited employment base. Evolving over the past half-century as a bedroom
community in the far northwestern corner of San Diego County with comparatively
affordable housing, the City now finds itself with one of the lowest percentages of jobs to
housing units in the San Diego region, furnishing fewer than 0.7 jobs for every dwelling. To
address this jobs/housing imbalance, the City has been encouraging manufacturing,
assembly, research and development, and other high-employment land uses in its
industrial zones and business parks, as well as the growth of its hospitality sector in both
the coastal area and near El Corazon – 450 acres of open space in the City’s core now
being developed as a regional recreational facility. The City’s future fiscal health
depends upon the growth of its employment base, and thus the City is committed to
maintaining its existing inventory of commercial and industrial land.
Focal Points for Future Housing Growth
With no adjacent unincorporated land available for annexation, and with regional
planning policies discouraging sprawl and encouraging more efficient use of already-
developed areas, the City expects to augment its housing stock primarily through infill
                                               B-2                                   April 2013

and redevelopment both within and adjacent to the commercial corridors of Coast
Highway, Mission Avenue, Oceanside Boulevard, and Vista Way, where zoning allows for
high-density housing in conjunction with mixed-use development, and, in the case of
Coast Highway, through exclusively residential projects with a minimum of 20 units.
In the City’s former Downtown
Redevelopment         Area,     centered
around the intersection of Mission
Avenue and Coast Highway, high-
density housing is becoming an
increasingly attractive option for
property owners and developers
looking to capitalize on the area’s
proximity to the beach and other
attractions, including the Oceanside
Pier, the Oceanside Small-Craft Harbor,
the Oceanside Museum of Art, and the
California Surf Museum. With the
exception of a limited number of
properties reserved for professional
office and tourist-serving commercial
uses, nearly all of the downtown area
allows for high-density housing. Well-
served     by    public     transit   and
increasingly supportive of active
transportation due to improvements
prioritized in the City’s Pedestrian
Master Plan and Bicycle Master Plan,
the City’s downtown area and
commercial           corridors        can
accommodate much of the City’s
future housing growth without major
expansion of infrastructure and without
compromising the City’s agricultural
and environmental resources. In turn,
the proliferation of residential uses in
these commercial areas is expected to
enhance the viability of the retail and
service sectors and promote greater
synergy among commercial uses.
Although the City can no longer rely
primarily on greenfield residential
development to meet its future housing
needs, the housing sites inventory
prepared for the 2013-2021 planning
period demonstrates that sufficient
land resources exist within the City’s       Underutilized sites in the Coast Highway corridor
                                            B-3                                        April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                      Appendix B – Land Inventory
already-urbanized areas to accommodate its RHNA share of 2,727 lower-income housing
units. This inventory identifies a range of vacant and underutilized properties with high-
density residential and commercial zoning that together have a capacity for nearly 4,000
new housing units under relatively conservative density assumptions.
More than 900 of the roughly 1,700 existing income-restricted housing units in Oceanside
are located within one-quarter mile of rail and/or high-frequency bus service, and the
City continues to seek out transit-oriented sites for future affordable housing
development. Mission Cove, a 288-unit family and senior affordable housing project now
being developed through a public-private partnership between the City and National
Community Renaissance, will be served by high-frequency bus service (North County
Transit District’s 303 Breeze). The addition of Mission Cove and other affordable and
market-rate housing projects along the City’s transit corridors are expected to spur
greater demand for transit, which in turn is expected to lead to even more convenient
and cost-effective service. This reciprocity between the City’s evolving land use patterns
and its increasingly multimodal transportation system exemplifies a sustainable approach
to meeting Oceanside’s future housing needs, consistent with state and regional Smart
Growth policies as well as the City’s General Plan, which calls for housing to be
“developed in areas with adequate access to employment opportunities, community
facilities, and public services.” Prepared with smart and sustainable growth patterns in
mind, the housing sites inventory for the 2013-2021 planning period demonstrates that
new housing growth in Oceanside over this eight-year period will largely conform to
these patterns, due to the fact that much of the City’s vacant and underutilized land lies
within transit-served areas where high-density housing is permitted by zoning and
encouraged by state, regional, and local policies.
Methodology and Guiding Assumptions
Recognizing that the California Department of Housing and Community Development
maintains a high standard of review for candidate sites that are neither vacant nor more
than one acre in size, the City prepared and implemented a rigorous protocol in its
assessment of properties considered for inclusion in the housing sites inventory. The sites
zoned for residential use are primarily vacant sites, while most of the non-vacant
properties in the inventory are situated in commercial zones that allow high-density
housing as a component of mixed-use development and/or as a stand-alone use.
Although many of the underutilized commercial sites are less than one acre in size, most
are contiguous with other sites with similar redevelopment potential, and City policies to
facilitate consolidation of adjacent parcels are included in the Housing Plan (see
Program 10). In some cases, these sites collectively comprise entire commercial blocks
with marginal land uses and/or development patterns. Along with vacant residential
sites, underutilized commercial sites are a key component of the housing sites inventory,
consistent with the City’s goal of revitalizing its commercial corridors through the
introduction of a robust residential component.
Beginning with close scrutiny of housing capacity maps prepared by the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) in support of its 2050 Regional Growth Forecast,
and centered on a multi-faceted analysis of development constraints and opportunities,
the site assessment process resulted in an inventory of sites with a collective capacity to
                                             B-4                                     April 2013

accommodate more than 3,700 new housing units at densities of at least 29 units per
acre. The protocol for site assessment involved the following tasks:
    •   Review of maps and aerial photography
            o   Housing capacity maps (SANDAG 2050 Regional Forecast)
            o   Zoning and land use maps
            o   Aerial photography (CityGIS, Bing Maps, Google Earth)
            o   FEMA flood zone panels
            o   Topographic surveys
            o   Habitat conservation maps
            o   California Water Resources Control Board Geotracker
    •   Evaluation of multiple sources of property data
            o   SanGIS parcel data
            o   RealQuest parcel data
            o   City entitlement records
    •   Field assessment
            o   Evaluation of existing conditions
            o   Calculation of proximity to key amenities
            o   Consideration of aggregation potential
    •   Discussion with City staff in Engineering, Public Works, Water Utilities and other
        disciplines
            o   Availability of infrastructure
            o   Presence of easements and/or other physical constraints
    •   Evaluation of the City’s land use and transportation policies
            o   Coast Highway Vision and Strategic Plan
            o   Oceanside Boulevard Vision Statement
            o   Circulation Element Update
Each of the potential housing sites identified on the SANDAG housing capacity maps
were cross-referenced on the City’s land use and zoning maps to confirm high-density
housing as a permitted land use. Sites zoned for high-density residential uses were then
viewed on aerial photography to verify street access, existing land use, and lot
dimensions. Potential development constraints were then identified through analysis of
subdivision maps, FEMA flood panels, topographic surveys, the City’s draft Subarea
Habitat Conservation Plan, and the “Geotracker” mapping application used by the
California Water Resources Control Board to identify sites contaminated by hazardous
materials. Sites not constrained by restrictive easements, flood risk, extreme slope,
sensitive habitat, or hazardous materials contamination were then evaluated in terms of
                                               B-5                                   April 2013

their ripeness for development (in the case of vacant sites) or recycling (in the case of
non-vacant sites).
As part of its evaluation of the likelihood of non-vacant sites recycling with high-density
housing, staff calculated the ratio of assessed land value to assessed improvement
value; except in a few instances where assessed values appear to be in conflict with
current market conditions, those sites where assessed improvement values were greater
than the assessed land value were removed from the inventory.
Non-vacant sites were further filtered on the basis of: 1) existing residential development
less than half the allowable maximum; and 2) potential for additional commercial floor
area above an FAR of 0.33. Non-vacant residential sites unable to accommodate at
least a doubling of density as well as those sites with existing commercial floor area ratios
at or above 0.33 were removed from the inventory.
Both vacant and non-vacant sites were evaluated on their capacity to accommodate
at least 16 dwelling units, either independently or through aggregation with abutting sites
with similar development or recycling potential. Sites that cannot accommodate 16
dwelling units either independently or through aggregation with qualified abutting sites
were removed from the inventory.
In its assessment of both the capacity and ripeness of candidate sites for new housing
development, City staff was guided by several key assumptions, which, applied
together, reveal the likelihood of each candidate site contributing new units to the City’s
housing stock during the 2013-2021 planning period. Candidate sites that survived the
vetting process conformed to the following key assumptions:
     •  The bulk of the City’s future housing growth over the next decade will occur within
        and immediately adjacent to its existing commercial corridors (i.e., Coast
        Highway, Oceanside Boulevard, Mission Avenue, Vista Way);
     •  In the absence of significant environmental and/or regulatory constraints, virtually
        all remaining vacant land under residential zoning will be developed within the
        next decade;
     •  Non-vacant properties can be categorized as underutilized, and thus ripe for
        redevelopment, when all of the following conditions exist:
            o  Existing residential density is less than 50 percent of the maximum allowable
               density;
            o  Existing commercial floor area ratio is less than 0.33;
            o  Assessed land value is greater than assessed improvement value;
            o  Capacity for at least 16 dwelling units, either on the individual site or in
               combination with adjacent sites with similar development potential.
     •  Sites with the following environmental, logistic, and/or regulatory constraints were
        excluded from the inventory:
            o  Lack of street access;
            o  Lack of electrical service and natural gas supply;
                                                 B-6                                     April 2013

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                           Appendix B – Land Inventory
           o    Lack of water and sewer service;
           o    Presence of restrictive access or utility easements;
           o    Hillside conditions, where portions of the property have a natural gradient
                in excess of 20 percent with an elevation differential of 25 feet or more;
           o    High risk of flood hazard (i.e., located within a federally-designated
                floodway);
           o    Soil contamination, as determined by the California Water Resources
                Control Board;
           o    Presence of sensitive wildlife habitat, as determined by the North County
                Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Program;
           o    Presence of significant historic resources, as identified by the California
                Office of Historic Preservation and/or the National Register of Historic
                Places;
    •   New high-density housing should be encouraged on sites within a quarter-mile
        radius of the following amenities:
           o    Rail or high-frequency bus service;
           o    Pedestrian and bicycle facilities, as identified in the City’s Pedestrian Master
                Plan and Bicycle Master Plan;
           o    Public parks and recreational facilities (including the beach);
           o    Grocery stores;
           o    Public health facilities;
           o    Elementary schools.
The site assessment methodology outlined above – crafted and implemented under
conservative assumptions regarding the potential of each candidate site to
develop/recycle with high-density housing – has produced an inventory of sites most
likely to accommodate new affordable housing over the 2013-2021 planning period. The
analysis demonstrated that these inventoried sites are not only ripe for development of
high-density housing, but that they collectively represent a smart and sustainable growth
pattern for both market-rate and affordable housing – a growth pattern that avoids
sprawl, preserves natural resources, encourages efficient use of existing infrastructure,
and contributes to transit ridership and active transportation. With its emphasis on high-
density infill housing along the City’s transit corridors, the sites inventory supports energy
conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as called for in the
California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) and related state policies and
regulations.
RHNA Carryover from the Previous Planning Period
State law18 requires that any portion of the housing need from the previous planning
period that was not accommodated must be carried over to the next planning period. In
   Government Code Sec. 65584.09

City of Oceanside 2013-2021 Housing Element                                Appendix B – Land Inventory
2009 the City adopted its Housing Element for the 2005-2010 planning period, which was
found by HCD to be in compliance with state law. The 2005-2010 Housing Element
included a commitment to rezone at least 105 acres to a zoning district allowing 29
units/acre to accommodate the regional housing need of 2,496 lower-income units by
June 2010 (Program 9). As described below, it was subsequently determined that no
rezoning was required and therefore no carryover is necessary because adequate sites
were available to fully accommodate the lower-income RHNA in the previous planning
period.
Suitability of 29 units/acre to facilitate affordable housing. Under state law, the “default
density” for most jurisdictions in urban counties is 30 units/acre. Default density refers to
the density considered suitable to encourage and facilitate the development of
affordable housing. State law also provides that an alternate density may be deemed
suitable depending on local circumstances.
A recent study by Keyser Marston Associates (KMA) 19 examined the relative cost and
financial feasibility of affordable housing development at different densities in San Diego
County. The study reviewed recently completed affordable housing developments and
also compared three prototype multi-family development types at densities of 20, 24 and
30 units/acre in order to compare development feasibility at different densities.
KMA found that most recent affordable housing developments built from 2009 to the
present in San Diego County had densities between 15 and 29 units/acre. In addition,
KMA’s analysis of multi-family prototypes concluded that the most feasible development
type was garden apartments at a density of 24 units/acre. The prototype of 30 units/acre
was found to be the least feasible of the three prototypes analyzed. The primary reason
that a density of less than 30 units/acre was found to be most feasible was the higher
cost of taller buildings and structure parking compared to surface parking.
KMA confirmed that real estate development conditions in Oceanside, especially east of
Interstate 5, are expected to be similar to those in other portions of San Diego County 20.
The KMA analysis supports the City’s determination that allowable densities in Oceanside
are appropriate to facilitate the production of affordable housing, which is further
supported by recent affordable housing developments in the City such as Mission Cove
(21 units/acre), La Mision (26 units/acre) and the Portola project (20 units/acre).
Lower-Income Housing Need in the Previous RHNA Cycle. The RHNA allocation for
Oceanside in the previous planning period was 6,423 units, with 2,496 of those in the very-
low and low income categories as shown in Table B-1.

As noted in Table A-4, 1,295 affordable units were completed during the previous
planning period, of which 493 were deed-restricted for very-low- or low-income
households. Subtracting these completed units from the total lower-income RHNA leaves
a net lower-income RHNA of 2,003 units.
Inventory of Sites for Lower-Income Housing. State law requires that the City analyze the
capacity of sites that were available for lower-income housing during the previous
planning period. The current sites inventory described in Tables B-7 through B-9 is the
appropriate reference point for this analysis because the General Plan and zoning land
use regulations have remained constant for these sites from May 2009 to the present.
In May 2009 it was determined that the City’s 1986 Zoning Ordinance was still in effect for
the Coastal Zone (rather than the 1992 Zoning Ordinance) because the 1992 ordinance
had not been ratified by the Coastal Commission. As a result, the zoning and
development standards contained in the 1986 ordinance regulated development from
May 2009 through the end of the previous Housing Element planning period (April 2013).
The 1986 ordinance provides significantly greater development potential than the 1992
ordinance in the following respects:
    •   35-foot height limit for all residential development (as opposed to a 27-foot height
        maximum under the 1992 ordinance)
    •   Allowance of a third story in the R-3 and R-T zoning districts (as opposed to a two-
        story limit under the 1992 ordinance)
    •   Allowance of mixed-use densities up to 43 units/acre in the C2 district, which
        encompasses all portions of Coast Hwy outside of the Downtown District (as
        opposed to a maximum mixed-use density of 29 units/acre under the 1992
        ordinance)
    •   Allowance for high-rise structures (with no specified height limit) through a CUP
        process in all coastal commercial and residential zones located outside of the
        Downtown District (where no such allowance existed under the 1992 ordinance)
From May 2009 forward, all of the vacant and underutilized sites listed in Tables B-7
through B-9 were available with the realistic capacities indicated. These tables are
annotated to indicate the parcels that were affected by the reinstatement of the 1986
ordinance. The total realistic capacity of these sites exceeds the capacity needed to
accommodate the previous remaining lower-income RHNA, therefore no carryover is
necessary. At the present time the City has no intentions of pursuing Coastal Commission
certification of the 1992 Zoning Ordinance, since the 1986 ordinance is more consistent
with current plans and policies, such as the Coast Highway Vision Plan, as well as City’s
efforts to improve its jobs/housing balance.
Pending Projects
Table B-2 summarizes projects that are currently in the review process. The Mission Cove
project proposes 288 units that will be deed-restricted for very-low-income households.

Realistic Capacity. The sites inventory assumes a typical density of 35 units/acre in zones
where the maximum allowable density is 43 units/acre. This assumption of only 81 percent
of allowable density is very conservative in view of the fact that several recent projects
have achieved a density at the maximum 43 units/acre. The realistic capacity for sites
with a maximum density of 29 units/acre has been conservatively assumed to be 25
units/acre (86 percent of maximum density, excluding density bonus). Properties within
the Oceanside Boulevard, Vista Way, and Mission Avenue corridors have a density
allowance of up to 29 dwelling units per acre in conjunction with mixed-use
development. As seen in the table below, there is a growing precedent for mixed-use in
both the downtown area and along the Vista Way corridor: several mixed-use projects in
the downtown area have been built or entitled in recent years, with residential densities
up to the maximum 43 units/acre; and the recently completed Piazza d’Oro
development at Vista Way and Rancho del Oro Drive integrates rental housing with retail
and office uses. Recent conversations with local real estate experts as well as inquiries
from developers confirm a strong interest in high-density residential development along
the City’s commercial corridors.

As noted previously, the inventory of underutilized sites presented in Table B-9 represents
only those sites with the greatest potential for residential development in the planning
period. The land inventory summary below shows that even with conservative
assumptions, the capacity of sites for lower-income housing exceeds the remaining
RHNA by over 900 units, or about 40 percent. In order to further ensure the availability of
adequate sites throughout the planning period, Program 25 in the Housing Action Plan
(Chapter V) includes a no net loss provision to monitor development and identify
additional sites if potential development capacity were to fall below the remaining
RHNA allocation.
Conclusion
Table B-6 summarizes the City’s land inventory for the 2013-2021 planning period. The
table shows that adequate sites are available with appropriate zoning to accommodate
the RHNA for the planning period.

                            Public Participation Summary
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a Land
Use Plan which determines the extent and density of future residential development in
the community.”
City residents and other interested stakeholders had many opportunities to recommend
strategies, review, and comment on the Housing Element update. Early in the update
process, two public workshops were held by the Planning Commission and Housing
Commission to solicit concerns and recommendations from members of the community.
Those workshops were widely advertised through flyers (both Englsh and Spanish) posted
on the City website, in City Hall, public libraries, and at the Oceanside Farmers Market
(see Figures C-1 and C-2). Public meeting notices were also published in the North
County Times, and sent by direct mail and/or email to a list of interested parties, service
providers, and organizations having an interest in housing and special needs issues (see
Table C-1).
Subsequent to review of the element by the Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD), additional public hearings were held by the Planning Commission,
Housing Commission and City Council. Representatives from organizations and groups
interested in affordable housing and special needs were again invited to participate in
the public hearings via notices sent by direct mail and posted on the City website.
A summary of public comments and how those comments were addressed in the
Housing Element is provided in Table C-2.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update.

What is an “emergency shelter”?                      An emergency shelter is a year-round facility as
                                                     opposed to a temporary shelter such as may
                                                     be set up during a natural disaster. Emergency
                                                     shelters are intended to provide short-term
                                                     housing for homeless persons, and may not turn
                                                     persons away due to inability to pay. Shelter
                                                     occupancy is typically limited to 6 months.
                                                     The Housing Element includes an analysis of

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
1. INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element provides goals, objectives, and policies to maintain
and improve the City of Oceanside’s (the “City”) transportation system and
enhance travel choices for current and future residents, visitors, and workers.
These policies are complemented by the policies in the Land Use, Noise,
Recreational Trails, and Community Facility Elements on related topics such
as smart growth and management of public space. Recognizing the
relationship between transportation and these related topics is critical to
improving mobility and accessibility within the city.
The Circulation Element was last adopted by City Council in 1995. It has had
some amendments in response to the changes in the City’s land uses and
network necessities. The Circulation Element was also reformatted and
additional information added in 2002.
The present challenges, opportunities, and transportation issues of interest to
the City are addressed in this element. These include but are not limited to:
     •   Enhancing the City’s corridors for all modes of transportation;
     •   Increasing bicycle and pedestrian connections, routes and facilities;
     •   Refining the City’s traffic calming program to promote safer streets for
         motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists;
     •   Identifying and incorporating Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
         technology for the City;
     •   Increasing support of Transportation Demand Management programs;
         and
     •   Improving the efficiency of the existing transportation system.
The City of Oceanside is served by a diverse circulation system consisting of
roadways, public transit, rail service, airport, and pedestrian and bicycle
facilities. A well-balanced and multimodal transportation system is considered
integral to the City’s efforts to sustain and enhance the quality of life and key
to its future economic growth. Achieving such a system requires integrating
land use and transportation planning, and implementing a range of
improvements that enhance connectivity, livability, and vitality.

1.1      Purpose and Authority
The following is a list of the statutory requirements for a General Plan
Circulation Element.
Government         Requirements
Code Section
§65302(b)          The general plan requires the inclusion of a circulation element.
§65302(b)          A circulation element shall consist of the general location and
                   extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
                   transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports,
                   and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the
                   land use element of the plan.
§65302(b)(2)(A)    Commencing January 1, 2011, upon any substantive revision of
                   the circulation element, the legislative body shall modify the
                   circulation element to plan for a balanced, multimodal
                   transportation network that meets the needs for all users of
                   streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in a
                   manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of
                   the general plan.
The Circulation Element shall contain objectives, policies, principles, plan
proposals, and/or standards for planning the infrastructure to support the
circulation of people, goods, energy, water, sewage, storm drainage, and
communications. Mandatory circulation element issues as defined in Statute
65302(b) include: major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any
military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities.
Additionally, Statue 65302(b)(2)(A) requires the Circulation Element be
modified to plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets
the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways. The statute defines “all
users of streets, roads, and highways” as “bicyclists, children, persons with
disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users of
public transportation, and seniors.”              Transportation networks should
additionally consider pedestrian, bicycle, and transit routes, which may not
always be located on or along streets, roads, and highways.
Circulation elements should also take into consideration the provision of safe
and convenient travel that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context
of the local jurisdiction’s General Plan. This could include policies and
implementation measures for both retrofitting and developing streets to serve
multiple modes of travel and the development of multimodal transportation
network design standards based on street types.

                                                                                   CIRCULATION
                                                                                       ELEMENT
1.2    Scope and Content
The Master Transportation Plan, as Chapter 3 in this element, serves as the
Circulation Element’s main policy tool for designating future road
improvements, extensions, and special intersection design treatments.
The Circulation Element shall also:
    •  Identify the transportation needs and issues within the City and those
       regional relationships that affect the City’s transportation system.
    •  Establish goals for the element with objectives and policies to attain
       those goals.
    •  Describe the proposed circulation system in terms of geometric design
       elements, operating characteristics, and limits of operation including
       current standards, guidelines, and accepted criteria for the location,
       design, and operation of the transportation system.
    •  Consider transportation modes such as carpools, buses, and mass
       transit as essential in providing services and access to facilities.
    •   Establish policies that coordinate the circulation system with planned
        land uses and provide direction for future decision making in the
        realization of the Circulation Element goals.
1.3    Related Plans and Programs
There are several existing plans and programs prepared by various agencies
that are directly applicable to the aims and objectives of the Circulation
Element. These plans and programs have been enacted through federal,
State, and local legislation and are administered by agencies with powers to
enforce federal, State, and local laws. Plans and programs related to the
Circulation Element include the following:
CITY OF OCEANSIDE 2008 BICYCLE MASTER PLAN UPDATE
                     This study is a comprehensive update of the 1995 City of
                     Oceanside General Plan Circulation Element –
                     Recreational Trails Element (Chapter 6, Bicycle Facilities).
                     The Bicycle Master Plan’s goals and objectives include
                     establishing facility types to be implemented and
                     identifying points where the City’s bikeway system could
                     integrate with the existing San Diego County regional
                     bikeway system.
                     The Bicycle Master Plan seeks to maximize the efficiencies
offered by multimodal connections between mass transit and bikeways, and to
promote a viable alternative to automobile travel in a climate particularly

2030 SAN DIEGO REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN: PATHWAYS
FOR THE FUTURE
The 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is based on the adopted
General Plans of the region’s cities and the County. Developed by the San
Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and approved in 2007, the
2030 San Diego RTP was developed to meet the region’s long-term mobility
needs, better connect transportation and land use policy decisions, and create
a transportation network that will serve the people of this region well into the
21st century. The 2030 RTP’s vision for improving mobility and travel in the
San Diego region supports the region’s strategy to promote smarter, more
sustainable growth.
2050 SAN DIEGO REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN
The 2050 Regional Transportation Plan is the blueprint for the regional
transportation system that further enhances the quality of life, promotes
sustainability, and offers more mobility options for people and goods. The
SANDAG board of directors has adopted a Hybrid Scenario for the preferred
revenue constrained transportation network scenario for the 2050 RTP. The
Hybrid Scenario contains a variety of multimodal projects from the initial
alternative Revenue Constrained Scenarios, with a primary focus on the
Highway Emphasis and Fusion Scenarios. The 2050 RTP was approved by
SANDAG in October 2011.
RIDING TO 2050, SAN DIEGO REGIONAL BICYCLE PLAN
The San Diego Regional Bicycle Plan was adopted to provide a regional

SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT REGIONAL AIR
QUALITY STRATEGY (2009)
The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (the “District”) is
responsible for the overall development and implementation of the Regional
Air Quality Strategy (RAQS). The RAQS for the San Diego region control
measures focus on emission sources under the District’s authority, specifically
stationary emission sources and some area-wide sources. The emission
inventories and emission projects in the RAQS reflect the impact of all
emission sources and all control measures including those under the
jurisdiction of the California Air Resources Board (e.g., on-road motor
vehicles, off-road vehicles and equipment, and consumer products) and the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (e.g., aircraft, ships, trains, and pre-
empted off-road equipment).
CITY OF OCEANSIDE THOROUGHFARE FEE ORDINANCE
The purpose of Thoroughfare Fee Ordinance No. 83-01 is to make provisions
for assessing and collecting fees as a condition of approval of a final
subdivision or parcel map, or as a condition of issuing a building permit that
will result in an increase in average daily trips for the purpose of defraying the
actual or estimated costs of constructing or improving existing bridges or
thoroughfares.
CITY OF OCEANSIDE TRAFFIC SIGNAL FEE ORDINANCE
The purpose of the Traffic Signal Fee Ordinance is to provide a fair
mechanism for defraying public costs associated with the actual or estimated
cost of construction of traffic signals pursuant to the requirements of
Government Code §66000 et seq. and §66484, and Public Resources Code
§21000 et seq., and Oceanside City Ordinance No. 87-19.
1.4     Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
In accordance with State planning law, the Circulation Element, although
independent, must be consistent with the other General Plan elements. All
elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals
and policies of each element may also address issues that are the major
subject of other elements. The Circulation Element relates most closely to the
Land Use, Noise, Environmental Resource Management, Recreational Trails,
and Community Facilities Elements.
Planned development identified in the Land Use Element is the basis for
determining future road improvements and connections; therefore, the Land
Use Element is directly linked to the Circulation Element. For example, the
circulation policies and plans identify the improvements to the roadway system
that will be required in order to serve traffic generated by the uses permitted in

                                                                                      ELEMENT
the Land Use Element. In addition, the Circulation Element promotes
alternative transportation modes to minimize the regional impacts of planned
local development.
The Noise Element contains policies and plans aimed to ease the adverse
effects of noise on the community that are directly attributable to the future
transportation plans contained in the Circulation Element. Noise exposure is
generally a key consideration when locating and designing new development
along arterials and other transportation related networks.
The Environmental Resource Management and Recreational Trail Elements
(a sub-element of this Circulation Element) contain provisions for the
preservation of natural areas and non-vehicular transportation. Many open
space areas are reserved for the public benefit, such as parks. The circulation
system also contains provisions and standards for movement of non-
motorized traffic, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians. Open
space areas are often interconnected with other land uses through the
utilization of trails for the exclusive use by non-motorized traffic.
The Community Facilities Element provides a comprehensive listing of all
public facilities (which includes the transportation network) that are needed to
meet a certain service level demanded by the population. With population
growth and given development patterns, the circulation system is evaluated
and the potential impacts on the transportation facilities are identified.
Therefore, improvements to the circulation system are planned as a means of
accommodating new growth and eliminating future deficiencies.

2. LONG RANGE POLICY DIRECTION
The following is a brief description of the potential issues in the circulation
system that must be considered in order to achieve the overall goals and
objectives of the Circulation Element.
                                                                                      CHAPTER
1.  The City of Oceanside has several older residential neighborhoods and            HIGHLIGHTS
    areas with small businesses that are located near existing roadways that
    are exposed to moderate noise levels. In new areas of development,             • Create a
    these concerns are being addressed through the use of perimeter walls            Multimodal
    such as sound walls. However, walls are not always the most feasible             System within
    noise control measure. There must be intermittent openings allowed for           the City of
    driveway access, line-of-sight viewing for motorists, and pedestrian             Oceanside
    access. Therefore, roadway improvements must critically examine
    various secondary noise control options (speed limits, truck exclusion,        • Incorporate
    residential relocation, conversion to less sensitive land uses, landscaping,     Complete
    etc.). In certain areas, a buffer zone with increased setback areas may          Streets into the
    be needed.                                                                       City of
                                                                                     Oceanside’s
2.  In order to create a more coordinated and efficient roadway system, some         Transportation
    roadway extensions and upgrades have been recommended which will go              Network
    through residential areas, agricultural areas, or environmentally sensitive
    areas. Prior to adoption of a final roadway alignment, thorough
    environmental/engineering studies should be conducted. The decision to
    commence with roadway construction should occur only when the level of
    service on the road and/or at nearby intersections is expected to degrade
    to an unacceptable level by a proposed development and warrants the
    construction of the roadway. In some cases, the level of service of
    intersections or segments may already be unacceptable.
3.  The impact of proposed roadway improvements may affect residential,
    commercial, industrial, and other types of structures in currently
    developed areas. Various existing land uses may require relocation
    and/or the reduction of setback areas along roadways designated as
    requiring additional capacity. In cases where the impacts would be
    extremely disruptive, all options to roadway widening should be explored
    or the use of the Transportation Management Center (TMC). These
    options can include elimination of on-street parking with a program of
    restriping, transportation demand management strategies, or using the
    TMC to manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on
    congested corridors.
4.  The City of Oceanside is fortunate to have considerable recreational,
    open space, agricultural, and historic resources. These special resources
    also present a challenge to the circulation system. A delicate balance
    must be achieved in allowing adequate roadways to be implemented,
    while at the same time present the least amount of disruption of the
    natural terrain, vegetation, and character of an area. The Environmental

                                                                                        ELEMENT
     Impact Report adopted for this Circulation Element addresses these
     concerns and suggests ways to mitigate potential impacts.
5.   Like most coastal cities, Oceanside experiences heavy volume of through
     traffic due to its location in the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor, and due
     to major trip generators such as the Harbor, Camp Pendleton, recreation
     areas, and employment centers. The City can benefit by participating in
     regional corridor proposals to coordinate transportation planning efforts,
     such as bicycle corridors, commuter rail service from Oceanside to
     Escondido and Oceanside to San Diego in order to mitigate the negative
     impacts caused by through traffic.
6.   Implementation of the 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan must,
     out of necessity, be closely related to funding opportunities. These are
     most notably represented by the Thoroughfare Fees that are collected
     from land development. Administration of the fees requires prioritization
     of the various elements of the Master Transportation Roadway Plan so
     that as fees are collected, they are expended on appropriate portions of
     the street plan that have the greatest need.
7.   Implementation of the 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan may
     also have impacts on the structural integrity of the various street sections.
     As traffic volumes increase, as new streets are constructed, or as existing
     streets are extended, widened or lanes added, the Traffic Index may well
     indicate a need for a heavier structural section than had been previously
     planned. Failure to take note of such need may result in premature
     pavement failure, associated cost, stress, and negative public reaction. In
     analyzing funding sources such as Thoroughfare Fees, such pavement
     upgrading is an important cost factor that cannot be overlooked.
The Circulation Element must also plan for the development of multimodal
transportation networks based on the requirements and objectives of
Assembly Bill (AB) 1358, The California Complete Streets Act. A complete
street should allow for all users to effectively travel by motor vehicle, foot,
bicycle, and transit to reach key destinations within their community or region.
It is recommended that all transportation projects, new or retrofit, shall be
reviewed for opportunities to improve safety, access, and mobility for all
travelers and recognize pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes as integral
elements of the transportation system. In addition, the City of Oceanside can
use complete streets design to construct networks that are accessible to all
modes and all users no matter their age or ability.
The City of Oceanside strives to develop a network of complete streets as is
outlined in the various chapters (Public Transit, Bicycle, & Pedestrian) within
this Circulation Element and additional adopted planning documents (Bicycle
and Pedestrian Master Plans) that support the complete streets concept. The
City of Oceanside’s Circulation Element strives to follow the suggestions
recommended by the Update to the General Plan Guidelines: Complete
Streets and the Circulation Element, December 2010 as relevant to

   3.1     In order to achieve the level of service goals, the City shall develop
           and institute a long-range funding program in which new land
           development shall bear its share of the associated costs and
           improvement requirements. Where existing deficiencies occur, the
           City will have to find funding sources to fund the improvements.
           Reciprocal agreements with neighboring cities must be developed

         as needed to achieve acceptable levels of service due to
         development in adjacent cities.
  3.2    The City shall adopt design standards for all streets in accordance
         with their functional classifications and recognized design
         guidelines. The City will use as its basis the design standards of
         Caltrans and the American Association of State and Highway
         Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
  3.3    All streets within the City shall be designed in accordance with the
         adopted City of Oceanside design standards (shown in Table 3-1,
         page 24). Typical cross-sections and design criteria for the various
         street classifications are shown in the City Engineers Design and
         Processing Manual.
  3.4    The City may permit construction of private streets within individual
         development projects, provided that:
         • They are designed geometrically and structurally to meet City
             standards.
         • Only project occupants are served.
         • All emergency vehicle access requirements are satisfied.
         • The streets do not provide direct through route between public
             streets.
         • The Homeowners Association and/or property owners provide
             an acceptable program for financing regular street maintenance.
  3.5    The City may allow private streets to be designed with narrower
         right-of-way, if approved after City review.
  3.6    The City shall institute street access guidelines consistent with the
         street classifications. These shall be applied where feasible to all
         new developments. The following guidelines shall be used to define
         appropriate access:
          •   The City shall prohibit driveway access to prime arterials.
          •   Driveway access to major arterials shall not be permitted
              unless there is no other reasonable means of access to the
              public street system. Where access to major arterials or
              secondary collectors must be allowed, it shall be limited
              through the use of medians and/or access controls to maintain
              street capacity.
          •   Along major arterials, access spacing shall be a standard
              distance of 1,200 feet or more. Under special circumstances
              this distance may be reduced to a minimum of 600 feet where
              access is limited to right-in and right-out only. The above
              measurements shall be made from the ends of curb returns.
          •   Along secondary collectors, the corresponding access spacing
              shall be 600 feet for the standard distance and a minimum of
              300 feet for special circumstances where access is limited to

                right-in and right-out only. The above measurements shall be
                made from the ends of curb returns.
   3.7     The City shall adopt specific alignment plans when “standard equal-
           sided” widening is not adequate for future needs or when special
           conditions exist that require a detailed implementation plan. When
           necessary, specific alignment plans shall be prepared prior to the
           formal submittal of a development proposal. The need for such
           plans will be indicated by the following:
             • Variable terrain or other sensitive areas that may preclude
                straightforward preparation of street improvement plans.
             • Alignments that are necessary because of existing street
                designs and/or land use configurations.
             • Development proposals that must deal with extraordinary
                physical or environmental features.
   3.8     The City shall consider the feasibility of narrowing local streets that
           primarily serve residential neighborhoods or implementing other
           techniques to discourage cut through traffic in new residential
           neighborhood developments.
   3.9     The City shall review all project applications and reduce or eliminate
           residential driveways on all collector and busier streets. Access to
           commercial projects shall be designed to meet the City’s standards
           and limited to the extent feasible. The City shall routinely review
           existing collector and higher streets to determine, as feasible, the
           closing, combining, or relocation of existing driveways.
Roadway Improvements
OBJECTIVE:
    iii.    Construct the roadway network in phases consistent with the
            needs and growth of the community.
The policies listed in this section will encourage the orderly development and
funding of the street system. The construction will be funded through a
combination of developer contributions and fees, City funds such as the
gasoline tax, regional TransNet sales tax, and State and federal guaranteed
financial support.
POLICIES:
   3.10    The City shall require dedication and improvement of necessary
           rights-of-way along Master Transportation Roadway Plan streets.
           This usually will occur in fulfillment of a condition of approval for a
           tentative map or as a condition of approval for a building permit,
           whichever occurs first.

  3.11   The City shall assure that each addition to the circulation system is
         a useable link on the total system and that new routes and links are
         coordinated with existing routes to ensure that each new and
         existing roadway continues to function as it was intended.
  3.12   The City shall require or provide adequate traffic safety measures
         on all new and existing roadways. These measures may include,
         but are not limited to, appropriate levels of maintenance, proper
         street design, traffic control devices (signs, signals, and striping),
         street lighting, and coordination with the school districts to provide
         school crossing signs and protection.
  3.13   The City shall give priority to funding and implementing projects that
         either complete links on the circulation system or relieve existing
         deficiencies.
  3.14   The City shall, where feasible, interconnect traffic signals to form
         area networks or corridor systems. These systems shall be timed to
         facilitate the flow of through traffic on the arterial system, thus
         enhancing the movement of vehicles and goods through the City,
         while reducing fuel consumption and air pollution.
  3.15   The City shall impose appropriate prorated fees for construction of
         roadway facilities and associated landscaping to ensure that all new
         development contributes to the completion of the circulation system.
         In addition to pre-permit collection, such fees may be imposed
         through creation of assessment districts.
  3.16   The City shall approve and build streets as per City of Oceanside
         Engineering Manual Specifications.
  3.17   The City shall require additional right-of-way width and additional
         improvements of major arterials where required for turning
         movements or to provide access to adjacent properties whenever
         access is not feasible from a lower classification street system.
  3.18   The City shall:
           • Require new developments to provide collector and local street
               improvements according to the standards of the City
               Engineering Department.
           • Require new developments to dedicate necessary right-of-way
               when the subdivision or development of property adjacent to
               Circulation Element streets is proposed.
           • Require new developments to provide all necessary grading,
               installation of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, parkway tree planting,
               and street lights, unless these improvements are provided
               through other means.
           • Require new developments to provide half-street improvements
               plus 12 feet beyond the centerline in accordance with City
               standards.

    3.19   For development within the Major Thoroughfare and Traffic Signal
           Fee area established by the City Council, the City shall collect the
           Major Thoroughfare Fees as required by Ordinance No. 80-30, the
           Traffic Signal Fees as required by Ordinance No. 87-19, and the
           latest City Council resolutions setting such fees.
    3.20   If the location and traffic generation of a proposed development will
           result in congestion on major streets or failure to meet the LOS D
           threshold, or if it creates safety hazards, the proposed development
           shall be required to make necessary off-site improvements. Such
           improvements may be eligible for reimbursement from collected
           impact fees. In some cases, the development may have to wait
           until financing for required off-site improvements is available. In
           other cases where development would result in unavoidable
           impacts, the appropriate findings of overriding consideration will be
           required to allow temporary undesirable levels of service.
    3.21   The City shall require that those responsible for street
           improvements replant, replace, or install new landscaping pursuant
           to existing City policy along all new roadways or on those that have
           been redesigned and reconstructed.
    3.22   Prior to approving any street widening project, the City shall explore
           all alternatives to adding additional lanes or acquiring additional
           right-of-way.
3.2     Roadway Classifications
Roadway classification is the process by which streets and highways are
grouped into classes according to the type of service they are intended to
provide. Fundamental to this process is the recognition that individual streets
and highways do not operate independently. Rather, most travel involves
movement through an integrated network of roads. It is the City’s responsibility
to plan, design, and implement a street system that recognizes the importance
of the use and function of each hierarchical roadway classification.
The City of Oceanside recognizes the importance of the use and function of
each street classification. The class of each road has a certain set of design
guidelines and intended functions that are described below.
Expressway – An Expressway is designed to provide express direct travel
through a city with several lanes of travel in each direction. It is a multilane
roadway that is often a divided highway for through traffic with fully controlled
access to intersections and with possible grade separations at most
intersections (SR76 has mostly at-grade intersections). Expressways are
constructed and maintained by the Caltrans. Expressways in Oceanside are
generally four or six lanes. The Caltrans Highway Design Manual (Index
405.5) states that median opening (includes intersections) should be spaced
at intervals no closer than 1,600 feet. The cross section for an expressway is
102/160 or 122/200 feet (curb-to-curb/total right-of-way width).

                                                                                      CIRCULATION
                                                                                          ELEMENT
Prime Arterial – A Prime Arterial is designed to provide regional, sub-
regional, and intra-city travel. It includes high design standards with six lanes
of travel, raised and landscaped medians, 8-foot shoulders, highly restricted
direct access, and on-street parking is not allowed. The cross section for a
prime arterial is 104/124 feet (curb-to-curb/total right-of-way width).
Major Arterial – A Major Arterial is designed to provide intra-city and sub-
regional service. Direct access is allowed, but selectively restricted to assure
proper function of the roadway. Typical design standards include the
provision of four or six lanes of travel with a raised and landscaped median, 8-
foot shoulders for emergency parking and bike lanes, and left-turn lanes are
typically protected along the roadway. The cross section of a major arterial is
80/100 feet or 104/124 feet (curb-to-curb/total right-of-way width).
Secondary Collector – A Secondary Collector is designed for intra-city travel
as a link between arterial and collector roadways. It frequently provides direct
access to abutting properties; however, that is not its primary purpose. The
typical design features include the provision of four travel lanes with a center
two-way left-turn lane and includes bike lanes or four lanes with left-turn
pockets without a raised median. The cross section of a secondary collector
is 64/84 (curb-to-curb/total right-of-way width) with a two-way left-turn lane
and 54/74, 60/80 feet without a two-way left-turn lane.
Collector Street – A Collector Street is designed to connect local streets with
the adjacent arterial street network. The design standards typically include
the provision for two travel lanes and on-street parking is allowed, except in
specific locations where parking is removed to provide turn lanes at
intersections. Collector streets frequently provide direct access to abutting
properties, although the desire is to limit access where possible to reduce
conflict. Collectors are generally two lanes with or without a center two-way
left-turn lane. The cross section of a collector is 50/70 (curb-to-curb/total right-
of-way width) with a two-way left-turn lane and 40/60 or 50/70 feet without a
two-way left-turn lane. A Collector can also be a two-lane one-way street,
such as the one-way couplet on Mission Avenue between Cleveland Street
and Clementine Street with Seagaze Drive. A Collector that is a two-lane one-
way street generally has parking on both sides of the street.
Local Street – A Local Street is designed to provide direct access to abutting
properties and to provide connection between neighborhood streets and the
collector street network. The Local Street may be discontinuous to discourage
through trips. The typical design standards include the provision for two travel
lanes, parking lanes on both sides of the street, and direct driveway access.
The cross section of a local street is 36/56 or 40/60 (curb-to-curb/total right-of-
way width).
All major elements of the circulation system have been assigned to one of
these classifications to aid in understanding the design configuration and right-
of-way needs for any segment of the system.

3.3      Existing Circulation System
The existing roadway system within the City of Oceanside is illustrated on
Figure 3.1. Regional circulation facilities serving the City include Interstate 5,
State Route 78 and State Route 76. Several of the major north/south and
east/west arterials such as El Camino Real, Rancho Del Oro Road, College
Boulevard, Oceanside Boulevard and Mission Avenue are accessed via these
facilities.
The existing traffic conditions were analyzed to determine areas where the
level of service did not meet the LOS D or better threshold. The existing traffic
volumes are shown on Figure 3.2. Figure 3.3 depicts the existing level of
service conditions for the roadway segments, and Figure 3.4 depicts the
existing level of service conditions for the key intersections in the City of
Oceanside. Detailed tables that include the existing roadway capacity, traffic
volumes, delay and level of service are included in Appendix D.

3.4      Regional Modeling Process
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) regional
transportation model was used to help assess the long range traffic impacts of
the General Plan land uses on the proposed Circulation Element Master
Transportation Roadway Plan. SANDAG updates and provides the regional
traffic forecasts for the San Diego region. SANDAG uses a regional
transportation model to produce highway and transit forecasts for individual
forecast years between 2003 and 2030. These forecasts are updated
periodically to incorporate the most recent planning assumptions.
In the regional model, San Diego County (the “County”) is divided into traffic
analysis zones, and the northern portion of the County is further divided and
analyzed as the combined North County Sub-Area model. The combined
North County Sub-Area model is a subset of the SANDAG Series 11 regional
model. The North County Sub-Area Model includes the cities of Carlsbad,
Oceanside, Escondido, Vista, San Marcos, and Poway. At the direction of
Oceanside’s City Council, the Series 11 North County Sub-Area model was
used to forecast future 2030 traffic volumes.
The Series 11 Combined North County Sub-Area model traffic forecasts utilize
the “Reasonably Expected” network as defined in the Regional Transportation
Plan (RTP) and the Final Series 11 2030 Regional Growth Forecast. It was
completed in March 2009. This subarea model produces current and future
traffic volumes tailored to the traffic patterns of the six North County cities. It
serves as the basis for travel demand forecasting needs in these cities. The
SANDAG Series 11 Year 2030 North County Sub-Area model traffic volumes
forecasts represent the City of Oceanside’s Year 2030 traffic volumes which
helped shape the proposed Master Transportation Roadway Plan network.
The SANDAG 2050 Regional Transportation Plan was approved in October
2011. The SANDAG Board of Directors approved the Hybrid Scenario as the
preferred Revenue Constrained Transportation Network. The Hybrid Scenario
contains projects that include improvements to the existing Trolley system as
well as a number of new light rail transit (LRT) services in other high demand
travel corridors and other bus rapid transit (BRT) and transit projects. The
proposed Hybrid Scenario also includes improvements for all of the major
freeway and highway corridors. It should be noted that the Hybrid Scenario
assumes that State Route 76 (SR76) is a four-lane expressway not a six-lane
expressway as shown in the SANDAG Series 11 North County Sub-Area
model and the City of Oceanside’s Circulation Element. SANDAG determined
that SR76 would remain a four-lane facility in the 2050 RTP and is not shown
on the Hybrid Scenario project list to be improved to a six-lane facility. The
City of Oceanside analysis shows that SR76 would operate at LOS D or worse
in the Year 2030 based on future traffic volumes that were taken from the
Series 11 North County Sub-Area model. Therefore, the Circulation Element
will continue to show SR76 as a six-lane facility as the future traffic volumes
(approx. 51,000 to 66,000 ADT, Series 11 Combined North County Sub-Area
model) justify the need for a six-lane expressway in Year 2030. It is
recommended that the City of Oceanside include the cost of widening SR76 to

contradiction between the City’s Circulation Element classification and the
2050 RTP.
3.5     Roadway Design Standards
The roadway design standards for the City of Oceanside are based on
engineering standards and on evolving policies and practices regarding the
City’s transportation infrastructure. The City of Oceanside has established
roadway design standards in order to standardize the City’s roadway elements
by ensuring that they meet both state and nationally accepted design criteria.
While the Circulation Element provides the roadway design standards, it is not
a substitute for professional engineering judgment and close coordination with
the City Traffic Engineer during project development and plan preparations. In
addition, bicycle and pedestrian facilities should be included in the roadway
design as appropriate. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities are further outlined in
Chapters 6 and 7. Table 3-1 provides a summary of the City of Oceanside’s
Street Design Criteria.

3.6    LOS Analysis Methodology
The efficiency of traffic intersection operations and available and utilized
capacity of roadways are measured in terms of Level of Service (LOS). The
LOS refers to the quality of traffic flow along roadways and at intersections.
Evaluation of roadways and intersections involves the assignment of grades
from A to F, with LOS A representing the lowest level of congestion, and LOS
F representing extremely crowded and restricted operations. Each letter grade
corresponds to a range of volume to capacity (V/C) values. The values for
roadways are presented as volume to capacity ratios or vehicle demand
divided by the roadway capacity. Therefore, as the ratio approaches a 1.00
capacity, the roadway approaches LOS F.
3.6.1   Freeways and Ramps
Freeways and associated interchanges must be evaluated since all freeways
are on the Congestion Management Program system. All signalized
intersections of freeway ramps with arterials should be evaluated using the
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) signalized intersection operational method
(see section 3.6.3). For diamond interchanges, the timing and phasing of the
two signals must be coordinated to ensure queue clearances. Signal timing
sheets should be requested from Caltrans or the City of Oceanside.
Freeways impacted by a proposed project should be evaluated for significant
impacts. Level of service (generally used by Caltrans) for freeways are
categorized in Table 3-2.
If ramp metering is present at a freeway interchange, the effects of the
metering should be analyzed. The analysis input and output for ramp
metering is explained in the Traffic Impact Study (TIS) component guidelines
which are included in Appendix G. In addition, the thresholds for a significant
impact to ramps or freeways are included in Appendix G.

Level of Service standards shall be used to determine acceptable levels of
ADT for all City roadways. LOS standards must be met by all new
development projects or agreed upon mitigation measures must be
implemented upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy of the first
residential unit, commercial/industrial building or educational facility.
Each classification in the Circulation Element hierarchy of arterial roadways
has a design capacity and associated LOS threshold. Table 3-3 shows the
design capacity and LOS thresholds for all roadways. If a roadway is
calculated to operate at LOS E, then an arterial peak hour analysis shall be
performed following the HCM methodology. A computer software with HCM
methodology analysis shall be used to determine arterial level of service for
peak hour analysis. Any other methodology used should first be discussed
and approved by the City.

3.6.3     Intersections
Intersection Level of Service analysis should be conducted using the HCM
Methodology. For signalized intersections, the methodology described in the
HCM Chapter 18 for signalized intersections is used. With this methodology,
the average control delay per vehicle is estimated for each lane group and
aggregated for each approach and for the intersection as a whole. The
relationship between control delay per vehicle and LOS for signalized
intersections is summarized in Table 3-4.

For unsignalized intersections, the methodology described in the HCM
Chapters 19 and 20 for unsignalized intersections is used. With this
methodology, LOS is related to the control delay for each stop-controlled
movement. The relationship between control delay per vehicle and LOS for
unsignalized intersections is summarized in Table 3-5.

3.7      Proposed 2030 Master Transportation Roadway
         Plan
The 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan was developed by assessing
the existing network and future 2030 traffic conditions. There were 18 potential
2030 network alternatives reviewed for the Master Transportation Roadway
Plan. The 18 potential network alternatives were run using the Series 11 Sub-
Area model. These alternatives were reviewed and narrowed down to five
scenarios that were presented to City staff and at public meetings with the
understanding that two variations of the five would be selected for further
detailed analysis in a traffic impact study.                          The proposed Master
Transportation Roadway Plan presented in this section is one of the
alternatives analyzed in the traffic impact study.
The 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan as shown on Figure 3.5 (page
32) represents the planned street system along with the classifications of
those streets. Where there is a change from one classification to another
along a certain street, a transition will occur mid-block to preclude non-
continuing lanes at intersections.                 The design criteria for the higher
classification shall generally take precedence through the transition area. The
City Traffic Engineer shall review these transition areas and provide guidance.
There are several pieces of the transportation network that have changed
from existing conditions to the proposed 2030 Master Transportation Roadway
Plan. The major changes to the circulation network include:
    •     SR76 is six-lanes
    •     Rancho Del Oro Road at SR78 is an interchange

     •   College Boulevard is six-lanes between Old Grove Road and Vista
         Way
     •   Melrose Drive is connected between North River Road and SR76
     •   Melrose Drive is connected between Spur Avenue and N. Santa Fe
         Avenue
     •   Pala Road is connected between Los Arbolitos Boulevard and Foussat
         Road
     •   Mission Avenue is a one-way couplet between Cleveland Street and
         Clementine Street with Seagaze Drive (Clementine Street will be one-
         way northbound and Cleveland Street will be one-way southbound)
In addition to the major network changes, there are several other network
improvements proposed for the 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan.
Table 3-6 highlights the changes from the existing network to the proposed
2030 network. Several facilities are already built to their ultimate classification
and are therefore not mentioned in Table 3-6. Intersection improvements
beyond existing conditions are depicted in Figure 3.6 (page 33-34). Figure 3.6
shows the future intersection geometry in red. A complete list of roadway
segment classification, forecast 2030 traffic volumes, delay and LOS are
included in Appendix E.

Footnotes:
1. Douglas Drive between Via Magaluena and Cardiff Bay Drive will remain as two-lanes.
2. Widening Lake Boulevard between Thunder Drive and Sundown Lane will accommodate forecast traffic
    volumes, but it should be noted that there are residential dwelling units fronting this segment that oppose
    the widening.
3. Melrose Drive between SR76 and North Santa Fe Avenue could possibly only be a four-lane major
    instead of a six-lane major in 2030.
4. Mission Avenue will be a two-lane one-way couplet between Cleveland and Clementine Streets with
    Seagaze Drive. Clementine Street will be one-way northbound and Cleveland Street will be one-way
    southbound.
5. Widening Vista Way between Coast Highway and I-5 will accommodate forecast traffic volumes, but it
    should be noted that there are residential dwelling units fronting this segment that oppose the widening.

3.7.1   Unacceptable LOS Roadway Segments
There are several segments in the proposed 2030 Master Transportation
Roadway Plan that do not operate at an acceptable LOS D or better and the
mitigation measures to improve the operations to an acceptable level of
service are not considered feasible. Figure 3.7 (page 38) depicts the 2030
Master Transportation Roadway Plan traffic volumes. Figure 3.8 (page 39)
depicts the level of service operations for the roadway network for the 2030
Master Transportation Roadway Plan. As forecast traffic volumes build on the
major corridors such as Coast Highway, College Boulevard, El Camino Real
and Oceanside Boulevard, traffic should be managed through the
Transportation Management Center (TMC). This will not provide full mitigation
but simply improve overall traffic flow along these segments. The potential
mitigation measures necessary to bring these segments to an acceptable LOS
D or better are not always feasible or do not work towards achieving the
overall long-term goals for the City of Oceanside. However, it is noted what
would be required to fully mitigate these segments. The following are City of
Oceanside roadway segments that do not operate at an acceptable LOS D or
better under the proposed 2030 Master Transportation Roadway Plan.
Coast Highway between Wisconsin Avenue and Oceanside Boulevard
    •   Capacity: Four-lane secondary collector with LOS E capacity of 25,000
        (see Table 3-3 for roadway capacities)
    •   LOS: Forecast 23,600 ADT volumes, LOS E, V/C ratio 0.94
    •   Mitigation: Widening to a four-lane secondary collector with a center
        two-way left-turn lane would accommodate forecast traffic volumes
College Boulevard between SR76 and Mesa Drive, Oceanside Boulevard and
Olive Drive, Waring Road and Plaza Drive, and Lake Boulevard and Southern
City Limits
    •   Capacity: Four-lane major between SR76 and Mesa Drive, six-lane
        major between Oceanside Boulevard and Olive Drive, and Waring
        Road and Plaza Drive, and four-lane major between Lake Boulevard
        and the Southern City Limits
    •   Capacity: Four-lane major LOS E capacity of 40,000 and six-lane
        major LOS E capacity of 50,000
    •   LOS: Forecast between 36,300-52,000 ADT volumes, LOS E and F,
        V/C ratio 0.91-1.04
    •   Mitigation: Widening the four-lane major sections (where there is an
        impact) to a six-lane major or widening the six-lane major sections
        (where there is an impact) to a six-lane prime arterial would
        accommodate forecast traffic volumes; however, residents on certain
        sections of College Boulevard would be impacted by widening this
        corridor.

                                                                                    ELEMENT
El Camino Real between Vista Way and SR78
    •  Capacity: Six-lane prime arterial with LOS E capacity of 60,000
       between Vista Way and SR78
    •  LOS: Forecast 58,900 ADT volumes, LOS E, V/C ratio 0.98 between
       Vista Way and SR78
    •  Mitigation: Widening of the segment between Vista Way and SR78 to
       an eight-lane facility would improve the LOS; however, there are right-
       of-way restrictions on this segment that would not feasibly allow any
       additional widening. Due to existing topography, street location, and
       buildings some congestion on these segments may occur at buildout.
Mesa Drive between Mission Avenue and Foussat Road
    •  Capacity: Two-lane collector with LOS E capacity of 10,000
    •  LOS: Forecast 11,100 ADT volumes, LOS F, V/C ratio 1.11
    •  Mitigation: Widening this segment to a two-lane collector with a center
       continuous two-way left-turn lane would accommodate forecast traffic
       volumes. Widening this segment to accommodate a two-way left-turn
       lane is not possible due to existing residential frontage.
Oceanside Boulevard between Crouch Street and Foussat Road
    •  Capacity: Four-lane major arterial with LOS E capacity of 40,000
    •  LOS: Forecast 37,900 ADT volumes, LOS E, V/C ratio 0.95
    •  Mitigation: Widening this segment to a six-lane major arterial would
       accommodate forecast traffic volumes.
Vista Way between College Boulevard and SR78 Ramps
    •  Capacity: Four-lane secondary collector with LOS E capacity of 30,000
       between College Boulevard and SR78 Ramps
    •  LOS: Forecast 31,500 ADT volumes, LOS F, V/C ratio 1.04 between
       College Boulevard and SR78 Ramps
    •  Mitigation: It should be noted that this segment has an eastbound
       right-turn lane serving the SR78 eastbound on-ramp. However, the
       City strives to improve the westbound approach of this segment by
       providing a westbound dedicated right-turn lane and extending the
       storage length of the westbound left-turn lanes at College Boulevard
       and Vista Way intersection.

3.7.2   Unacceptable LOS Intersections
In addition, there are several key intersections in the proposed 2030 Master
Transportation Roadway Plan that do not operate at an acceptable level of
service during peak hours. Figure 3.9 (page 40) depicts the level of service
operations for the key intersections for the proposed 2030 Master
Transportation Roadway Plan. Below is a list of intersections that operate at
LOS E or F during the AM or PM peak hours. The potential mitigation
measures for the intersections that are proposed to operate at LOS E or F
include adding an additional thru, left, or right-turn lanes to the necessary leg
of the intersection. The intersection level of service, delay, and list of potential
mitigation measures for these intersections are included in Appendix F.
    •   Mission Avenue and I-5 Southbound Ramps (PM peak hour)
    •   Oceanside Boulevard and I-5 Northbound & Southbound Ramps ((PM
        peak hour)
    •   Oceanside Boulevard and Crouch Street (PM peak hour)
    •   SR76 and Foussat Road (AM peak hour)
    •   El Camino Real and Oceanside Boulevard (AM peak hour)
    •   Douglas Drive and El Camino Real (AM and PM peak hours)
    •   College Boulevard and Oceanside Boulevard (PM peak hour)

3.7.3 Recommended Overriding Considerations
The following segments and intersection are recommended for consideration
by City Council for an overriding consideration with the adoption of this
Circulation Element. The mitigation measures identified for these segments
have significant land use or environmental impacts that prohibit a feasible
mitigation to bring the facility to an acceptable level of service.
Roadway Segments:
Coast Highway between Wisconsin Avenue and Oceanside Boulevard
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a four-lane
secondary collector. It would require a four-lane 64/84 secondary collector
designation without the existing on-street parking to accommodate the
forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to manage the
transportation system through adaptive signals on congested corridors.
College Boulevard between SR76 and Mesa Drive
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a four-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane major arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to
manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested
corridors.
College Boulevard between Oceanside Boulevard and Olive Drive
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a six-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane prime arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to
manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested
corridors.
College Boulevard between Waring Road and Vista Way
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a six-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane prime arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to
manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested
corridors.
College Boulevard between Vista Way and Plaza Drive
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a six-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane prime arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to
manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested
corridors.

College Boulevard between Lake Boulevard and the Southern City Limits
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a four-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane major arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to
manage the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested
corridors.
El Camino Real between Vista Way and SR78
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a six-lane
prime arterial. It would require an eight-lane arterial designation to
accommodate the forecast traffic volumes on this segment. However, there
are land use constraints due to the proximity of existing development that
prohibit widening El Camino Real to eight lanes. This segment had a previous
overriding consideration from the 1995 Circulation Element. It is
recommended that an overriding consideration be adopted for this segment
again for this update of the Circulation Element.
Mesa Drive between Mission Avenue and Foussat Road
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a two-lane
collector. It would require widening it to a 50/70 collector street to
accommodate forecast traffic volumes.
Oceanside Boulevard between Crouch Street and Foussat Road
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a four-lane
major arterial. It would require a six-lane major arterial designation to
accommodate forecast traffic volumes. The new TMC can be used to manage
the transportation system through adaptive signals on congested corridors.
Vista Way between College Boulevard and SR78 Ramps
The Master Transportation Roadway Plan shows this segment as a four-lane
secondary collector. It would require a four-lane major arterial designation to
fully accommodate forecast traffic volumes. However, improvements to the
College Boulevard and Vista Way intersection in the form of a westbound
dedicated right-turn lane and lengthening the westbound left-turn lanes
storage would improve peak hour operations on this segment. Therefore, the
westbound improvements at College Boulevard/Vista Way should be
implemented.
Intersections:
Mission Avenue and I-5 SB Ramps
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
both east- and westbound and two westbound left-turn lanes to fully mitigate
this intersection. This would require widening the Mission Avenue bridge over

I-5. The Caltrans I-5 widening project plans show the Mission Avenue bridge
remaining as four lanes.
Oceanside Boulevard and I-5 SB Ramps
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
both east- and westbound, two westbound right-turn lanes, and two eastbound
left-turn lanes to fully mitigate this intersection.
Oceanside Boulevard and I-5 NB Ramps
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
both east- and westbound to fully mitigate this intersection.
Oceanside Boulevard and Crouch Street
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
both east- and westbound to fully mitigate this intersection.
SR76 and Foussat Road
This intersection cannot be fully mitigated in the AM peak hour, but providing
two right-turn lanes northbound and three thru lanes southbound will improve
the peak hour operations.
El Camino Real and Oceanside Boulevard
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
both east- and westbound to fully mitigate this intersection.
Douglas Drive and El Camino Real
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Mission Avenue; however,
it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and adaptive signal controls
will fully mitigate this intersection. It would require providing three thru lanes
southbound, two thru lanes and one dedicated right-turn lane northbound, and
on dedicated left-turn and one dedicated thru-lane westbound to fully mitigate
this intersection. There is also not sufficient right-of-way at this intersection to
provide the recommended mitigation measures.
College Boulevard and Oceanside Boulevard
The new TMC can be utilized to manage traffic on Oceanside and College
Boulevard; however, it cannot be determined that the use of the TMC and

3.8     Traffic Impact Studies
3.8.1   Traffic Impact Study Guidelines
The SANTEC/ITE Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies (TIS) in the San Diego
Region, March 2000 (or most recent version) shall be followed within the City
of Oceanside for any proposed project that would have an impact on the City’s
roadway network. A TIS can also be required based on the discretion of the
City. Early consultation between the developer and the City is required to
establish the base study parameters, assumptions, and analysis
methodologies for the TIS. The City of Oceanside has a list of required
components for TIS reports. All TIS reports should follow the required TIS
components guidelines which are included in Appendix G. A TIS can be
performed by any consultant on the City approved Traffic Engineering
Consultants list to complete development traffic impact studies.
As recommended in the SANTEC/ITE Guidelines, the use of the most recent
version of the SANDAG Trip Generation rates should be used or the rates
from ITE’s latest Trip Generation manual. For smart growth/mixed-use
development areas, SANDAG has developed a Trip Generation for Smart
Growth: Planning Tools for the San Diego Region to identify trip generation
rates associated with smart growth developments. This new method of
applying Smart Growth trip generation rates is intended to supplement data in
the San Diego Traffic Generators Manual, published by SANDAG in 2000, and
the accompanying Not-so-Brief-Guide to Trip Generation, published by
SANDAG in 2002. The most recent version of the SANDAG Smart Growth or
Trip Generation rates should be used.
3.8.2   Traffic Analysis Performance Criteria
The City of Oceanside’s minimum acceptable level of service for all roadways
is LOS D. The values associated with the LOS D minimum for the different
roadway classifications are defined in Table 3-3 (page 27). The minimum
acceptable level of service for intersections during the peak periods is LOS D.
The values associated with LOS D for intersections during the peak periods
were previously defined in Tables 3-4 and 3-5 (pages 28 & 29). These level of
service standards are considered acceptable within the San Diego region and
have been used in the analysis for the Circulation Element.
3.8.3   Mitigation Measures
Any proposed development project that causes a street segment or
intersection to operate worse than LOS D is a significant project impact. If a
segment or intersection operates at LOS E or F under pre-project conditions,
a significant impact is determined as outlined in the most recent version of the
SANTEC/ITE Guidelines. The developer shall propose, prepare and provide
feasible mitigation measure(s) for the City to review that would improve the
impacted location(s) to an acceptable LOS. Mitigation measures should be

used to construct on- and off-site transportation infrastructure improvements
and dedicate right-of-way connected to impacts resulting from new
development. The City also may require a developer to provide improvements
to pedestrian and/or bicycle facilities as part of the project’s mitigation
measures. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the Pedestrian and Bicycle Facility
networks in the City of Oceanside.
Any proposed development project that affects a street segment that already
operates, or is projected to operate worse than LOS D, regardless of peak
hour analysis, the developer shall propose, prepare and provide mitigation
measure(s) for the City to review. If there are no feasible mitigation measures
that would fully mitigate traffic impacts, the developer shall propose, prepare
and provide various mitigation measures, such as Traffic Management Center
tools and resources, which may not include physical improvements to the
impacted facility. Where various mitigation measures have been prepared,
agreed upon by the City, and will be implemented, yet are not sufficient to fully
mitigate the traffic impacts, then LOS E during peak hour periods will be
considered acceptable. A project’s fair share contributions may also be
considered by the City for predetermined project improvements (e.g. TMC,
adaptive signals) in lieu of prepared and implemented mitigation measures.
3.9      Additional Recommended Transportation Network
        Guidelines
The following recommended guidelines are for action by the City:
    1. Develop and implement a Traffic Engineering Consultant on-call list for
        potential developers to utilize for traffic impact studies.
    2. Implement the proposed transportation network and                  street
        classification standards as shown on Figure 3.5 (page 32).
    3. As more precise intersection data becomes available, incorporate
        special design treatments for mitigating potentially unacceptable levels
        of service at those intersections identified in Section 3.7.2 (page 37)
        and included in Appendix F.
    4. Continue to impose the City’s Thoroughfare Fee and Traffic Signal Fee
        Ordinances to fund improvements necessary to maintain acceptable
        levels of service.
    5. Update and revise the City’s Thoroughfare Fee and Traffic Signal Fee
        Ordinances periodically to include road segment and intersection
        improvements as necessary to maintain acceptable LOS, and make
        any necessary adjustments in the amount of fees to be imposed.
    6. Construct road segment improvements and road expansions as
        indicated on the Master Transportation Roadway Plan to provide

       LOS D or better at such time as traffic flow warrants the improvements
       or expansion.
   7. Widen approaches and make any other necessary intersection
       improvements to achieve LOS D or better for those intersections which
       would be impacted by proposed development.
  8. Incorporate the following mitigation measures, where appropriate, into
       the design of new and improved roadways and streets to ensure that a
       new roadway will not result in future noise levels exceeding City land
       use compatibility criteria:
           •    Alignment alternative
           •    Roadway barriers
           •    Lateral separation
           •    Vertical profile
           •    Retrofitting existing sensitive uses with added wall insulation,
                double pane windows, and air conditioning
           •    Relocation of severely impacted sensitive uses
           •    Buffer zones with adequate setbacks to avoid potentially
                unhealthful exposure to roadway noise and air quality levels
  9. In the design of transportation facilities, every reasonable effort should
       be made to integrate and preserve significant natural features of the
       land, such as major canyons, watercourses, wetlands, native
       vegetation, trees, and rock outcroppings.
  10. Locate and design roadways to avoid excessive grading and to respect
       the existing hillside and/or wetlands topography.
  11. Require utilities to be undergrounded or relocated whenever possible,
       in conjunction with roadway construction.
  12. Require landscaping to be replanted, replaced, or introduced along all
       new roadways or those which have been redesigned or reconstructed.
  13. In the design of transportation facilities, reasonable effort should be
       made to integrate a complete streets design concept to accommodate
       the various users of the network such as pedestrians, bicyclists,
       transit, etc.
  14. Incorporate traffic calming features, where feasible, into the roadway
       design of new, in-fill or redevelopment areas and at intersections with
       high pedestrian activity.

The San Diego Regional Transportation Plan provides for a regional TDM
program. The regional TDM program provides a mix of opportunities and
services to promote viable alternatives to the single occupant motor vehicle
commute. iCommute (www.icommutesd.com) is the regional program that
offers commute choices within the San Diego region. The program is
managed by SANDAG as part of the regional 511 transportation information
program. The goal of the program is to manage and reduce traffic congestion
during peak-times, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other
environmental pollutants that result from commuters driving to work alone

daily. iCommute offers assistance and tools to commuters and employers
through various services such as carpool, vanpool, schoolpool, transit, bike to
work, and work from home programs.
Carpool – Carpooling shares the daily commute with another driver.
iCommute offers RideMatcher, which is a database of thousands of
commuters looking for carpool partners. TripTracker allows the individual
commuter to track carpool trips and see the cost and environmental savings.
The iCommute Carpool program also offers a Guaranteed Ride Home
Program for those who carpool three or more times each week. And, park-
and-ride lots are free and available for those who carpool or vanpool.
Oceanside currently has four park-and-ride lots at the following locations:
    •   SR78/College Boulevard South (3700 Haymar Drive)
    •   Moreno Street (1928 Moreno Street)
    •   SR78/College Boulevard North (3710 Vista Way)
    •   Frontier Drive/New Hope Church (Mission Avenue and Frontier Drive)
Vanpool – Vanpools allow groups of 7 to 15 people to share their commute to
work. A van can be leased by the commuter or an employer through one of
iCommute’s contracted vanpool vendors and receive up to $400 per month to
help offset the cost of the lease. The RideMatcher, TripTracker, Guaranteed
Ride Home, and Park and Ride Lots are all available to vanpool commuters as
well.
SchoolPool – This is iCommute’s free carpool matching service for parents of
children who attend the same school anywhere in the region. iCommute has
helped to establish SchoolPool programs at elementary, middle, and high
schools throughout the region.
Transit – Public transportation service is available throughout the region,
including Oceanside. iCommute offers a link to 511’s Transit Trip Planner to
plan a commute using the public transportation available in the San Diego
region.
Bike to Work – iCommute will help a commuter find a ride partner, as well as
connect the commuter with a free bike locater and map out the best route of
travel. There are even some financial incentives offered through certain
employers who commute by bicycle.
Work from Home – Teleworking is a convenient solution that enables
employees to work from home or a remote location one or more days per
week. iCommute can refer an employer to area teleworking and flexible
working experts who will help establish program evaluation guidelines and
strategies, training sessions for employees and managers, one-on-one
consultation with telework experts, presentation on teleworking designed for
middle and upper management, and the overall design and implementation of
a customized telework program.

The City of Oceanside can also integrate these TDM programs through their
Energy Roadmap. SANDAG is coordinating the Energy Roadmap program to
offer energy-planning assistance to local governments in the San Diego region
through an energy-efficiency partnership with SDG&E. By saving energy,
local jurisdictions can contribute to state and regional goals for saving energy
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.
The iCommute program provides free assistance and tools for jurisdictions to
design and implement TDM programs as part of their Energy Roadmap. TDM
programs promote transportation solutions that reduce traffic congestion, fuel
consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions by providing alternatives to
commuters who drive alone to work.
GOAL:         Support programs that encourage increased vehicle
              occupancies and trip reduction in order for residents to
              enjoy the quality of life that currently exists in
              Oceanside.
OBJECTIVES:
        i.   Move more people in fewer vehicles while providing high quality
             modes of transportation.
       ii.   Maintain high quality transportation services which cater to the
             needs of all residents, regardless of age, income, or physical
             ability.
      iii.   Encourage alternative modes of transportation through TDM
             practices such as transit, walking, bicycling, and teleworking
             especially during peak travel periods.
POLICIES:
The following policies are intended to direct City efforts to promote the
integration of TDM programs:
    4.1      The City shall encourage the reduction of vehicle miles traveled,
             reduction of the total number of daily and peak hour vehicle trips,
             and provide better utilization of the circulation system through
             development and implementation of TDM strategies. These may
             include, but not limited to, implementation of peak hour trip
             reduction, encourage staggered work hours, telework programs,
             increased development of employment centers where transit usage
             is highly viable, encouragement of ridesharing options in the public
             and private sector, provision for park-and-ride facilities adjacent to
             the regional transportation system, and provision for transit
             subsidies.

          residential areas with schools, parks, recreation areas, major
          employment centers, and neighborhood commercial areas.
   4.3    The City shall maintain and implement the policies and
          recommendations of the Pedestrian Master Plan as part of the
          Recreational Trails Element to ensure pedestrian access along
          streets and other locations throughout the City are properly
          maintained and provided.
   4.4    The City shall support parking policies that increase the cost of
          parking and/or reduce the supply of off-street parking to encourage
          drivers to consider using alternative modes of transportation or
          carpool/vanpool opportunities where transit facilities are available.
   4.5    The City shall encourage businesses to offer financial incentives to
          use modes of transportation other than the single occupant vehicle
          by way of subsidized transit, carpool/vanpool programs, bike to
          work programs, parking cash-out programs, or some combination
          of these.
   4.6    The City shall encourage new developments to provide onsite
          facilities such as showers, lockers, carpool stalls, and bicycle
          racks.
   4.7    The City shall coordinate with businesses and employers to
          organize and facilitate transportation commuter fairs that provide
          information on carpools, vanpools, transit, bicycling, and other
          alternative commute modes to the single occupant vehicle, as well
          as the advantages and costs savings of alternative forms of
          transportation.
   4.8    The City shall support and promote SANDAG’s regional iCommute
          program that encourages the reduction of the use of the single
          occupancy vehicle.
   4.9    The City shall look for opportunities to incorporate TDM programs
          into their Energy Roadmap that contributes to state and regional
          goals for saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
   4.10   The City shall maintain curb use priorities that consider, in
          descending order, the needs of through traffic, transit stops, bus
          turnouts, passenger loading needs, and short- and long-term
          parking.

NCTD has prepared the 2011 Mobility Plan to provide a road map for
fundamentally restructuring NCTD’s services and enhancing the area’s role as
the mobility manager for its area. The primary purpose of the plan is to enable
NCTD to make the best use of available resources to provide the best
possible mobility options to its residents.
Based on the proposed transit service for the City of Oceanside shown within
the 2011 Mobility Plan, the following corridors will be served by transit in the
future:
    •   Avenida del Oro
    •   Avenida de la Plata
    •   Coast Highway
    •   College Boulevard
    •   Corporate Center Drive
    •   Douglas Drive
    •   El Camino Real
    •   Melrose Drive
    •   Mesa Drive
    •   Mission Avenue
    •   North River Road
    •   North Santa Fe Avenue
    •   Oceanside Boulevard
    •   Rancho Del Oro Drive
    •   Vandegrift Boulevard
    •   Vista Way
Figure 5.2 (page 55) depicts the future major transit corridors in the City of
Oceanside. These major transit corridors are based on the proposed service
information available in the 2011 Mobility Plan which is included in Appendix
H.

6.1       Bicycle Facilities
Building on the efforts of the Bicycle Master Plan, the following goals,
objectives, and policies were developed in close cooperation with City staff
and community stakeholders. Together, they represent the fundamental
criteria for the City of Oceanside’s planned bikeway system.
GOAL 1:        Provide a safe, interconnected network of bicycle facilities
               within Oceanside for recreational and commuter users.
GOAL 2:        Make bicycling a viable mode choice in an effort to reduce
               congestion, improve air quality, and provide residents and
               visitors with public health and recreational benefits.
OBJECTIVES:
        i.    Ensure the bikeway system will endeavor to be a complete
              system emphasizing local and regional continuity and
              connectivity.
       ii.    Design the bikeway system to be destination-oriented, especially
              towards employment centers, residential areas, and high use
              activity centers – including access to other modes of local and
              regional transportation systems.
      iii.    Ensure safety along the bikeway system by focusing on
              maximum visibility for the cyclist, signage, bikeway segment
              selection, and utilizing easily-recognized markers to clearly identify
              paths, lanes and routes.
      iv.     Conform to the minimum design standards established by Caltrans
              Highway Design Manual Chapter 1000.
       v.     Regularly maintain bikeway system segments and facilities.
      vi.     Implement bikeway system design and layout to minimize the
              City’s and adjacent property owners’ liability exposure to issues
              such as trespassing, loss of privacy, damage, and property loss
              associated with bike routes.
     vii.     Whenever possible, develop bikeway system design and layout
              to minimize potential financial burden to the City by engaging
              development to implement bike segments, locating segments
              within the existing right-of-way, and minimizing the need for
              acquisition.
    viii.     Whenever possible, construct the bikeway system to utilize

Prior to the adoption of the Bicycle Master Plan, the City had a series of
additional planned facilities slated for implementation.
These facilities mirror the goals, objectives, and policies above, and provide
guidance to City staff on the ways in which to best implement the
improvements as defined in previous iterations of the Circulation Element and
those additional recommendations developed as part of the Bicycle Master
Plan.

District sidewalks are sidewalks along roads that support heavy pedestrian           To School
levels in mixed-use concentrated urban areas. Usually, the district is an            Programs
urbanized area with special functions, such as theater districts, office parks,
shopping centers, or college campuses.                                            • Provide

Corridor Sidewalks                                                                   Pedestrian
Corridor sidewalks are defined as sidewalks along roads that support                 Facilities at
moderate density business and shopping districts with moderate pedestrian            Transit
levels. They can range from wide sidewalks along boulevards to small                 Stations and
sidewalks along a heavily auto oriented roadway.                                     Bus Stops
Connector Sidewalks
Connector sidewalks tend to have low pedestrian levels and are along roads
with moderate to high average vehicular traffic. Connector sidewalks tend to
be long and, in some cases, do not have accessible land uses directly
adjacent to the sidewalk.
Neighborhood Sidewalks
Neighborhood sidewalks are sidewalks along roads that support low to
moderate density housing with low to moderate pedestrian levels.
Neighborhood streets and their associated walkways are generally lower
volume streets, with low to moderate widths, single lanes in each direction,
and posted speed limits of 25 miles per hour.

Ancillary Pedestrian Facilities
Ancillary Pedestrian Facilities are facilities away from or crossing over streets
such as plazas, paseos, promenades, courtyards or pedestrian bridges and
stairways. Many of these ancillary facilities attract local residents and workers,
generating moderate to high pedestrian use.
Paths
Paths are paved facilities with exclusive right-of-ways that act as corridors and
have little or no vehicular cross flows. Many of these paths are exclusive to
pedestrians and bicycles and are not associated with streets.
Trails
Unpaved walkways or roads used for recreational use or open space
maintenance are classified as Trails. Trails are separated from roads and
support activities such as hiking, biking and walking primarily through parks
and open space.
As part of developing the Pedestrian Master Plan, the areas of high pedestrian
activity within the City of Oceanside were identified. This was done through
the use of a Pedestrian Priority Model which combines pedestrian generators,
attractors, barriers, and detractor issues to identify areas that have high
generators, attractors, barriers, and detractors. This model helped identify the
areas within Oceanside where pedestrians are most likely to be, either
currently or if improvements were made. Figure 7.1 depicts the pedestrian
activity levels within the City of Oceanside for both existing and potential
pedestrian activity areas.

The goals and policies contained in this chapter were taken from the
Pedestrian Master Plan (PMP), as the PMP is a planning document consistent
with the Circulation Element for the City’s long range pedestrian planning
efforts.
GOAL 1:    Develop and maintain a safe pedestrian network that is free
           of barriers and hazards; that has sufficient lighting, signs,
           signals, street crossings, and buffers from vehicular traffic
           in order to create a sense of security for the pedestrian.
           Utilize corrective measures through engineering, education,
           and enforcement.
GOAL 2:    Create pedestrian environments that encourage walking
           through the use of public art, street trees, furnishings, and
           other amenities. Ensure a positive walking environment by
           making the pedestrian feel protected, comfortable and
           connected with the environment and the City.
GOAL 3:    Develop a complete pedestrian network that provides
           continuous and convenient access to transit, employment
           centers, retail, neighborhoods, schools, beaches, parks,
           public places and other essential pedestrian destinations.
GOAL 4:    Ensure that pedestrian facilities meet local, State and federal
           access requirements. Utilize “Universal Access” principles
           that go beyond the minimum standards, since all pedestrians
           benefit from this approach.
GOAL 5:    Support walking as a primary means of transportation that in
           turn supports transit and bike options. A positive walking
           environment is essential for supporting smart growth,
           mixed land uses, transit oriented development, traffic
           calming and reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse
           gas emissions.
GOAL 6:    When walkable communities are provided, they enhance
           neighborhood quality by providing opportunities for social
           interaction, enhanced economic development and healthy
           lifestyles. A walkable community can provide clarity to the
           physical organization of neighborhoods by making people
           familiar with their environment.
GOAL 7:    Identify funding for pedestrian facilities to encourage walking
           as a key form of transportation within the City. Develop an
           action priority plan to acquire funding for pedestrian facilities
           to create an economical and efficient pedestrian network
           within Oceanside by partnering with private interests and
           other public agencies.

PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS
The Pedestrian Master Plan indentified several pedestrian issues concerned
with missing sidewalks, safety, accessibility, walkability, and connectivity. All
of the issues identified as part of the Pedestrian Master Plan were prioritized
into the top 25 projects based on a ranking system that was developed. The
list of top 25 priority projects is shown in Table 7-1. A more detailed
assessment of each of the 25 projects is included in the Pedestrian Master
Plan (November 2009).             The Pedestrian Master Plan is included in
Appendix B.

The following technologies are either currently in use or under development by      within
the City:                                                                           Oceanside

Central Signal Management System is a centralized software application              Potential Ones
used to monitor and manage traffic signals within the City. This system was         for the Future
updated in 2010 to the new regional standard known as the Regional Arterial
Management System (RAMS). This system is also known regionally as
QuicNet. This system allows City staff to remotely monitor signal operations
and alerts for all signals that have communications back to the City Traffic
Management Center (TMC).            The system also allows for centralized
management of coordinated signal timing plans for corridors. The recently
upgraded system also allows for shared monitoring of City, Caltrans
interchange, and neighboring jurisdiction signals where agreed to by the
agencies involved. Finally, use of this system ensures the City retains
consistency with the rest of the agencies in the region in terms of signal
operations and providing relevant data to traveler information systems.
Advanced Signal Control Options allow for more advanced approaches to
signal operations beyond the traditional application of fixed timing plans for
different times of the day. Ranging from what is termed responsive to
adaptive, these approaches can be deployed along corridors or in key areas
to allow the signal operations to adapt to rapidly changing traffic flows and
conditions. In 2010, the City initiated efforts on College Boulevard to test
some of these options to assess where they may be most effectively applied.
Emergency Preemption System is the hardware and software comprising a
system that provides for the altering of standard traffic signal timings and

                                                                                         ELEMENT
sequences to efficiently accommodate approaching emergency vehicles in
order to reduce response times. The City has already deployed an
emergency preemption system at all signalized intersections. As this system
is very useful for assisting in emergency response, the maintenance and
lifecycle replacement should be considered over time.
Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a
signal to a specific place on a limited set of monitors. The video cameras
would usually be mounted on poles or other street fixtures to view traffic
flows at intersections, roadways, highways, or bridges. In many cases,
cameras used for detection purposes for signal operations can also provide
video feeds to allow for real-time remote viewing of traffic conditions. In
2010, the City commenced design and installation of expanded traffic video
monitoring capabilities with video feeds being brought to the City TMC.
Driver Feedback Signs and Devices are deployed to inform drivers of their
speed as they approach and pass a particular location in relation to the
posted speed limit. These devices can also collect data regarding
approaching and passing speeds of vehicles, as well as volumes of vehicles,
to assist City engineers in determining the effectiveness of speed control
measures. The City has deployed some of these devices and will have 11
sites operational in the near-term. Additional sites are planned for the future
with potential wireless communications to provide data back to the TMC.
Transportation Management Center serves as the central data collection
center where real time information is gathered from many sources such CCTV
cameras and traffic signals. The information received at the TMC would
enable City traffic engineers to monitor and optimize traffic in real time to
ensure a fast, intelligent and coordinated response is made to improve traffic
operations on the circulation system. This information and the associated
response measures are usually managed through a software application
known as an Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS). Aside from the
use of immediately improving the efficiency of the circulation system, the TMC
can monitor and provide traveler information (with the use of changeable
message signs) during peak traffic periods and/or emergency situations. In
addition, the TMC allows traffic engineers to monitor and adjust traffic signal
plans during special events, as well as implement real-time transportation
management measures at incident locations. The TMC is equipped to
operate as the primary location for the City’s Emergency Operation Center. If
a natural disaster were to occur, the TMC would provide emergency personnel
with up-to-date information to share with officials and citizens. Finally, the City
TMC could coordinate with partner TMCs operated by other cities and
Caltrans to more readily respond to regional conditions that impact
transportation in the City of Oceanside.
The City of Oceanside has completed Phase I of the Transportation
Management Center. Phase II is currently underway, which consists of
preparing plans to install a fiber optic backbone along Coast Highway,
Oceanside Boulevard, El Camino Real, and College Boulevard, a 16-panel
video wall, and 35 of the proposed CCTV cameras at key signalized

intersections. It is expected that additional phases would follow as funding
becomes available.
Potential ITS Applications Under Consideration for Future Use:
The following technologies are being considered for potential future
deployment and use within the City of Oceanside:
Changeable Message Signs are electronic traffic signs often used on
roadways to give travelers information about traffic congestions, accidents,
incidents, roadwork zones, or speed limits on a specific segment. In urban
areas, they can also be used for parking guidance and information. As of
2010, the City had commenced design to support a limited deployment of
changeable message signs. When these signs are installed, they will be
managed from the City TMC to provide information and assist in traffic
direction during special events, incidents, and other similar situations. Unlike
their freeway counterparts, these signs are generally smaller and deployed to
more readily match the scale of the city environment.
Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is an operational strategy that facilitates the
movement of buses through predefined traffic-signal controlled intersections.
The objectives of TSP include improved schedule adherence and improved
transit travel time efficiency while minimizing impacts to normal traffic
operations. Standards for TSP have been established regionally, but the City
has not yet implemented these types of measures.
Arterial Speed and Conditions Detection is a method used to more
rigorously monitor arterial speeds and queues similar to the specialized
detection that is in place along much of the regions freeway network. Devices
are placed in or alongside the roadbed to detect vehicles as they pass for
counting the number of vehicles and speeds during a unit of time (typically
60 seconds). This information can be used for traffic conditions monitoring by
staff at the TMC, for reporting information to traveler information systems such
as 511, and for long-term monitoring of traffic speeds and trends. The City
has not yet implemented these types of solutions, but regional tests are
underway that may promote future deployment within the City.
511 Program is a regionwide program for providing near real-time traveler
information for auto and transit users. Information can be accessed by
phone (by dialing 5-1-1) or through the Internet. The goal is to provide a
single source for traveler information data and conditions in the San Diego
region. The information provided through 511 is subject to data made
available by local, regional, and State agencies. The regional 511 Program
has already been deployed and is managed by SANDAG, and information
would be provided through the TMC and the various systems that the City of
Oceanside deploys.
Smart Parking Systems can be deployed to provide information to travelers
on available parking in constrained or high demand parking environments.
For example, some California coastal cities have deployed these systems to
Intelligent Transportation Systems           Page | 78                           September 2012
                                                                                  CIRCULATION
                                                                                      ELEMENT
inform visitors of available beach parking spaces and provide directions to lots
with available parking that may not be readily visible from major
thoroughfares. Systems vary, but are generally deployed to detect vehicles in
individual spaces or more commonly compare vehicles entering and leaving
controlled parking lots. Information has typically been made available through
specialize electronic signage, but many cities are now using Internet
webpages or mobile device information options.
Street Lights Management includes systems to enhance energy and
maintenance efficiency for City provided street lights along roads and other
transportation facilities. The system can be used to dim lights in areas where
no traffic or activity is present. In addition, the system can monitor and
provide alerts for burned out bulbs, which allows for more focused
maintenance and replacement. When combined with LED and low energy
lighting options, this approach can improve safety and save energy.
Summary of ITS Device Deployment and Supporting Communications
The City of Oceanside has identified 58 intersections that will be connected to
the TMC with CCTVs. Figure 9.1 (page 81) shows the City of Oceanside’s
traffic signal communication system. Table 9-1 shows the first 35 of the 58
