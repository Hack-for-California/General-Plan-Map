The Land Use Element serves as the long-range planning guide for development in the City by indicating the location and extent of development to be allowed.  More than any other element, the Land Use Element will shape the way our community develops over the next twenty years.  The Land Use Element serves as a guide to public officials and private citizens for decisions regarding the type, intensity and general distribution of uses of land for housing, business, industry, and open space.  The Element provides public officials with the framework for providing public facilities, services and directing new development.  

The essential components of the Land Use Element are the General Plan Land Use Map and the goals and policies that guide future development.  While the General Plan Land Use Map is an essential component of the entire General Plan, it also provides a graphic representation of the goals and policies expressed by all of the General Plan’s elements.  Users of this document are advised to refer to the goals, policies and the Land Use Map when evaluating proposed development and improvements.


2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

The State of California Government Code Section 65302(a) 65302 (a)(1) requires that a General Plan include:

“…a A Land Use Element that which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities and other categories or public and private uses of land…”

The Land Use Element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.

3.0	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1 	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

Placentia has grown into a community of approximately 48,200 51,932 residents.1  The general layout and land use pattern of the City has stayed relatively consistent throughout the years.  The City of Placentia consists primarily of residential uses located throughout the City.  Open space uses are generally located adjacent to residential uses and school facilities.  Commercial uses are concentrated along primary arterials in the eastern and western portions of the City and Industrial uses occur in the southern portion of the City adjacent to the rail line.  The oldest section of the City is located adjacent to Bradford Avenue and the Santa Fe Railroad.  

The City of Placentia is approaching build-out conditions.  New development within the City has focused on remaining vacant parcels.  Based upon existing development and remaining developable land, the City is approximately 98 percent built-out.  Approximately 84 acres are either vacant or under developed.  Remaining vacant parcels of land in Placentia are primarily in the southern portion of the City and are designated for Industrial and Commercial uses.    

Table 2-1, Existing Land Use Distribution, quantifies the amount of acreage devoted to each land use, as well as the existing number of dwelling units or square footage within each category.  The planning area for the Placentia General Plan encompasses approximately 3,473.5 acres.

The Land Use Element serves as the primary means of integrating the policies in other elements of the General Plan with the proposed pattern of land uses designated on the General Plan Land Use Map.  The Circulation Element provides for the maintenance of a transportation network that will support the ultimate land uses established on the land use map.  The Housing Element contains policies for residential development, which are also considered in the Land Use Element.  The Open Space and Recreation Element identifies sites for community open space uses and contains policies to enhance open space and recreational resources within the City.  The Resources Management Element identifies policies related to air quality, water resources, cultural resources and recreation.  The Growth Management Element contains policies that will allow for growth and development based upon the City’s ability to provide an adequate circulation system and public facilities.  The Safety Element identifies potential hazards that may occur within the land use planning areas.  Noise contours identified in the Noise Element are used as a guide to establish the land use patterns to ensure that future development minimizes exposure of residents to excessive noise.  

The guidelines identified in the Land Use Element form an umbrella of land use designations and generalized land use patterns that set the policy of how the City will develop and what it wants to accomplish with its development.  Several other planning tools are used to implement the policies for land use set forth in this document.  These tools include the City’s zoning ordinance, redevelopment plans, specific plans and development agreements.  

3.2.1	PLACENTIA’S ZONING CODE

The City of Placentia Zoning Code is a regulatory document that provides a means to implement the policies illustrated in City of Placentia’s General Plan.  While the General Plan provides long-range and broad categories of land use, the Zoning Code provides specific development requirements, such as density, height, size and development character.  Similar to the General Plan, a zoning map accompanies the Zoning Ordinance and defines the boundaries of each zoning district. 

The City of Placentia’s Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 23 Title 23 of the Placentia Municipal Code) establishes land use zoning districts that provide for uniform regulations to properties similarly situated within each zoning classification.  State of California law requires the City’s Zoning Code be in conformance with the General Plan.

3.2.2	REDEVELOPMENT PLANS

State of California redevelopment law enables jurisdictions to adopt Redevelopment Plans.  Redevelopment plans are intended to revitalize and rehabilitate opportunity areas.  Redevelopment plans provide a means for government agencies to encourage private reinvestment in blighted areas through initial governmental assistance.  Because redevelopment projects must be in conformance with the General Plan, these plans are one of the more powerful means cities have to implement the goals and policies set forth in their General Plan.

As shown in Exhibit 2-2, Redevelopment Project Area, two redevelopment project areas have been adopted by the City of Placentia.  The original Placentia Redevelopment Project area consisting of 155.8 acres, was adopted in 1983.  In 1990, the City added 90.8 acres to the original Redevelopment Project area bringing the total redevelopment area to 246.6 acres.  Land uses within the Project area include commercial, industrial park, school and park uses.  

3.2.3	SPECIFIC PLANS

Specific Plans are designed to implement General Plan goals and policies by designating land uses, densities, development standards and design standards in more specific detail.  A Specific Plan addresses smaller areas that have unique qualities and require focused planning attention.  The City of Placentia has adopted several Specific Plans.  

The Placentia Westgate Urban Transit Oriented Development (TOD) project area consists of a one-half mile radius circle centered approximately about the Melrose/ Crowther intersection.  The purpose of the TOD project is to create moderate and high density housing, with complementary public uses, jobs, retail and services concentrated in a mixed-use development along a regional transit system.  Potential uses within the TOD project area may include:

?	Transportation Center including Metrolink Station;
?	Office;
?	Commercial/Retail;
?	Museum;
?	Housing;
?	Senior Housing;
?	Community Center;
?	Plazas/Open Space;
?	Hotels;
?	Restaurants;
?	Educational Facilities; and
?	Police Substation.

4.0	LAND USE PLAN

4.1 	OVERVIEW OF THE LAND USE PLAN

General Plan land use designations describe the type and intensity of development allowed in a specific area. While terms like “residential”, “commercial”, or “industrial” are generally understood, State General Plan law requires a clear and concise description of the land use categories that are depicted on the General Plan Land Use Map (refer to Exhibit 2-3, General Plan Land Use Map).  The General Plan Land Use Map indicates the location of the land use designations within the City.  The acreages of the various land uses on the General Plan Land Use Map are presented in Table 2-3, 2020 General Plan Land Use.

4.2 	LAND USE DESIGNATIONS

The Land Use Element and General Plan Land Use Map contain the following ten land use designations:

?	Low Density Residential
?	Medium Density Residential
?	High Density Residential
?	Commercial
?	Santa Fe Commercial
?	Commercial – Manufacturing 
?	Office
?	Industrial
?	Schools
?	Open Space

The General Plan Land Use Map indicates the location of General Plan land use designations within the City.  

LAND USE INTENSITY/DENSITY

State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element indicate the maximum building intensities/densities allowed in the City.  The Land Use Element contains ten building land use designations; each allowing certain land uses and corresponding intensity/density standards (refer to Table 2-4, Land Use Designations and Density/ Intensity Standards).  Table 2-4 also includes the expected overall levels of development within each land use designation.

The term “intensity” refers to the degree of development based on a building’s characteristics such as, floor area ratio (FAR), building height and lot coverage.  Intensity is most often used to describe non-residential development. 

Table 2-4
2020 General Plan Land Use Designations Intensity/Density Standards

Net densities may be lower, dependant on zoning requirements and other regulatory considerations.
(2)	Total dwelling units and square footage estimates based upon existing acreage multiplied by gross density/intensity standards.

The measure of intensity, known as floor area ratio (FAR), provides the most convenient method of describing levels of development.  The floor area ratio is the relationship of total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot in square feet to the total land area of the lot in square feet expressed as a ratio.  The FAR describes use intensity on a lot, but not the actual building height and lot coverage.  

The term “density” is a measure of the population or residential development capacity of a designated land use.  Residential density is described in terms of dwelling units per gross area (du/ac).  A dwelling unit is a building or a portion of a building used for human habitation and may vary considerably in size (square footage).  For purposes of calculating population, an average number of persons per acre or dwelling unit for all types and sizes of dwelling units is assumed.

5.0	PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES

The Land Use Element goals and policies provide direction for future growth and development in Placentia, while minimizing existing and potential land use conflicts.  The goals and policies are designed to encourage:

?	Balanced Development with Economic Growth;
?	Compatible and Complementary Development;
?	Revitalization of Existing Uses and Properties;
?	Effective and Balanced Development;
?	Long-Term Citywide Economic Development;
?	Provision of Infrastructure and Services; and
?	Opportunities for Economic Monitoring.

BALANCE DEVELOPMENT WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH

Planning Factor

The City of Placentia has a diverse range of local residential and commercial uses.  While the City provides a range of land use types, it also competes with surrounding jurisdictions for basic services (groceries, retail, etc.).  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the City to establish a land use pattern that balances economic development with land use decisions.
Goal	LU-1	Provide a well-balanced land use pattern that accommodates existing and future needs for housing, commercial, industrial and open space/recreation uses, while providing adequate community services to City residents.

Policies	LU-1.1	Preserve singlefamily neighborhoods in Placentia which are economically and physically sound.

LU-1.2	Allow for multifamily infill in designated areas to satisfy regional housing needs.

LU-1.3	Encourage commercial center development and redevelopment to provide employment and a strong fiscal base for the City.

LU-1.4	Encourage mixed use development within the Placita Santa Fe area. Provide incentives for senior citizen and multifamily housing.

LU-1.5	Where feasible, increase the amount and network of public and private open space and recreational facilities for active or passive recreation as well as for visual relief.

COMPATIBLE AND COMPLEMENTARY DEVELOPMENT

Planning Factor

Compatible and complementary development is a key element to highly functional, economically viable and livable communities.  The provision of a functional relationship between land uses will promote a more walkable environment and reduce impacts on the existing circulation system.

The City of Placentia also seeks to enhance future land uses so that they promote compatible and complementary development.  Future redevelopment of the Placita Santa Fe area is one example of the City’s desire for compatible mixed-use development.

The City has identified transportation impacts associated with land use as one of the primary challenges associated with compatible and complementary development.  The City understands that land uses integration will contribute to the reduction in infrastructure need and utilization.

LONG-TERM CITYWIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Planning Factor

The City of Placentia desires a stronger connection between land use planning and its relationship to long-term citywide economic development.  Economic development relies heavily on the connection between land use planning decisions, and therefore should be a consideration for all land use policy decisions.  The City of Placentia should seek to establish a strong connection between the need to expand and improve its economic base and the type and distribution of land uses citywide.   The establishment of progressive land use and economic development strategies should be implemented to ensure long-term economic success.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The Circulation Element represents the City’s overall transportation plan.  The transportation plan consists not only of the physical transportation system itself, such as streets, highways, bicycle routes and sidewalks, but also various modes of transportation, such as cars, buses, trucks, rail, bicycles, ridesharing and walking.  Circulation also refers to the movement of people and goods and products within and through the City.  The circulation and transportation system provides an important role in shaping the overall structure and form of the City, in that it both divides and connects land uses at the same time. 

The Circulation Element specifies the system of roadways and other transportation infrastructure required to satisfy future travel demand.  The Circulation Element is related to the Land Use Element, since the circulation system must adequately handle future traffic conditions and provide the means to move people and goods through and within the City of Placentia.  

The Circulation Element identifies and establishes the City’s policies governing the system of roadways, intersections, bike paths, pedestrian ways and other components of the circulation system, which collectively provide for the movement of people and goods throughout the City.  The Circulation Element established official City policy that:

?	Identifies the transportation facilities required to serve present and future vehicular and non-vehicular travel demand in the City;

?	Identifies linkages between alternative modes of transportation and feasible alternative transit strategies; and

?	Identifies strategies to implement the City’s circulation system. 

2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

The State of California Government Code Section 65302 (b)(1) requires that a General Plan include:

“A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals… and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.”

3.0	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1 	RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS

MEASURE M- GROWTH MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (GMP)

As a result of the Orange County Measure M (a ½-percent sales tax increase), passed by Orange County voters in 1988 1990 and renewed by the voters in 2006, all Orange County cities are required to develop a Growth Management Program (GMP).  The stated purpose of the GMP is to ensure that the planning, management and implementation of traffic improvements and public facilities are adequate to meet the current and projected mobility needs of Orange County.  

A traffic Level of Service (LOS) policy is to be established by each City, whereby LOS “D” or better is to be designated as the overall goal.  However, it is recognized that some arterials are influenced by traffic factors beyond the control of the City; therefore, a lower LOS goal may be adopted for certain arterials.  A Deficient Intersection List must also be developed for “problem” locations, and if future developments significantly impact these locations, they may provide mitigation in the form of pro-rate share fees.  

The overall objective of the GMP is to ensure that new developments provide their fair share of public facilities and that services and infrastructure keep pace with anticipated growth.  The program calls for an annual evaluation of compliance with LOS policies, a development phasing program, participation and interaction with other jurisdictions (Growth Management Areas or GMA’s) to prioritize and receive funding for regional transportation improvements, provision of a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) trip reduction program.  In summary, the GMP requires development of a comprehensive program to ensure that improvement of public facilities keeps pace with development, and that new developments provide their fair share of those improvements.    
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (CMP)

	In June 1990, California voters approved Proposition 111, which established a 9 percent per gallon gas tax, staged over a 5-year period, for the purpose of funding transportation-related improvements statewide.  Congestion Management Program (CMP) legislation (originally AB 471, amended to AB 1791) requires every urbanized county with a population of 50,000 or more to adopt a CMP in order to be eligible for gasoline tax revenues associated with Proposition 111.  

	The CMP has an established Highway System (CMPHS), which consists of principal local arterials, Smart Streets and State Highways.  In the City of Placentia, Imperial Highway, Orangethorpe Avenue and Rose Drive are included on the CMP Highway System.  The intersections of Rose Drive–Tustin Avenue/Orangethorpe Avenue, SR-57 NB Ramps/Orangethorpe Avenue, SR-57 SB Ramps/Orangethorpe Avenue and Rose Drive/Imperial Highway are designated as CMP intersections.  A minimum operating LOS of LOS “E” is required on CMP facilities, unless the facility was operating at a worse level when the baseline counts were conducted in 1991.  Cities will be required to maintain LOS “E” or better (or baseline levels, if worse than “E”) on the CMPHS.  

	The CMPHS is monitored through CMP requirements and minimum Level of Service standards must be maintained in order to remain eligible for the gas tax revenues.  One alternative to physical mitigation (widening streets, adding lanes at intersections, etc) is to develop a deficiency plan, whereby the CMPHS system as a whole is improved and air quality benefits are provided.  

	An important aspect of the CMP regulations is the requirement that new developments mitigate any significant traffic impacts to the CMPHS.  This means that cities need to develop a review process whereby the traffic impacts of new projects are evaluated and impacts mitigated.  This serves to ensure that the LOS standards on the CMPHS are maintained.  In addition, the CMP contains requirements such as a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) submittal, a trip reduction program (TDM) and the need for inter-jurisdictional coordination.  

	SCAG REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY AND 
CONTROL MEASURES

	The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the local air quality agency that establishes local air quality goals.  The SCAQMD recently adopted the 2003 AQMP, which relies on a partnership of governmental agencies to achieve federal and state standards for improved air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB).  At the regional level, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) assists sub-regional and local governments in the air quality elements of transportation planning.  SCAG is responsible for the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP), which include transportation improvement projects that could have significant air quality impacts.  The region must demonstrate that its transportation plans and programs conform to the mandate to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in a timely manner.     
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) was designed to reduce peak hour traffic through carpooling, vanpooling, transit and parking incentives, provision of at-work support services, and other programs.  As a result of this focus and by requirement of the Orange County GMP, all Orange County cities have adopted a Trip Reduction Ordinance.  The City’s Trip Reduction Ordinance is provided in the Placentia Municipal Code.  

3.2	EXISTING CONDITIONS

Placentia shares borders with the Cities of Brea to the north, Fullerton to the west, Anaheim to the south and Yorba Linda to the east.  The Cities of Placentia, Brea and Yorba Linda collaborate as the Tri-City Area on inner-city transportation and land use issues.  Many of the arterial roadways through the City of Placentia extend beyond the City boundaries into neighboring cities.  Circulation issues and travel patterns, likewise, extend beyond the Placentia City limits.  Land use decisions and traffic patterns in these adjacent cities have the potential to affect the quality of traffic flow and mobility in the City of Placentia, and conversely, traffic conditions and decisions made by the City of Placentia can affect its neighbors.  

3.2.1	REGIONAL ACCESS

Regional access to the City of Placentia is provided by the Orange Freeway (SR-57) to the west side of the City, and the Riverside Freeway (SR-91), which is south of Placentia, in the City of Anaheim.  

North-south arterials that extend through and beyond the City of Placentia include Placentia Avenue, Kraemer Boulevard and Rose Drive.  East-west arterials that extend through and beyond the city limits are Imperial Highway, Bastanchury Road, Yorba Linda Boulevard, Chapman Avenue and Orangethorpe Avenue.  Imperial Highway, Yorba Linda Boulevard, Orangethorpe Avenue and Chapman Avenue have full interchanges with SR-57 Freeway.  

3.2.2	LOCAL ACCESS

Smaller north-south roadways that do not provide continuous north-south travel through the City include; Bradford Avenue and Melrose Street to the west side of the City, Valencia Avenue and Central Avenue in the central part of the City, and Jefferson Street, Van Buren Street and Richfield Road on the east side of the City.  Other, smaller east-west roadways include Golden Avenue on the north side of the City and Palm Drive, Madison Avenue, Buena Vista Avenue, Alta Vista Avenue and Crowther Avenue in the central and southern areas of the City.  

3.2.3	ROADWAY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

The City of Placentia circulation system consists of a network of local streets providing access to the arterial street system, which in turn provides access to the regional freeway system.  This network provides access to adjacent land uses and facilitates the movement of persons and goods to and from, within and through the City.  The design and operation of each street is determined by emphasis placed on each of these functions.  Streets that have a mobility and/or regional access function will typically have more lanes, higher speed limits and fewer driveways.  Where access to properties is required, streets typically have fewer lanes, lower speeds, parking and more frequent driveways to serve abutting properties.  
	
To define the intended uses of roadways, many jurisdictions, including Placentia, use a functional classification system.  The classification system provides a standard for the design and operation of the roadway system.  The City of Placentia classification system references and is consistent with County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH).  The following street classifications have been identified:

?	Major Arterial:  120 feet of right-of-way;
?	Modified Major Arterial:  100 feet right-of-way;
?	Primary Arterial:  100 feet right-of-way;
?	Modified Primary Arterial:  80 feet right-of-way;
?	Secondary Arterial:  80 feet right-of-way; and
?	Modified Secondary Arterial:  64 feet right-of-way.

	Table 3-1, City of Placentia Roadway Classifications and Exhibit 3-1, Functional Roadway Classifications, indicate the existing functional classification for the arterial roadways in the City of Placentia.

The transit needs of the City of Placentia are provided primarily by the Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA), with the opportunity to transfer to other transit systems from some OCTA bus routes.    

The OCTA operates six routes in the City of Placentia:

?	Route 20 operates between the Cities of La Habra and Yorba Linda via Imperial Highway and serves a very small area of Placentia in the northeast corner of the City.  This route provides connecting service to Norwalk Transit at Imperial and Beach, in the City of La Habra.  

?	Route 24 operates between the Cities of Fullerton and Orange, traveling along Chapman Avenue in the City of Placentia.  This route provides connecting service to a number of Los Angeles MTA routes at stops in the City of Fullerton and Riverside RTA routes at the Village in Orange.

?	Route 30 operates between the Cities of Cerritos and Anaheim, traveling along Orangethorpe Avenue.  This route provides connecting service to Los Angeles MTA, Long Beach Transit, Norwalk Transit and City of Cerritos bus routes at stops in the City of Cerritos.  

?	Route 53 operates between the Cities of Brea and Irvine, traveling along Placentia Avenue at the west City boundary.  This route provides connecting service to the Los Angeles MTA bus system at the Brea Mall. Foothill Transit at the Brea Mall. 

?	Route 59 provides service between the Cities of Brea and Irvine, traveling along Kraemer Boulevard in the City of Placentia.  This route provides connecting service to the Los Angeles MTA bus system at the Brea Mall. AMTRAC and METROLINK rail systems at the Orange Transportation Center and The Depot at Santa Ana. 

?	Route 213 provides service between the Cities of Brea and Irvine, traveling along Chapman Avenue and Kraemer Boulevard in the City of Placentia.  This route provides connecting service to the Los Angeles MTA bus system at the Brea Mall. AMTRAK and METROLINK rail systems at the Fullerton Transportation Center and the Village in Orange. 
           
3.2.5	BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES

Existing Bikeways in the City of Placentia are shown on Exhibit 3-2, Existing Bikeways.  Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes are provided on a number of roadways throughout the City of Placentia.  The bike system provides bicyclists with connections between neighborhoods, parks, schools and other neighborhood and recreational facilities.  Most City bikeways are either Class II - on-street bike lanes with markings on the pavement adjacent to the curb or Class III – on-road bike routes designated by signs only.

Sidewalks are provided on most arterial roadways and on most residential streets.  In the southern part of the City, roadways adjacent to the railway often do not have sidewalks on the rail side of the street.  

3.2.6	TRUCK ROUTES

The City of Placentia has designated selected roadways as truck routes to provide for the authorized movement of trucks through the City.  Truck routes allow for the movement of truck traffic on designated streets where they would cause the least amount of neighborhood intrusion and where noise and other impacts on residential areas and other sensitive land uses would be minimized.  Roadways providing access to the freeways are the most likely candidates for truck route designation.  Designated truck routes in the City of Placentia are illustrated on Exhibit 3-3, Truck Routes.  The designation of truck routes does not prevent trucks from using other roads or streets to make deliveries or for other reasons as defined in the State of California Motor Vehicle Code.  

3.2.7	RAIL TRANSPORTATION

The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) operates a freight rail line along the “Orangethorpe Corridor” that connects the ports of Los Angeles with the Inland Empire and the Midwest United States.  The Orangethorpe Corridor traverses several northern Orange County cities, including Fullerton, Placentia, Yorba Linda and Anaheim. Within the City of Placentia, the rail line crosses through Old Town, and intersects Richfield Road and Lakeview Avenue while traveling alongside Crowther Avenue into the City of Anaheim. 

Under current conditions approximately 50 trains per day travel through the Orangethorpe rail corridor.  The number of trains is projected to increase to 135 per day by the year 2020.  This train traffic halts all pedestrian and automobile traffic at each of the numerous at-grade crossings of arterials within the Orange County communities.  With projected increases in train activity also come increased delay, noise, air pollution, resident inconvenience and increased accident potential.

The City of Placentia has joined with the City of Anaheim and the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) to form the Orange North-American Trade Rail Access Corridor (OnTrac) Authority, a joint powers authority (JPA) established in 2000.  The City of Placentia is the lead agency of the OnTrac JPA, whose purpose is to accomplish the Orangethorpe Avenue Grade Separation project.  This project is a 5-mile long railroad-lowering project that will lower the tracks into a trench below grade level, thereby grade separating 11 rail crossings in the cities of Placentia and Anaheim.  The portion of the OnTrac project located within the Cites of Placentia and Anaheim is known as the “Orange County Gateway”.      


3.3	ANALYSIS OF EXISTING OPERATING CONDITIONS

3.3.1	DAILY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITION FOR ROADWAYS

Level of Service is a term used to describe the operating conditions of a roadway on a daily basis, or an intersection on a peak hour basis.  When a street network carries traffic volumes that approach or exceed the network’s designed capacity, congestion occurs.  A roadway’s capacity is a function primarily of the number of lanes provided to carry traffic volumes, and whether or not the roadway is divided with a median or center turn lane.  The more lanes provided, the more capacity the roadway has to accommodate traffic demand.  Table 3-2, Daily Roadway Capacity by Roadway Type, is a summary of theoretical daily traffic-carrying capacity for each of the roadway types.  

Table 3-2
Daily Roadway Capacity by Roadway Type

Roadway TypeEstimated Daily Capacity (a)Major: 6-Lane Divided56,300 vpdPrimary: 4-Lane Divided37,500 vpdSecondary: 4-Lane Undivided25,000 vpdCollector:  2-Lane Undivided12,500 vpd(a)  Estimated daily capacity for Level of Service (LOS) E, expressed as vehicles per day (vpd).

These daily capacity values provide a general guideline as to the adequacy or deficiency of the roadway system.  The actual capacity of a roadway also depends on a combination of factors, including the presence or absence of intersection controls, signal timing, the frequency of driveways, on-street parking, the percentage of the daily traffic in the peak hour, the directionality of traffic in the peak hour and other factors.

The term Level of Service (LOS) is used to qualitatively describe prevailing conditions and their effect on traffic.  Broadly interpreted, the LOS concept denotes operating conditions along a roadway, based on the roadway capacity and the daily traffic volumes.  The LOS is related to the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C).  To determine the V/C ratio, the average daily traffic volume is divided by the link capacity.  There are six defined Levels of Service, A through F which describe conditions ranging from “ideal” to “worst” as defined in Table 3-3, Level of Service Descriptions.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS OF ROADWAYS

Existing average daily traffic (ADT) volumes were compared to roadway capacity to assess existing levels of service.  This analysis was based on existing daily traffic volumes compiled for the City-wide Traffic Model, which was completed in 2002.  Existing daily traffic volumes on roadway segments are presented in Exhibit 3-4, 2002 Daily Traffic Volumes.  For each roadway segment, the daily capacity was determined in accordance with the current facility type and existing number of lanes, and a V/C ratio was computed.  The resulting volumes and associated V/C ratios and LOS are summarized in Table 3-4, Level of Service on Roadway Segments Existing Conditions (2002).

The data in Table 3-4 indicates that the following roadway segments currently operate at LOS “E” or “F”:

?	Chapman Avenue: Placentia Avenue to Bradford Avenue – LOS E
?	Placentia Avenue: Nutwood Avenue to Chapman Avenue – LOS F
?	Lakeview Avenue: South of Orangethorpe Avenue – LOS F

3.3.2	PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITION FOR INTERSECTIONS

For peak hour operating conditions, intersections are analyzed using the Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) methodology as specified by the Orange County CMP.  The ICU methodology uses peak hour volumes on each approach to the intersection, number of lanes for each movement and lane capacities to calculate a volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C ratio) for each turning movement.  Critical movements are then identified and an ICU value is determined by summing the critical V/C ratios.  The ICU results are then related to LOS values, ranging from “A” to “F”, according to Table 3-5, Intersection Level of Service and Corresponding ICU Values.

4.0	DESCRIPTION OF CIRCULATION PLAN

4.1 	ANALYSIS OF BUILDOUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

Analysis of projected traffic conditions at build-out of the City was conducted to determine whether or not the City’s circulation system can accommodate the future traffic demands of the City’s land use plan.  The buildout year is assumed to be Year 2025.  If roadway or intersection deficiencies are projected to occur as a result of buildout of General Plan land uses, improvements needed to accommodate future traffic volumes will be identified.  

4.1.1 	METHODOLOGY

The methodology for evaluating future traffic volumes on the roadway segments and at intersections in Placentia is based on the following major premises:

?	The Circulation Element must be consistent with all other Elements of the General Plan, especially the Land Use Element, such that there is good balance between the transportation capacity to be provided and the travel demand to be generated by the buildout land uses.

?	The effects of increased traffic in Placentia due to growth and development in neighboring communities must be taken into consideration.  While “through” traffic is not encouraged, its presence must be recognized so that the Circulation Element can be responsive.

?	The City’s current circulation system is built out to its designated capacities, and is assumed to be the network for buildout analysis.  If improvements to the roadway system or intersections are needed to accommodate General Plan buildout, these will be recommended as mitigation measures.  

4.1.2	BUILDOUT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS

While the City of Placentia is almost fully developed, some parcels are still vacant, underdeveloped or have the potential for further development.  The Land Use Element of the General Plan quantifies the potential development on these underdeveloped and vacant parcels.  The remaining potential development on these parcels is estimated to consist of approximately 1,911,805 square feet of development (commercial, industrial or office) and 280 residential units.

For analysis of future traffic conditions, each parcel was identified in terms of its potential future land use, including the land use type (residential, retail, office, industrial, etc.) and the quantity of those land uses (dwelling units, thousand square feet, etc.).  The additional trips generated by the proposed developments were estimated and distributed on the surrounding road network.  

4.1.3	BUILDOUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ON ROADWAYS

Forecasted daily traffic volumes are presented on Exhibit 3-5, Buildout (2025) Daily Roadway Segment Traffic Volumes.  Forecasted operating conditions for Buildout Year 2025 are presented in Table 3-7, Level of Service on Roadway Segments, Buildout Conditions (2025). 

Table 3-7 indicates roadway segments would continue to operate at LOS D or better at buildout, with the exception of one roadway segment:

?	Placentia Avenue from Nutwood Avenue to Chapman Avenue, LOS F.

Placentia Avenue is classified as a Secondary Arterial.

RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS TO MITIGATE IMPACTS

Since the acceptable threshold for Level of Service is D, the segment referenced above is considered to be impacted.  Placentia Avenue from Nutwood Street to Chapman Avenue would need to be widened to four lanes divided in order to achieve the acceptable LOS threshold of D.  Additional capacity would be achieved through the addition of a center median.  It should be noted that the roadway currently allows on-street parallel parking on both sides of the street and that it already has a narrow center turn lane, allowing the road to function like a Primary Roadway, although constrained by the land widths and on-street parking.  Eliminating on-street parking on one or both sides would allow a full-width center turn lane to be installed with the existing curb-to-curb width.  Removal of on-street parking would impact adjacent development on the street.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The Open Space and Recreation Element of the Placentia General Plan provides the strategies and actions to preserve and enhance open space areas in the City and meet the recreational needs of its residents.  Open space and recreational facilities in the City of Placentia include parks, schools, community and privately owned recreation facilities, bikeways, trailways, golf courses and open space easements ranging from passive open space to active recreation sites.

2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

The State of California Government Code Section 65302(e) requires that a General Plan “includeing an open space element as provided in Article 10.5 (commencing with Section 65560).”  Recreation Elements are an optional element of the General Plan, pursuant to Section 65303 of the Government Code.  Other relevant sections of the Government Code that are applicable to the Open Space and Recreation Element include Sections 65560, 65562, 65564, 65566, and 65567, as well as Public Resources Code Section 5076, which allows cities to consider the demands for trail-oriented recreational use. 

The Open Space and Recreation Element must contain goals and polices concerned with managing all open space areas, including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas.  Specifically, the Open Space Element includes open space that is left undeveloped for public health and safety reasons, and open space that is used for the preservation of natural resources, for the managed production of resources and for outdoor recreation.

3.0	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

3.1 	EXISTING OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES

Placentia’s open space and recreation resources include parkettes, neighborhood, community and sub-regional parks, special use facilities and golf courses.  Combined, these resources offer Placentia residents a wide variety of recreational opportunities.  Table 5-1, Open Space Inventory identifies existing types and corresponding acreages of open space resources located within Placentia and Exhibit 5-1, Parks, Recreation and Open Space Inventory, illustrates the location of these resources.

PARKETTES  

Parkettes are small areas of passive land usually ranging in size from a few square feet to an acre.  They are landscaped areas that sometimes have special design features such as fountains, rose gardens, or flower areas as the dominant feature in their design. Placentia has two parkettes, Jaycee and La Placita, contributing approximately 1.3 acres to the City’s open space inventory.

NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS

A neighborhood park is generally serves a residential area of one square mile, bounded by arterial streets and is served by an elementary school.  A Neighborhood Parks is often combined with an elementary school to obtain maximum benefits from both facilities.  Generally, The Neighborhood Parks provides space for indoor and primarily outdoor recreation activities, primarily for children from approximately  and are geared toward youth 5 -14 years of age. A Neighborhood Parks generally contains a play area for tots and younger children; a wading pool a multi-purpose grass area; picnic area; a small meeting room and when possible, and off-street parking when possible.  Neighborhood Parks are typically one to five acres, and the and have a service radius is of approximately one-half mile. Neighborhood Parks located adjacent to schools are typically 5 to 15 acres.

Placentia has six Neighborhood Parks, contributing approximately 19 acres to the City’s open space inventory.  

COMMUNITY PARKS

A Community Park serves several neighborhoods within a community.  The Community Park provides indoor and outdoor facilities to meet a much wider range of recreation interests than does the Neighborhood Park.  A Community Park generally contains features such as community centers, picnic grounds, children’s play areas, swimming pools, outdoor activity courts, and off-street parking.  This type of park is generally five to ten acres, with a service radius of approximately three miles.

Placentia has three Community Park facilities, Parque de Los Ninos, Kraemer Park and McFadden Park, encompassing approximately 26.9 acres of the City’s total park acreage.  These Community Parks offer a variety of facilities including ballfields, playgrounds and multi-purpose rooms.  

SPECIAL USE FACILITIES

Special Use Facilities generally provide a specific recreational service within the community.  Examples of Special Use Facilities are golf courses, zoos, casting ponds, local camp sites, archery and rifle ranges and athletic complexes which may include baseball, softball, soccer and football fields, or tennis, handball and racquetball courts.  

Placentia has four special use facilities, Parque del Arroyo Verde, Tuffree Park, Bradford Park and Placentia Champions Sports Complex, contributing approximately 22.5 acres to the City’s open space inventory.  

SUBREGIONAL PARKS

A Subregional Park is generally 25 to 50 acres in size, serving several cities.  Subregional Parks may contain family and group picnicking, camping, nature trails, play areas, outdoor amphitheaters and lakes with water-oriented activities.  The service radius for a subregional park can extend to three or more miles.

Placentia has one subregional park facility, Tri-City Park, comprising 40 acres.  Tri-City Park has an 108-acre lake, commonly used for fishing.  Additionally, the park provides picnic areas with barbecues, hiking and biking pathways, overnight camping and playgrounds.  During the summer, concerts at sunset are provided has picnic shelters, areas with barbeques, hiking and walking trials, biking paths, restrooms, multiple parking lots, and a playground area. Various City sponsored events are held at the park throughout the year including community wide and regional events such as the Heritage Festival and Parade, Get Fit 5K and summer Concerts in the Park series. Various community groups and non-profit groups also utilize the park for special events, camps and programs. 

The park is managed by the Tri-City Park Authority. The Tri-City Park Authority was founded in 1974 as a joint venture by three cities (Brea, Fullerton, Placentia) and the County of Orange to develop 40 acres as a sub-regional park site in North Orange County. A joint powers agreement was established with the three cities giving the Tri-City Authority the responsibility for acquisition, development including master planning future development, and administering the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the park. 

GOLF COURSES

Alta Vista County Club is a 6,539-yard private golf club located in the southeastern portion of the City. The private facility includes an 18hole course, driving range, putting greens and clubhouse.  The clubhouse is comprised of administrative offices, lounge, card room, pro-shop and a restaurant. Alta Vista Country Club is also available for public events such as weddings, banquets, receptions and fundraising golf tournaments. 

BIKEWAYS

Bikeways provide access to schools, parks and other open space areas within the community.  Although not included in the open space inventory, the City’s bikeway network provides significant recreation opportunities.  Exhibit 3-2, of the Circulation Element, Existing Bikeways, illustrates the location of bikeways within Placentia.  Existing bike paths are classified as Class I, II, or III.  Class I bike paths are off road bike paths, separate from the street and are the highest quality bike path.  Class II and III are both located on the street.  Class II paths include a designated bike lane and Class III paths are marked by signage. 
Currently no equestrian trails or facilities exist within the City of Placentia.  The surrounding cities of Yorba Linda and Fullerton have equestrian trails and facilities for use by Placentia residents. The City of Placentia bikeway system ties into the Orange County Transit Authority bikeway system (see Circulation Element).

3.1.2	PLACENTIA RECREATIONAL FACILITIES

Recreational facilities within Placentia contribute to the City’s recreational resources.  These facilities include community buildings, recreation centers, senior centers, fitness centers gymnasiums and sports facilities (refer to Exhibit 5-1, Parks, Recreation and Open Space Inventory).  Placentia recreation facilities facilitate a wide variety of programs and events for City sponsored activities. Community facilities also enhance the community by providing building space for governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, resident use, non-resident use and commercial organizations.

Many programs are conducted in conjunction with other community organizations within the City.  Recreational programs include youth and adult sports, health, cultural arts, human services and senior and youth activities.  As Placentia is almost completely developed, the City’s recreational programming has become more important in providing for the recreational needs of its residents.  The following programs are currently offered by the City:

?	Recreation Classes.  The City of Placentia offers a variety of recreation classes for all ages including dance lessons, computer classes, exercise classes, music lessons, gymnastics, aquatics, self-help courses, mommy and me classes and more.  Classes are offered throughout the year.

3.1.4	SCHOOL FACILITIES

The use of school facilities as an additional open space resource is an important element in the City’s overall open space and recreational program.  Sixteen Seventeen school facilities are located within the City of Placentia.  Exhibit 5-2, School Facilities, illustrates the location of educational facilities located within the City.  The use of school facilities for open space and recreational opportunities provides a creative means to enhance and expand the City’s overall open space and recreational resources.  The amount of school acreage attributed to the City’s park acreage is shown in Table 5-3, School Facilities. 

The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District encourages the use of the District facilities by Placentia’s community organizations through a joint use agreement.  However, the use of school district facilities by the community is limited to after 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, unless a school athletic event is in progress, and at all times on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  The District will retain the right to exclusive use of the facilities after 5:00 p.m. for up to 15 evenings when school is in session for purposes of graduation, open house and other activities, as determined by the District.  When school is not in session, the District has the right to exclusive use of the facilities during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday.  The City has the right to exclusive use of the facilities at all other times when the school is not in session.  

The use of school athletic facilities by groups or organizations for non-school sponsored activities must be processed and cleared with the City prior to District approval.  Groups that qualify normally for free facility use, including City Recreation Departments, are charged for the added cost to the District.  A system of priorities is established to prevent conflicts between groups wishing to use the same school property at the same time.  Currently McFadden Park and the Placentia-Yorba Unified School District have a joint use agreement in effect.

4.0	OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PLAN

The Open Space and Recreation Plan for the City of Placentia identifies how the City will provide an adequate level of open space and recreational resources for the City’s residents.  This section of the Open Space and Recreation Element emphasizes coordination between the City, its internal departments, local agencies and community groups to provide citywide recreation opportunities.

4.1	FUTURE PARKLAND DEVELOPMENT

The City of Placentia Open Space and Recreation Plan contains measures to ensure that adequate recreational opportunities are provided for Placentia residents.  The City has adopted a park development standard of 4 acres per 1,000 residents.  Currently, Placentia has 82.5 acres of parks, which include neighborhood, community and subregional parks3.  Table 5-4, City of Placentia Park Development Guidelines provides an overview of guidelines for park facilities within the City.

4.2	PARKLAND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

The State of California Planning and Zoning Law and the Subdivision Map Act Code Section 66477 (the Quimby Act) indicates provides that the legislative body of a city or county may, by ordinance, require the dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park recreational purposes as a condition to the approval for a final tract map or parcel map. In cases where such dedications or fees have not been obtained for particular lots through a map, they may be imposed at the time that building permits are issued. Chapter 22.54 of the Placentia Municipal Code includes the requirements for park and recreation dedication and fees.   



Among other requirements, the following conditions must be met:

?	The Ordinance must include definite standards for determining the proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated and the amount of any fee to be paid in lieu thereof; and

?	The legislative body has adopted a General Plan containing a Recreation Element, and any proposed park and recreational facilities are in accordance with definite principles and standards contained therein.

In conformance with this statute the Quimby Act, the Open Space and Recreation Element includes standards determining land requirements for future park sites.  Table 5-5, Parkland Needs Assessment, provides an overview of existing park facilities and associated surpluses/deficiencies within Placentia.

4.3	OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS

Placentia will seek to expand recreational programs and services to serve the City’s growing population. The following recommendations help to continue a high level of recreational service for the Placentia community.
	
?	Focus on improvements to existing facilities through renovation and upgrades to ensure the recreation needs of all residents are met.

?	Focus recreational programs towards teens and seniors to ensure recreational activities and services are meeting their needs.

?	Continue to support cooperative arrangements with the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District to ensure the broadest range of recreational activities and services are made available to Placentia residents.

?	Expand coordination with adjacent park departments and park and recreation districts for providing a coordinated set of recreational programs and a broader range of recreational resources than currently available.

?	Work with various civic, non-profit, and private recreation-oriented private groups (e.g., Boys Club and YMCA) to provide recreational programming that is positive, well coordinated and responsive to changing community needs.

4.4	RECREATION PROGRAMMING AND FACILITY NEEDS

The City of Placentia evaluates its existing recreational program and needs through periodic assessment by its residents.  The City utilizes participant/customer surveys, staff and instructor input, participation numbers in programs and events, and citizen input at community meetings to assess opinions and behavior with respect to recreational activities, programs and facilities in Placentia.

In addition to the renovation of existing facilities and recreational field improvements at City and School District facilities, the City has identified recreation needs including:

?	Skate Park;
?	Dog Park;
?	Gymnasium;
?	Senior/Community Center;
?	Performing Arts Center; and
?	Aquatics Complex.

Many of these needs were identified through the Development of the City of Placentia Parks and Facilities Development Study completed in February, 2007 (attached as appendix TBA). 


4.5	ANALYSIS OF VACANT LAND FOR PARKLAND DEVELOPMENT

Population growth in Placentia will require the utilization of existing vacant land resources as a means to provide future open space and recreational resources.  Evaluating the potential use of the vacant parcels for the provision of viable open space is an important factor in providing additional recreation opportunities for Placentia residents.  The City of Placentia has identified existing vacant land, as shown in Exhibit 2-2, Vacant Land and in Table 2-2, Summary of Vacant Land, in the Land Use Element.  Additional analysis of vacant parcels will need to be conducted to determine if their size, location, land use and environmental constraints make them suitable for parkland.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The Resource Management Element addresses the topics of air quality, water resources, biological resources and historic and cultural resources.  The California Government Code mandates that all General Plans include a Conservation Element.  The purpose of the Conservation Element is to provide direction regarding the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources.  For the City of Placentia General Plan Update, the The Conservation Element has been combined with the Resource Management Element primarily due to the overlapping nature of issues addressed in these Elements, as they relate to the City of Placentia.

2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

Authority for the Resource Management Element is found in Section 65303 of the State Government Code.  That section allows cities and counties to add optional elements beyond the State-mandated elements.  This Element meets State requirements concerning the Conservation Element as defined in Section 65302(d) of the Government Code.  According to these requirements, the Conservation Element must contain goals and policies that further the protection and maintenance of the State's natural resources; such as water, air, energy, biological, solid waste, minerals and other natural resources; and prevents their wasteful exploitation, degradation and destruction.
3.0	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

The following section inventories conservation resources in Placentia including water resources, air quality, energy resources, biological resources, solid waste, land resources and cultural resources.  This inventory will provide the basis to identify issues to be addressed in this Element.

3.1 	WATER RESOURCES

Water resources are diminishing throughout Southern California with increased development.  As the native water supply decreases, the region's dependence on imported water grows.  This section describes the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources within Placentia.

3.1.1	SURFACE WATER

There are no naturally-occurring permanent surface water features exist within the City of Placentia.  The Tri-City Park in northern Placentia contains a 10-acre man-made lake.  Additionally, numerous small lakes exist at the Alta Vista Country Club golf course.  Two storm drain channels, Carbon Creek and Attwood Creek, intermittently carry water during wet weather events.  

Other bodies of water located within close proximity of Placentia include Nixon Park Reservoir in Yorba Linda and Anaheim Lake in Anaheim.  These water bodies are part of the main aquifer underlying most of the Placentia area.

3.1.2	GROUNDWATER

The 1993 Orange County Ground Water Management Plan outlines strategies for conserving water resources in Orange County, including the City of Placentia. The Plan outlines the following five goals: 1) increasing basin water supplies, 2) protecting and enhancing water quality, 3) improving basin management, 4) improving relations with constituents, and 5) improving Orange County Water District management and operation.

There are several programs being implemented to improve basin management and decrease reliance upon imported water.  The MWD seasonal storage program gives local agencies financial incentives to store water through the winter months, thus reducing peak loads in the drier summer months.  The OCWD conjunctive use well program offers local agencies low interest loans for construction of up to three wells.

Placentia, in conjunction with the SCWC Golden State Water Company, promotes voluntary water conservation strategies to be implemented year round. Methods to reduce water consumption include drought-resistant landscaping and water saving irrigation, especially for City projects and new developments. Other measures include low-flow showerheads and toilets, flow restrictors and drip irrigation. 


The Southern California Water Company (SCWC) Golden State Water Company (GSWC) and Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD) provide water distribution in Placentia.  Approximately 75 percent of Placentia’s water use is obtained from the groundwater basin managed by the Yorba Linda Water District and Southern California Water Company.  The remaining 25 percent of water is imported through the Municipal Water District of Orange County.  Created by the State legislature in 1933, the Orange County Water District (OCWD) is responsible for maintaining the quantity and quality of groundwater underlying Placentia and much of northern Orange County.  The OCWD prevents local water companies from over drafting the basin's water supply.  Each jurisdiction is allowed to extract only 75 percent of their water needs from groundwater. 

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER COMPANY GOLDEN STATE WATER COMPANY

According to the Southern California Water Company Golden State Water Company Urban Water Management Plan, the Southern California Water Company Golden State Water Company’s Placentia System receives its regular water supply from a combination of groundwater (four wells) and treated surface water via two interconnections to the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC).  Exhibit 6-1, Water Sources, illustrates the location of the City’s water wells. The combined capacity of the four wells in the Placentia System is approximately 2,735 gallons per minute (gpm) or 3.9 million gallons per day (mgd).  Other Southern California Water Company Golden State Water Company facilities that serve the City of Placentia include one reservoir and two booster stations.  

YORBA LINDA WATER DISTRICT

The Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD) currently operates a total of eight water wells serving the City of Placentia.  Six of these wells are located within the City (refer to Exhibit 6-1, Water Sources).  The Yorba Linda Water District also provides water service via eleven reservoirs, two of which are located in the City of Anaheim and serve the City of Placentia.  The system also provides one booster station within the City, two connections for treated imported water and one connection for untreated imported water.  The eight wells have a total maximum pumping capacity of 15,000 gallons per minute (gpm).  The two imported water connections have a total maximum pumping capacity of 18,000 gpm.

3.1.3	WASTEWATER

Municipal wastewater is generated in the City’s service area from a combination of residential and commercial sources.  Wastewater in the City is collected by gravity sewers and lift stations owned and operated by the City of Placentia.  The wastewater is transported through trunk sewers to Orange County Sanitation District’s (OCSD) Plant No. One in Fountain Valley and/or Plant No. Two in Huntington Beach.

OCSD’s Plant No. One has a capacity of 174 Million Gallons per Day (MGD) and Plant No. Two has a capacity of 276 MGD.  Average daily flow is 90 MGD at Plant No. One and 153 MGD at Plant No. Two.  During peak flow events, wastewater flows can be shifted between Plants to meet changing flow conditions.  The Plants provide primary and secondary treatment.  
Insert Exhibit 6-1
Water Sources
8.5 X 11


Up to 10 MGD of effluent from Plant No One is delivered to Orange County Water District (OCWD) for advanced treatment.  This water is used for groundwater recharge and landscape irrigation.

3.1.4	STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Stormwater runoff is a significant contributor to local and regional pollution.  Urban stormwater runoff is the largest source of unregulated pollution to the waterway and coastal areas of the United States.  Stormater can be contaminated with a variety of pollutants that contribute to increased health risks and environmental damage.

The City of Placentia seeks to protect and promote the health, safety and welfare of its citizen by controlling non-stormwater discharges to the stormwater conveyance system.  The City is required by the Clean Water Act and other federal, state and regional regulations to control the discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system, including the discharge of pollutants from construction sites and areas of new development or significant redevelopment.  

FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

Local stormwater pollution control measures are implemented pursuant to the Clean Water Act, Federal Water Quality Control Act and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

CLEAN WATER ACT

The Clean Water Act prohibits any person from discharging pollutants through a “point source” into a “water of the United States” unless they have an NPDES permit.  NPDES permits regulate the discharges from publicly owned facilities.  The NPDES program also regulates wet weather discharges such as stormwater discharges from industrial activities and municipal stormwater discharges including, urban stormwater runoff, combined sewer overflows and storm sewer overflows.

The Clean Water Act amendments of 1987 established a framework for regulating stormwater discharges from municipal, industrial and construction activities under the NPDES program.  The primary objectives of the municipal stormwater program requirements are to effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges and reduce the discharge of pollutants from stormwater conveyance systems to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), including management practices, control techniques and system, design engineering method and such other provisions that the U.S. EPA or the California State Water Resources Control Board deem appropriate for the control of such pollutants.      

NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) STORMWATER PROGRAM

Mandated by Congress under the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater program is a comprehensive two-phased national program for addressing the non-agricultural sources of stormwater discharges adversely affecting the quality of the nation’s waters.  The Program uses the NPDES permitting mechanism to require the implementation of control and monitoring measures designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed into local water bodies by stormwater runoff.  

The NPDES program requires the owner or operator of any facility, or any person responsible for any activity that discharges waste into the surface waters of the U.S. to obtain a NPDES permit from the Regional Water Quality Control Board, as mandated by the Clean Water Act.  

STATE AND REGIONAL PROGRAMS

The Clean Water Act provides that states are authorized to operate their own NPDES programs provided such programs meet minimum federal requirements.  The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board issues the municipal storm water National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.  The City of Placentia currently operates under Permit No. CAS618030, Order No. R8-2002-0010.  The Permit was adopted on January 18, 2002 and expires of January 18, 2007.

The objective of the Order is to protect the beneficial uses of receiving waters in Orange County.  To meet this objective the first term permit (Order No. 90-71) required permittees to implement requirements to reduce discharge of pollutants in surface waters from urban runoff to the maximum extent practicable.  The second term permit (Order No. 96-31) required continued implementation of the first term permit required the permittees to focus on those areas that threaten beneficial uses.    The third term permit (current Order No. R8-2002-0010) outlines additional steps for an effective storm water management program and specifies requirements to protect the beneficial uses of all receiving waters.  Permittees are required to examine sources of pollutants in storm water runoff from activities, which the permittees conduct, approve, regulate and/or authorize by issuing a license or permit.  

Locally, the Order requires the City of Placentia to minimize short and long term impacts on receiving water quality from new development and significant redevelopment to the maximum extent practicable.  The City’s General Plan must be reviewed and updated, as necessary; to ensure watershed and storm water quality and quality management are considered in accordance with the Order.     

3.1.5	CONSERVATION OF WATER RESOURCES

Southern California suffered a severe drought during the 1980s and early 1990s requiring the importing of water to meet growing demands of the region.  The Metropolitan Water District imports water from the Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct and from northern California via the State Water Project to obtain water supplies from sources outside of Southern California.

In recognition of California's limited water supply, the Southern California Water Company (SCWC) Golden State Water Company (GSWC) has created voluntary measures to promote water conservation in Placentia.  Current programs include the distribution of low flush toilets and offering feedback to residential customers regarding their water use patterns.
Additionally, the Yorba Linda Water District Board of Directors passed a Resolution urging residential, commercial and public water consumers to adopt voluntary water conservation measures.  The water conserving measures contained in the resolution include:

?	Necessary residential, commercial and public irrigation should be completed between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m., and no more than on an every-other-day basis.

?	Hand watering should be done using a positive shut-off hose nozzle.

?	Agricultural users and commercial nurseries should curtail all non-essential water use.

?	Property owners should use drought tolerant plant materials in the landscaping of their property.

?	Water should not be used to wash down sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios or other paved areas, except to alleviate immediate fire or sanitation hazards.

?	Restaurants should not serve water to their customers except when specifically requested.

?	The operation of any ornamental fountain or similar structure should be curtailed.

?	Handwashing of vehicles and equipment should be done using a positive shut-off hose nozzle only between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m.  Washing is permitted anytime at a commercial car wash.

?	Water leaks should be fixed as soon as possible.

?	Property owners should install water-saving showerheads, flow restrictors and/or water saving toilet kits.

?	Homeowners should use automatic dishwashers and washing machines for full loads only.

?	Property owners should insulate hot water pipes to reduce the waiting time for hot water.

DISTRIBUTION OF WATER CONSERVATION MATERIALS

The YLWD actively distributes “Water Conservation Kits” and brochures to residents opening new service accounts.  These materials are available to the public in the customer service lobby, mail and at various YLWD public events.  Since 1985, more than 5,000 kits have been distributed by YLWD.

WATERLINE NEWSLETTER

The YLWD publishes a quarterly newsletter that is sent to all customers with their water bills.  Articles frequently address the subjects of water supply, water conservation and Xeriscape.  Since 1985, approximately 720,000 newsletters have been mailed to YLWD customers.

XERISCAPE COMMITTEE

In August 1987 the YLWD formed a committee of landscape industry professionals, homeowner’s association presidents and water officials to encourage the adoption of drought tolerant landscaping in the community.  Within YLWD, about 50 percent of all water use is for landscape irrigation, presenting one of the best opportunities for significant water conservation.  The primary focus of the committee has been to organize and present a series of “how to” seminars on home Xeriscape landscaping.

XERISCAPE DEMONSTRATION GARDENS

In 1986 the YLWD Board of Directors contributed $500 toward the establishment of the first Xeriscape Demonstration Garden in northern Orange County at the Golden Elementary School in Placentia.

In the spring of 1989 the YLWD established a Xeriscape Demonstration Garden at the YLWD’s Fairmont Reservoir site.  This garden may be viewed by the public and is located on Fairmont Boulevard, just north of the Yorba Linda Education Center.  The YLWD will landscape the remainder of this facility with drought tolerant plant materials when the area surrounding the site is developed for residential use.

The YLWD’s main office building on Plumosa Avenue was landscaped with Xeriscape landscaping at the completion of the office renovation project in the spring of 1990.  All landscaping at YLWD facilities has been converted to Xeriscape as an example of water conservation for the community.  The YLWD’s policy is to hydroseed all new reservoir sites and other facilities with drought resistant plant materials.

PLUMBING RETROFIT PROGRAMS

YLWD has implemented the following indoor plumbing retrofit programs:

?	Ultra-low-flow showerheads.  The YLWD promotes an on-going program in which old, high-flow, showerheads are exchanged for ultra-low-flow showerheads.  This program has resulted in the installation of approximately 4,000 water conservation showerheads.

?	Ultra-low-flow toilets.  The YLWD has coordinated efforts with MWD and MWDOC to promote voluntary installation of ultra-low-flow (ULF) toilet fixtures (1.6 gallons or less per flush).  The program has resulted in installation of approximately 3,300 ULF toilet fixtures in the YLWD’s service area.
3.2	AIR QUALITY

Air Quality conditions within the City of Placentia are influenced by a variety of natural and man-made factors.  Local climate, types of industrial uses, transportation and other factors can significantly affect local air quality conditions.  This section provides a review of local air quality conditions and provides a comparison to State and Federal air quality standards.

3.2.1	CLIMATE

The City of Placentia is located in the South Coast Air Basin.  The Basin is a 6,600 square mile area bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains to the north and east.  The Basin includes all of Orange County and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, in addition to the San Gorgonio Pass area in Riverside County.  The Basin area is characterized as having a “Mediterranean” climate (a semi-arid environment with mild winters, warm summers and moderate rainfall).  The South Coast Air Basin is a coastal plain with broad valleys and low hills; therefore, terrain and geographical location determine the climate of the Basin.  

The topography and climate of Southern California combined with man made pollution affect the extent and severity of air pollution in the Basin.  During the summer months a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist marine layer preventing pollutants from dispersing upward, causing a temporary inversion.  Light winds during the summer further limit ventilation in the area. 

Low wind speeds and persistent daytime temperature inversion in late spring, summer and early fall allow for emission of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen to combine with sunlight to produce photochemical oxidant, or smog.  The smog potential is further increased in the basin due to the South Coast region experiencing more days of sunlight than most other urban areas.

The Pacific Ocean affects local temperatures due to its relative warmth in winter and cooling sea breezes in summer.  Placentia generally experiences mild summers and short, mild winters.  The average maximum daily temperature is 82 degrees Fahrenheit in July and 64 degrees Fahrenheit in January.  Placentia’s average annual rainfall is 11.40 inches. 

Air quality conditions in Placentia are influenced by many factors, including the topography, climate and the number and type of pollution producers.  This section examines these issues and historical pollution levels in the community, as compared to State and Federal air quality standards.

3.2.2	AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

Ambient air quality is described in terms of compliance with Federal and State standards.  Ambient air quality standards are the levels of air pollutant concentrations considered safe to protect the public health and welfare.  They are designed to protect people most sensitive to respiratory distress, such as asthmatics, the elderly, very young children, people already weakened by other disease or illness and persons engaged in strenuous work or exercise.  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 for six air pollutants.  States have the option of adding other pollutants, to require more stringent compliance or to include different exposure periods.  

The California Air Resource Board (CARB) is required to designate areas of the State as attainment, non-attainment or unclassified for any State standard.  An “attainment” designation for an area signifies that pollutant concentrations did not violate the standard for that pollutant in that area.  A “non-attainment” designation indicates that a pollutant concentration violated the standard at least once, excluding those occasions when a violation was caused by an exceptional event, as defined in the criteria.  An “unclassified” designation signifies that data do not support either an attainment or non-attainment status.

State and Federal ambient air quality standards have been established for the following pollutants: ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), fine particulate matter (PM10) and lead.  For some of these pollutants, notably O3 and PM10, the State standards are more stringent than the Federal standards.  The State has also established ambient air quality standards for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride and visibility reducing particles.  The above-mentioned pollutants are generally known as “criteria pollutants.” 

In 1997, the U.S. EPA announced new ambient air quality standards for O3 and PM10.  The new standards were intended to provide greater protection of public health.  The EPA proposed to phase out the 1- hour O3 standard and replace it with an 8-hour standard.  There are two new Federal PM2.5 (particulates less than 2.5 microns in diameter) standards: a 24-hour limit set at 65 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3) of ambient air and an annual average limit set at 15 mg/m3. The current PM10 standards will be retained.  Areas will be considered in attainment for the annual PM2.5 standard when the three-year average of the annual arithmetic mean is equal to or less than 15 mg/m3.  For the new 24-hour standard, attainment will be based on the 98th percentile of PM2.5 concentrations for each year, averaged over three years, to help compensate for any high concentrations that may be due to unusual meteorological conditions.  Following announcement of the new national standards, the SCAQMD began collecting monitoring data to determine the region’s attainment status with respect to the new standards.  Industry groups have challenged the new standards in court.1

The South Coast Air Basin has the worst air quality problem in the State.  Despite implementing many strict controls, the SCAQMD portions of the basin still fails to meet the Federal air quality for three of the six criteria pollutants: ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM10).  Because Federal pollution standards have not been achieved, the basin is considered a non-attainment area for Federal standards for these pollutants.  For State standards, the Orange County portion of the basin is designated as non-attainment for O3 and PM10.2

3.2.3	LOCAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) operates several air quality monitoring stations within the Air Basin.  The City of Placentia is located within Source Receptor Area (SRA) 17.  The communities within an SRA are expected to have similar climatology and subsequently, similar ambient air pollutant concentrations.  The nearest air monitoring station within SRA 17 is located in the City of Anaheim.  Air Quality Data from 1996 to 2000 for the Anaheim Monitoring Station is provided in Table 6-1, Local Air Quality Levels.

3.2.4	SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution than are the general population.  Sensitive populations (sensitive receptors) who are in proximity to localized sources of toxins and carbon monoxide are of particular concern.  Land uses considered sensitive receptors include residences, schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, athletic facilities, long-term health care facilities, rehabilitation centers, convalescent centers and retirement homes.  

3.2.5	TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS (TACS)

SCAQMD implements Toxic Air Contaminant (TAC) controls through Federal, State and local programs.  Federal TACs are regulated by the EPA under Title III of the CAA.  At the State level, the CARB has designated all 243 Federal hazardous air pollutants as TACs, under the authority of AB 1807.  The Air Toxic Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act (AB 2588) requires inventories and public notices for facilities that emit TACs.  Senate Bill 1731 amended AB 2588 to require facilities with “significant risks” to prepare a risk reduction plan (reflected in SCAQMD Rule 1402).  SCAQMD also regulates source-specific TACs.

The City of Placentia, as a local government, will be primarily responsible for implementing the transportation and land use measures included in the AQMP and reducing emissions in the areas of energy conservation, dust control and trip reduction. This may be done, in part, through the adoption of this Air Quality Element as part of the City's General Plan.

AIR QUALITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

Federal Clean Air Act

The 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) authorized the establishment and schedule for attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).    The CAA requires plans to provide for the implementation of all reasonable available control measures “as expeditiously as practicable,” including the adoption of reasonably available control technology for reducing emissions from existing sources.   The 1990 amendments to the CAA implemented more stringent deadlines in meeting the standards and changed the procedures required by areas of the nation that exceeded these standards.  The amendments required the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) to develop specific plans to address Ozone (O3) attainment, post 1996 rate-of progress and a PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP) that incorporates best available control measures for fugitive sources.   In 1997 previous ozone standards were modified to reflect change in averaging times and levels, making them more stringent.  The criteria for particulate matter were also changed, providing more stringent goals for fine air particles.

California Clean Air Act

The 1988 California Clean Air Act (CCAA) requires air pollution control districts design their air quality attainment plans to achieve a reduction in basin-wide emissions of 5 percent or more per year (or 15 percent or more in a 3-year period) for all non-attainment pollutants and their precursors.  The CCAA requires that the 1994 AQMP control measures reduce overall population exposure to criteria pollutants by 40 percent at the end of 1997 and by 50 percent by 2000.  This requirement is applicable to ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO2) in the Southern California Air Basin.  The 1994 AQMP must include an assessment and ranking of the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures.  The technological feasibility, emissions reduction potential, rates of reduction, public acceptability and enforceability of the measures must also be considered.

South Coast Air Quality Management District 

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has prepared multiple Air Quality Management Plans (AQMPs) to accomplish the five percent annual reduction goal.  The most recent AQMP was published in 2003.  To accomplish its task, the AQMP relies on a multi-level partnership of governmental agencies at the Federal, State, regional and local level.  These agencies, which include EPA, CARB, local governments, Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the SCAQMD, are the cornerstones that implement the AQMP programs.

2003 AQMP

On August 1, 2003 the SCAQMD adopted the 2003 AQMP.  The 2003 AQMP updates the demonstration of attainment with the federal standards for ozone and PM10; replaces the 1997 attainment demonstration for the federal carbon monoxide (CO) standard and provides a basis for a maintenance plan for CO for the future; and updates the maintenance plan for the federal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) standard that the SCAB has met since 1992.  

The 2003 AQMP relies on a multi-level partnership of governmental agencies at the federal, state, regional and local level.  These agencies (United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), local governments, Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the SCAQMD are the primary agencies that implement the AQMP programs.  The 2003 AQMP proposes policies and measures to achieve federal and state standards for improved air quality in the SCAB and those portions of the Salton Sea Air Basin (formerly named the Southeast Desert Air Basin) that are under SCAQMD jurisdiction.  

The 2003 AQMP also addresses several state and federal planning requirements and incorporates significant new scientific data, primarily in the form of updated emissions inventories, ambient measurements, new meteorological episodes and new air quality modeling tools.  The 2003 AQMP is consistent with and builds upon the approaches taken in the 1997 AQMP and the 1999 Amendments to the Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the SCAB for the attainment of the federal ozone air quality standard.  However, the 2003 AQMP points to the urgent need for additional emission reductions (beyond those incorporated in the 1997/99 Plan) to offset increased emission estimates from mobile sources and meet all federal criteria pollutant standards within the time frames allowed under the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA).

1997 AQMP

A 1997 AQMP was prepared and adopted by the SCAQMD on November 15, 1996.  The 1997 AQMP was adopted by CARB on January 23, 1997.  The 1997 Plan contains two tiers of control measures: short- and intermediate-term, and long-term.  Short- and intermediate-term measures are scheduled to be adopted between 1997 and the year 2005.  These measures rely on known technologies and other actions to be taken by several agencies that currently have the statutory authority to implement the measures.  They are designed to satisfy the Federal CAA requirement of Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) and the CCAA requirement of Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT).  There are 37 stationary source and 24 mobile source control measures in this group.

To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, further development and refinement of known low- and zero-emission control technologies, in addition to technological breakthroughs, would be necessary.  Long-term measures rely on the advancement of technologies and control methods that can reasonably be expected to occur between 1994 and 2010.

The 1997 AQMP continues to include most of the control measures outlined in the previous 1994 Ozone Plan with minor exceptions, but postpones many marginal measures found to be less cost-effective, drops future indirect-source rules that are now deemed infeasible, and focuses the SCAQMD’s efforts on about ten major emission-reduction rules.  The SCAQMD will focus its efforts on seven major rules to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a key ingredient in smog; and the Plan includes new market-based measures giving businesses greater flexibility in meeting emission-reduction requirements, such as intercredit trading and additional credits for mobile source emission reductions.

The 1997 AQMP shows that measures outlined in the 1994 Ozone Plan are sufficient to attain the Federal health standards for the two most difficult ingredients in smog, PM10 and ground level O3, by the years 2006 and 2010, respectively. The region already has met the three other Federal health standards for Pb, SO2 and NO2.  

To help reduce PM10 pollution, the 1997 Plan outlines seven control measures for directly emitted particulates, which will reduce emissions from agricultural areas, livestock waste, wood-working operations, construction, and restaurants.  The measures will also help control dust from paved and unpaved roads, which accounts for two thirds of the directly-emitted particulates.

1997 AQMP Control Strategies.  The 1997 AQMP’s off-road mobile source control measures are based on the EPA’s proposed Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the SCAB.  The FIP’s proposed control measures are based on a combination of stringent emission standards, declining caps on emission levels and emission/user fees.

3.3	BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The City of Placentia is almost completely urbanized and landscaped with mostly nonnative species. No known rare or endangered plant or animal species have been identified within the City.  The community’s most significant plant resources are its ornamentals.  The urban landscaping within Placentia provides habitat for smaller rodents and birds.  However, the frequent disruptions caused by urban activities and the frequent cultivation of such plant life make these plant communities a less than an ideal habitat for wild animals.

3.4	ENERGY RESOURCES

Limited supplies and environmental concerns regarding conventional energy resources such as oil, electricity and natural gas require their conservation. Reductions in domestic oil production in the U.S. has resulted in increasing dependence on foreign imports.  

Southern California Edison (Edison) supplies residential and commercial electricity for the City of Placentia.  The Southern California Gas Company (The Gas Co.) supplies natural gas to Placentia.  Natural gas is a finite resource and therefore supplies cannot be increased.

Given the area’s warm climate, the most important alternative and renewable energy resource in Placentia is solar energy. This energy source has considerable potential and can be developed to substitute for oil, gas and other energy supplies.  Solar energy's ability to substitute for fossil fuels can be an important tool in the battle against air pollution.

Solar radiation in the form of sunlight can be utilized for energy production in two ways. The first method, active solar systems, involves the use of mechanical devices to convert solar energy to heat or electricity.  The second, passive solar systems, utilizes natural heating and cooling from the sun through proper orientation and building design. Placentia’s geographic location and climate make it well suited for the utilization of solar power.  Southern exposure in the winter and limited western exposure in the summer should be a factor in building design and placement. Streets that run east-west are more adaptable to solar energy practices than northsouth streets. The ideal building orientation recommended for the Southern California coastal inland regions is a 35-degree variation to the southwest of the building's long axis. State Title 24 Energy Regulations establish energy performance building code requirements that the City will follow and implement.

3.5	SOLID WASTE

Solid waste collection services for the City of Placentia are contracted to Taormina Industries.  The majority of the solid waste generated in the area is disposed of at the Olinda Alpha Sanitary Landfill in Brea.  As landfill sites in California approach capacity, it is necessary to reduce the amount of solid waste to these sites.  In 1989 the State legislature passed AB 939, The Integrated Waste Management Act to address solid waste issues.  The Act is codified in the Public Resources Code and requires cities to develop a plan that will result in source reduction, recycling and composting and environmentally safe transformation and land disposal.  

The Integrated Waste Management Plan (IWMP) requires each city or county develop Source Reduction and Recycling Elements (SRREs).  The SRRE must include the following components: waste characterization; source reduction; recycling, composting, solid waste facility capacity, education and public information, funding, special waste and household hazardous waste.   Waste Diversion Mandates require each city or county plan to include implementation of a schedule to divert 25 percent of solid waste from landfills by 1995 and to divert 50 percent of solid waste by 2000.

The California Integrated Waste Management Board is still focused on assisting local officials around the State in meeting the 50 percent waste diversion requirement for 2000.  The California Integrated Waste Management Board and State legislature has not introduced new legislation to set diversion requirements beyond 2000.  

In April 1995, Placentia prepared and adopted a source reduction and recycling element (SRRE).  Placentia has developed several programs to implement the SRRE, achieving a 56 percent solid waste diversion rate for 2000.  

3.5.1 	SOURCE REDUCTION

Source reduction concentrates on eliminating waste before it is created. The City has implemented a program supporting State and Federal legislation calling for less packaging and pre-waste measures.  Other City programs address public education, rate structure modification and on-site composting.

To reduce the amount of solid waste generated in Placentia, the has City prepared and adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling Element and is currently implementing its programs.  Strategies to reduce waste include source reduction, recycling, composting, special waste provisions and education and public information.  In accordance with AB 939, specific programs were implemented to reduce the amount of waste generated in Placentia by 25 percent in 1995 and 50 percent by 2000.

Source reduction concentrates on eliminating waste before it is created.  The City has local government and procurement programs to implement source reduction measures in-house.  In addition, other City programs address public education, rate structure modifications, land use incentives and on-site composting.

Recycling focuses on retrieving goods that can be processed into new products.  It encompasses a four-step process in which post-consumer wastes are collected, separated from other wastes, reconfigured to meet the specifications for manufacturers and then marketed as material for new products.  Recyclable waste is collected from single-family and multi-family residential, commercial and industrial uses and taken to a sorting facility by the City’s contract waste hauler.  In addition, composting material may be retrieved through curbside collection to later be transferred to a processing facility. 
 
RECYCLING PROGRAMS

Recycling focuses on retrieval of waste that can be re-processed into new products.  The City has established several programs encouraging recycling.  These programs rely on public education through printed materials, community outreach, media and school programs. The following programs support source reduction, recycling and composting:

?	Residential Curbside Recycling Program

In 1997, the City of Placentia implemented a curbside recycling program.  Single-family residences are provided specific color bins for recyclable materials, yard waste and trash items.  Taormina Industries, the City’s franchise trash hauler, picks up recycling containers weekly in accordance with a recycling schedule.  All materials are taken to the Taormina Consolidated Volume Transfer (CVT) Regional Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Anaheim before they are taken to a local landfill.  The CVT MRF serves other jurisdictions in Orange County in addition to Placentia.  

?	Multiple-Family, Commercial and Industrial Recycling 

Waste is collected from multiple family, commercial and industrial uses by Taormina Industries and taken to the CVT MRF for sorting before going to the local landfill.  Some businesses within Placentia have arrangements with Taormina Industries to have a separate bin for recyclables on-site. 

?	Green Waste Program
 
The City of Placentia Green Waste Program was implemented in October 1995 in accordance with State mandated waste reduction and diversion requirements.  Yard waste and kitchen waste (not mixed with refuse) are picked up and taken to the CVT MRF where they are transferred to a facility that converts the waste to compost, diverting the waste from local landfills.   

?	Bulky Item Pick Up

Taormina Industries provides free bulky item pick up service by appointment.  Each household receives up to three bulky Item pick-ups per calendar year.   Bulky items include furniture, refrigerators, stoves and water heaters.  

?	Yearly Recycling Calendar 

The City prepares an annual calendar identifying recycling weeks and when waste removal would occur one day behind schedule as a result of holidays.

?	Recycle Placentia Teen Team

Local high school students in coordination with the City visit local schools and attend area events to educate people on recycling programs and their benefits.

?	Used Oil Recycling Program 

The City currently runs a residential used oil collection program.  Residents can contact a toll free telephone number and request used oil be picked up from their home.  The program is made possible by a grant from the California Integrated Waste Management Board.  In addition, the City has several walk-in hazardous waste collection facilities that accept used oil.

?	Household Hazardous Waste Collection  

Residents of Placentia utilize the County of Orange Household Hazardous Waste Collection Center in Anaheim.  The regional facility is available to Orange County residents to deposit household hazardous wastes.  Items included in this special collection are tires, construction/demolition debris, asbestos and medical waste.  Additionally, Placentia provides a toll free telephone number for elderly and disabled residents to request hazardous waste materials to be picked up from their residences.  The program is made possible by a grant from the California Integrated Waste Management Board.


?	Best Management Practices for Construction Activities  

The City’s Department of Public Works has developed a one-page information sheet outlining the minimum standards to be used for recycling construction related materials.  The standards listed on the information sheet are based upon the Best Management Practices detailed in the California Storm Water Best Management Practices Handbook dated March 1993. 

3.6	AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION RESOURCES

Placentia was originally an agriculture and dairy community featuring row crops and citrus trees. Placentia developed rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s converting most agricultural acreage to urban uses.  Currently, Row crops (predominantly strawberries and oranges) do not exist in any significant quantity. This land is, however, planned and zoned for business park development.

3.7	MINERAL RESOURCES

The State Division of Mines and Geology has identified mineral resource areas throughout the State.  According to the geologic map of Orange County, Placentia does not contain any mineral resources as defined.  The only mineral extraction within the City at the present time is petroleum.  Oil extraction/pumping operations continue in limited marketable  quantities throughout the city.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PLACENTIA

The following historical overview of Placentia is summarized from a historical account presented in Placentia City History: A Brief History of Events.
In the early 1760’s, the Spanish began exploring what would later be known as California.  Gaspar de Portola, a Spanish guide, led a group of men on an expedition through California with detailed plans to develop the vast land.  While traveling northward, many of Portola’s men were impressed with the area, which was to become Orange County, and later settled there.

Juan Pacifico Ontiveros, a soldier who had been a member of the exploration party, received a grant of 35,970 acres of land from California Governor Francisco Alvarado.  Ontiveros named his new land Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana.  Placentia and portions of the present day cities of Brea, Fullerton, Anaheim, and Yorba Linda were part of the land grant.  During the next two decades, the largely Spanish population increased together with new settlers who came to the area.

Daniel Kraemer, credited with being the first non-Spanish settler, arrived in 1865.  Kraemer bought 3,900 acres of the Ontiveros ranch and moved his family from Illinois.  Daniel Kraemer was a community leader who helped pave the way to make Placentia the city it is today.  Kraemer Middle School, a park, and a major street are named after him.

After moving from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, William McFadden purchased 100 acres on the southwest corner of Placentia Avenue and Yorba Linda Boulevard.  McFadden was a schoolteacher and later Superintendent of Los Angeles County schools.  He was involved in community affairs and his wife, Sarah, is credited with naming the community of Placentia.

Charles Wagner arrived in Placentia in 1871.  Wagner was a sheep rancher in the northern portion of Placentia and Brea.  He also grew walnuts and oranges.  His orange grove was one of the earliest in Placentia.

Albert Bradford came to Placentia in 1881 to manage a large ranch.  He married Fannie Mead and bought twenty acres on which he grew oranges.  His orange brand was called Tesoro (Treasure) with a picture of the large ranch house he built in 1902.  Bradford was active in the community and served as Chamber of Commerce president from its beginning in 1924 until his death in 1933.  Mr. Bradford was instrumental in organizing a committee to raise money in order to buy the necessary rights-of-way for the Santa Fe railroad.  His home, which is located at 136 E. Palm Circle, is listed in the National Register of Historical Places.

The Town

News of imminent railroad construction in 1912 resulted in fast commercial growth.  Albert Bradford and Richard Melrose subdivided land near the new railroad station.  The boundaries were Chapman Avenue, Crowther Avenue, Bradford Avenue and Melrose Street.  Richard Melrose, as owner of the land, dedicated the new Melrose, Main Center and Santa Fe Streets as roads.

Main and Center Streets developed primarily into residential property.  Business concentrated along Santa Fe Street abutting the railroad.  The stores did not extend past Bradford Avenue or Melrose Street but these few blocks became a thriving business district.

As the population grew, citizens began to recognize the need for community services.  By 1874, there were enough children to justify building a school.  Daniel Kraemer donated land on Orangethorpe Street and William McFadden built the schoolhouse.  In 1898, the school was enlarged by an addition of a second story.  A citizen’s group formed the Placentia Improvement League to further the development of the town and serve the needs to the growing town-site.  Typical League projects included pavement of streets and installation of streetlights.  The League arranged for utility companies to serve the community.  The Placentia Domestic Water Company supplied water to inhabitants within a one-mile radius of the center of town.  By 1912, the City was served by Southern Counties Gas Company, Pacific Telephone, and Edison Electric.

Economic Growth

Although early Spanish settlers called the area ”por que nada”, which means “worse than nothing, “ Placentia proved to have very strong economic potential.  In late 1800’s, irrigation water was in short supply and dry farming was practiced.  The drought of 1864 devastated the cattle industry.  Sheep raising, initially popular and prosperous was later destroyed by a drought in 1877.

Richard Gilman is credited with establishing what would be known as the hearth to the Orange County economy.  He experimented with orange seedlings and developed the Valencia variety.  The Valencia orange became commercially popular and was grown throughout Southern California.  Placentia growers were successful with Valencia oranges and they became the main cash crop for many of the farmers.

Oil was discovered on Daniel Kramer’s land in 1919.  Oil derricks were erected throughout the City of Placentia.  The oil supplies were among the most productive in the state.  Oil wells in the city continue to produce marketable quantities of oil.

The townsite of Placentia, along the Santa Fe railroad, was surveyed in 1910.  On December 2, 1926, Placentia was incorporated with 800 residents on 0.16 square miles.  Harry Easton became the first mayor by vote of the board trustees.  Rapid growth began with the population doubling between 1920 and 1930, reaching 1,607.  Nearly all 17 miles of streets were paved in 1927.  The new City established a police department.

In 1927, businessmen bought an 800-gallon fire truck.  The City Council succeeded in passing a bond in order to build a city hall and in 1939, a small Spanish-style building was erected.  It housed both the police and fire stations.

Placentia population in 1950 was 1,682; in 1960, it reached 5,861. Recognizing the need for sound planning, the City Council, in 1966, called upon Placentia’s 18,000 residents to assist in defining community goals to be accomplished by the City’s 50th birthday in December 1976.  Utilizing a series of public forums and study sessions, the Placentia Tomorrow program explored all aspects of the community.  Among the findings were strong indications that the residents desired to preserve a small-town atmosphere were interested in having a Varity of recreational and leisure time activities and wanted a well-rounded community.

Progress since the issuance of the Placentia Tomorrow report in 1967 has been dramatic.  In 1968, voters gave overwhelming support to one of the few successful recreation bond issues in Orange County’s history.

The County of Orange selected Placentia as its Model City in 1971.  In September of the same year, the National Sports Foundation awarded Placentia its coveted National Gold Merit Award for excellence in Parks.

On February 28, 1972, the National Municipal League of the Saturday Evening Post announced that Placentia was one of nine cities in the United States to win the coveted All American City Award, the first ever presented to a city in Orange County.  The award is one of the highest forms of recognition for citizen involvement in a community.

In 1974, Edward and Angelina Backs donated a 6-acre parcel for the development of a Civic Center.  It was completed in September on 1974 and is located at the northeast corner of Chapman Avenue and Kraemer Boulevard.  The center has a landscaped mall with three fountains and a bell tower.   The Civic Center includes a police facility and library.  The Civic Center’s architectural style reflects the early Spanish heritage of the Placentia area.

Historic Sites

The City of Placentia has many historic structures that serve as reminders of the City’s unique history.  The following structures have been identified as historically significant:

?	Santa Fe District
Santa Fe Street between Bradford Avenue and Main Street

Santa Fe Street was the first commercial street in the townsite, stretching from a train depot (demolished) at Bradford Avenue to the two-story bank building at Main Street.  To serve the growing area, after the railroad was completed in 1910, there was a Chamber of Commerce, a grocery store, feed store, post office, a lumber yard, barber shop, blacksmith shop and livery stable, a reading and recreation room which grew into the library, a hardware store, a hotel and many other stores.  In 1989, the area was named Placita Santa Fe.

?	Placentia Orange Growers Association
201 W. Crowther Avenue

The “OG” was first incorporated in 1894, shipping fruit from Fullerton until 1911 when the association built the first packinghouse in Placentia at a cost of $15,700.  The modern building at 207 West Crowther, now used as a multi-use small business building, was constructed in 1934 after a fire had damaged the earlier structure.  The new steel-frame concrete building contained large “cold” rooms and was earthquake resistant.

?	Placentia Mutual Orange Association
341 South Melrose Street

The Placentia Mutual Orange Association (PMOA) was organized October 12, 1910 with 33 members.  John C. Tuffree served as the first president.  The first packinghouse, built by Sam Kraemer at the corner of Bradford Avenue and Crowther, still stands.  Another building was constructed at 3431 S. Melrose Street in the 1930s.  At one time the PMOA claimed to ship more citrus in one year via the Santa Fe Railroad than any other California Sunkist affiliated house.  The best-known label, which commanded a high price in the New York market, was a Shamrock. 

?	Bradford Brothers, Inc.
100 E. Santa Fe Street

Hartwell and Warren Bradford, sons of A.S. Bradford, opened an independent citrus packinghouse in 1922, constructing the building facing Santa Fe Avenue, which now houses the Placentia-Yorba Unified School District warehouse operation.  Hartwell Bradford maintained the A.S. Bradford House as a residence until his death.  He invented a patented process to remove natural gas from oil, and was one of the original founders of Pacific Lighting (Southern California Gas Company).

?	Old City Library
143 S. Bradford Avenue

The Edwin T. Powell Building, at the corner of Bradford Avenue and Center, is the former library building constructed by the Placentia Library District in 1926 at a cost of $30,000.  The architect was Carlton Winslow who had gained worldwide recognition for his design of the Los Angeles City Library.  This building is considered one of the most interesting small structures in the town and served the City until the new library was constructed in 1974.  Currently, the senior center is housed in the City-owned building.

?	Old City Hall
120 S. Bradford Avenue

The City Hall Building, in use until a new Civic Center was dedicated in 1974, was built with federal assistance in the 1940s and replaced a building on Bradford Avenue, just north of Santa Fe. The City retains ownership to the portion of the site containing the fire station.


?	Kraemer Memorial Park
Bradford Avenue, north of Chapman

Mr. and Mrs. Edward Backs donated the site for Kraemer Park to the City of Placentia in 1954.  Angeline Backs asked that the public park be named in honor of her father, Samuel Kraemer and her mother, Angelina Yorba Kraemer.  A family history, outlined in three brass tablets is located in a memorial near the entrance to the Backs Building facing Bradford Avenue.  Trees planted throughout the park were donated and dedicated to other City pioneers.  

?	Veteran’s Memorial Fountain
Chapman Avenue and Walnut Street

The Veteran’s Memorial Fountain was donated to the City by Edward and Angeline Backs and was constructed at a cost of $250,000.  It is dedicated to our nation’s veterans.  The sculptor was John Edward Svenson who cast the dolphins in Norway.  Arthur Barton, landscape architect for Kraemer Park, designed the courtyard, which surrounds the fountain. 

?	Water Tower
Chapman Avenue and Main Street

The 50,000-gallon water tower, which today bears the markings of Placentia’s All America City Award, remains in active service for the Southern California Water Company Golden State Water Company, which serves most of the City.  It was constructed in 1941, replacing earlier towers built to serve the original townsite. 

?	Valencia High School
500 N. Bradford Avenue

Valencia, the first high school in Placentia, was rebuilt (after a fire) in its present form in 1935 with some later additions.  It is a good example of Moderne Style, sometimes called Art Deco.  Bradford Elementary School, built in 1912 as a replacement for the original Placentia school on Chapman and Placentia Avenues, previously occupied the site.  One structure from the 1912 school remains behind the auditorium. 

?	Bradford House
136 Palm Circle

The Albert Sumner Bradford home in Bradford Park, was built in 1902 in the modified Queen Anne Style popular at the time.  It was located on the Tesoro (treasure) Ranch, which is now the site of the Town Center Shopping Mall.  The original Bradford citrus nursery was on this site and provided many of the trees for the burgeoning California Valencia Orange Industry.


?	Nenno House
502 Palm Drive

The Nenno home was built in 1907-08 by John and Antionette Nenno, who came to Placentia in 1892.  John was one of several citrus fumigators, and the house was the site of a small citrus ranch.  The house has been recently restored as an office building with a similar style to the freestanding office building on the north end of the property. 

?	George Key Home
625 W. Bastanchury Avenue

The George Key Home was built in 1898 and is an excellent example of ranch homes of that period, once found throughout the area.  In 1983, the County of Orange purchased the home and its contents to be operated as a museum.  Visitors can see a collection of the items that were used by ranchers when Placentia was the center of the Valencia Orange industry. 

?	Tri-City Park
Kraemer Boulevard and Golden Avenue

Three cities that adjoin the site, Fullerton, Brea and Placentia, have joined together to develop this lake and its park.  It was originally a storage reservoir on the ranch land of Colonel J.K. Tuffree who had surveyed ranch lands owned by Don Able Stearns.  Tuffree took land in Placentia in lieu of cash payments for his services.  The reservoir held water brought by a gravity canal from the Santa Ana River.  Constructed from 1876 to 1878, the canal was operated by the Anaheim Union Water Company, which delivered water to nearby ranches until the 1960s.

?	Charles Wagner, Jr. House
903 E. Yorba Linda Boulevard

The Wagner home was built in 1920 by one of three Wagner brothers.  The home of each Wagner brother still stands today.  All three were citrus ranchers, and this house is one of several elegant former ranch homes.  It was recently used as a boutique and restaurant and in spring 1991 was used as a backdrop for film production.

RM-10.5	Ensure that post-development runoff rates and velocities do not have an adverse impact on downstream erosion and stream habitat.

RM-10.6	Ensure the minimization of the quantity of stormwater directed to impermeable surfaces and maximize the percentage of permeable surfaces to facilitate increase percolation of stormwater into the ground. 

RM-10.7	Ensure the preservation of riparian habitat and establish limits on the clearing of natural vegetation from project sites. 

RM-10.8	Encourage the use of biofiltration swales, watershed-scale retrofit, etc. where such measures are technically and economically feasible. 

RM-10.9	Establish the provision of appropriate permanent measures to reduce stormwater pollutant loads in stormwater from development sites.

RM-10.10	Establish and monitor guidelines for areas particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss. 

HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

Planning Factor

The preservation of historic and cultural resources is important to the City of Placentia.  The City understands that its history is unique and should be documented and preserved for all residents.  

Goal	RM-11	Preserve Placentia’s historic, archaeologic and paleontologic resources.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of the Growth Management Element is to mandate that growth and development are based on the City’s ability to provide an adequate circulation system and public facilities pursuant to the Orange County Division, League of California Cities Countywide Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Plan Component.

On November 6, 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M, the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance, which provides funding to Orange County for needed transportation improvements over a 20-year period through the imposition of a one-half cent retail transaction and use tax.  Portions of revenue received from the new sales tax will be returned to Orange County jurisdictions for use in local and regional transportation improvements, subject to the jurisdiction’s acquisition and retention of an eligible status for Measure M revenues.

To qualify for Measure M funds, the City of Placentia must comply with the Countywide Growth Management Program component requirements and have an established policy framework for the required Growth Management Program through the adoption of a Growth Management Element.


The City of Placentia’s Growth Management Element was originally adopted on May 5, 1992.  The Growth Management Element for this General Plan update includes minor changes and clarifications to reflect changes in programs and policies that have occurred since the adoption of the original element in 1992.

As required by Measure M, the Growth Management Element must: 1) establish policy statements that identify traffic levels of service (LOS); 2) commit the City to implement a development mitigation program; and 3) commit the City to implement a development phasing and monitoring program.  The Growth Management Element follows guidelines in the State Government Code Section 65303.
 
2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT 

State Government Code Section 65303 allows jurisdictions to adopt “any other elements or address any other subjects, which in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.”  Once adopted, an optional element carries the same legal weight as any other of the elements as required by Government Code Section 65300.5 65301.5.

Additionally, Measure M, the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance, provides local government authority related to compliance with the Countywide Growth Management Program and the establishment of minimum standards of performance for the locally adopted Growth Management Elements.

3.0	SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

       RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS

Many Federal, State, regional and county plans, programs and laws affect growth management in the City of Placentia.  Programs and policies such as the Orange County Growth Management Plan, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) Growth Management Plan, South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), State Assembly Bill 471 (Proposition 111 Congestion Management) and Measure M (Orange County) will have the most direct and significant impact upon the City's Growth Management Plan.

?	Measure M Growth Management Program

Approved by voters on November 6, 1990, Measure M required the adoption of Growth Management Elements by May 1992.  The Measure M program set a general target standard LOS D for intersections.  Urban area intersections may have a lower LOS than that established for the remainder of jurisdictions.  Intersections failing to be brought into LOS compliance for reasons beyond local jurisdictional control are added to a Deficient Intersection List and will be improved with Measure M intersection improvement funds.
?	Congestion Management Program

Approved by voters on June 5 1990, the program requires the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) to prepare a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) in consultation with OCTA, Caltrans, Orange County Cities, County of Orange, SCAG and SCAQMD.   The CMP sets a level-of-services E, or pre-existing level if worse than the minimum standard.   The CMP also requires a seven-year capital improvement program for maintaining and improving traffic and transit standards and for the mitigation of regional transportation impacts.

Traffic improvement projects included in the CMP are the basis for the Regional Transportation Improvement Program, which competes for state funding. 

4.0	DESCRIPTION OF THE GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN

The City’s Growth Management Plan includes all of the components required by Measure M, the Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance. Additional implementation programs independent of this Element will be required in order to implement the Growth Management Plan.

4.1 	TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE GOALS

This Element provides policies that require development applicants make necessary improvements to the circulation system, where affected by their development, so as to maintain acceptable Levels of Service (LOS) standards at intersections and on roadway links under the City’s jurisdiction. Roadway expansions will be planned as part of the Capital Improvement Program and phased according to the Comprehensive Phasing Program. The City of Placentia’s LOS goals will be incorporated into conditions of approval and monitored annually through the adopted Performance Monitoring Program.

Achievement of the adopted LOS standard and implementation of transportation improvements shall consider extraordinary transportation circumstances, which may impact identified intersections and/or timing of the required improvements. An example of an extraordinary circumstance would be when arterial roadways serve as substitute freeway access (thus impacting LOS performance) while planning and construction of additional freeway improvements are underway.

4.2 	DEVELOPMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM

The City has established a Development Mitigation Program based on Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) timetables to ensure that all new development pays its fair share of needed transportation improvements to the City's roadway network.  The City of Placentia Public Works/Engineering Department requires all new development pay its share of the costs associated with transportation improvements to mitigate impacts of development.  Participation is on a pro-rata basis and is required of all applicable development projects except where an increased level of participation exceeding these requirements is established through negotiated legal mechanisms.  The City requires pro-rata participation for projects through specific conditions of approval imposed on development approvals and through compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).  

The Development Mitigation Program is coordinated through Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums in order to determine minimally acceptable impact fees for application with the Growth Management Areas (GMAs).  The City may elect to use existing traffic mitigation fee programs to receive credit with regard to the GMA base level fee.

4.3	COMPREHENSIVE PHASING PROGRAM

The City has prepared a Comprehensive Phasing Program (CPP) based on OCTA timetables.  The CPP contains a development phasing component to ensure, to the extent feasible, that adequate infrastructure (roadways, utilities) is constructed as development occurs by linking the ability of the development to proceed to either; (1) construction of the improvement(s) by others, (2) construction of the improvement(s) by the developer or, (3) by the developer's timely provision of the appropriate funding to the City so that the provision of these facilities is in balance with demand.

While the Comprehensive Phasing Program will provide plans for new facilities, the Performance Monitoring Program will provide annual evaluation of compliance with phasing plans in order for development to continue.  The Comprehensive Phasing Program provides reasonable lead-time (three years from first building permit or five years from first grading permit) to design and construct specific transportation improvements.

4.4	PERFORMANCE MONITORING PROGRAM

The City has prepared a Performance Monitoring Program based on OCTA timetables.  As described in this Element, the Performance Monitoring Program establishes a system for annual evaluation of compliance with newly approved development phasing allocations. Under this program, roadway and other transportation facility improvements or funding must be provided in order for new development to continue.

The Performance Monitoring program provides an annual evaluation of the maintenance of transportation service levels.  Annual traffic reports prepared under this Program shall utilize data collected within three (3) months of preparation of the report, but not within the time period of June through August and November 15 through January 5.  In the event that the Performance Monitoring Program identifies one or more service level deficiencies, measures shall be implemented to correct identified deficiencies.

4.5	SEVEN-YEAR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

The City has prepared a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for transportation systems improvements to effectively manage the system based on OCTA timetables. The purpose of the Capital Improvement Program is to estimate future development over a seven-year period and determine the necessary infrastructure and associated costs required for this new development. Capital Improvement Plans will be closely linked with the Comprehensive Phasing Plan.

The City will determine the capital projects needed to meet and maintain both the City’s adopted Traffic Level of Service and Performance Standards.  The Capital financing programming will be based on proposed development to be constructed during (at a minimum) the following seven-year period. The CIP shall include approved projects and an analysis of the costs of proposed projects as well as a financing plan for providing the improvements.

4.6	TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE

The City of Placentia has adopted a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance that fulfills Measure M and CMP requirements.  If the current TDM Ordinance is modified in the future, the revised ordinance and adopting resolution will be forwarded to OCTA.

4.7	INTER-JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION

The City of Placentia participates in inter-jurisdictional coordination for various purposes, including:

?	Cooperating with the County of Orange, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), and other local jurisdictions through the Regional Advisory and Planning Council (RAPC), or other appointed bodies, on the implementation of Measure M and the development of future revisions.

?	Working with inter-jurisdictional forums (such as the City-County Coordinating Committee) to make sure that the City's fees are consistent with minimally acceptable impact fees for application within the larger Growth Management Area.

?	Participating in the Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums at the Growth Management Area (GMA) level to discuss implementation of traffic improvements, cooperative land use planning, and appropriate mitigation measures for developments with multijurisdictional impacts.

?	Working with the inter-jurisdictional forums to develop strategies for bringing about greater jobs/housing balance at the subregional level.

?	Cooperating with the County of Orange in implementing the Facility Implementation Plans and collaborating in the Development Monitoring Program.

?	Cooperating with State, County and local governments in planning and implementing the City’s Circulation Element, and coordinating efforts to ensure orderly development.
?	Coordinating population, housing, employment and land use projections with the State Department of Finance, SCAG, the County of Orange Development Monitoring Program, school and water districts.

4.8	COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR LARGE PROJECTS

The City of Placentia requires that new large-scale developments prepare a Specific Plan and associated environmental impact analysis. This allows the City to anticipate impacts of large projects prior to development of any portion and permit more time to plan for public services and facilities required.

4.9	COORDINATION WITH ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS

In addition to coordination with sub-regional or inter-jurisdictional forums (such as the CityCounty Coordinating Committee), the City will separately work with other cities and agencies in the immediate area to develop mutual agreements for review and possible conditioning of development projects.

5.0	GROWTH MANAGEMENT PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES

The following goals and policies are designed to meet all the Growth Management Element requirements for a developed community - pursuant to Measure M and the Countywide Growth Management Program Implementation Manual. 

TRAFFIC CONGESTION

Planning Factor

Traffic congestion is a problem not only on freeways and arterials, but also on local streets. Traffic volumes in Placentia are particularly heavy on Yorba Linda Boulevard, Orangethorpe Avenue, Imperial Highway (90), Rose Drive, Kraemer Boulevard and Placentia Avenue.  

Goal	GM-1	To reduce traffic congestion on the City of Placentia controlled arterial highway system.

Policies	GM-1.1	Traffic level of service.  Within three (3) years of the issuance of the first building permit for a development project or within five (5) years of the first grading permit for said development project, whichever occurs first, that the necessary improvements to transportation facilities to which the project contributes measurable traffic, are constructed and completed to attain Level of Service (LOS) D at the intersections under the sole control of the City.  

GM-1.2 	The Congestion Management Program establishes LOS E as its baseline standard for intersections.  The target standard for the City shall be LOS D for intersections, but it is recognized that the City may establish a lower standard for certain intersections in urbanized areas. The City will be in compliance with the CMP as long as LOS E, or the baseline LOS if worse than E, is maintained or a deficiency plan is prepared.

GM-1.3	Level of Service (LOS) will be measured by the Traffic Level of Service Policy Implementation Manual established by the Local Transportation Authority.

GM-1.4 	Certain intersections are exempt from the above requirements including those under the jurisdiction of another city or the state or those included on the Deficient Intersection List established pursuant to this Element (the Deficient Intersections List is determined by members of the Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums). Deficient intersections are those that are not brought into compliance in the most current CIP for reasons beyond the control of the City. Examples include intersections such as those involving ramps leading to or from the freeways. 

The City of Placentia is not held responsible for bringing these intersections to an acceptable LOS. These intersections shall be discussed through the Growth Management Area Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums to reach agreement on mitigation of traffic impacts associated with individual developments.

GM-1.5 	Prior to the issuance of building permits for new development that in the opinion of the City Traffic Engineer may generate substantial a.m. and p.m. peak hour trip ends, a Traffic Impact analysis (TIA) shall be completed.  The expense for such analysis shall be the responsibility of the developer.

The TIA shall identify arterial and intersection improvements needed to provide not worse than LOS D along the balance of the arterials on the City’s Circulation Element that are measurably impacted by the new development and are under the City’s jurisdiction. All traffic impact analyses shall be prepared in accordance with the CMP TIA process.

GM-1.6	All development contributing measurable impacts to intersections on the Deficient Intersections List and all projects contributing cumulatively or individually ten (10) percent or more of the traffic using an intersection, shall be assessed an impact fee determined by the jurisdictions in the GMA and locally administered through the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

GM-1.7 	Achievement of the adopted levels of service standard and implementation of exacted transportation improvements shall take into consideration extraordinary transportation circumstances that may impact identified intersections and/or timing of the required improvements. An example of an extraordinary circumstance would be when arterial roadways serve as substitute freeway access (thus impacting LOS performance) while planning and construction of additional freeway improvements are underway.

GM-1.8	Promote traffic reduction strategies as contained in the City’s Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance.  

TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES

Planning Factor

Regional transportation facilities do not have adequate capacity to accommodate existing and projected growth.  Measure M was largely supported by the voters to respond to this problem by allocating additional funds to provide the needed transportation facilities. 

Goal	GM-2	To provide adequate transportation facilities for existing and future inhabitants of the City.

Policies	GM-2.1	Developments that are within the City of Placentia’s jurisdiction are required to provide improvements needed to provide not worse than a LOS D when evaluating existing plus new traffic levels of service.  All new development shall pay its share of the costs associated with that development, including regional traffic mitigation.

GM-2.2	For larger-sized development projects, an approved phasing program shall be required that phases the proposed development of the project commensurate with the required improvements to roadway capacities. The phasing program shall include an overall buildout plan that shall demonstrate the adequacy of the infrastructure to support the proposed project as well as a financing source to fund the improvements.

The developer shall be responsible for a fair share amount of the costs of such improvements. All Improvements shall be bonded to ensure the developer's fair share is secured.

GM-2.3 	Development phasing for new projects shall be considered during the development review and entitlement process and appropriate conditions of project approval shall be included as part of applicable development applications.

GM-2.4 	The City shall annually monitor the implementation of development phasing programs of new development where a phasing program is required.  The City shall also prepare a status report for these programs. The monitoring program shall include an annual evaluation of compliance with development phasing and an evaluation of the maintenance established LOS performance standards.

GM-2.5	The City’s seven-year CIP shall be adopted and approved in conformance with Measure M requirements to maintain LOS standards established in this Element.

GM-2.6 	The City shall continue to collect Thoroughfare Acreage Fees for improvements within its boundaries and shall work with adjacent jurisdictions through the Inter- Jurisdictional Forums to determine acceptable impact fees within the growth management area. These fees may be assessed, as necessary, in addition to the City’s Thoroughfare Acreage Fees to cover shortfalls that may not be generated by the established fee program.

GM-2.7 	A Deficient Intersection Fund shall be established by the City to make improvements on those intersections necessary to achieve the LOS standard established in this Element.

GM-2.8 	Measure M sales tax revenues shall not be used to replace private developer funding which has been committed for any project or normal subdivision obligations.

INTER-JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION

Planning Factor

Traffic congestion in Placentia is not only a local problem, but a regional problem as well.  Development occurring in neighboring jurisdictions and throughout the County has potentially significant effects upon the freeways and many of the major arterials that traverse the City of Placentia. Therefore, the City of Placentia cannot fully address growth management issues and develop policies without consulting at a regional level.  The potential impacts of growth in adjacent jurisdictions, within the City and throughout the County necessitate a regional approach to transportation growth management.   

Goal	GM-3	Coordinate and cooperate with neighboring jurisdictions and the County to reduce traffic congestion.

Policies	GM-3.1	The City shall participate in Inter-Jurisdictional Planning Forums at the GMA level to discuss developments with multi-jurisdictional impacts and appropriate mitigation measures.

GM-3.2	The City will cooperate with the County in the annual Congestion Management Plan update in order to receive State gas tax revenue.

BALANCED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

Planning Factor

Patterns of land use that reduce the likelihood of people living in close proximity to where they work are a primary contributor to local and regional congestion.  Long commutes contribute significantly to congestion.  Establishing land use balance so that the community can live and work in relative proximity shortens commutes and encourages the use of alternative forms of transportation.  

Goal	GM-4	Support and encourage the concept of jobs/housing balance, where possible, and require the use of Transportation Control Measures (TCM’s) to improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion.

Policies	GM-4.1	Recognizing the constraints of existing physical development characteristics, it is the policy of the City to strive towards an achievement of balanced land use, where possible, so that residential, non-residential and public land uses are proportionally balanced.

GM-4.2	The City shall participate in meetings with other jurisdictions, the Air Quality Management District (AQMD) and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) to develop and adopt Transportation Control Measures that will improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The Safety Element identifies and evaluates potential hazards in the City of Placentia.  The Safety Element examines natural and man-made hazards that could endanger the public safety and welfare.  Natural hazards include flooding, earthquakes, ground rupture and liquefaction.  Man-made hazards can result from hazardous and toxic materials, fires and crime.  The Element serves as a guide to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property damage and the economic and social dislocation that may result from hazards.  The Safety Element establishes goals and policies to reduce the impacts of hazards. 

2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

The State of California Government Code Section 65302(g)(1) requires that a General Plan include:

“...a A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with §2690) of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild land … and urban fires...”
Policies and information for this element are contained in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Public Resources Code Section 2621, et seq.), the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (Public Resources Code Section 2690, et seq.), and the Unreinforced Masonry Law (Government Code Section 8875, et seq.).

3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS

The Safety Element addresses both natural and man-made hazards.  This section identifies natural hazards including flooding, seismic activity, geology and soils and man-made hazards including fire, crime, hazardous materials and aircraft over-flight.  This section of the Safety Element addresses the existing conditions of these hazards and the programs currently in place.

3.1 	CITY PLANS AND PROGRAMS

Several plans and programs contain information that relates to the City of Placentia Safety Element.  A brief synopsis of relevant documents is provided below.
 
* Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)

California Code of Regulations requires local compliance with the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) “…to be documented in the areas of planning, training, exercise and performance”.  To be in compliance, emergency plans should address management, operations, logistics, planning/intelligence and finance/administration.

* Placentia Emergency Operations Plan

The Placentia Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) provides guidance during emergency situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents and nuclear defense operations. The Plan does not address normal daytoday emergencies or the established and routine procedures used in coping with such emergencies.  Rather, the EOP analyzes potential large-scale disasters that require a coordinated and immediate response. The EOP incorporates and coordinates all the facilities and personnel of the City into an efficient organization, as defined under the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS).  Placentia’s EOP is designed to be in compliance with Government Code 8607(a) for managing response to a multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional emergency in California. 

Aid during emergency situations is available within the local government structure and associated agencies.  An Emergency Operation Center (EOC) is located at City Hall for seismic and other disaster situations.  The EOP identifies key personnel and groups in the Placentia Emergency Management Organization that are organized to protect life and property in the community. The Plan also identifies sources of outside support that might be provided through mutual aid by other jurisdictions, State and Federal agencies and the private sector.

All emergency evacuation activities are coordinated by the Evacuation Coordinator (the Chief of Police).  The Chief of Police will issue evacuation orders based on information gathered from emergency experts.  Law enforcement agencies, highway, road and street departments and public and private transportation providers conduct evacuation operations.  The City’s evacuation routes are shown on Exhibit 8-1, Emergency Evacuation Routes. 

ORANGE COUNTY HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN

Current government responsibilities for hazardous waste management are divided among Federal, State and local levels. The Orange County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, adopted in 1989, addresses those issues having local responsibilities and involvement.  In addition, the Plan discusses hazardous waste issues and analyzes current and future hazardous waste generation in the County.

The purpose of the authority is to coordinate local implementation of a regional action program to effect comprehensive hazardous waste management throughout Southern California.  The action program focuses on the development of programs to equitably site needed hazardous waste management facilities; to promote on-site resource reduction, treatment and recycling; and to provide for the collection and treatment needs of small quantity hazardous waste generators.  

An important component of the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan is the monitoring of hazardous waste management facilities for compliance with Federal and State regulations.  Siting criteria and subsequent environmental documentation required pursuant to CEQA will also ensure the mitigation of adverse impacts associated with the siting of hazardous waste facility. 

3.2	NATURAL HAZARDS

FLOODING

The City of Placentia is within the 500-year flood zone.  Therefore, large scale flooding within the City is highly unlikely.  The City does periodically experience flooding during winter weather events.  The last recorded flood damage in the City occurred in 1995, when a pedestrian bridge was destroyed at Parque de los Vaqueros.  Flood abatement measures to reduce the likelihood of flooding have been implemented by the Orange County Flood Control District.  According to the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Orange County, the projected 100-year flood for Placentia is contained within the Carbon Creek, Carbon Creek Channel, Attwood Channel and Tri City Lake. The channels are located in the southern and southeast portion of Placentia.  However, like most of Orange County, the projected 500-year flood may result in widespread flooding throughout the entire City.  Exhibit 8-2, Flood Zones, provides a summary of areas within the 100- and 500-year floodplain. 

The City of Placentia contains no natural, permanent water features.  However, a 10-acre man-made lake exists in Tri-City Park, and numerous small man-made water features are located in Alta Vista Country Club golf course.  In addition, Carbon Creek and a number of storm drain channels traverse the City and transport water intermittently.

DAM INUNDATION

Dam inundation occurs as a result of the structural failure of a dam.  This failure may be a result of seismic activity, severe flooding or other catastrophic events.  The City of Placentia is within the dam inundation area of the Carbon Canyon Dam and the Prado Dam.  Potential areas of inundation are illustrated in Exhibit 8-3, Carbon Canyon Dam Inundation Area and Exhibit 8-4, Prado Dam Inundation Areas.  

* Carbon Canyon Dam

The Carbon Canyon Dam, an earthfill structure with a capacity of 6,614 acre-feet, is located approximately one (1) mile north of Placentia.  The drainage area above the dam is 19.3 square miles.  The structure provides flood protection to the cities of Placentia, Brea, Yorba Linda, Anaheim, Fullerton, Buena Park and unincorporated areas of the County of Orange.  The Carbon Canyon Dam rarely contains threatening quantities of water.  However, when the dam is filled to its capacity, the reservoir could create some potential upstream flooding problems. 

If an inundation event should occur as a result of dam failure, floodwaters are expected to generally follow the path of the Carbon Canyon Creek Channel.  Floodwaters may potentially reach the SR-91 Freeway in the southern portion of the City.  Exhibit 8-3, Carbon Canyon Dam Inundation Areas, shows the inundation areas of the Carbon Canyon Dam.

* Prado Dam

Prado Dam, designed in the 1930s, is located approximately 18 miles east of Placentia in Riverside County.  The functioning capability of the Dam was increased (as of November 1999) due to the completion of the Seven Oaks Dam located approximately 40 miles upstream on the Santa Ana River.  During a flood, Seven Oaks Dam will store water intended for Prado Dam for as long as the reservoir pool at Prado Dam is rising.  Once the flood threat at Prado Dam passes, Seven Oaks Dam will begin to release its stored floodwater at a rate that does not exceed the downstream channel capacity.  Working in tandem, the Prado and Seven Oaks Dams provide increased flood protection to Orange County.  Exhibit 8-4, Prado Dam Inundation Areas, shows the inundation areas of the Prado Dam.

* Mainstem Project

The Santa Ana River Mainstem project is designed to provide flood protection to Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.  The proposed improvements cover 75 miles from the headwater of the Santa Ana River, east of the City of San Bernardino, to the mouth of the river at the Pacific Ocean between the cities of Newport Beach and Huntington Beach.  The Mainstem Project will increase flood protection to more than 3.35 million people within the three counties.  The project includes seven independent features: Seven Oaks Dam, Mill Creek Levee, San Timoteo Creek, Oak Street Drain, Prado Dam, Santiago Creek and the lower Santa Ana River.

The City has prepared emergency evacuation plans for the Prado and Carbon Canyon Dams.  These plans are detailed in the City of Placentia Emergency Operation Plan and are located at the Emergency Operations Center at City Hall.

SEISMIC HAZARDS

This section describes the presence and characteristics of seismic hazards in Placentia, including earthquake faults, surface rupture and ground shaking, liquefaction, potentially hazardous buildings and seismic response.

Earthquake Faults

Active faults, structural zones and historically destructive earthquakes characterize this area of Southern California. According to the Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology, six faults are located within close proximity to Placentia.  These include the Whittier-Elsinore, Norwalk, NewportInglewood, Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes and San Gabriel faults.  The San Andreas and San Jacinto faults are located some distance from Placentia, but have the potential to deliver larger magnitude earthquakes.  The closest fault to Placentia is the Whittier-Elsinore, approximately 1,000 feet north of Placentia.  There are no identified Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones within the City limits.   A map illustrating the location of faults and fault zones in the proximity of Placentia is shown in Exhibit 8-5, Regional Fault Map.

* Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone.  The WhittierElsinore Fault is approximately 1,000 feet northeast of the City.  The Whittier Fault extends over twenty miles from the Whittier Narrows near the City of Whittier, southeasterly to the Santa Ana River where it merges with the southeasterly trending Elsinore Fault.  Together, these two faults combined with smaller faults are known as the Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone.  There have been several minor earthquakes along this fault zone.  Seismic history reveals that the fault is able to produce a seismic event of magnitude 6.0 or greater.

* Norwalk Fault.  The Norwalk Fault is approximately 16 miles long and is located near the northwest boundary of the City.  Seismic activity has occurred along this fault and the fault may have been the cause of a 4.7 magnitude earthquake.
				
* NewportInglewood Structural Zone.  The Newport-Inglewood structural zone is a series of northwesterly trending folded hills and echelon faults extending from the southern edge of the Santa Monica Mountains southeastward to the offshore area of Newport Beach.  This structural zone is approximately 17 miles west/southwest of Placentia.  Fault segments for this zone include:

?	Charnock Fault;					
?	AvalonCompton Fault;
?	Overland Avenue Fault;				
?	Cherry Hill Fault;
Insert Exhibit 8-5
Regional Fault Map
8.5 x 11


?	Inglewood Fault;					
?	Seal Beach Fault; and
?	Potrero Fault.

Numerous seismic events of 4.0 magnitude or greater, including the historic 6.3 magnitude Long Beach earthquake in March 1933, have been generated within this fault zone and suggest an active seismic history.  Although there has been no observed ground displacement associated with the NewportInglewood structural zone, there may have been subsurface fault displacement of approximately seven inches associated with the October 21, 1941, and June 18, 1944, earthquakes. This structural zone could generate a 7.6-plus magnitude maximum credible earthquake.

San Andreas Fault.  The San Andreas Fault extends over 600 miles, encompassing virtually the entire length of California. The fault is divided into segments that have distinctive behavior patterns. The southern segment of the fault is over 300 miles long and occasionally delivers large earthquakes.  This fault is located approximately 35 miles north/northeast of Placentia.

The last significant earthquake on this segment was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake that is believed to have caused a surface rupture extending 200 miles. Several other earthquakes have been attributed to the San Andreas Fault.  The latest event affecting Southern California was a 6.7 magnitude quake in 1899.  It is estimated by geologists that this fault may have the potential to generate an earthquake of magnitude 8.5 on the Richter scale, which is designated as the maximum credible earthquake.

San Jacinto Fault.  The San Jacinto Fault branches from the San Andreas Fault on the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains and parallels the San Andreas to the MexicoCalifornia border. The San Jacinto fault has been very active, with damaging earthquakes occurring along its entire length.  The last earthquake on this fault exceeding a magnitude 6.0 occurred in 1968. Ten damaging earthquakes have been attributed to this fault since the 1800s, ranging from 5.4 to 6.8 on the Richter scale.  This fault is located approximately 34 miles northeast of Placentia.

SURFACE RUPTURE AND GROUND SHAKING

Surface rupture resulting from earthquakes is unlikely to occur in Placentia because no faults have been identified within the City boundaries.  Typically, surface rupture occurs in near-surface materials, reflecting differential compaction or liquefaction of underlying materials.  The potential for ground cracking exists, especially in those areas of the City which have moderate to high potential for liquefaction. 

Ground shaking impacts on Placentia depends on several factors. The particular fault, fault location, distance from the City and magnitude of the earthquake all determine the degree of shaking that will occur in the City.  In addition, the soil and geologic structure underlying Placentia influences the amount of damage that the City may experience.  Exhibit 8-6, Geologic Conditions, provides an overview of geologic conditions within the City. 

Insert Exhibit 8-6
Geologic Conditions

The NewportInglewood Fault is anticipated to generate the most destructive ground shaking in Placentia. The Whittier-Elsinore and Norwalk Faults, though closer to the City, are predicted to generate smaller magnitude earthquakes. The San Jacinto Fault is very active and has historically produced 6.0 to 7.0 magnitude earthquakes.  However, as Placentia lies approximately 30 miles to the southwest, the distance between the City and this fault would alleviate the ground shaking impact.

LIQUEFACTION HAZARDS

Liquefaction is the result of strong ground shaking of water-saturated, loose to moderately dense sand and silty sand.  Strong ground shaking causes sediment,  saturated with groundwater, to lose strength and behave as though it was a liquid.  Liquefaction occurs where the water table is high and soils are generally loose.  Liquefaction is generally associated with shallow ground water conditions and the presence of loose and sandy soils or alluvial deposits.  The California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology provides mapping of liquefaction hazard zones for the City of Placentia.  Exhibit 8-7, Potential Liquefaction Hazards, illustrates those areas in the City of Placentia subject to liquefaction.

Placentia, like most of Orange County, has granular sandy soil with high water content.  Areas with these conditions may experience liquefaction during extreme ground shaking.  Areas of high liquefaction potential occur within the central, southernmost and easternmost portions of Placentia

STRUCTURE FAILURE

During a seismic event, Placentia may be subjected to high levels of ground shaking.  As a result, structures within the community could sustain substantial damage.  Some structures are particularly susceptible to earthquake damage, including tiltup structures, unreinforced masonry buildings, older buildings, buildings over four stories and mobile homes.  Concrete tiltups built prior to 1974 may be especially susceptible. 

SEISMIC RESPONSE

The possible geologic effects of a major earthquake on Placentia include rupture of the ground surface associated directly with movement on geologic faults, ground failure due to liquefaction, ground shaking with moderate to high lateral accelerations and in general, collapse of buildings as a result of groundshaking.  Partial to total collapse of buildings could occur among pre-1933 buildings and partial collapse of some tilt-up and concrete block buildings could occur among buildings built prior to March 1972.  Buildings constructed under modern building codes, where current state-of-the-art seismic evaluations and where disaster preparedness is being maintained, are expected to survive the maximum expected earthquake with relatively moderate losses.     


LANDSLIDE HAZARDS

The City of Placentia is characterized by a relatively flat topography.  Approximately 68 percent of total land in the City has slopes of less than three percent.1  According to the State of California Division of Mines and Geology, Official Map of Seismic Hazard Zones (1998)2, no earthquake induced landslides are likely to occur within the City’s boundaries based on the area's predominately flat terrain.

3.2.2	MAN-MADE HAZARDS

A number of hazards present in the City of Placentia are a result of manmade facilities or activities. This section explores hazardous materials, fire, crime and rail safety.

HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC MATERIALS

Hazardous materials are any substance(s) or combination, which, because of quantity, concentration or characteristics may have the potential to cause or significantly contribute to an increase in death or serious injury, or pose substantial hazards to humans and/or the environment.  Local governments have little control over the production and use of these materials because they are necessary products or by-products of everyday functions.  Even household wastes can be hazardous materials and pose a threat to public health.

Emergency response plans are in place with the City in the event a hazardous or toxic materials event occurs.  In addition, the Orange County Fire Authority provides emergency response to incidents involving hazardous materials.  The Orange County Fire Authority Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT) directly responds to hazardous materials incidents.  However, if another city’s fire station (i.e. Anaheim), equipped and trained to handle hazardous materials releases, is within closer proximity to the release, then the corresponding fire station would provide emergency response.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORT

Hazardous materials incidents may be a result of accidents that occur during transport of hazardous materials via truck or rail transportation.  State Route 91 and State Route 57 traverse the western and southern boundaries of the City and provide the primary regional transportation corridors for the transport of hazardous materials.  In addition, industrial facilities located near major transportation routes are more susceptible to spills of hazardous materials than are other parts of the community.  A release could also occur along existing rail lines that traverse the City.

Fixed Facilities

There is the potential for hazardous materials spills or incidents within or directly adjacent to facilities that warehouse, manufacture and process hazardous or toxic materials within or directly adjacent to Placentia.  The use of hazardous materials in these facilities can pose a significant threat however, Federal, State and local regulatory requirements and site-specific contingency and evacuation plans reduce these potential threats.

The Orange County Fire Authority Hazardous Materials Disclosure Office identifies facilities that contain or handle hazardous materials.  According to the City’s Emergency Operations Plan Hazard Assessment for Hazardous Materials, approximately 251 facilities have been identified as containing or handling hazardous materials.

Two facilities have the greatest potential to threaten the health and safety of Placentia residents:

* Pargas Propane Distribution Facility

The Pargas Propane Distribution Facility is an aboveground propane gas distribution facility located in the southwestern portion of the City.  Release of hazardous materials from this center could result in a highly volatile situation.  Prevailing winds may also pose a potential threat from several industrial complexes in the vicinity of Orangethorpe Avenue and Melrose Street.

The Pargas facility contains five liquid transfer locations.  These facilities include transport unloading, railcar unloading, cylinder charging dock, truck fill riser and dispensing unit.

* Unocal 76 Research Center

The Unocal 76 Fred L. Hartley Research Center, located north of Placentia in the City of Brea poses a potential risk to Placentia residents.  The Unocal facility utilizes a number of hazardous materials, including anhydrous ammonia, technical grade solvents, fuels and miscellaneous cylinder gases and other materials.  The City of Placentia has evaluated the potential impacts of a hazardous materials incident and has determined a Sphere of Influence for the potential release of hazardous materials.  Exhibit 8-8, Unocal Chemical Plant Sphere of Influence, illustrates the areas in Placentia that may be directly affected by a hazardous materials incident.

Illegal Dumping

Illegal dumping of hazardous materials pose significant threats to the health and safety of Placentia residents.  It is assumed that occasional illegal dumping activities will occur within the City as the City has experienced unauthorized dumping in the past.  Since this type of dumping is clandestine in nature, it is difficult for the City to anticipate when and where such activities will occur.  Illegal dumping poses threats to the health and safety of residents and may cause damage to underground water supplies, sewage and stormwater conveyance systems and other public facilities.

Pipeline and Well Hazards

Oil recovery operations occurring within the City limits pose a threat to the health and safety of Placentia residents.  Regulation of these oil recovery operations has progressed in recent times with an emphasis on environmental protection and public safety.  These regulations promote safe oil recovery and production in urbanized areas.  Local regulations are found within the Uniform Fire Code (UFC) and the Placentia Municipal Code.

The City of Placentia has numerous wells and pipelines that extract and transport potentially hazardous materials.  Exhibit 8-9a, Well Locations and Exhibit 8-9b, Pipeline Locations, illustrates the locations of well facilities.  Pipelines represent a hazard due to the contents of the pipelines and the potential for them to rupture, causing chemical leaks, explosions or fires.

Household Hazardous Waste

Household hazardous wastes pose a potential risk to all Placentia residents.  Many everyday cleaners, chemicals and other household products have the potential to harm residents or pollute the environment.  The improper disposal of household hazardous wastes can be extremely harmful to the human and natural environment.

To assist residents with the disposal of household hazardous waste, the City of Placentia offers a residential collection program for seniors and disabled residents.  Items are picked up from the resident’s home at no charge.  For residents who do not qualify for this program, a Household Hazardous Waste Collection Center, located at 1071 North Blue Gum Street in Anaheim, accepts hazardous waste materials in their original containers.  In addition, Placentia residents can contact a recycling center to pick up used motor oil from their home for recycling.

3.3	FIRE, POLICE PROTECTION AND MEDICAL EMERGENCIES

3.3.1	FIRE PROTECTION

FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES

The Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) provides services to the City of Placentia under a joint powers agreement (JPA) to provide fire prevention, suppression and emergency services to 22 jurisdictions within Orange County.  The OCFA has served the City of Placentia since May 16, 1980.  Fire Station 34, located at 1530 North Valencia and Fire Station 35, located at 110 South Bradford, provide fire service to the City (refer to Exhibit 8-10, Fire Station Facilities).  In addition to Fire Station 34 and Fire Station 35, resources are deployed based upon a regional service delivery system, assigning personnel and equipment to emergency incidents without regard to jurisdictional boundaries.  The equipment used by the department as the versatility to respond to both urban and wildland emergency conditions.  Contracted fire

services include community safety services, finance, administration and human resources services, technical services and fire operations.3  The OCFA responded to 4,117 incidents within Placentia in 2000.
	 
FIRE STATION FACILITIES

Table 8-1, Fire Station Facilities, identifies the equipment and personnel provided by fire stations serving Placentia.  Station 34 is equipped with one paramedic engine with four personnel per shift, one truck with four personnel per shift and one battalion chief per shift.  Station 35 is equipped with one engine (squirt) with 3 personnel per shift.

According to the OCFA, the standard response goal throughout the OCFA is for the first engine to reach the emergency scene within five minutes 80 percent of the time and a paramedic to reach the scene within eight minutes 90 percent of the time.4  This standard is met and exceeded in the City of Placentia.  The current ISO rating for the City of Placentia is Class 3.

FIRE HAZARD POTENTIAL

The City of Placentia is an urbanized community with a minimal inventory of natural open space and vegetation.  Therefore, the threat of wildland fires within the City limits is significantly diminished.  Fires occurring in the urban environment pose the largest threat to Placentia residents.

Building materials and wind speeds can contribute significantly to the spread of urban fires.  According to the OCFA, a significant portion of Placentia’s housing stock contains wood shingled roofs.  The majority of these housing units are concentrated in the northern portion of the City. The City is occasionally subject to periodic high winds, which contribute to the spread of fire. However, the separation and setback requirements that were in effect when most houses in the City were constructed assist in minimizing fire risk.  Additionally, the OCFA has identified the following significant hazards within Placentia:

?	Fire spread potential in attached buildings in “Old Town”; 

?	Older packing house style construction near Bradford and Placentia;

?	Pargas - A LPG storage and transfer facility on Melrose Avenue;

?	Substantial oil field development, wells, tanks, pipelines, etc., throughout the city; and

?	Main-line BNSF rail corridor on the south side of the City.

3.3.2	POLICE PROTECTION

The City of Placentia operates its own police department at the City Hall complex.  The City’s Police force serves Placentia with a current (2003) staff of 53 sworn full-time officers, 18 non-sworn full-time personnel (including civilians), 7 non-sworn part-time personnel, (including civilian employees) and 5 volunteers.  The Police Department is divided into two divisions: Operations and Support Services.

The ability to quickly and effectively respond to emergency situations is a primary objective of the Placentia Police Department.  Quick and effective response to emergency situations is an important means in evaluating police service in the community.  The City of Placentia regularly evaluates response times to ensure police services respond effectively to the needs of the population.  Table 8-2, Police Department Response Times, illustrates the Departments response times based on the type of call.

The Placentia Police Department takes pride in the level of service provided to the community.  In addition to crime and safety services, several community programs and services are provided to enhance the Police Department’s level of service to the community.  These programs and services include Fingerprinting, a Bicycle Safety Program, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), a Burglary Prevention Program and a Robbery Prevention Program.

Call TypeAverage Response TimePriority One – Emergency Response2 MinutesPriority Two – Urgent Response2 to 7 MinutesPriority Three – Non-Emergency Response7 MinutesSource:  City of Placentia Police Department, October 2001.


The Placentia Police Department encourages public involvement through a variety of programs including the Neighborhood Watch Program, Radio Watch, Crossing Guard Program, Reserve Officer Program, volunteers in Police Program and the Ride Along Program.  Through these programs, citizens work directly with Department personnel to better serve the community.

3.4	RAIL SAFETY

Rail safety is of primary concern to the City of Placentia.  With increased demand for commuter and commercial rail services, additional rail traffic is expected.  Currently, more than 50 trains per day travel through the Orangethorpe rail corridor that serves the ports of Los Angeles and the Midwest (refer to Exhibit 8-11, Rail Line and Crossings).  This corridor, which is the point of intersection of the San Bernardino Subdivision and the Orange/Olive Subdivision in the Placentia and Anaheim area, is referred to as the Orange County Gateway.  The number of trains traveling through the Gateway is projected to increase to 135 per day by the year 2020.  Train traffic currently halts auto and pedestrian traffic at the intersections it crosses.  Increases in train traffic would result in further delays at these intersections.  In addition, delays occur for commuters and emergency-response traffic such as police cars and ambulances.

OnTrac was formed in April of 2000 to build and sustain support for the Orangethorpe Avenue Grade Separation and Trade Corridor project.  OnTrac is a 5-mile long railroad-lowering project that will be a complete grade separation at 11 rail crossings in the cities of Placentia and Anaheim.  The project will connect the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the transcontinental rail network, creating a faster, more efficient method of distributing the expected $250 billion in trade.  For 5 miles through Placentia and Anaheim, freight and passenger trains will travel through a trench, allowing local passenger and business traffic to flow unimpeded at rail crossings.  The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) has approved an Agreement recognizing OnTrac as the implementing agency for projects utilizing the funding appropriated to the State Traffic Congestion Relief Program.  OnTrac is working closely with OCTA and State transportation officials on a comprehensive Southern California trade corridor plan.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION 

The Noise Element of the General Plan establishes the policy framework for limiting exposure to objectionable noise. The Noise Element includes an overview of noise terminology, a description of the effects of noise on humans, applicable State regulations, a summary of the City noise environment and a statement of goals and policies designed to minimize existing and foreseeable noise impacts.  The Noise Element is intended to guide decision-making for projects that may have potential noise impacts and in assessing compliance with California Noise Insulation Standards.

Analysis of existing and future noise environments within Placentia should be integrated into land use planning decisions.  The Element presents the existing and future noise environments so that the City will include noise impact considerations when evaluating projects. Noise and land use compatibility guidelines are presented, as well as noise standards for new development. 

2.0 	AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT 

The Noise Element follows guidelines as set forth in State Government Code Section 65302(f)(1).

“…a A nNoise eElement which that shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community.  The Noise Element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify…current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources: (1) highways and freeways; (2) primary arterials and major local streets; (3) passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems; (4) commercial, general aviation, heliport, and military airport operations, aircraft operations, aircraft overflight, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation; (5)local industrial plants, including but not limited to, railroad classification yards; (6) other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.” 

3.0	SUMMARY OF MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDS

3.1 	NOISE SCALES AND DEFINITIONS

Decibels (dB) are based on the logarithmic scale.  The logarithmic scale compresses the wide range in sound pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes.  In terms of human response to noise, a sound 10 dB higher than another is judged to be twice as loud; and 20 dB higher four times as loud; and so forth.  Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very loud).  The A-weighted sound pressure level is the sound pressure level, in decibels, as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighted filter network.  The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound, placing greater emphasis on those frequencies within the sensitivity range of the human ear. Examples, of various sound levels in different environments are shown in Table 9-1, Sound Levels and Human Response.

Many methods have been developed for evaluating community noise to account for the following characteristics:

?	The variation of noise levels over time;
?	The influence of periodic individual loud events; and
?	The community response to changes in the community noise environment.

A variety of methodologies have been developed to measure sound over a period of time.  These methods include: 1) the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL); 2) the Equivalent Sound Level (Leq); and 3) the Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn).

3.1.1	COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL)

Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is the primary community noise rating scale used in California for land use compatibility assessment.  The CNEL quantifies an average of 24 hourly readings of equivalent levels, known as Leq’s, based on an A-weighted decibel with upward adjustments added to account for increased noise sensitivity in the evening and night periods.  These adjustments are +5 dBA for the evening, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., and +10 dBA for the night, 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  CNEL may be indicated by “dBA CNEL” or just “CNEL”.
3.1.2	EQUIVALENT SOUND LEVEL (Leq)

The Equivalent Sound Level (Leq) is the sound level containing the same total energy over a given sample time period.  The Leq can be thought of as the steady sound level, which in a stated period of time would contain the same acoustic energy as the time-varying sound level during the same period.  Leq is typically computed over 1, 8 and 24-hour sample periods.

3.1.3	DAY/NIGHT AVERAGE (Ldn)

Day/Night Average (Ldn) is an additional and commonly used method for measuring sound.  The Ldn quantifies the 24-hour average noise level at a stationary location.  Ldn has been adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for developing criteria for the evaluation of community noise exposure.  It is based on a measure of the average noise level over a given time period which is the Leq.  The Ldn is quantified through averaging the Leq’s for each hour of the day at a given location after penalizing the “sleeping hours” (defined as 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), by 10 dBA to account for the increased sensitivity of people to noises that occur at night.  

3.1.4	OTHER NOISE MATRICES

The maximum noise level recorded during a noise event is typically expressed as Lmax.  The sound level exceeded over a specified time frame can be expressed as Ln (i.e., L90, L50, L10, etc).  L50 equals the level exceeded 50 percent of the time, L10 ten percent of the time, etc.

Humans tend to respond to changes in sound pressure in a logarithmic manner.  In general, a 1 dBA change in the sound pressure levels of a given sound is detectable only under laboratory conditions.  A 3 dBA change in sound pressure level is considered as a “just detectable” difference in most situations.  A 5 dBA change is readily noticeable and a 10 dBA change is considered a doubling (or halving) of the subjective loudness.  It should be noted that a 3 dBA increase or decrease in the average traffic noise level is realized by a doubling or halving of the traffic volume; or by about a 7 mile per hour (mph) increase or decrease in speed.

For each doubling of distance from a point noise source, the sound level will decrease by 6 dBA.  In other words, if a person is 100 feet from a 12 dBA noise source, and moves 200 feet from that source, sound levels will drop approximately 6 dBA.  For each doubling of distance from a line source, like a roadway, noise levels are reduced by 3 to 5 decibels, depending on the ground cover between the source and the receiver.

Noise barriers can provide approximately a 5 dBA CNEL noise reduction (additional reduction may be provided with a barrier of appropriate height, material, location and length).  A row of buildings provides up to 5 dBA CNEL noise reduction with a 1.5 dBA CNEL reduction for each additional row up to a maximum reduction of approximately 10 dBA. The exact degree of noise attenuation depends on the nature and orientation of the structure and intervening barriers.

3.2	NOISE STANDARDS

3.2.1	FEDERAL NOISE STANDARDS

The United States Noise Control Act of 1972 (NCA) recognized the role of the Federal government in dealing with major commercial noise sources in order to provide for uniform treatment of such sources.  As Congress has the authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, regulation of noise generated by such commerce also falls under congressional authority. The Federal government specifically preempts local control of noise emissions from aircraft, railroad and interstate highways.

The U.S. EPA has identified acceptable noise levels for various land uses, in order to protect public welfare, allowing for an adequate margin of safety, in addition to establishing noise emission standards for interstate commerce activities.

3.2.2	STATE NOISE STANDARDS

The Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services has developed criteria and guidelines for local governments to use when setting standards for human exposure to noise and preparing noise elements for General Plans.  These guidelines include noise exposure levels for both exterior and interior environments. In addition, Title 25, Section 1092 of the California Code of Regulations sets forth requirements for the insulation of multiple-family residential dwelling units from excessive and potentially harmful noise. The State indicates that locating units in areas where exterior ambient noise levels exceed 65 dBA is undesirable. Whenever such units are to be located in such areas, the developer must incorporate into building design construction features, which reduce interior noise levels to 45 dBA CNEL.  Tables 9-2 and 9-3, summarize standards adopted by various State and Federal agencies. Table 9-2, Noise and Land Use Compatibility Matrix, presents criteria used to assess the compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise environment. Table 9-3, State of California Interior and Exterior Noise Standards, indicates standards and criteria that specify acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the state. These standards and criteria will be incorporated into the land use planning process to reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities. These tables are the primary tools that allow the City to ensure integrated planning for compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise.

3.2.3	CITY NOISE ORDINANCE

The City of Placentia has adopted a Noise Ordinance noise standards for noise levels that sets forth standards for noise levels citywide and provides the means to enforce the reduction of objectionable or offensive noises (refer to Table 9-4, City Noise Ordinance Standards).  Chapter 23.76 of the Placentia Municipal Code establishes noise standards and enforcement procedures (the “Noise Ordinance”).

The City’s Noise Ordinance is designed to protect people from objectionable non-transportation noise sources such as music, construction activity, machinery and pumps and air conditioners.  Enforcement of the Ordinance ensures that adjacent properties are not exposed to excessive noise from stationary sources.  Enforcing the Noise Ordinance includes requiring proposed development to show compliance with the Ordinance, and requiring construction activity to comply with established noise limits.  The Ordinance will be reviewed periodically for adequacy and amended, as needed, to address community needs and development patterns.

3.3	EXISTING NOISE CONDITIONS

Noise sources in the City of Placentia fall into the following three basic categories:

?	Train operations (from the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad);
?	Roadways; and
?	Stationary sources (including industrial and commercial centers).

3.3.1	TRAIN OPERATIONS

The primary noise source in the City of Placentia is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) line located in the southern portion of the City.  This rail-line traverses the City in an east/west direction, generally parallel to Crowther and Orangethorpe Avenues.  The rail corridor, which serves the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, is referred to as the Orange County Gateway.  An estimated 50 trains per day, or two trains per hour, travel through this corridor.  Approximately 90 percent of daily rail traffic is related to freight operations. The remaining traffic is comprised of passenger operations, including MetroLink and Amtrak service.  The estimated 50 trains per day are forecast to increase to 100 trains per day by the year 2010 and to over 135 trains per day by the year 2020.

The rail corridor is situated adjacent to residential, commercial and industrial uses.  Residential developments and other sensitive uses located along the rail corridor would require sound insulation to mitigate noise to an acceptable level.  Further, additional measures may be required to mitigate vibration.

In anticipation of the projected increase in train traffic, the City of Placentia is a primary participant in the Orange North-American Trade Rail Access Corridor (On-Trac) Authority.  Implementation of this project is anticipated to result in many environmental benefits to the City of Placentia including reduced noise and vibration.

3.3.2	ROADWAYS

Traffic noise on surface streets is a significant source of noise within the community.  Roadways in the City are designated according to five classifications:

?	Freeway;
?	Major Arterial;
?	Primary Arterial;
?	Secondary Arterial; and
?	Collectors.

Exhibit 9-1, Functional Roadway Classifications, illustrates the major roadways in the City along with their respective classification. Noise levels along roadways are determined by a number of traffic characteristics, most important of which is the average daily traffic (ADT).  Additional factors include the percentage of trucks, vehicle speed, the time distribution of traffic and gradient of the roadway.  All roadway classifications within the City, excluding collectors, would be considered significant noise generators since these roadways would be the most frequently traveled.

3.3.3	STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES

Stationary noise sources are defined as stationary devices that emit sound while fixed or motionless.  These include but are not limited to parking lots, delivery areas, outdoor loudspeakers and mechanical equipment of various types (i.e., air compressors, generators, heating/ventilation/air conditioning units).  These noise sources are typically associated with commercial and industrial land uses, which if located in proximity to residential land uses, may generate occasional noise impacts.  Commercial uses are found throughout the City, primarily along major arterials.  

NOISE SENSITIVE RECEPTORS

Housing is the predominant noise-sensitive land use in Placentia.  Residential uses are considered noise-sensitive because; (1) considerable time is spent by individuals at home, (2) significant activities occur outdoors and (3) sleep disturbance is most likely to occur in residential areas.  Mixed-use developments that include residential uses along major roadways are particularly sensitive since they are located in areas where higher noise levels are generated.

Other noise-sensitive land uses within the City of Placentia include:

?	Educational facilities;
?	Libraries;
?	Hospitals;
?	Group quarters (i.e., senior housing);
?	Park and recreation facilities;
?	Daycare facilities; and
?	Churches with daycare facilities.

Insert Exhibit 9-1
Functional Roadway Classifications
8.5 X 11


Exhibit 9-2, Noise Sensitive Receptors, illustrates the locations of these noise sensitive receptors.  Field measurements to identify ambient noise levels within the vicinity of these noise sensitive receptors were conducted on March 22, 2001.  The noise monitoring equipment used for field measurements consisted of a Larson Davis Laboratories Model 700 integrating sound level meter equipped with a Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) Type 41762” microphone.  Table 9-5, Field Noise Measurements, details the noise levels measured at each noise sensitive receptor.

4.0	NOISE CONTOURS

The noise environment for Placentia can be described using noise contours developed for the major noise sources within the City.  These contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the contour lines on a topographic map are lines of equal elevation.  The contours shown are the 60 and 65 dBA CNEL (Community Noise Equivalency Level) contours.  As previously stated, CNEL is a 24-hour time-weighted average noise level where noise which occurs during sensitive time periods is weighted more heavily.

60 CNEL

The 60 CNEL contour defines the Noise Study Zone.  The noise environment for any proposed noise-sensitive land use (for example, single- or multi-family residences, hospitals, schools or churches) within this zone should be evaluated on a project specific basis.  A project may require mitigation to meet City and/or State (Title 24) standards.  A site- and project-specific study will be required to determine what types(s) of measures will be necessary to mitigate interior building environment to acceptable levels.  Some sites may be sufficiently protected by existing walls or berms such that no further mitigation measures are required.

65 CNEL

The 65 CNEL contour defines the Noise Mitigation Zone. Within this contour, new or expanded noise-sensitive developments should be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures, such as barriers or additional sound insulation, are included and City and/or State noise standards are achieved.  In some instances it may be possible to show that existing walls, berms or screening may exist such that required mitigation is already in place.

TRAFFIC NOISE

Existing and future (Year 2025) roadway noise levels within the City were projected using the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Noise Prediction Model (FHWA RD-77-108) together with several roadway and site parameters.  These parameters determine the projected impact of vehicular traffic noise and include the roadway cross-section (e.g., number of lanes), the roadway width, the average daily traffic (ADT), the vehicle travel speed, the percentages of auto and truck traffic, the roadway grade, the angle-of-view, the site conditions and the percent of total ADT which flows each hour throughout a 24-hour period.  The model does not account for ambient noise levels (i.e., noise from adjacent land uses), or topographical differences between the roadways and adjacent land uses.  Noise projections are based on modeled vehicular traffic only as derived from the Circulation Element.  Table 9-6, Noise Contours, illustrates the noise environment as estimated in Year 2000 for existing land uses and traffic on major roadways and the future noise environment (Year 2025), as it would exist at full implementation of the General Plan.  Exhibit 9-3, Existing Noise Contours (2003) and Exhibit 9-4, Future Noise Contours (2025), illustrate the noise contours for existing and future noise levels in the City, respectively.

The inclusion of an area within a 60 or 65 CNEL contour shown in Exhibit 9-3 and 9-4 indicates that noise levels are high enough to be of potential concern.  However, this does not imply that excessive noise levels are present uniformly on all properties within the area.  Buildings, walls, berms and changes in topography affect noise levels.  Some locations may be screened from noise impacts by the presence of one or more of these features.

Table 9-6 illustrates the projected 60 dB contours under Existing Conditions (2003) ranging between approximately 65 feet (Golden Avenue: East of Valencia Avenue) and 1,182 feet (Rose Drive: Palm Drive to Buena Vista Avenue) from the roadway centerlines, while the 65 dB contour ranges between 20 feet (Golden Avenue: East of Valencia Avenue) and 374 feet (Rose Drive: Palm Drive to Buena Vista Avenue) from the roadway centerlines.

Table 9-6 illustrates the projected 60 dB contours under Build-Out (2025) ranging between approximately 56 feet (Bradford Avenue: Chapman Avenue to Crowther Avenue) and 1,499 feet (Rose Drive: Palm Drive to Buena Vista Avenue) from the roadway centerlines, while the 65 dB contour ranges between 18 feet (Bradford Avenue: Chapman Avenue to Crowther Avenue) and 474 feet (Rose Drive: Palm Drive to Buena Vista Avenue) from the roadway centerlines.

5.0	DESCRIPTION OF NOISE PLAN

The primary noise source in the City of Placentia is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) rail line.  As previously discussed, the On-Trac project is proposed to separate vehicular traffic at all rail crossings within the city. Implementation of this project is anticipated to reduce potential noise and vibration impacts in the City.

Transportation noise is the second-most significant noise source in Placentia. However, local government has little direct control over transportation noise at the source.  The most effective method for mitigating transportation noise is through site planning and the design and construction of noise barriers (generally a wall or berm). 

TYPICAL NOISE ATTENTUATION TECHNIQUES

Noise impacts can be mitigated in three basic ways; (1) by reducing the sound level of the noise generator, (2) by increasing the distance between the source and receiver and (3) insulating the receiver.

Noise reduction can be accomplished by the appropriate placement of walls, landscaped berms, or a combination of the two, between the noise source and the receiver.  Generally, effective noise shielding requires a solid barrier with a mass of at least four pounds per square-foot of surface area which is large enough to block the line of sight between source and receiver.  Variations may be appropriate in individual cases based on distance, nature and orientation of buildings behind the barrier, and a number of other factors.  Garages or other buildings may be used to shield dwelling units and outdoor living areas from traffic noise.

Noise insulation can also be accomplished through proper building design.  Nearby noise generators should be recognized in determining the location of doors, windows and vent openings.  Sound-rated windows (extra thick or multi-paned) and wall insulation are also effective.  These measures cannot realize their full potential unless care is taken in actual construction: doors and windows fitted properly; openings sealed; joints caulked; plumbing adequately insulated from structural members.

Insulation of noise sensitive uses, such as residences, schools, libraries, hospitals, care homes and certain types of stationary noise sources can reduce noise impacts.  More efficient approaches involve limiting the level of noise generation at the source.  State and Federal statutes have preempted local control over vehicular noise emissions but commercial and industrial operations and certain residential activities provide opportunities for local government to assist in noise abatement.  Local ordinances may establish maximum levels for noise generated on-site.  This usually takes the form of limiting the level of noise permitted to leave the property where it may impact other uses.

Although vehicular noise emissions standards are established at the State and Federal levels, local agencies can play a significant part in reducing traffic noise by controlling traffic volume and congestion.  Traffic noise is greatest at intersections due to acceleration, deceleration and gear shifting.  Measures such as signal synchronization can help to minimize this problem.  Likewise, reduction of congestion aids in reduction of noise.  This can be accomplished through the application of traffic engineering techniques such as channelization of turning movements, parking restrictions, separation of modes (bus, auto, bicycle, pedestrian) and restrictions on truck traffic.

Noise reduction through reduction of traffic volumes can also be accomplished with incentive programs for use of public transit facilities and high-occupancy vehicles, staggering of work hours and land use controls.  Vehicle trips can be turned into pedestrian trips with integration of housing and employment into the same project or area, construction of high-density, affordable housing in proximity to employment, shopping and public transit facilities and other techniques.

NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING 

The following methods are intended to prevent future noise and land use incompatibilities:

?	Enforce standards that specify acceptable noise limits for various land uses throughout the City.  Table 9-4 shows criteria used to assess the compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise environment.  These criteria are the basis of specific noise standards.  These standards, presented in Table 9-4, define City policy related to land uses and acceptable noise levels.

?	Incorporate noise-reduction features during site planning to mitigate anticipated noise impacts on affected noise-sensitive land uses.  The noise referral zones identified by 60 and 65 dB CNELs in Exhibits 9-3 and 9-4 can be used to identify locations of potential conflict.  New developments will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are included such that the standards contained in this Element are met in accordance with Table 9-4.

?	Enforce the provisions of the current State of California Uniform Building Code, which specifies that the indoor noise levels for multi-family residential living spaces not exceed 45 dB CNEL due to the combined effect of all noise sources.  The State requires special construction features to be incorporated within project design to attain this interior noise standard when the outdoor noise levels exceed 65 dB CNEL.

?	The Noise Referral Zones (the 65 dB CNEL contour) can be used to determine when this standard needs to be addressed. The Uniform Building Code requires that “interior” CNEL/Ldn with windows closed, attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an annual CNEL or Ldn of 45 dB in any habitable room. The code requires that this standard be applied to all new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings other than detached single-family dwellings. The City will also apply this standard to single-family dwellings.

?	Coordinate all land use planning and design efforts in the environs of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad line to be consistent with noise levels for the railroad line.  Noise sensitive land uses should be prohibited inside the 65 CNEL contour projected for the railroad line and all noise sensitive land uses inside the 60 CNEL contour should be designed to mitigate railroad noise.

NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL

People must be protected from excessive noise from non-transportation sources, including commercial and industrial centers.  These impacts are most effectively controlled through the application of the City’s Noise Ordinance.

?	Enforce the City of Placentia Noise Ordinance. The Ordinance protects people from non-transportation related noise sources such as music, machinery, pumps and air conditioners.

?	Require that any proposed development and building projects demonstrate compliance with the City Noise Element and Ordinance prior to project approval. Notify applicants for building permits that include mechanical equipment that this requirement exists.

?	Require construction activity to comply with limits established in the City Noise Ordinance. Ensure adequate noise control measures at all construction sites through provision of mufflers and the physical separation of machinery staging and maintenance areas from adjacent residential uses.

?	Limit delivery hours for commercial and industrial uses with loading areas or docks fronting, siding, bordering, or gaining access on driveways adjacent to noise-sensitive uses.  Exemption from this restriction shall be based solely on attaining full compliance with the nighttime noise limits of the noise ordinance.

6.0	PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES

The Noise Element’s goals and policies provide direction for compatible land use planning and noise integration and for reduced noise impacts throughout the community.

TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL

Planning Factor

Transportation sources are a major cause of noise within the City of Placentia.  Controlling transportation noise sources is difficult, as the City has little control over reducing transportation noise due to State and Federal noise standards preemption.   

Goal	N-1	Reduce noise impacts from transportation noise sources.

Chapter 1: Introduction
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
               The 2006-2014 Housing Element provides for the identification and analysis of
               existing and projected housing needs and articulates the Cityâ€™s official policies for the
               preservation, conservation, improvement and production of housing within the City
               of Placentia.
PURPOSE AND CONTENT
               The City of Placentiaâ€™s Housing Element addresses adequate housing opportunities
               for present and future residents through 2014 and provides the primary policy
               guidance for local decision-making related to housing.
               California Government Code Section 65583 requires a jurisdictionâ€™s Housing Element
               include the following components:
               ï‚§   A review of the previous Elementâ€™s goals, policies, objectives and programs to
                   ascertain the effectiveness of each of these components, as well as the overall
                   effectiveness of the Housing Element;
               ï‚§   An assessment of housing need and an inventory of resources and constraints
                   related to meeting these needs;
               ï‚§   A statement of goals, policies and quantified objectives related to the
                   maintenance, preservation, improvement and development of housing; and,
               ï‚§   A policy program that provides a schedule of actions that the City is undertaking
                   or intends to undertake implementing the policies set forth in the Housing
                   Element.
HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS
               The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
               suitable living environment for every Californian as the Stateâ€™s main housing goal.
               Recognizing the important part that local planning programs play in pursuit of this
               goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing
               Element as part of their comprehensive General Plans (California Government Code
               Section 65302(c)).
               This Housing Element update covers the planning period from January 2006 to July
               2014. State planning law mandates that jurisdictions within the Southern California
               Association of Governments (SCAG) region update and adopt their Housing Element
               by June 30, 2008. It is intended that this Housing Element be reviewed annually and
               updated and modified not less than every five years in order to remain relevant and
               useful and reflect the communityâ€™s changing housing needs. This document
               represents the update required and responds to the issues that currently face the City.
Final                                        1-1                                        March 2, 2010

Chapter 1: Introduction
STATE LAW AND LOCAL PLANNING
                  CONSISTENCY WITH STATE LAW
                  The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements required by the State
                  of California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California
                  Government Code. It is the only General Plan Element that requires review and
                  certification by the State of California. State Law requires that each jurisdictionâ€™s
                  Housing Element consist of â€œan identification and analysis of existing and projected
                  housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and
                  scheduled program actions for the preservation, improvement, and development of
                  housing.â€ The Housing Element plans for the provision of housing for all segments of
                  the population.
                  Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific requirements regarding the
                  scope and content of each Housing Element. Table 1-1 summarizes these
                  requirements and identifies the applicable sections in the Housing Element where
                  these requirements are addressed.

                  GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
                  The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various
                  elements of a General Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the
                  General Planâ€™s various Elements shall provide an integrated and internally consistent
                  and compatible statement of policy. The City has reviewed the other elements of the
                  General Plan and has determined that this Housing Element provides consistency
                  with the other Elements of the General Plan. The City will maintain this consistency as
                  future General Plan amendments are processed by evaluating proposed amendments
                  for consistency with all elements of the General Plan.

CHAPTER 2: HOUSING PROFILE
INTRODUCTION
             When preparing the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate both existing and
             future housing needs for all income groups.
             This section analyzes demographic and housing characteristics that influence the
             demand for and availability of housing. The analyses form a foundation for
             establishing programs and policies that seek to address identified housing needs.
             Housing needs are identified according to income, tenure and special needs groups.
             Primary data sources include the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census, the California
             Department of Finance and the Southern California Association of Governments.
             These data sources are the most reliable for assessing existing conditions and provide
             a basis for consistent comparison with historical data and the basis for forecasts.
COMMUNITY PROFILE
             POPULATION TRENDS AND CHARACTERISTICS
             Housing needs are generally influenced by population and employment trends. This
             section provides a summary of the changes to the population size, age and
             racial/ethnic composition of Placentia.
             Historical, Existing and Forecast Growth
             The City of Placentia is one of the 34 cities within Orange County. The Department
             of Finance estimates Orange Countyâ€™s population at 3,121,251 in 2008, ranking as
             the third largest county in the state. Orange County was the second largest county in
             California in 2000 with 2,846,289 residents. Overall, the County has experienced
             rapid population growth over the last two decades. From 1980 to 1990, the
             population increased by 24.7 percent. From 1990 to 2000, the County population
             increased by 18.1 percent. Table 2-1 lists the counties in southern California, and

                     According to the U.S. Census Bureau and State Department of Finance, Placentia
                     experienced a 14.2 percent population increase between 1990 and 2000 and a 9.8
                     percent increase between 2000 and 2008 (see Table 2-2). As shown on Figure 2-1,
                     the Center for Demographic Research at Cal State Fullerton forecasts a leveling in
                     population growth rate over the next 20 years with a forecast population of
                     approximately 61,456 in 2030.

                EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
                Housing needs are influenced by employment trends. Significant employment
                opportunities within the City can lead to growth in demand for housing in proximity
                to jobs. The quality or pay of available employment can determine the need for
                various housing types and prices.
                As shown in Table 2-5, the largest group of Placentia residents in 2000 was employed
                in educational, health and social services with over 18 percent of the labor force,
                closely followed by manufacturing with over 17 percent. Over 10 percent were
                employed in retail trade. Approximately 10 percent were employed in professional,
                scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services. Eight
                percent were employed in finance, insurance, real estate, and rental and leasing.
                Seven percent were employed in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation
                and food services.

                HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
                This section describes Placentiaâ€™s housing occupancy characteristics. The U.S. Census
                Bureau defines a household as all persons living in a single housing unit, whether or
                not they are related. One person living alone is considered a household, as is a group
                of unrelated people living in a single housing unit. The U.S. Census Bureau defines a
                family as related persons living within a single housing unit.
                Household Formation and Composition
                In 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 15,138 households in Placentia, a 13
                percent increase from 1990, as shown in Table 2-8. In comparison, total households
                in Orange County increased by 12.8 percent between 1990 and 2000 and total

                    The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) generates an
                    annual median family income for the purpose of determining program eligibility. The
                    2008 median family income (MFI) for Orange County, including the City of Placentia,
                    is $84,100.
                    The State of California uses five income categories to determine housing affordability.
                    These categories are as follows:
                    ï‚§    Extremely Low-income- 0% to 30% of the median income;
                    ï‚§    Very Low-income- 31% to 50% of the median income;
                    ï‚§    Low-income- 51% to 80% of the median income;
                    ï‚§    Moderate-income- 81% to 120% of the median income; and,
                    ï‚§    Above Moderate-income- greater than 120% of the median income.
                    Table 2-11 shows the income ranges for each income category based on the 2008

                Approximately 68.8 percent of Placentiaâ€™s housing units were owner-occupied and
                31.2 percent of the units were renter-occupied in 2000. As shown in Table 2-18, the
                percentage of owner-occupied units in Placentia was comparatively higher than
                Orange County and California as a whole.

                Vacancy Rates
                Vacancy rates are an indicator of housing supply and demand. Low vacancy rates
                influence greater upward price pressures. A higher vacancy rate indicates downward
                price pressure. A four to five percent vacancy rate is considered â€œhealthy.â€ In 2000,
                the vacancy rate in Placentia was 1.9 percent; and stayed the same in November
                2008

                Age of Housing Stock
                The age of a housing unit is often an indicator of housing conditions. Housing units
                without proper maintenance can deteriorate over time. In general, housing that is 30
                years or older may exhibit need for repairs based on the useful life of materials.
                Housing over 50 years old is considered aged and is more likely to exhibit a need for
                major repairs. Additionally, older units in the Cityâ€™s housing stock may not be built to
                current building standards for fire and earthquake safety.
                Table 2-20 categorizes the Cityâ€™s housing units by the year of construction. According
                to the U.S. Census Bureau, 63 percent of Placentiaâ€™s housing units were constructed
                prior to 1980. Nine percent of the Cityâ€™s housing units were constructed prior to
                1960.

              Housing Conditions
              Households living in substandard conditions are considered to be in need of housing
              assistance, even if they are not seeking alternative housing arrangement, due to threat
              to health and safety.
              In addition to structural deficiencies and standards, the lack of infrastructure and
              utilities often serves as an indicator for substandard conditions. According to the
              2000 U.S. Census, 99 occupied units in Placentia lacked complete plumbing
              facilities. Of those, 71 were owner-occupied and 28 of the units were renter
              occupied. A total of 85 of the occupied units lacked complete kitchen facilities. Of
              those lacking complete kitchen facilities, 55 (65 percent) were owner occupied units.
              It should be noted that there might be some overlap in the number of substandard
              housing units, as some units may lack both complete plumbing and kitchen facilities.
              The Code Enforcement Department estimates there are approximately 200
              substandard housing units currently in the City. The substandard housing units are
              primarily concentrated in the La Jolla and Santa Fe areas.

                iii. Affordability Gap Analysis
                The costs of home ownership and renting can be compared to a householdâ€™s ability
                to pay for housing. Housing affordability is defined as paying no more than 30
                percent of the household income on housing expenses. Table 2-27 summarizes
                affordable rents and purchase prices by income categories based on the 2008 HUD
                median income of $84,100 for Orange County. Affordable purchase price assumes a
                6 percent interest rate with a 30-year fully amortized mortgage.

             iv. Rental Affordability
             In 2008, affordable rent payment for the very-low income group would be lower
             than the average monthly rent for a one bedroom, one bath units. The average rents
             for one to two bedroom, one bath units would be affordable for the low-income
             group. The average rent for a two bedroom, two baths and three-bedroom units
             exceed the affordable payment of both the very-low and low-income groups (see
             Table 2-25).
             v. Ownership Affordability
             The median sales price for new and resale housing units in Placentia in 2008 exceeds
             the affordability range for all income categories except above-moderate income
             households (see Table 2-25). Very low-, low-, and moderate-income households
             may have difficulty finding housing they can afford to purchase. This indicates
             greater affordability pressure for ownership housing.

Chapter 2: Housing Profile
HOUSING NEEDS
             This section provides an overview of existing housing needs in Placentia. It focuses
             on four categories:
             ï‚§    Housing need resulting from households overpaying for housing;
             ï‚§    Housing need resulting from overcrowding;
             ï‚§    Housing need resulting from population growth and demolition of the existing
                  housing stock; and,
             ï‚§    Housing needs of special needs groups such as elderly persons, large households,
                  persons with disabilities, female-headed households, persons who are homeless,
                  and farm workers.
             HOUSEHOLDS OVERPAYING FOR HOUSING
             Overpayment is defined as households paying more than 30 percent of their gross
             income on housing related expenses. This includes rent or mortgage payments and
             utilities. High housing costs can cause households to spend a disproportionate
             percentage of their income on housing. This may result in rental or mortgage
             payment problems, deferred maintenance or overcrowding.
             According to SCAG (Southern California Association of Governments), 26 percent of
             the total households in Placentia experience overpayment. Of the owner-occupied
             households, approximately 26 percent experience overpayment. Of the renter-
             occupied households, approximately 26 percent experience overpayment. Over 38
             percent of the owner-occupied households overpaying for housing earn over 95
             percent of the median income. Some owner households may choose to allocate a
             higher percentage of their disposable monthly income on housing costs because this
             allocation is justified in light of investment qualities of ownership. Of the renter
             households experiencing overpayment, 20.6 percent are extremely low income and
             34.8 percent are very-low income.

                       OVERCROWDING
                       Overcrowding is defined as households having an average of more than one person
                       per room. Overcrowding can affect public facilities and services, reduce the quality
                       of the physical environment and contribute to deterioration.
                       Table 2-29 summarizes SCAG estimates of overcrowding in Placentia. Twelve
                       percent of Placentiaâ€™s total households are overcrowded. Approximately 5 percent of
                       owner households and 29 percent of renter households are overcrowded. Of the
                       overcrowded owner-occupied households, 35 percent earn over 95 percent of the
                       median household income. In renter-occupied households, overcrowding is more
                       prevalent in the low-income categories. Twenty percent of overcrowded renter
                       households are extremely low-income. Thirty-one percent are very low income and
                       25 percent are low-income.

                2006-2014 GROWTH NEEDS
                The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is responsible for
                allocating housing needs to each jurisdiction in its region, including Placentia. A local
                jurisdictionâ€™s â€œfair shareâ€ of regional housing need is the number of additional
                housing units that will need to be constructed in the jurisdiction to accommodate the
                forecast growth in the number of households, to replace expected demolitions and
                conversion of housing units to non-housing uses, and to achieve a future vacancy rate
                that allows for healthy functioning of the housing market. The allocation is divided
                into the four income categories: Very Low-, Low-, Moderate-, and Above Moderate-
                Income. The City must also plan for the growth needs of Extremely Low-Income
                households. The Extremely Low-Income needs is assumed to be 50 percent of the
                Very Low-Income households. The allocation is further adjusted to avoid an over-
                concentration of lower-income households in any one jurisdiction.
                Table 2-30 shows the Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City of Placentia:

                SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
                Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding affordable and
                suitable housing due to special needs. This section identifies the needs for elderly
                persons, large households, female-headed households, persons with disabilities,
                persons who are homeless and farmworkers.
                Elderly Persons
                Elderly persons are considered a special needs group because they are more likely to
                have fixed incomes. Elderly persons also often have special needs related to housing
                location and construction. Because of limited mobility, elderly persons typically need
                access to services (i.e. medical and shopping) and public transit.
                According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 9.1 percent of Placentiaâ€™s residents were elderly
                (age 65 and over) (see Table 2-3). As shown in Table 2-31, 22.6 percent of

                   Placentiaâ€™s owner-occupied households had an elderly householder in 2000. Over
                   seven percent of renter-occupied households had an elderly householder.

                   householder age 65 to 74 years was $51,809. The median income for households
                   with a householder 75 years or older was $29,289. In 2006, the ACS (American
                   Community Survey) estimates that the median income for households with a
                   householder age 65+ years in Orange County was $41,850.

                   The U.S. Census Bureau provides information on the number of persons with
                   disabilities of varying types and degrees. The two categories of physical disabilities
                   that affect a personâ€™s need for special needs related to the construction and location
                   of housing are self-care disability and going-outside-the-home disability. Persons with
                   self-care disabilities report having difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside
                   the home. Persons with going- outside-the-home disabilities have difficulty going
                   outside the home alone to shop or visit a doctorâ€™s office. Elderly persons with self-
                   care limitations and go-outside-home disabilities may need housing equipped with
                   ramps, handrails, elevators, and lower cabinets and counters. The elderly may also
                   need special security devices for their homes to allow for greater self-protection.
                   Over 10 percent of the elderly population had a self-care or go-outside-the-home
                   disability in 2000. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, no elderly persons reported as
                   having self-care disability only. However, over 6 percent of elderly persons reported
                   self-care and at least one other disability.

                  Large Households
                  Large households are defined as having five or more persons living within the same
                  housing unit. Large households are considered a special needs group because they
                  require more space and larger bedroom counts. In 2000, there were 2,322
                  households in Placentia with at least five persons, representing 15.3 percent of the
                  total households in the City. Of the large households, 38 percent were renter-
                  occupied and 62 percent were owner-occupied.

                  Female-Headed Households
                  Female-headed households are a special needs group due to comparatively low rates
                  of homeownership, lower incomes and high poverty rates experienced by this group.
                  According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 712 female-headed households with
                  children and 900 female-headed households without children in Placentia. Of the
                  total female-headed households in the City, 51 percent were renter-occupied and 49
                  percent were owner-occupied.

                 Persons with Disabilities
                 Access and affordability are the two major housing needs for persons with disabilities.
                 This often requires specially designed dwelling units typically not found in market rate
                 housing. Additionally, locating near public facilities and public transit is important for
                 this special needs group.
                 Table 2-38 shows the number of Placentia residents in 2000 with physical, self-care
                 and go-outside-the-home disabilities over the age of 16. According to the U.S.
                 Census, 0.7 percent of residents age 16 to 20 and 3.1 percent of residents age 21 to
                 64 had one of these disabilities. Nearly 19 percent of residents age 65 and up also
                 had one of these disabilities.

                 Homeless Population and Transitional Housing
                 Enumeration of the homeless population is difficult because of its transient nature and
                 the existence of the â€œhidden homelessâ€ or persons that move around in temporary
                 housing situations. The most recent data regarding the homeless population in
                 Orange County is from the 2007 Point-in-Time Survey conducted by the HCSD and
                 OC Partnership; and the 2007 Homeless Needs Assessment. The 2007 Point-in-Time
                 Count estimates 27,732 incidents of homelessness in the County over a 12-month
                 period. The 2007 Homeless Needs Assessment reports 35,065 homeless episodes in
                 Orange County; of these, 24,545 are homeless episodes of persons in families with
                 children and 10,420 are homeless episodes of unaccompanied individuals. An
                 episode is a single continuous period of homelessness. An episode could range from a
                 single day to many months.

Chapter 2: Housing Profile
             To estimate the existing homeless population in Placentia, the City made direct
             contact with non-profit entities providing homeless assistant in and adjacent to the
             City. Additionally, the City of Placentia Police Department was asked to estimate
             existing homeless populations based upon observations in the field. The City of
             Placentia estimates there are 130 homeless individuals in Placentia on a day-to-day
             basis.
             According to the Housing and Community Services Department of Orange County,
             there are 68 emergency and transitional shelters countywide that provide 3,300 beds.
             There is one emergency shelter located in Placentia, Homeless Intervention Shelter
             (H.I.S.). The shelter provides transitional living facilities for families and single
             individuals; and serves about 140 persons on average every year. Two local churches
             also provide food and other emergency services. Placentia Presbyterian Church
             operates a weekly soup kitchen that serves meals to about 60 persons every
             Thursday. St. Joseph Catholic Church also distributes food, and offers other services
             such as transportation assistance and job referrals.
             The Human Services Division of the City of Placentiaâ€™s Community Services
             Department oversees the operation of the Human Services Office and Senior Center
             that provide food programs and emergency resources to the community. The Human
             Services Office provides residents with assistance in a wide range of issues including
             employment, financial assistance, domestic abuse, healthcare, insurance issues,
             homeless services, landlord and tenant disputes, public assistance forms, senior
             citizen services, translation assistance and youth services. Human Services distributes
             USDA surplus commodities received from Second Harvest Food Bank to over 300
             households each month along with providing emergency food to residents and
             weekly bread distributions. Additionally, the Senior Center offers two food programs
             for adults 60 years or older, including a daily nutritional lunch program that serves
             400 meals per month and a Brown Bag program that provides basic grocery items to
             over 130 adults per month.
             Farm Workers
             Farm workers are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
             seasonal agricultural work. In 2000, 135 persons, less than 1 percent of Placentiaâ€™s
             labor force, were employed in agriculture (or related industries). It is assumed that
             only a small percentage of persons employed in this industry are involved in active
             agricultural production and harvest. Therefore, there is no apparent or recognized
             need for farmworker housing.

CHAPTER 3: RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
ANALYSIS
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS AND RESOURCES
              Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements and actions imposed
              by various levels of government upon land and housing development. These
              constraints may include building codes, land use controls, growth management
              measures, development fees, processing and permit procedures, and site
              improvement costs. State and federal agencies play a role in the imposition of
              governmental constraints; however, these agencies are beyond the influence of local
              government and are therefore not addressed in this analysis.
              LAND USE CONTROLS
              Land use controls include General Plan policies, zoning designations (and the
              resulting use restrictions, development standards and permit processing requirements)
              and development fees.
              General Plan
              Every city in California must have a General Plan, which establishes policy guidelines
              for all development within the city. The General Plan is the foundation of all land use
              controls in a jurisdiction. The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the
              location, distribution and density of the land uses within the City. General Plan
              residential densities are expressed in dwelling units per acre. The Placentia General
              Plan identifies three residential land use designations, a Planned Community
              designation and a Specific Plan designation. Table 3-1 summarizes the residential
              land use designations and their associated acreages and density ranges.

                    According to the 1988 General Plan, the maximum potential capacity is 22,645
                    dwelling units in the City and the realistic capacity is 18,117 dwelling units. The
                    Department of Finance (DOF) reports 16,436 dwelling units have been developed as
                    of January 2007.
                    Depending on land costs, certain densities are needed to make a housing project
                    economically feasible. The following densities required to accommodate construction
                    affordable to specific income levels are generally accepted:
                    ï‚§     Very Low- and Low-Income: 30 dwelling units per acre minimum
                    ï‚§     Moderate-Income: 11-30 dwelling units per acre minimum
                    ï‚§     Above Moderate-Income: Up to 11 dwelling units per acre
                    Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to protect and
promote public health, safety and welfare. Placentiaâ€™s residential zoning designations control both
the use and development standards of specific sites and influence the development of housing.
Table 3-2 summarizes the single-family residential zoning designations and their requirements. Table
3-3 summarizes the multi-family residential designations and requirements. Based on residential units

standards do not unreasonably impact the cost and supply of housing nor the ability of projects to

                Table 3-5 summarizes the residential parking requirements in Placentia. Parking
                requirements do not constrain the development of housing directly. However,
                parking requirements may reduce the amount of available land for residential
                development.

               DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCE
               In order to encourage the construction of affordable housing developments for very
               low and low-income households, the City of Placentia has adopted a Density Bonus
               Ordinance (Chapter 23.23 of the Municipal Code). Upon request from the
               applicant, the City grants a density bonus of at least twenty-five percent (25%) and
               possibly additional incentives based on the applicantâ€™s commitment to construct
               preset percentages of senior housing units or low and very-low income housing units.
               General Density Bonus for Affordable Units
               The City grants a density bonus for developments providing units affordable to and
               occupied by lower income persons and households. The project must have a
               minimum of five units and an affordability covenant is required for at least 30 years.
               The developer is entitled to only one density bonus even if more than one qualifying
               criterion is met.
               General requirements for density bonus are outlined in Table 3-6.
                                                                 Table 3-6

               All set-aside units are required to have a bedroom mix and amenities representative
               of the entire project and should be reasonably distributed through the project. When
               applicable, the developer are encouraged participate in the County of Orange
               mortgage revenue bond program, County of Orange multifamily revenue bond
               program, or other locally-approved programs.
               Rental Units
               To qualify for rental density bonus, projects shall be either occupied by, or vacant
               and available for specific income tenants, as outlined in Table 3-6.
               In addition, the following priority is required in selecting tenants. First priority should
               be given to very low-income Placentia resident/worker households without Section 8
               certificates. Second priority should be given to very low-income households without

                Ownership Units
                Ownership units receiving a density bonus are required to be sold to and occupied
                by, or vacant and available for exclusive sale, to households within specific income
                groups as described in Table 3-6.
                The City of Placentia has defined maximum sale prices, mortgage payments, and
                down-payment amounts for ownership units within density bonus. Ownership units
                targeted for very low income households or lower income households shall be sold at
                a cost that does not to exceed affordable housing cost as defined by Section 50052.5
                of the California Health and Safety Code. The total mortgage payments for
                ownership units targeted for senior citizen households including principal, interest,
                taxes, insurance and homeowner association dues, (if applicable) can not exceed 30
                percent of the purchaserâ€™s gross monthly income. The total down-payment amount
                for affordable ownership units, excluding closing costs, shall not exceed 10 percent
                of the purchase price.
                Additional Incentives
                In addition to the density bonus, the City of Placentia has established additional
                incentives. The City provides at least one of the following incentives:
                ï‚§      A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code
                       requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum
                       building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission,

                 requirements, or the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be
                 required;
             ï‚§   Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if
                 commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the
                 housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses
                 are compatible with the housing development and the existing or planned
                 development in the area where the proposed housing development will be
                 located; or
             ï‚§   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City
                 that result in identifiable cost reductions, including but not limited to, additional
                 density bonus, public financing and expedited processing.
             The Director of Development Services may award additional incentives, if they are
             deemed necessary to make a project economically feasible. The requested additional
             incentives cannot negatively affect public health, safety and welfare, nor can they
             result in an overall development pattern that is incompatible with other structures in
             the immediate vicinity. The City may, at its sole discretion, consider the provision of
             one of the additional incentives in exchange for increasing the length of affordability
             requirements from 10 years to 30 years.
             PLACENTIA-WESTGATE SPECIFIC PLAN
             Currently, the City is drafting the Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan. The Specific Plan
             area is a 110-acre historic core district situated on the original town site of Placita
             Santa Fe. The area is bounded by Chapman Avenue to the north; Orangethorpe
             Avenue to the south; and the 57 Freeway to the west. The plan envisions a walkable
             network of varied blocks, plazas, parks and streetscapes; and a reestablishment of the
             communityâ€™s relationship with the rail corridor.
             The following zones are established in the Placentia- Westgate Specific Plan, and are
             applied to property within the Specific Plan Area:
                 ï‚· Mainstreet (MS)
                 ï‚· Town Center 1 (TC-1)

                 ï‚· Neighborhood General (NG)

             SENIOR HOUSING
             Placentiaâ€™s Zoning Code allows group dwellings including nursing homes,
             intermediate care facilities and assisted care facilities in the C-2 designation with a
             conditional use permit, senior housing and facilities in Specific Plan 3 area as a
             permitted use, and independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, and skilled
             nursing facilities in Specific Plan 9 area as a permitted use.
             Specific Plan 3 area developments are subject to the requirements found in Chapter
             23.103 (Specific Plan 3) of Placentia Municipal Code. Specific Plan 3 area contains
             requirements for board and care facilities for persons 62 years of age or older, with
             private bathrooms, central kitchen facilities and services which include transportation,
             activities programs, housekeeping, linen and laundry service and full-time staff
             supervision; and apartment projects for persons 55 years of age or older, which
             contain a private entry and individual kitchen, but are no larger than two bedrooms,
             where two bedroom units do not exceed 50 percent of the total number of units.
             Specific Plan 9 area developments are subject to the requirements found in Chapter
             23.109 (Specific Plan 9) of Placentia Municipal Code. A deed restriction for this area
             requires that for the life of the structures at least one resident of each independent
             living unit shall meet the minimum age requirement of 55 years.
             The City currently does not have a senior housing zoning designation. The Zoning
             Code currently permits housing types that provide opportunities for senior housing
             within various zones.
             The City has reviewed Section 65008 of the Government Code and found that the
             Cityâ€™s Zoning Code does not conflict with State law.
             EMERGENCY SHELTERS, TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
             State Housing Law requires that cities identify sites that are adequately zoned for
             homeless shelters, transitional housing and supportive housing. The Cityâ€™s Municipal
             Code does not make reference to emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive
             housing or housing for the homeless. H.I.S. House currently operates a transitional
             living facility in the City. The facility, which consists of a single-family residence, is
             owned by the Placentia Redevelopment Agency and is leased to H.I.S. House for an
             amount equal to the annual property tax.
             Pursuant to recent changes in State law (SB 2), jurisdictions with an unmet need for
             emergency shelters are now required to identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters
             will be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other
             discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
             accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one
             year-round shelter. Permit processing, development and management standards for

              emergency shelters must be objective and facilitate the development of, or
              conversion to, emergency shelters.
              To meet statutory requirements of SB 2, Placentia has conducted a staff level review
              of existing zoning districts and determined the High Density Multiple-Family district
              (R-3), the Commercial Manufacturing District (C-M), and the Manufacturing District
              (M) are conducive to provision of an emergency shelter by-right. The City has
              included a program within this Housing Element update to modify the Zoning
              Ordinance to permit emergency shelters in these three zones subject to the same
              development standards as other permitted uses in the zones. The program also
              considers transitional and supportive housing as residential uses, subject to those
              restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
              Table 3-9 summarizes the development standards in the R-3, C-M, and M zones.

               The High Density Multiple-Family (R-3) district permits apartments, duplexes, multi-
               family units, and group dwellings. Multiple family residences are located adjacent to a
               variety of community services. The Commercial Manufacturing (C-M) district permits
               retail businesses, light manufacturing, and offices. Commercial uses are primarily
               adjacent to major streets and transportation corridors. The Manufacturing (M) district
               permits manufacturing activities that do not cause obnoxious or offensive effects that
               may be detrimental to public health and safety.
               In addition to application of R-3, C-M and M development standards, pursuant to SB
               2, the City can also specify written, objective standards to regulate the following
               aspects of emergency shelters to enhance compatibility:
                     ï‚· The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by
                           the facility;
                     ï‚· Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking
                           requirements for other residential or commercial uses in the same zone;
                     ï‚· The size and location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake
                           areas;
                     ï‚· The provision of onsite management;
                     ï‚· The proximity of other emergency shelters;
                     ï‚· The length of stay;
                     ï‚· Lighting; and
                     ï‚· Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
               SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANY (SRO) UNITS
               Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one-room units occupied by a
               single individual, and may either have a shared or private kitchen and bathroom

             facilities. SROs are rented on a monthly basis typically without a rental deposit, and
             can provide an entry point into the housing market for Extremely Low-Income
             individuals, formerly homeless, and disabled persons.
             Single Room Occupancy units are not defined or included in the Cityâ€™s Municipal
             Code. As a result, this Housing Element update will include a program to review and
             revise existing zoning district provision in the Municipal Code to explicitly define and
             establish regulatory standards for single-room occupancy units SROs.
             SECOND DWELLING UNITS
             Second dwelling units provide additional opportunities to provide housing for people
             of all ages and economic levels, while preserving the integrity and character of single-
             family residential neighborhoods. Placentia permits second units in the R-A, R-1 and
             PUD-1 districts, and in the SP-7 or RPC districts with an underlying land use
             designation of low-density residential, provided certain requirements are met.
             Requirements for a second unit should comply with all of the development standards
             for a new single-family detached dwelling unit in the R-A or R-1 zone, including but
             not limited to, setbacks, height, lot coverage (refer to Table 3-2: Summary of Single
             Family Residential Zoning Requirements) and those listed in Section 23.75.020
             (Development Plan Review) of the Municipal Code. The following standards also
             apply:
             ï‚§    The total floor area of an attached second unit cannot exceed 30 percent of the
                  total living area of the primary dwelling unit.
             ï‚§    The total floor area of a detached second unit cannot exceed 1,200 square feet.
             ï‚§    The architecture of the new unit has to be compatible with the existing unit and
                  neighborhood.
             ï‚§    One off-street parking space must be provided in addition to that required for
                  the primary unit. This space does not need to be located within the required
                  front yard setback and may be open.
             ï‚§    Only one exterior entrance on any one side of the building is allowed.
             ï‚§    No exterior stairways on the front of the house are allowed.
             ï‚§    Only one second unit is allowed on any lot.
             ï‚§    The primary unit must continue to comply with the minimum standards
                  applicable to a single-family detached dwelling unit in an R-A or R-1 zone even
                  with the creation of a second unit, including but not limited to maximum lot
                  coverage and minimum floor area.
             HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
             The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-lasting
             physical, mental or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a
             person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or

             remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go
             outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.
             The City of Placentia allows, by-right, residential care facilities for 6 or fewer persons
             in any single-family residence in an R-A, R-1 or R-2 zone. Residential care facilities
             provide twenty-four hour supervised non-medical care. Group dwellings including
             nursing homes, rest homes, and other special needs facilities are permitted in
             residential and commercial districts subject to a use permit.
             The Cityâ€™s Municipal Code defines â€œfamilyâ€ as â€œan individual or two or more persons
             related by blood, marriage or adoption, or a group of not more than six persons,
             excluding servants, who are not related by blood, marriage or adoption, living
             together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit.â€
             To further accommodate housing for persons with disabilities, there are no maximum
             concentration requirements for residential care facilities. And the City considers
             parking requirements for residential care facilities on a case-by-case basis.
             Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
             As a matter of State law (SB 520), cities are now required to analyze potential and
             actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing
             for persons with disabilities, and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental
             constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for persons
             with disabilities. Cities are required to include programs that remove constraints and
             provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with
             disabilities. The City of Placentia does not currently have a formal process for
             requesting reasonable accommodations. As a result, this Housing Element will
             include a program to establish a written and administrative reasonable
             accommodation procedure in the Municipal Code for providing exception for
             housing for persons with disabilities.
             BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
             Building and safety codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and
             ensure the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards also
             have the potential to increase the cost of housing construction or maintenance.
             Building Codes
             The City of Placentia has adopted the 2007 California Building Code, based on the
             2006 International Building Code, which establishes construction standards for all
             residential buildings. The City amends the code as needed to further define
             requirements based on the unique local conditions. The code is designed to protect

             the public health, safety and welfare of Placentiaâ€™s residents. Code enforcement in
             the City is performed on a complaint basis.
             The following are local amendments to the 2007 California Building Code:
                 ï‚· Section 903.2.7 Group R- An automatic sprinkler system installed in
                     accordance with Section 903.3 shall be provided throughout all buildings
                     with a Group R fire area as follows:
                          o All new Group R occupancies, including attached garages.
                          o All existing Group R occupancies and U-1 garages when the total floor
                              is increased by 50% of the existing area over a 2-year period.
                          o All existing Group R occupancies and U-1 garages when the total area
                              is increased by 750 SF or more over a 2-year period.
                          o All existing Group R occupancies and U-1 garages when an additional
                              story is added to the structure regardless of the area involved.
                          o An automatic sprinkler system shall be installed throughout any
                              existing building when the floor area of the alteration within any 2-
                              year period exceeds 50% of the area of the existing structure. When
                              the cost of installing an approved automatic sprinkler system exceeds
                              5% of the cost of the alteration, with the approval of the fire code
                              official, the required automatic sprinkler system may be omitted.
                          o Exceptions:
                                   ï‚§ Occupancies housing ambulatory children only, none of
                                        whom are mentally ill or mentally retarded
                                   ï‚§ Occupancies licensed for protective social care which house
                                        ambulatory clients only, none of whom is a child (under the
                                        age of 18 years) or is elderly (65 years of age or over)
             The City has found that the amendments to the 2007 California building code do not
             unduly influence the cost, availability and conservation of housing.
             Code Enforcement
             Contained within the City Planning Division function, the Cityâ€™s Code Enforcement
             key objective is maintaining and preserving value and appearance in residential,
             commercial and industrial properties throughout the City. The Cityâ€™s Code
             Enforcement representatives enforce the following items:
                 ï‚· Substandard housing;
                 ï‚· Garage conversions;
                 ï‚· Property maintenance;
                 ï‚· Recreation vehicle parking on private property;
                 ï‚· Trash container placement, time and location;
                 ï‚· Illegal business activity;
                 ï‚· Inoperable vehicles on private property; and
                 ï‚· Garage sales and signage.

Resources and Constraints
             Code enforcement efforts are focused on property maintenance practices and
             standards so as to avoid conditions, which can be detrimental to the public health,
             safety, or general welfare.
             Fair Housing and Americans with Disabilities Act
             The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
             (ADA) are federal laws intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing.
             Building requirements and provisions including the minimum percentage of units
             accessible to persons with physical disabilities in new developments are incorporated
             into Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Compliance with these regulations
             may increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of rehabilitating
             older units, which may be required to comply with current codes. However, the
             enforcement of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is
             mandated under federal law.
             DEVELOPMENT FEES
             Various development and permit fees are charged by the City and other agencies to
             cover administrative processing costs associated with development. These fees
             ensure quality development and the provision of adequate services. Often times,
             development fees are passed through to renters and homeowners in the price/rent of
             housing, thus affecting the affordability of housing.
             The City of Placentia charges the majority of environmental, planning and
             engineering fees on a fixed fee basis. The Building Industry Association of Orange
             County provides a yearly land development fee survey for Orange County
             jurisdictions. Table 3-10 shows the results of the survey and provides a comparative
             summary for Placentia and surrounding jurisdictions. The fee survey utilizes a
             hypothetical subdivision and house size to standardize the reporting of fees. The
             prototype subdivision used in 2006-2007 was 50 units on a 10-acre size at a density
             of 5 dwelling units per acre. The building fees are based on a 2,500 square foot,
             single-family detached unit with a 400 square foot garage. The hypothetical building
             is valued at $177,970 and contains 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. Table 3-11
             summarizes the total typical development fees for single-family and multi-family
             developments, based on two projects recently constructed in the City. The City has
             recently implemented a new fee structure that is based on the cost of staff time to
             review and process project applications. The previous fee structure was based on
             building valuation. The revised fee structure ensures that adequate fees are charged
             to ensure complete review without undue burden on the project applicant.

                LOCAL PROCESSING AND PERMIT PROCEDURES
                Considerable holding costs can be associated with delays in processing development
                applications and plans. Three levels of decision-making bodies govern the review
                process in Placentia: the Zoning Administrator, the Planning Commission and the City
                Council.
                The time required to process a project varies depending on the given projectâ€™s size
                and complexity and the number of actions and/or approvals required to complete the
                process. Both single-family residential and multi-family residential developments take
                between 6-12 months for total entitlement and permit processing. Table 3-12
                provides a summary of the most common steps in the entitlement process. Not every
                project is required to follow all the steps outlined in the table. In addition, some of
                the approval procedures can run concurrently.
                To address any constraints posed by processing timelines on residential development,
                this Housing Element update will include a program to review and revise processing
                timelines to mitigate and/or remove any identified constraints.

               ENVIRONMENTAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
               Environmental Constraints
               Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic
               conditions, which provide the greatest threat to the built environment. The following
               hazards may impact future development of residential units in the city.
               i.    Seismic Hazards
               Similar to most southern California cities, Placentia is located within an area
               considered to be seismically active. No faults have been identified within the City
               limits. There are six faults within close proximity to Placentia: Whittier-Elsinore,
               Norwalk, Newport-Inglewood, Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes and San Gabriel. The
               Whittier-Elsinore fault is located approximately 1,000 feet to the north of Placentia
               and is able to produce a seismic event of magnitude 6.0 or greater. The impact of
               earthquakes on Placentia depends on several factors: the particular fault, fault

Resources and Constraints
             location, distance from the City, and magnitude of the earthquake. Some areas of the
             City may experience liquefaction and ground failure during extreme shaking. As part
             of the Cityâ€™s development review process, future residential projects would be
             required to prepare geotechnical studies to abate and potential hazards.
             ii. Flooding
             Portions of the City are located within 100-year flood zones. Inundation is projected
             to be most significant in the southwest portion of Placentia. Flooding within Placentia
             as a result of a 100-year flood would be expected to reach an average depth of only
             one foot and only at specific locations.
             Prado Dam is a flood control and water conservation project constructed and
             operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District. The dam is
             located approximately 11 miles east of Placentia, on the Santa Ana River, west of the
             City of Corona. In the event of dam failure, the flood wave would reach Placentia in
             approximately 40 to 45 minutes with possible surge wave depths ranging from nine to
             twenty-three feet.
             Carbon Canyon Dam provides flood control in and around the drainage basin. The
             dam is located approximately one mile north of Placentia. In the event of the damâ€™s
             failure at maximum capacity, water would reach the northerly City limits in
             approximately two minutes with depths ranging from 10 to 30 feet. In the event of a
             dam failure at either the Prado or Carbon Canyon Dams, the Cityâ€™s emergency
             evacuation plan would be implemented and emergency service personnel would
             respond to any hazards.
             iii. Toxic and Hazardous Wastes
             Although definitions of hazardous materials vary, Federal, State and County agencies
             have generally recognized toxic substances as chemicals or mixtures whose
             manufacture, process, distribution, use or disposal may present an unreasonable risk
             to human health or the environment. The OCFAâ€™s Hazardous Materials Area Plan
             provides a detailed hazard analysis of chemical hazards within Orange County.
             iv. Transportation of Hazardous Materials
             Transportation routes through and around the City are used to transport hazardous
             materials from suppliers to users. Major transportation routes within Placentia
             include surface streets and railroads. Additionally, the 57 and 91 freeways are
             located adjacent to the city. Transportation accidents involving hazardous materials
             could occur on any of the routes, potentially resulting in explosions, physical contact
             by emergency response personnel, environmental degradation and exposure to the
             public via airborne exposure.

Resources and Constraints
             The Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) is the primary regulatory authority
             for the interstate transport of hazardous materials. The DOT establishes regulations
             for safe handling procedures (i.e., packaging, marking, labeling and routing). The
             California Highway Patrol (CHP) enforces the intrastate transport of hazardous
             materials and hazardous waste.
             v. Hazardous Waste Management
             The Orange County Hazardous Waste Management Plan provides policy direction and
             action programs to address current and future hazardous waste management issues
             that require local responsibility and involvement in Orange County. The Plan
             discusses hazardous waste issues and analyzes current and future hazardous waste
             generation in the County. The Integrated Waste Management Department (IWMD)
             of Orange County owns and operates three active landfills, four household hazardous
             waste collection centers (HHWCC) and monitors ten closed landfills.
             The California Health and Safety Code (H&SC) establishes regulations requiring
             businesses within the city to complete a chemical inventory to disclose hazardous
             materials stored, used, or handled on site. The disclosure information is intended to
             assist emergency responders in planning for and handling emergencies involving
             hazardous materials. The main program objective is to safeguard the lives of
             emergency responders, the public, and to minimize property loss. The H&SC also
             requires a Business Emergency Plan (BEP) to assist in mitigating a release or
             threatened release of a hazardous material, and to minimize any potential harm or
             damage to human health or the environment. Disclosure of hazardous materials is
             updated annually. The Fire Prevention Department of the OCFA is responsible for
             the distribution and handling of disclosure forms. Additionally, the OCFA maintains
             the files of all chemical inventory information and business plans, which are made
             available for public inspection.
             vi. Fire Hazards
             The City of Placentia is highly urbanized with no wildlands adjacent to areas zoned
             for residential use. There is minimal potential for fire related to brush or other natural
             materials. Fire hazards within the City may be associated with industrial uses,
             hazardous materials, and arson. The County of Orange Fire Authority provides fire
             protection services to Placentia. There are two fire stations located within the City
             limits.
             vii. Noise
             Residential land uses are generally considered to be the most sensitive to loud noises.
             The principal noise sources in Placentia are the transportation systems. Roadways are
             the primary source of transportation-generated noise. The Burlington North Santa Fe
             Railroad also runs through the city along the Orangethorpe Corridor. The Placentia

Resources and Constraints
             Quiet Zone went into effect in August of 2007. Along the quiet zone, all trains are
             prohibited from using horns unless an engineer feels an emergency exists that
             threatens human or animal injury or property damage.
             Infrastructure Constraints
             i.    Sewer
             The City of Placentia operates and maintains approximately 76 miles of gravity sewer
             pipelines. In addition, the Yorba Linda Water District services approximately 12 to 15
             percent of the City. A capacity study of the Cityâ€™s sewer system was conducted in
             2000 as part of the Sewer System Master Plan (SSMP). Deficiencies found in that
             study, as well as those found in an inspection of the Old Town area released in 2003
             have been prioritized and were the basis for the initial capital improvement program
             list. The City Council adopted a sewer service fee in March of 2005 to provide a
             dedicated source of funding.
             The City maintains and operates the local sanitary sewer collection system, which
             includes gravity sewers and lift stations. The Orange County Sanitation District
             (OCSD) collects, treats, and disposes of the wastewater from central and
             northwestern Orange County, including Placentia. Wastewater generated by the City
             is transported through trunk lines to OCSDâ€™s Plant No. 1 (located at 10844 Ellis
             Avenue, Fountain Valley) and Plant No. 2 (located at 22212 Brookhurst Street,
             Huntington Beach) where it receives primary and secondary treatment. Plant No. 1â€™s
             average daily flow is 90 million gallons per day (MGD) and its capacity is 174 MGD.
             Similarly, Plant No. 2â€™s average daily flow is 153 MGD and its capacity is 276 MGD.
             Thus, excess capacity exists at both plants. It is noted up to 10.0 MGD of effluent
             from Plant 1 is delivered to Orange County Water District (OCWD) for advance
             treatment, and ultimately used for groundwater recharge and landscape irrigation.
             The Cityâ€™s future housing needs would generate increased wastewater flows, placing
             greater demands on wastewater treatment and collection. The City requires
             individual assessments of potential impacts to wastewater facilities to ensure future
             development does not impact the ability to serve future needs Based upon the
             analysis of future development need, current infrastructure capacity exists. .
             ii. Water
             The City of Placentia is served by the Yorba Linda Water District and the Golden
             State Water Company. The Yorba Linda Water District has approximately 3.400
             service connections in Placentia. The remainder of the city is served by Golden State.
             According to the Golden State Water Companyâ€™s Urban Water Management Plan,
             there are no factors affecting the wholesale supply of the Placentia system, therefore,
             there is 100 percent reliability of imported water supply. The Yorba Linda Water

         Resources and Constraints
                           Districtâ€™s Urban Water Management Plan indicates that the reliability of the Orange
                           County Basin is less than 100 percent, which is reflective of low groundwater levels
                           due to drought, saltwater intrusion, and increased accumulated overdraft of the
                           Basin. To counteract the intermittent supply from the Basin during multiple dry water
                           years, wholesale supply reliability is over 100 percent.
                           The water demand associated with future housing could impact groundwater
                           supplies. The Urban Water Management Plans (UWMPs) for both the Golden State
                           Water Company and the Yorba Linda Water District concluded that the City water
                           supplies would be 100 percent reliable in meeting future water demands. The
                           proposed Housing Element was considered in both UWMPs, since additional
                           residential development was assumed. As such, potential increases in water demand
                           associated with future housing were anticipated in the UWMPs. All future residential
                           development would be subject to compliance with the UWMPsâ€™ Conservation
                           Programs, which would ensure that future development would incorporate water
                           conservation measures. Therefore, Housing Element program implementation would
                           not substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with
                           groundwater recharge.

                           The City of Placentia Redevelopment Agency provides the funding source for many
                           housing-related activities in the City. Table 3-13 shows the housing set-aside fund

Resources and Constraints
             Inclusionary Housing Requirements
             The City of Placentia, in accordance with California Community Redevelopment Law,
             requires the production of affordable housing based on activities in the
             redevelopment areas. These requirements are as follows:
             ï‚§    At least 30 percent of all new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units
                  developed by the Agency shall be available at affordable cost to low and
                  moderate-income households. Of these low-mod units, 50 percent must be
                  affordable to very-low-income households.
             ï‚§    At least 15 percent of all new dwelling units within a project area developed by
                  an entity other than the Agency must be affordable to low and moderate income
                  households. Of these low-mod units, 40 percent must be affordable to very-low-
                  income households.
             More recent legislation effective on January 1, 2002, requires the Agency to expand
             its low and moderate income housing funds over the duration of the Implementation
             Plan to assist housing in at least the same proportion as:
             ï‚§    the total number of housing units needed for persons of moderate, low, and very
                  low income within the community as those needs have been determined for the
                  community in the Housing Element of the General Plan, and
             ï‚§    is available to families with children in at least the same proportion as the
                  population under age 65 bears to the total population of the community as
                  reported in the most recent census of the US Census Bureau.
             COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT AND HOME PROGRAMS
             Placentia participates in a consortium with the County of Orange and other 12 other
             cities known as the Orange County Urban County Program. The Urban County
             receives Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME funding on a
             formula basis from the Federal government. Funds are distributed by the County of
             Orange to individual jurisdictions on a competitive basis. In the preparation of the
             2005-2010 Consolidated Plan for the County of Orange, Placentia indicated its
             intention to pursue CDBG and HOME funds for housing activities including housing
             rehabilitation. During the 2006-2007 Fiscal Year, $129,375 in CDBG funds were
             allocated to Placentia for the Housing Rehabilitation Grant Program. Though the City
             does not currently receive HOME funds, the City will continue to pursue them in the
             future.
             CDBG funds can be used for the following activities:
             ï‚§    Acquisition
             ï‚§    Rehabilitation

               On- and off-site improvements may be required in conjunction with development
               based on the location of the project and existing infrastructure. Dedication and
               construction of streets, alleys and other public easements and improvements may be
               required to maintain public safety and convenience.
               The Cityâ€™s standards and requirements for streets, sidewalks, and other site

               VACANT AND UNDERUTILIZED LAND
               A through analysis of vacant and underutilized land within the City of Placentia is
               provided in Appendix B.
               LAND PRICES
               Land costs influence the cost of housing. Prices are determined by a number of
               factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted development

               density. As land becomes less available, the price of land increases. The price of
               land also increases as the number of units permitted on each lot increases. In Orange
               County, undeveloped land is limited and combined with a rapidly growing
               population land prices have increased. Prices for vacant residential land in Placentia
               are estimated to be $35 to $50 per square foot.
               CONSTRUCTION COSTS
               Construction costs are primarily determined by the costs of materials and labor. They
               are also influenced by market demands and market-based changes in the cost of
               materials. Construction costs depend on the type of unit being built and the quality of
               the product being produced. Table 3-15 summarizes the estimated construction costs
               based on type of development in Placentia.

               FINANCING
               Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher
               interest rates increase a homebuyerâ€™s monthly payment and decrease the range of
               housing that a household can afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and
               lower monthly payments for the homebuyer.
               When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing
               prices. Similarly, when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is
               often a lag in the market, causing housing prices to remain high when interest rates
               rise until the market catches up. Lower-income households often find it most difficult
               to purchase a home during this time period.
               As shown in Table 3-16, the number of loan applications increases as income
               increases. The percentage of persons denied for a home loan in Orange County is
               highest for the very low-income (less than 50 percent of the MFI) category with 41.7
               percent.

             offer interest rate write-downs. Additionally, government insured loan programs may

             There have been recent changes in the qualifications and lending standards for home
             loans. Nationwide there has been a large increase in the number of delinquencies
             and foreclosures in the residential market. As a result, lenders have more stringent
             qualifications for home loans and lower-income households may find it more difficult
             to qualify.
             ENERGY CONSERVATION
             In order to reduce the consumption of water in a landscaped area the City of
             Placentia has adopted a Xeriscape ordinance within the Zoning Code. Primary
             techniques to reduce water consumption are the use of water conserving plants,
             minimizing the amount of grass area, grouping plants in accordance to their watering
             needs, and providing an irrigation system designed to meet the needs of the plants in
             the landscape. All new developments are required to submit plans that comply with
             the ordinance.
             In 1982, the City adopted an ordinance that encourages the development of energy
             efficient residential dwellings in order to reduce the reliance of the Cityâ€™s residents in
             commercial energy sources.
             Southern California Edison, which provides electricity service in Placentia, also offers
             public information and technical assistance to developers and homeowners regarding
             energy conservation. Southern California Edison also provides incentives for energy
             efficient new construction and home improvements. Through the California Energy
             Star New Homes program, builders can receive up to $700 per single family unit or
             $275 per multi-family unit for constructing homes that are 15-20 percent more
             energy efficient than the Title 24 requirements. Builders also have the option of
             installing efficient appliances, insulation and/or tight ducts to receive similar monetary
             incentives. Owners of existing homes can receive monetary incentives for purchasing
             Energy-star qualified appliances or making other energy-saving improvements such as
             installing a whole-house fan in the attic.
             One of the more recent strategies in building energy-efficient homes is following the
             U.S. Green Building Councilâ€™s guidelines for LEED Certification. LEED-certified
             buildings demonstrate energy and water savings, reduced maintenance costs and
             improved occupant satisfaction. The LEED for New Construction program has been
             applied to numerous multi-family residential projects nationwide. The LEED for
             Homes pilot program was launched in 2005 and includes standards for new single-
             family and multi-family home construction.

Policy Program
CHAPTER 4: HOUSING POLICY PROGRAM
This section describes Placentiaâ€™s housing policy program for the 2006-2014 Planning Period. The
Housing Policy Program identifies the specific policy actions related to the preservation,
improvement and development of housing in the City. These policy actions address current and
future housing needs, meet the requirements specified by State law and consider the input by
residents and stakeholders. While the plan provides a comprehensive approach to address housing
issues throughout the City, the emphasis of the 2006-2014 Policy Program is on actions enabling the
City to increase and maintain housing opportunities affordable to extremely low, very low, low and
moderate-income households.
Housing Goals and Programs
Placentiaâ€™s housing goals focus on four policy priority areas. Goals are provided to address each of
these areas and programs are developed to support and implement each goal. The four priorities are:
    1. Developing and maintaining Housing Supply and Variety
    2. Promoting Equal Housing Opportunity
    3. Promoting Housing and Neighborhood Preservation and Conservation
    4. Encouraging Housing Cooperation and Coordination
Goal HE-1: Housing Supply and Variety
Develop and maintain an adequate supply of housing that varies sufficiently in cost, size, type,
and tenure to meet the economic and social needs of existing and future residents within the
constraints of available land.
        Program HE-1.1: Manufactured Housing
        The City of Placentia recognizes the importance of manufactured housing as a means to
        provide affordable housing for the Cityâ€™s residents. The City shall explore land use policies,
        regulations, and programs to facilitate and encourage manufactured housing. These policies,
        regulations and programs may include, but are not limited to, flexible development
        standards, technical assistance and referrals to the County of Orange Mobile Home Exterior
        Grant Program.
        Objective:                               Use of manufactured housing

        Program HE-1.2: Locate Housing Near Transportation, Employment and Services
        To increase livability within new housing developments, the City shall encourage and
        coordinate the location of major housing developments, particularly affordable housing and
        multi-family units near transportation options, major employment centers and services. The
        City is currently drafting a specific plan for a transit-oriented development in Placentia-
        Westgate area surrounding the future Metrolink station. The specific plan will provide for
        residential uses in proximity to the station as well as entertainment, retail and office spaces.
        The development regulations for the specific plan area will encourage and facilitate multi-
        family residential development and live-work units. The City will also encourage housing near
        transportation, employment and services through Program HE-1.16: Transit-Oriented
        Development of this Housing Element.
        Objective:                                Proximity to transportation,

        Monitor availability of County, State and Federal housing programs and pursue available
        funds as appropriate. The City shall encourage and coordinate with housing developers and
        service organizations to obtain funds for affordable housing projects, initially through pre-
        application meetings and throughout project development. The City shall also make funding
        information available to all proposed developers in the City through informational materials
        distributed through the Cityâ€™s website and at pre-application meetings.
        Objective:                                Increase use of County, State and

        Program HE-1.4: Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
        In compliance with State Law (SB 2), the City will review and revise the existing Zoning
        Ordinance to allow for emergency shelters and transitional and supportive housing for
        families and individuals that are homeless. The City will comply with the requirements of the
        State in the following manner:
           ï‚· Provide at least one zoning category in which emergency shelters can be located
               without discretionary approvals. The subject zoning category(ies) shall include sites
               with sufficient capacity to meet the local need for emergency shelters and in any case
               accommodate at least one year-round shelter. The City is considering the R-3, C-M
               and M zones to allow emergency shelters by-right.

Policy Program
           ï‚· Ensure the provisions of the Housing Accountability Act are enforced and prohibit the
               denial of emergency shelter/transitional housing facility via discretionary approvals if it
               is consistent with adopted regulatory standards.
           ï‚· Evaluate development standards and regulatory provisions to ensure that standards
               encourage rather than discourage development of emergency shelters and Transitional
               Housing.
           ï‚· Amend the Zoning Code to allow transitional and supportive housing as a residential
               use, subject only to those requirements of other residential uses in the same zone.

        To ensure that requirements for infrastructure provision are not considered an undue
        constraint to residential development, the City shall review infrastructure provision costs and

        Program HE-1.8: Adequate Sites For Housing Development
        The City has a remaining lower-income growth need of 38 dwelling units. To ensure the
        availability of adequate sites to accommodate the projected construction need by income
        category for the 2006-2014 planning period, the City shall develop and adopt a specific plan
        for the Placentia-Westgate area. As part of the Specific Plan, the City shall rezone a minimum
        of 1.27 acres to permit by-right multi-family, rental and ownership residential development at
        a minimum net density of 30 du/ac. Of the rezoned land, a minimum of 0.63 acres shall
        permit exclusively by-right residential uses to accommodate at least 50 percent of the Cityâ€™s
        lower-income growth need. The lower-income growth need shall be accommodated on sites
        with densities and development standards that permit a minimum of 16 units per site.
        The City has identified the opportunity sites to accommodate the remaining lower-income
        need in Table B-6 of this Housing Element. The City shall encourage the development of
        housing on the opportunity sites through incentives such as financial incentives , land write-
        downs; assistance with on- or off-site infrastructure costs; expedited entitlement review; fee
        reductions, fee deferrals or concessions; in-kind technical assistance; and other regulatory

        Program HE-3.7: Monitoring At-Risk Units
        The City shall regularly monitor the units in the City with affordability covenants that will
        expire during the planning period. To encourage the preservation of these â€œat-riskâ€ units, the
        city shall provide for targeted outreach to the owners of these units to encourage the
        extension and/or renewal of deed restrictions or covenants.
        The City shall develop a preservation strategy that is ready for implementation should owners
        of these units choose not to extend affordability. The preservation strategy shall identify non-
        profit agencies that the City can partner with to preserve the units and available funding
        sources. As part of this strategy, the City shall ensure compliance with noticing requirements
        and conduct tenant education.

        Program HE-3.8: Vacant Building Ordinance
        To prevent blight and deterioration of Placentiaâ€™s residential and non-residential
        neighborhoods, the City recently approved an ordinance establishing owner responsibilities
        for the maintenance and rehabilitation of long-term vacant buildings. The ordinance requires
        the registration of vacant properties resulting from foreclosure, and provides for an
        administrative monitoring program for boarded-up and vacant buildings. To ensure
        compliance, the ordinance imposes fees and civil penalties; and provides for administrative
        review and appeal opportunities. The City will continue to implement this ordinance to
        prevent blight and deterioration in Placentiaâ€™s neighborhoods.

to ensure maximum effectiveness in solving local and regional housing problems.
        Program HE-4.1: Partnerships with Housing Industry
        The City of Placentia has limited resources to use for the development and maintenance of
        affordable housing. In order to maximize its funding and staff resources, the City shall seek
        opportunities to partner with non-profit and for-profit housing developers.
        Specifically, the City shall proactive seek partnerships to develop affordable housing on
        identified sites within the Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan area to meet the Cityâ€™s remaining
        lower-income housing growth need. The City shall contribute to the partnership through
        activities such as in-kind technical assistance, support in seeking grant and funding
        opportunities, and financial assistance, which may include land write-downs and assistance
        with on- or off-site infrastructure costs.

Appendix A: Community Outreach
APPENDIX A: COMMUNITY OUTREACH
INTRODUCTION
             During 2008, the City of Placentia conducted a number of community outreach
             activities to ensure the Housing Element update reflected the issues and opportunities
             identified by the community. The workshops were advertised through flyers and
             announcements on the city website. In addition, the City mailed invitations to
             stakeholder groups such as affordable housing developers, professional and
             community organizations and housing advocacy groups and supportive service
             providers.
             The following community workshops were advertised and open to the general public:
             ï‚§    Workshop #1: February 7, 2008 at the Placentia City Hall Council Chambers
             ï‚§    Workshop #2: June 2, 2008 at the Placentia City Hall Council Chambers
             The following stakeholder meetings:
             ï‚§    Stakeholder Meeting #1: February 7, 2008 at the Placentia City Hall Community
                  Room
             Many stakeholder groups attended Community Workshop #1 in addition to the
             Stakeholder Meeting. All of the stakeholder groups were invited to participate in
             Community Workshop #2 along with the general public.
             During the first stakeholder and community workshops, participants were provided
             with an overview of the Housing Element Update process and content. Participants
             identified and discussed challenges, opportunities and resources related to housing in
             Placentia.
             The second Stakeholder Meeting and Community Workshop were combined to
             facilitate discussion. Many stakeholder groups who attended the first meeting also
             attended.
             During the second stakeholder/community workshop, participants were provided
             with an overview of the Housing Element Update process and content. Participants
             received a summary of key findings from the housing needs assessment and
             comments from the first stakeholder and community workshops. The group also
             identified additional challenges and opportunities related to housing in Placentia.
             Participants then discussed policy directions and other actions to address the current
             challenges; and identified possible resources and programs to implement the new
             policies.
Final                                  Appendix A-1                                 March 2, 2010

Appendix A: Community Outreach
             From the input received at the stakeholder meeting and community workshops, a
             number of overarching themes emerged. The following section summarizes those
             themes. The actual comments received are provided verbatim at the end of this
             appendix.
SUMMARY OF COMMUNITY/STAKEHOLDER INPUT
             AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING
             Affordability and the availability of different types of housing were identified by a
             number of participants as a challenge. They noted that high costs for both ownership
             and rental housing have affected the ability of many families to live in Placentia. To
             address these challenges, the participants would like to see mixed-income housing
             that promotes diversity and integrates low- to moderate-income units in higher
             income areas. Some would also like to see development of manufactured housing
             and larger apartment units. The issue of the availability of housing also touches upon
             the challenge of homelessness in the city. The participants would like to see specific
             policies that address the needs of the homeless.
             LAND USE
             Participants identified a number of challenges and opportunities related to land use
             and relationships between housing development and other areas of the city. The
             general lack of available land is seen as a large challenge for the city. A solution
             identified is to utilize mixed-use zoning. The participants expressed interest in
             establishing mixed-use zones and using specific plans in order to provide more
             housing and to attract business opportunities. Participants also acknowledged that
             increased density in some areas of the city might provide opportunities to develop
             housing.
             UTILIZING EXTERNAL RESOURCES
             Stakeholder meeting participants identified a number of external resources that can
             be used to improve, maintain and develop housing in Placentia. The stakeholder
             groups discussed at great length the opportunity for partnerships between the City
             and non-profit organizations, as well as the business community. These organizations
             can provide funding and other resources for the development of housing in the City
             of Placentia. Many participants identified the need for partnerships with nonprofit
             groups in order to target the development of housing for lower income families. The
             participants also discussed funding sources such as Section 8 and State HCD funds
             that can assist in the encouragement of mixed-income housing.
Final                                  Appendix A-2                                  March 2, 2010
Appendix A: Community Outreach
             INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES
             The workshop participants identified a number of challenges related to infrastructure
             and services needed to support housing in Placentia. Challenges included access to
             amenities such as pharmacies, cleaners and grocery stores, and access to public
             transit. Establishing mixed-use zones that provide housing and services in integrated
             neighborhoods were identified as an opportunity to improve the community and the
             quality of life for community members.
             AGING IN PLACE
             The meeting participants expressed particular concern over the challenges of â€œaging
             in place.â€ Because of the shortage in affordable housing units, many younger
             residents are moving out of the city. Housing for older residents is also lacking. In
             order to promote a multi-generational population, the participants propose the
             development of different housing opportunities and encouragement of
             homeownership for lower income residents.
             INTEGRATION OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES
             In order to address the challenges of climate change, the workshop and meeting
             participants identified the need to integrate green technologies into the development
             of housing.
             DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION
             Participants identified the revitalization and clean up of Old Town Placentia as an
             important consideration to promote safety and provide for housing and business
             opportunities. The meeting participants expressed the need to build partnerships with
             existing business owners in order to combine resources for public infrastructure
             improvements and building rehabilitation.
             CREATING JOBS
             Workshop participants identified the challenge of creating job opportunities within
             the city. Participants suggested establishing marketing efforts in order to promote the
             city to potential businesses that can create more jobs for the diverse workforce.

             The meeting participants discussed at length their concern over the Placentia-
             Westgate Specific Plan. Many expressed the need to update the current plan in order
             to keep up with the existing needs of the City. Some noted that more effort should be
             directed towards the implementation of the specific plan, and the essential proactive
             role of the City to complete the plan. The participants also identified the importance

             of creating a balance between housing and commercial development within the
             specific plan area to increase the tax base of the City. Participants expressed that the
             increase in tax base could provide additional resources to help improve housing
             conditions and add more housing choices.
             CITYWIDE REHABILITATION OF SUBSTANDARD UNITS
             In order to address the aging housing stock, the meeting participants proposed a
             number of opportunities that can be utilized by the City. Participants identified the
             need to streamline and advertise current rehabilitation grant programs to City
             residents in order to assist with housing repairs and maintenance. Meeting
             participants also recognized the option of using additional resources such as
             Redevelopment funds to assist homeowners and businesses with rehabilitation
             activities.
             EXPANDING RETAIL BASE
             The meeting participants extensively discussed the concern over the Cityâ€™s current
             retail tax base. Participants articulated the challenges of attracting new businesses to
             Placentia and identified different opportunities to address this need. The meeting
             participants recognized the Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan, the revitalization of Old
             Town Placentia, and a citywide rehabilitation of substandard units as opportunities to
             attract new businesses to the City.
             CREATING A CLEAR â€œVISIONâ€ FOR THE CITY
             Meeting participants discussed the need for creating a clearer â€œvisionâ€ for the
             Placentia. Some expressed the importance of developing a long-range plan that
             considered the future of the whole City. Participants discussed the need for a General
             Plan update to provide an opportunity to establish citywide goals for Placentia.

ADEQUATE SITES ANALYSIS
              State Housing Element Law mandates that each city show it has adequate sites
              available through appropriate zoning and development standards and with the
              required public services and facilities for a range of housing types and incomes. This
              evaluation of adequate sites represents planning goals, and not a goal for actual
              production of housing within the planning period. The City must demonstrate that it
              has the capacity or adequate sites to accommodate the projected need for housing.
              SCAG, the Council of Governments (COG) representing the region, in cooperation
              with local jurisdictions, is responsible for allocating the regionâ€™s projected new
              housing demand in each jurisdiction. This process is known as the Regional Housing
              Needs Assessment (RHNA) and the goals are referred to as the â€œregional shareâ€ goals
              for new housing construction. The allocation takes into account factors such as
              market demand for housing, employment opportunities, the availability of suitable
              sites and public facilities, commuting patterns, and type and tenure of housing needs.
              In determining a jurisdictionâ€™s share of new housing needs by income category, the
              allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in
              any one jurisdiction. The allocation is divided into four income categories:
                   ï‚·  Extremely Low-Income: 0 to 30 percent of the area median income;
                   ï‚·  Very Low-Income: 31 to 50 percent of the area median income;
                   ï‚·  Low-Income: 51 to 80 percent of the area median income;
                   ï‚·  Moderate-Income: 81 to 120 percent of the area median income;
                   ï‚·  Above Moderate-Income: more than 120 percent of the area median
                      income.
              The RHNA prepared by SCAG for the planning period of January 1, 2006 through
              June 30, 2014 identifies the City of Placentiaâ€™s share of the regionâ€™s housing needs as
              97 new housing units. The City of Placentiaâ€™s share of the regionâ€™s housing needs for
              2006-2014, as determined by SCAG, is the projected need for housing used in this
              evaluation.
              UNITS CONSTRUCTED DURING PLANNING PERIOD
              To determine the housing needs for the 2006-2014 planning period, the Cityâ€™s
              regional share is adjusted by the actual number of new housing units constructed
              from January 1, 2006 to the present. During this time span there were 35 new
              housing units constructed. Table B-1 provides detailed permit information and
              affordability level of the newly constructed units. The locations of these units are

               CAPACITY TO REACH REGIONAL SHARE GOALS
               To enable to City of Placentia to meet RHNA goals, the City must evaluate its ability
               to meet this need with existing development capacities.
               Current Projects
               The City of Placentia has several â€œprojects-in-the-pipelineâ€ that have not yet been
               completed but have received full planning entitlements. Table B-3 provides a
               summary of Placentiaâ€™s current residential projects.

                    Vacant Land Resources
                    The City of Placentia has minimal areas of vacant land. The majority of vacant land is
                    within the Cityâ€™s Specific Plan 7. This area is bounded by the south side of Buena
                    Vista Avenue to the north, the east side of Rose Drive to the west, the north side of
                    Orangethorpe Avenue along the south, and the west side of Van Buren Street to the
                    east. Table B-3 provides a summary of vacant land zoned for residential use
                    throughout the City. Exhibit B-2 shows the locations of these parcels. Many of the
                    vacant parcels are contiguous land areas too small to allow for construction.
                    However, through lot consolidation these parcels have the potential to provide
                    opportunities for new housing construction. The vacant residential land in Placentia
                    has the capacity for construction of 226 residential units. Based on the densities
                    permitted in these areas, the units would be affordable to moderate and above-
                    moderate income households.
                    Underutilized Land Resources
                    The City of Placentia also has a number of underutilized residential parcels. These
                    areas contain existing structures that are surrounded by vacant land; and have the
                    potential to provide additional opportunities for new housing construction. Table B-4
                    provides a summary of underutilized land zoned for residential use throughout the
                    City. Exhibit B-4 shows the locations of these parcels. The underutilized parcels have
                    a total potential capacity of 113 units, affordable to moderate and above-moderate
                    income households.

              Rezoning to Remaining RHNA Need
              Pursuant to AB 2348, jurisdictions with a shortfall of vacant/underutilized residential
              land to meet its RHNA needs must commit to a rezoning program to provide
              adequate sites to meet its remaining housing growth needs. The program must adhere
              to the following parameters:
              â€¢ Sites must be re-zoned to accommodate 100 percent of the remaining RHNA need
              for lower-income units
              â€¢ Re-zoned sites must permit rental and owner-occupied multi-family residential uses
              by-right
              â€¢ AB 2348 establishes â€œdefaultâ€ density standards. If a local government adopts
              density standards consistent with the â€œdefaultâ€ density standard (at least 30 du/ac for
              Placentia), the sites with those density standards are accepted as appropriate for
              accommodating the jurisdictionâ€™s share of regional housing need for lower income
              households
              â€¢ At least 50 percent of the very-low and low income housing need shall be
              accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which non-residential
              use or mixed-uses are not permitted
              â€¢ Sites identified to meet the very-low and low income housing need must have
              density and development standards that permit at least 16 units per site.
              The City has a remaining very-low and low income need of 38 dwelling units. The
              City will need to rezone a minimum of 1.27 acres at 30 du/ac to accommodate the
              remaining need. Of the rezoned land, at least 0.63 acres must permit exclusively by-
              right residential uses to accommodate at least 50 percent of the Cityâ€™s very-low and
              low income growth need.
              Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan
              Currently, the City is drafting the Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan. The Specific Plan
              area is a 110-acre historic core district situated on the original town site of Placita
              Santa Fe. The area is bounded by Chapman Avenue to the north; Orangethorpe
              Avenue to the south; and the 57 Freeway to the west. The location of the Specific
              Plan area is shown in Exhibit B-4.
              The Specific Plan envisions a walkable network of varied blocks, plazas, parks and
              streetscapes; and a reestablishment of the communityâ€™s relationship with the rail
              corridor. The draft plan proposes the development of over 1,500 new residential
              units in conjunction with new commercial and office spaces. The Placentia-Westgate
              Specific Plan will contain opportunities for development of affordable housing units.
              The following zones are established in the Placentia- Westgate Specific Plan, and
              govern the use of land within the Specific Plan Area:

              The City has identified sites within the Placentia-Westgate Specific Plan area that
              have the greatest potential or opportunity to provide for affordable housing. These
              opportunity sites are the candidate sites for rezoning to permit by-right multi-family
              residential use at a minimum density of 30 du/ac and have the capacity to meet and
              exceed the Cityâ€™s remaining RHNA need. Table B-6 summarizes these opportunity
              sites.

              The first two parcels identified in Table B-6 are contiguous and are part of what is
              referred to as the East Packing House site. These parcels are able to be consolidated.
              Through the Specific Plan, the East Packing House site will permit mixed-use
              including higher-density residential uses, public facilities, and retail uses to support
              the future Metrolink station. While the potential capacity is 25 units at the â€œdefault
              densityâ€ of 30 du/ac, the City anticipates construction of up to 85 units on this site.
              The structure was historically used as a packing house, but the use has long been
              discontinued. The City recently purchased these parcels with the intent of
              redeveloping them. The City continues to lease the structures to the current tenants,
              however these leases will be discontinued once the City enters into a partnership
              with a developer for the project. The City is currently working with potential
              developers. The project will include higher-density housing, community facilities, and
              parking for the future Metrolink station.
              The third parcel is referred to as the West Packing House site. The City has identified
              this site for an adaptive reuse project. The parcels has been designed to be rezoned
              permit exclusively by-right residential use at a minimum of 30 du/ac. The existing
              building will be converted to accommodate affordable housing units. While the
              potential unit capacity is 69 units at the â€œdefault densityâ€ of 30 du/ac, the City
              anticipates this site will yield over 100 units. The building was originally constructed

              as a packing house; however, the use has been discontinued. The building is
              currently occupied with light industrial uses. The property owner has expressed
              interest in discontinuing the existing uses and selling the property. It is the Cityâ€™s
              intent to purchase this parcel when funds become available. Subsequent to the
              Specific Plan adoption, the City will be proactively seeking developer partnerships for
              this project. Policy actions to secure partnerships are included in the Housing
              Element policy program. Concept-level plans for housing have already been
              developed for these sites.

  ASSISTED UNITS â€œAT-RISKâ€ OF CONVERSION
                    Jurisdictions are required by State Housing Element Law to analyze government-
                    assisted housing that is eligible to convert from low-income to market rate housing
                    over the next 10 years. State law identifies housing assistance as a rental subsidy,
                    mortgage subsidy or mortgage insurance to an assisted housing development.
                    Government assisted housing might convert to market rate housing for a number of
                    reasons including expiring subsidies, mortgage repayments or expiration of
                    affordability restrictions.
                    This section addresses:
                    ï‚§    An inventory of assisted housing units that are at-risk of converting to market rate
                         housing;
                    ï‚§    An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing these units;
                    ï‚§    Resources that can be used to preserve at-risk units;
                    ï‚§    Program efforts for preservation of at-risk housing units; and
                    ï‚§    Quantified objectives for the number of at-risk units to be preserved during the
                         Housing Element planning period

               COST OF PRESERVATION VERSUS REPLACEMENT
               Two projects with a total of 113 units are at-risk of converting to market rate housing
               from 2008 through 2014. Generally, the cost of preserving existing units is more cost
               effective than replacing units through new construction. Replacement of these units
               with rehabilitated units may be cost effective in some instances.
               Preservation Strategies
               There are many options to preserving units including purchasing affordable housing
               units by a non-profit or public agency, providing financial incentives to project
               owners to extend low-income use restrictions, or providing local subsidies to offset
               the difference between the affordable and market rate. Scenarios for preservation will
               depend on the type of project at-risk.
               Local Rental Subsidy
               One strategy for preserving the units at-risk during the planning period is to provide a
               local rental subsidy to residents. Rent subsidies can be utilized to provide assistance
               to residents when their affordable units convert to market rate. To determine the
               subsidy needed, Fair Market Rents were compared to market rate rents. Table B-
               9provides a summary of Fair Market Rents for Orange County and Table B-10
               provides an estimate of the required subsidy by unit type.

               Replacement Cost
               The city of Placentia can also consider the cost of replacing the units with new
               construction. Construction cost estimates include all hard and soft costs associated
               with construction in addition to per unit land costs. The analysis assumes the
               replacement units are garden style apartments with parking provided on-site. Square
               footage estimates are based on the average unit size per the prevailing sales in the
               region. Land costs have been determined on a per unit basis. Tables B-11 and B-12
               summarize the estimated replacement costs per unit.
