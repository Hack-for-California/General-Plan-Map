A Community Guide
to the General Plan
The City of Santa Clara General Plan presents the vision for
the evolution and enhancement of the Santa Clara community
through the year 2035. This General Plan’s vision is long-range,
supported by a spectrum of strategies and policies to deal with
changing priorities and development pressures that the City will
face through the coming years. Because this Plan looks forward 25
years into our future, it recognizes that changing circumstances
may alter our collective choices as we move toward that far-time
horizon.
This General Plan has been designed as a “Progressive Plan”
that breaks down the 25-year horizon into three planning phases
that are more manageable and responsive to change and our
future needs. As we near the conclusion of each of these short,
medium and long-term planning phases, to 2015, 2025 and 2035,
respectively, there will be renewed community participation
eﬀorts to check our direction and priorities, as well as to reaﬃrm
and extend our long-term vision each time.

                                 development in the City, the General Plan outlines Major
                                 Strategies that provide the foundation for defined goals and

The Santa Clara Vision
Santa Clara has a rich history and a promising future. Mission
Santa Clara, rebuilt several times prior to its current home
on the Santa Clara University campus, is a fitting icon for the
City’s seal. It represents a commitment and a will to succeed.
Leadership in Santa Clara takes many forms, and overall it has
been forward thinking and supportive of the growing City since
its incorporation in 1852, but at the same time, protective of its
cultural and historical treasures. Together, the residents and
businesses of Santa Clara have built a community that is strong
and successful well beyond its modest reputation.
Modern Santa Clara sprang from two centers, the central core
that grew outward from the original downtown and the Old
Quad residential areas, and Agnew Village, a satellite area that
established a base for residential neighborhoods in northern
Santa Clara. Primarily an agricultural community through
the mid-1900s, it came to life as a family-oriented, suburban
community of comfortable neighborhoods in the post World
War II era and as the heart of Silicon Valley in the electronics
industry boom of the 1970s.
Because City leadership had the foresight to develop its own
electric, water and sewer utilities, as well as to support an
industrial and retail economic base that has resulted in robust
property and sales tax revenues, Santa Clarans have enjoyed
high quality services for many years in the form of aﬀordable
utility rates, abundant parks and recreational amenities, good
streets and admirable community facilities, such as the Senior
Center, the Central Park Library and the municipal Santa Clara
Golf & Tennis Club, to name a few.
In crafting a General Plan that articulates a vision for the City,
the community participants who lead this eﬀort recognized the
importance of protecting and preserving the heritage of past
                                                                   Page 1-3

                      generations and the neighborhoods. At the same time, because
                      the world does not stand still, these leaders realized that we
                      must look forward, just as our community forefathers did, and
                      make bold plans to maintain and enhance that quality of life for
                      Santa Clarans to come. The policies in this General Plan, and
                      the underlying Strategies for Santa Clara’s vision, will support
                      decisions, large and small, that continue to make Santa Clara a
                      great place to live, work and play.
                      Just after the turn of the millennium in 2000, it became clear that
                      forces of change larger than our local decisions were beginning
                      to alter the economy of Silicon Valley. While the headquarters of
                      major electronic firms, such as Intel, Applied Materials, National
                      Semiconductor and Sun Microsystems/Oracle, among many
                      others, remain, much of the production and manufacturing
                      activities of these enterprises moved away. Many jobs were lost,
                      with commercial and industrial vacancies hitting a high in late
                      2009. The management, design and development activities of
                      these companies have stayed, indicating the confidence in the
                      area’s wealth of brain power and entrepreneurial spirit.
                      The challenge for realizing Santa Clara’s vision will be to
                      preserve the best of the community we have cultivated over many
                      years, while finding and making the most of the opportunities
                      that stem from the pressures of development that are brought
                      before us. Santa Clara is built out, with over 97 percent of its
                      land area developed primarily in a low density, suburban form.
                      New businesses and residences will need to intensify existing
                      development. Planned growth, economic, physical and social,
                      should be directed to areas where already developed properties
                      can be enhanced and intensified with little or no adverse eﬀect
                      on areas that we wish to preserve.
                      Growth that is well done, and in the right location, will provide
                      new revenues to support current and new services and replace
                      aging infrastructure. It will generate jobs for residents and
                      families who want to remain in Santa Clara, support new and
                      better retail services through reinvestment in older properties,
                      and put new housing in areas where services can be added or
                      enhanced. These improvements will increase transportation
                      options for new and existing residents, alike, and reduce their
                      reliance on automobile trips.

1.1.1 Why a General Plan?                                            Committee Members,
The State requires that every city and county in California              October 2009
prepare a general plan. The City of Santa Clara’s General
Plan lays out broad goals and specific policies on land use,
community design, circulation, housing, public facilities, open
space, recreation, conservation, noise, seismic and safety, and
historic preservation. The General Plan provides information
for the community to define acceptable development. It is a
guide for decisions by the City Council, Planning Commission,
City Departments and other governmental agencies on specific
development applications. In sum, the purpose of the General
Plan is to:
                                                                                            Page 1-5

                                  A city’s general plan can be described as its constitution for
                                  development and the framework for decisions related to growth,
                                  public services and facilities and environmental protection.
                                  General plans are as diverse as the communities they guide. The

           Committee Members,
               October 2009       State law requires that general plans address seven specific
                                  areas, called “elements.” These required elements are: Land
                                  Use, Circulation, Open Space, Conservation, Noise, Safety and
                                  Housing. During the City of Santa Clara’s planning process,

historic preservation and neighborhood compatibility emerged
as important components for inclusion in the General Plan, as
well. Instead of treating each area as separate elements, this
General Plan integrates them into a comprehensive guide for the
City’s future. The State required elements are cross-referenced
in Appendix 8.4. Note that the General Plan Housing Element
is a stand-alone document in Appendix 8.12. Policies from that    General Plan
document are also incorporated into the residential land use

                      1.2   GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION
                      The Santa Clara General Plan is organized into seven chapters
                      and multiple appendices.
                         • Chapter 1 (this chapter) is the Community Guide to
                            the General Plan. It is a synthesis of the General Plan’s
                            vision, strategies and implementation program, and
                            is intended as the executive summary of the Plan and
                            serves as a reference guide for community members and
                            policymakers.
                         • Chapter 2 provides a description of the progressive
                            structure of the Plan. This chapter also describes the
                            State requirements for general plans.
                         • Chapter 3 sets the historical context for the General Plan
                            goals and policies.
                         • Chapter 4 defines the Major Strategies which are the
                            guiding principles for the Plan, itself.
                         • Chapter 5 includes the goals and policies that direct the
                            Plan implementation. Policies for land use, discretionary
                            uses and land use transitions, focus areas, historic
                            preservation, mobility and transportation, public facilities
                            and services, and environmental quality provide the
                            direction for future development.
                         • Chapter 6 provides information about the local and
                            regional planning context, including parallel planning
                            eﬀorts by the City, surrounding jurisdictions and regional
                            agencies that have implications for development in Santa
                            Clara.
                         • Chapter 7 defines the implementation strategy, in terms
                            of roles, responsibilities and financing, to meet Plan
                            policies and goals.
                         • Chapter 8 is the Appendices. It contains supplemental
                            documents to the Plan, including the City’s Sustainable
                            Community Plan, a matrix of the Plan’s consistency with

1.2.2 Areas of Stability and Potential Development
Most areas of the City are not expected to change substantially
over the course of the Plan. Specifically, Santa Clara’s established
residential neighborhoods, with their distinctive character and
sense of community, are not proposed for land use changes.
                                                                                                 Page 1-9

                                 Additionally, General Plan policies support compatibility

                                 1.2.3 Plan Phases
                                 The Plan is organized into the three phases listed below, reflecting
                                 near-, mid- and long-term horizons. Each phase includes
                                 changes in land uses and development intensities for specific
                                 areas. The primary objective for the phasing is to ensure that
                                 new development is supported by the appropriate infrastructure
                                 and services. Over time, new economic, technological and social

           and bicycle           end of each phase. As the City faces a new cycle of needs and
         pathways and            economic conditions, General Plan strategies and objectives can
                                 be refined and reflected in subsequent phases. Through this

                                 the preservation and enhancement of existing neighborhoods;
                                 foster public and private investment in jobs, housing, services

                                  in the early history and development of California. While some
                                  aspects of the City have changed with its transition from a
             ... local and

    • Continue high quality public services and amenities,
       including open space and parks; and,
    • Encourage sustainability to protect energy, water supplies
       and air quality.
These themes serve as the basis for the General Plan Major
Strategies, which are summarized below. They also provide the
context for the General Plan policies as well as for the population
and job growth projections identified in Appendix 8.6.
                                                                                            Page 1-13

         GENERAL PLAN
                      1.4     MAJOR STRATEGIES
                      The seven Major Strategies represent the overarching principles
                      of the Santa Clara General Plan. The Strategies expressed here are
                      reflected throughout the Plan, providing the direction for goals
                      and policies, as well as for implementing actions. Each Strategy
                      listed below defines a distinct priority, such as economic vitality
                      or sustainability. The synthesis of these individual Strategies
                      into General Plan goals and policies mutually reinforces the
                      overall purpose of the Plan to enhance quality of life for existing
                      and future members of the City of Santa Clara.
                          1. Enhance the City’s High Quality of Life
                          2. Preserve and Cultivate Neighborhoods
                          3. Promote Sustainability
                          4. Enhance City Identity
                          5. Support Focus Areas and Community Vitality
                          6. Maintain the City’s Fiscal Health and Quality Services
                          7. Maximize Health and Safety Benefits
                      1.5     GOALS AND POLICIES
                      Goals and policies of this General Plan are organized around
                      land use; discretionary uses and transitions between varying
                      land uses; focus areas; historic preservation; mobility and
                      transportation; public facilities and services; and environmental
                      quality. These goals and policies describe the priorities and
                      strategies for the City’s General Plan vision.
                      1.5.1 Prerequisites
                      Prerequisite goals and policies identify fundamental steps, or
                      milestones, that must be undertaken or reached, prior to moving
                      on to subsequent phases of the General Plan. The prerequisites
                      provide the opportunity to monitor and evaluate the City’s
                      progress at regular intervals. Some goals and policies are specific
                      to a particular year or phase, while others apply to all phases.

Each of the policies must be followed to graduate to the next
phase.
1.5.2 Land Use
Because Santa Clara has virtually no vacant land, new
development will primarily redevelop existing sites from lower
to higher intensity uses. Intensifying existing development
                                                                     ... urban parks,

Creek Boulevard, as well as in the City’s employment core north
of the Caltrain corridor. Focusing increased intensities at these    plazas that are
locations will maximize opportunities for mixed uses and future      integrated well
transit, without impacting the City’s existing residential and
industrial character.                                               within the larger

Components of the City’s land use policies include:
    • Revitalizing Downtown with a mix of commercial and
        residential uses;
    • Redefining El Camino Real as a vital, pedestrian-oriented
        corridor, with a greater diversity of uses;

                              commercial centers.
                      While much of the City is not anticipated to change significantly
                      in character, land use or development intensity over the next
                      25 years, all areas will be influenced by new growth in the City.
                      As a result, the City’s growth strategy addresses sustainability
                      and fiscal responsibility, as well as the City’s role in supporting
                      innovation and expansion for existing and new businesses.
                      1.5.3 Focus Areas
                      The Plan identifies Focus Areas throughout the City to support
                      and foster the City’s diverse economic base. The purpose of these
                      Focus Areas is to encourage improvements and new development
                      tailored to the character and quality of these areas. Near-term
                      Focus Areas include the El Camino Real and Stevens Creek
                      Boulevard corridors where a mix of land uses at key locations, in
                      conjunction with improved commercial and streetscape design,
                      are encouraged. Santa Clara’s Downtown is another Focus Area
                      for regeneration as a center of activity to draw patrons City-wide
                      for shopping, eating and entertainment. The fourth near-term
                      Focus Area is centered on the Santa Clara Transit Station. Future
                      Focus Areas are envisioned along transportation corridors, such as
                      San Tomas Expressway and Bowers Avenue, in order to facilitate
                      greater mobility and expand accessibility to jobs in these areas.
                      Comprehensive planning is a prerequisite for all the Future Focus
                      Areas prior to development approvals.
                      1.5.4 Neighborhood Compatibility
                      Policies for neighborhood compatibility promote livability
                      through the design of new public spaces, such as streets and
                      plazas, as well as through the application of interface solutions
                      between new development and existing neighborhoods. These
                      policies protect Santa Clara’s existing assets in order to maintain
                      the City’s identity. Neighborhood compatibility policies focus
                      on protecting existing neighborhoods, as well as on providing
                      appropriate transitions between varying planned intensities and
                      uses.
                      Components of neighborhood compatibility include discretionary
                      use and transition policies. Discretionary Use Policies are used
                      to address unique cases in which uses and/or densities, other

1.5.8 Environmental Quality
The quality of the environment that surrounds us, whether it
is rural, suburban or urban, aﬀects quality of life and physical,
mental and emotional health.          Preserving environmental
resources, maintaining water and air quality and protecting
plant and wildlife habitat are important to environmental health.
Environmental quality also includes protecting the community’s
safety against the risks posed by hazards. Potential safety
hazards can be associated with seismic and geologic conditions,
flooding, hazardous materials and waste, as well as excessive
noise. Like most Bay Area communities, Santa Clara is located
in a seismically active region. The City is also proximate to
the San José Norman Y. Mineta International Airport, rail lines
and various highway corridors, all of which generate noise.
Addressing these environmental issues is important as the City
becomes more densely developed.
Components of the City’s policies for maintaining environmental
quality include:
    • Maximizing opportunities throughout the City to provide
        open space and habitat;
    • Protecting and improving air quality by reducing vehicle
        trips;
    • Continuing to develop cost eﬀective alternative power
        sources and to encourage conservation;
    • Maximizing recycling and composting to save energy and
        resources, as well as to reduce demand on solid waste
        facilities;
    • Requiring water conservation and recycled water use to
        ensure an adequate water supply and to save energy;
    • Requiring that urban development not reduce water
        quality;
    • Participating in a regional Non-Point-Source Control
        Program to reduce storm water runoﬀ pollutants;
                                                                  Page 1-19

1.7.3 Neighborhood Planning
The General Plan focuses on City-wide policies. Other than
the policies and design elements tailored to the four, near-term
Focus Areas, the Plan does not include detailed neighborhood
plans. The Plan does, however, outline a process for existing
neighborhoods and districts to initiate separate, private planning
eﬀorts to create smaller scale Neighborhood Improvement
Plans. These community-initiated plans are intended to
help neighborhoods to define and preserve their individual
neighborhood character.

General Plan Organization
This Chapter describes the purpose of the General Plan, its
required contents under State law, and outlines the organization
of the document, itself. It also provides a description of
the “Progressive General Plan,” including areas where new
development is anticipated, the phasing of the plan and a
summary of the prerequisites for development, which are the
fundamental components that shape the Plan.
2.1     PLAN REQUIREMENTS
This General Plan governs the City’s actions related to Santa
Clara’s physical development. It is mandated by, and derives
its authority from, California Government Code Section 65300 et
seq. In the City of Santa Clara, the General Plan is adopted by
the City Council to:
      Define a vision for Santa Clara’s long-term physical and
        economic development;
                                                                 Page 2-1

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                           Provide specific strategies and policies that support this
                              vision;
                           Establish a basis for development and project approvals;
                           Support proposals that protect environmental resources
                              and minimize hazards; and,
                           Set parameters for plans and programs, such as the
                              Zoning Ordinance, Capital Improvements Program and
                              Redevelopment Plans.
                      2.1.1 State Requirements
                      A city’s general plan can be described as its constitution for
                      development and the framework for decisions related to growth,
                      public services and facilities, and environmental protection. In
                      California, local control over land use decisions means that cities
                      have flexibility in preparing general plans, provided certain
                      basic requirements are met. The California Government Code
                      establishes both content requirements for general plans and the
                      rules for their adoption and subsequent amendment. Together,
                      State law and judicial decisions have established four overall
                      guidelines for general plans.
                          1. Comprehensive. This requirement has two aspects. First,
                              a general plan must be geographically comprehensive.
                              It must apply throughout the entire incorporated area
                              and should include other areas that the city determines
                              are relevant to its planning. Second, a general plan must
                              address the full range of issues aﬀecting the city’s physical
                              development.
                          2. Internally Consistent. This requirement means that the
                              General Plan must fully integrate its separate parts and
                              relate them to each other without conflict. Consistency
                              applies as much to figures and diagrams as to the text. It
                              also applies to data and analysis as well as policies. All
                              adopted portions of a general plan, whether required by
                              State law or not, have equal weight.
                          3. Long-Range.       Because anticipated development will
                              aﬀect a city, its residents and businesses for years, State
                              law requires every general plan to take a long-term
                              perspective. The time horizon for the Santa Clara General
                              Plan is approximately 25 years.

   4. Mandated Elements. State law mandates that general
       plans include seven elements: Land Use, Circulation,
       Open Space, Conservation, Noise, Safety, and Housing.
       Elements to address other local concerns may also be
       included. The Santa Clara General Plan includes Historic
       Preservation and Neighborhood Compatibility. Because
       this General Plan is an integrated document, it does
       not have independent elements except for the Housing
       Element, which is provided in Appendix 8.12. Appendix
       8.4 is a matrix that cross-references State general plan
       required elements with the Santa Clara General Plan text
       and diagrams.
2.2    PLAN ORGANIZATION
The Santa Clara General Plan is organized into seven chapters
and multiple appendices.
   • This Chapter provides a description of the “Progressive
       Plan” and an outline of the organization of the Plan.
   • Chapter 1 is the Community Guide to the General Plan. It
       is a synthesis of the General Plan’s vision, strategies and
       implementation program. This Chapter is intended as the
       executive summary of the Plan and serves as a reference
       guide for community members and policymakers.
   • Chapter 3 sets the historical context for the General Plan
       goals and policies. It is a summary of existing conditions,
       which provides the framework for the Plan.
   • Chapter 4 defines the General Plan’s Major Strategies,
       which serve as the guiding principles for the Plan itself.
   • Chapter 5 includes the goals and policies for land use,
       discretionary uses, land use transitions, focus areas,
       historic preservation, mobility and transportation, public
       facilities and services, and environmental quality that
       provide direction for future development.
   • Chapter 6 provides a description of the local and regional
       planning context.
                                                                   Page 2-3

         GENERAL PLAN
                      • Chapter 7 defines the implementation strategy, in terms
                        of roles, responsibilities and financing for Plan policies
                        and goals. This Chapter also outlines the process for
                        monitoring, amending and implementing the Plan.
                      • Chapter 8 is the Appendices and contains supplemental
                        documents to the Plan, including:
                        -   Index, Definitions and Acronyms. The index is
                            intended to help readers locate information by topic
                            in the Plan, and the glossary provides definitions for
                            terms used in the Plan.
                        -   Matrix of General Plan Land Use Designations. This
                            matrix illustrates the relationship between the 1992
                            General Plan land use designations and those in the
                            2010-2035 General Plan.
                        -   Matrices of General Plan Elements and Other
                            Regulatory Requirements. These Appendices include
                            matrices that cross-reference the State-mandated
                            elements and other regulatory requirements, such as
                            those associated with Senate Bill 2 (SB2), Assembly
                            Bill 32 (AB32) and Senate Bill 375 (SB375), with specific
                            sections, policies and diagrams in the Plan.
                        -   Assumptions Appendices.             These Appendices
                            document the underlying development assumptions
                            associated with land uses in the Plan for growth (such
                            as persons per household, rate of development and the
                            like) as well as the assumptions for the transportation
                            networks.
                        -   Housing Element. This is the City’s Housing Element
                            for the current planning period, which is a technical
                            document, consistent with State law requirements.
                            It provides the basis for many of the residential land
                            use policies found in Chapter 5.
                        -   Sustainability Goals and Policies Matrix.           This
                            Appendix includes a matrix of General Plan policies
                            that correspond to the City’s goals for sustainability
                            and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
                        -   Other Technical Appendices. Included in these
                            Appendices are other documents, such as the noise
                            analysis, historical resources inventory, heritage tree
                            list, parks and open space resources inventory, and
                            school district and facilities information.

Chapter Two: GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION

            contributors to the production of the General Plan
            document.
The Goals and Policies are organized from those with broad
direction for a variety of land uses to those applying to more
specific areas or situations in the City. Goals and Policies are
numbered using the Section number, a designation as “Goal” or
“Policy” and sequential numbering. For example, Downtown
Focus Area Goals are labeled “5.4.2-G1”, “5.4.2-G2” and so on,
while Downtown Focus Area Policies are labeled “5.4.2-P1”,
“5.4.2-P2” and so on. Note that policies pertaining to public/
quasi-public facilities and to parks, trails and open space are
included in Section “5.9: Public Facilities and Services” as well as
in Section “5.5: Neighborhood Compatibility Goal and Policies”
as Discretionary Use Policies.
2.3     PROGRESSIVE GENERAL PLAN
2.3.1 Areas of Stability
Much of the City is not expected to change substantially over the
three phases of the Plan. Specifically, Santa Clara’s established
residential neighborhoods, with their distinctive character and
sense of community, are not proposed for land use changes.
Additionally, General Plan policies support compatibility
between new development and existing neighborhoods in terms
of scale, height and land use. The City benefits from private
investments as a result of implementation of the Plan, including
increased revenues from new development, as well as upgraded
public facilities, transportation options and retail services. Areas
of Stability are illustrated on Figure 2.3-1 in this Chapter.
2.3.2 Areas of Potential Development
Given that the City has virtually no vacant land, all new
development will reuse existing underutilized properties for
redevelopment. A preliminary market assessment of future land
use demand, prepared as part of the analysis for the General
Plan Update, identified future opportunities throughout the
City for investment in residential, retail, entertainment, oﬃce,
industrial and data center uses, when the economy supports such
development. The Areas of Potential Development illustrated
on Figure 2.3-1 in this Chapter were identified using this market
analysis, in conjunction with an analysis of the redevelopment
                                                                     Page 2-5

                      potential for properties based on location and/or relatively low-
                      intensity existing development. While not all of the sites will
                      likely redevelop, the map indicates where new development is
                      anticipated and acceptable. It is possible that by 2035, other, more
                      recently-developed sites may also be ready for redevelopment or
                      intensification. The designated land uses for new development
                      are illustrated in Chapter 5, Figures 5.2-1, 5.2-2 and 5.2-3.
                      Potential development identified in the Plan includes both
                      intensification under existing land use designations, as well as
                      expansion of the allowed uses under those designations. Only
                      the Downtown and Santa Clara Station Focus Areas and the
                      new residential neighborhoods in the Future Focus Areas, north
                      of the Caltrain right of way, incorporate significant land use
                      designation changes from the prior General Plan.
                      Both the City’s industrial and commercial areas are expected to
                      change from lower to higher intensity development. North of
                      the Caltrain corridor, the City’s employment base is expected
                      to expand through the intensification of oﬃce/research and
                      development (R&D) uses. Specifically, the Bowers Avenue and
                      San Tomas Expressway transportation corridors are targeted
                      for higher-intensity employment centers. More moderate
                      employment centers surround these corridors. Intensification of
                      commercial uses and expanded opportunities for mixed uses are
                      targeted for the areas along El Camino Real and Stevens Creek
                      Boulevard. The areas included within the Downtown and Santa
                      Clara Station Focus Areas combine new land uses with higher-
                      intensity development in order to take advantage of proximity
                      to transit. Chapter 5 provides more detail on the allowable
                      development intensity for the various land use designations and
                      for the Downtown and Santa Clara Station Focus Areas.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      2.4     PLAN PHASES
                      The Plan is organized into three phases, reflecting near-, mid-
                      and long-term horizons. Each phase includes changes in land
                      uses and development intensities for specific areas. The goals
                      and policies in Chapter 5: Goals and Policies, along with the
                      associated Land Use and Mobility and Transportation Diagrams,
                      include the requirements associated with each phase.
                      The primary objective for the three phases is to ensure that
                      pressure for new development can be accommodated and
                      supported by appropriate infrastructure and services. Over
                      time, new economic, technological and social conditions may
                      emerge that alter current assumptions about land use needs,
                      compatibility and overall planning. To respond to these unknown
                      factors, the Plan includes prerequisites as described in Section
                      2.5 and in Chapter 5. For example, as the City faces a new cycle
                      of needs and conditions, General Plan strategies and objectives
                      will be refined and reflected in subsequent phases. Through this
                      iterative process, the Progressive General Plan will continue to
                      preserve the high quality of life enjoyed in the City, encourage
                      the preservation and enhancement of existing neighborhoods,
                      promote public and private investment in jobs, housing, services
                      and amenities, as well as reflect and support the Major Strategies
                      defined in Chapter 4.
                      2.4.1 Phase I: 2010-2015
                      Phase I represents the short-term strategy for growth. It focuses
                      on areas with new development opportunities, including new
                      land use designations and implementation measures for 2010 to
                      2015. The end of this phase aligns with the next State-mandated
                      housing element adoption cycle and incorporates housing located
                      near the Santa Clara Transit Station, Downtown, El Camino Real
                      and other residential and mixed-use areas. In sum, the intent of
                      Phase I is to:
                           Define opportunity sites for housing that are well-
                              connected with existing residential neighborhoods, City
                              services and public transit;
                           Focus intensified employment centers north of the
                              Caltrain corridor;
                           Support infrastructure improvements;

     Develop mixed residential and commercial uses along El
       Camino Real, in Downtown, and in Santa Clara Station
       Area;
     Preserve and expand commercial uses along Stevens Creek
       Boulevard; and,
     Establish new neighborhood-oriented retail uses and
       services along Homestead Road at Lawrence Expressway
       and Kiely Boulevard, Monroe Street, and at Saratoga Avenue
       and Stevens Creek Boulevard.
2.4.2 Phase II: 2015-2025
Phase II represents the intermediate strategy for growth. It
continues many of the policies defined in Phase I, including the
employment intensification north of the Caltrain corridor; mixed-
use development along El Camino Real and in Downtown; and
commercial uses along Stevens Creek Boulevard. New initiatives
in Phase II are to:
     Develop new residential neighborhoods north of the
       Caltrain corridor to capitalize on existing transit near the
       Caltrain Station at Lawrence Expressway and adjacent to
       the Tasman light rail corridor at the City’s eastern boundary;
       and,
     Plan public facilities and services in tandem with new
       neighborhoods, including retail uses, parks and open space,
       utilities and other public facilities.
2.4.3 Phase III: 2025-2035
As the City’s long-term strategy for growth, Phase III applies to the
period between 2025 and 2035. For this time period, some of the
General Plan assumptions may need re-evaluation. A reassessment
of this phase before 2025 will help to better align growth and
development with future conditions and changing needs. Looking
ahead, applicable, long-range initiatives in Phase III are to:
     Develop new residential neighborhoods in conjunction
       with appropriate retail uses, parks and open space and
       other public facilities along transit corridors, such as
       Great America Parkway, Central Expressway, De La Cruz
       Boulevard and Tasman Drive; and,
     Explore a civic presence in Downtown and continue the
       intensification of residential and mixed uses along El
       Camino Real.

                      2.5     PLAN PREREQUISITES
                      To address the potential eﬀects of future growth and the
                      associated increased demand for services, resources and changing
                      technology, the Plan identifies intermediate steps, conditions
                      and improvements as prerequisites for implementation of
                      subsequent phases. The intent of these prerequisites is to
                      allow logical planning for responsible growth, ensuring that
                      the City maintains quality services and available resources for
                      existing and future residents and businesses. Prerequisites for
                      future phases will be refined, amended and added over time,
                      as local and regional conditions, as well as technology, change.
                      Prerequisites for phases of the Progressive General Plan are
                      included in Chapter 5: Goals and Policies.
                      Prerequisites for each phase focus on a reassessment of the Plan
                      prior to implementing the next phase. Through this process,
                      assumptions for future development, as well as for supporting
                      infrastructure and services, can be adjusted to meet changing
                      conditions. An analysis of the fiscal implications for the City is
                      also envisioned between each phase to help define appropriate
                      land use and policy changes.
                      In addition to prerequisites that keep the Plan current, there
                      are also prerequisites for public improvements. The purpose
                      of these is to promote the concurrent development of facilities
                      and services necessary for new residential and non-residential
                      development. For example, new neighborhoods north of the
                      Caltrain corridors will require comprehensive planning eﬀorts
                      prior to implementation of individual development proposals.
                      This process will identify adequate infrastructure and services,
                      access to transit, open space, recreation and retail and suﬃcient
                      public facilities (such as parks, schools, libraries and utilities).
                      Finally, transportation improvements to meet future demands
                      of new development and changing priorities for alternate modes
                      are also prerequisites for each phase. These prerequisites include
                      criteria for roadway and intersection improvements, as well as
                      for bicycle, transit and pedestrian facilities.

Treasuring Our Past,
Present and Future
Santa Clara, the “Mission City,” has been significantly
transformed over the past century from a small agricultural town
to the center of technology in Silicon Valley. The past 20 years,
in particular, have given rise to a wave of new development
in the City. Today, Santa Clara consists of vibrant residential
neighborhoods and job centers that provide stability and support
for the City’s continued growth. This Chapter provides an
overview of the City, including its history and context, as well as
a summary of existing conditions that will shape future growth.
It also describes the public participation eﬀorts that provide the
basis for the vision and strategies incorporated into the General
Plan.

                                       3.1     HONORING OUR PAST
                                       Santa Clara has a rich past that is rooted in the early history and
                                       development of California. While some aspects of the City past
                                       have changed with its transition from a Mission outpost and
                                       agricultural town, key reminders of Santa Clara’s history remain
                                       throughout the City. These features are evident in the City’s
                                       historical places, like Mission Santa Clara, Santa Clara Railroad
                                       Depot, the Old Quad and Agnew Village neighborhoods and the
                                       vintage period architecture. As Santa Clara continues to evolve,
                                       understanding and honoring the past will ensure that the City’s

in 1777 and rebuilt four times in its
history, with the final 1825 structure
                                       The area around Santa Clara was first settled by the Costanoan
residing on the current Santa Clara
University (SCU) campus.               tribe, also known as the Ohlone tribe, as early as 4000-8000
                                       BC. In 1769, scouts from Juan Gaspar de Portola’s expedition
                                       into the Monterey Bay discovered the area’s rich fertile soils.
                                       Mission Santa Clara was established in 1777. Over time, Mission
                                       activity gave way to wheat farming as well as cattle ranching.
                                       By 1850, when California became a state, Santa Clara was an
                                       established frontier settlement. In 1851, Santa Clara College,
                                       now Santa Clara University, was founded on the Mission site.
                                       The incorporation of Santa Clara followed in 1852. In 1866, the
                                       City oﬃcially established a grid street system to accommodate
                                       anticipated growth. Today, this area is known as the Old Quad
                                       neighborhood.
                                       Early industries in the City included manufacturing, as well as
                                       seed and fruit packing. Leather tanning and wood products
                                       were two key industries of the City well into the 20th century.
                                       Similarly, seed growing, fruit farming and packing (especially
                                       pears, cherries, apricots and prunes) were mainstays, contributing
                                       to the City’s exports. The Santa Clara Railroad Depot, built in
                                       1863, became an important hub as exports increased. In addition
                                       to its growing industries and rail use, the City made historic
                                       headway in transit and transportation. The Alameda became
                                       the first interurban horse car line in the West, linking Santa Clara
                                       and San José. By 1888, the street had the first electric trolley
                                       line in California. The City also established its own municipal
                                       electric power utility in 1896; this entity endures today as
                                       Silicon Valley Power, a City department, providing Santa Clara
                                       residents and businesses with low-cost power and alternative
                                       energy resources.

                                                                                                       3
During the early evolution of Santa Clara into a prosperous
and innovative city, the City’s population remained relatively
small and stable, growing from around 3,500 in 1900 to 6,500 in
1940. During and after World War II, industry expanded and
the population doubled. It was not until the introduction of the
semiconductor, the related electronics industry and the defense
industry in the 1950s that the City’s population increased
dramatically by well over 600 percent in 20 years, to 86,000 by
1970. The growth of the technology sector quickly replaced the
City’s renowned orchards, changing the character of the City
into a modern, growing technological hub.
During this period of extensive growth, the City’s urbanized area
grew from approximately 3.1 square miles in 1953 to 8.0 in 1961
and to 14.9 in 1980, as shown in Figure 3.1-1. Much of the mid-
century expansion in the City was due to the construction of the
many single-family subdivisions found in the southern portion of
the City today. Industrial growth expanded significantly during
the following 20 years through 1980 as more electronics research
and manufacturing establishments located in Santa Clara. With
this expansion, the City began to regulate new development. The
City’s Planning Commission was established in 1949, followed
by the establishment of City departments for Engineering,
Utilities, Planning and Building. During this time, the City also
developed ample parks, along with recreation facilities, public
                                                                    The Santa Clara Railroad Depot was

promise of a new Downtown has not been realized. As a result,
a cornerstone of the City’s history and identity was eliminated.
The loss of agricultural land and the demolition of the historic
Downtown have had a lasting eﬀect on subsequent City
decisions to preserve the City’s identity and historic assets. In
1955, the City Council established the Historical and Landmarks
Commission to make recommendations to the City Council on
historic issues. In 1976, a decade after the initial Urban Renewal

                                           inventory. More recently, the City completed the Downtown Plan
                                           for a portion of the original Downtown, as a catalyst for future
                                           redevelopment and regeneration of Downtown Santa Clara.
                                           Historic preservation and City identity are key components of
                                           this General Plan. Despite the growth and transformation of the
                                           City, Santa Clara’s small-town origins have left an imprint on the
                                           community. The community values its historic resources and
                                           quality of life. This General Plan builds on these assets to ensure
                                           that the City’s evolution to 2035 preserves its core identity and
                                           character.
                                           Development through the 1970s represents today’s predominant
                                           pattern for most of the land area of the City, with low-density,

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                                 3.2     THE CITY TODAY
                                 3.2.1 Regional Location and Setting
                                 The City of Santa Clara is located at the center of the Santa Clara
                                 Valley, between the Santa Cruz Mountains to the southwest
                                 and the Diablo Range to the northeast. As shown on Figure
                                 3.2-1, Santa Clara is at the southern end of San Francisco Bay,
                                 approximately 40 miles south of San Francisco. Three seasonal
                                 creeks run through the City and empty into the southern portion
                                 of the Bay: the San Tomas Aquino, Saratoga and Calabazas
                                 Creeks. Additionally, the City is bordered by the Guadalupe
                                 River to the northeast.
Calabazas Creek runs through the
southern portion of the City.    The City is completely surrounded by neighboring jurisdictions:
                                 the City of San José to the north, east and south, and the cities of
                                 Sunnyvale and Cupertino to the west. Figure 3.2-2 illustrates the
                                 City’s 18.4 square-mile footprint within the subregional context
                                 of Santa Clara County. Due to its location on the valley floor,
                                 Santa Clara is well served by existing regional transportation and
                                 transit corridors, making it attractive to commercial interests.
                                 U.S. Highway 101 traverses east-west through the center of the
                                 City, while State Route 237 is located to the north and Interstates
                                 880 and 280 skirt the southeast and southwest corners of
                                 the City, respectively. Existing transit lines include Caltrain,
                                 Altamont Commuter Express (ACE), Capitol Corridor, Valley
                                 Transportation Authority (VTA) bus and light rail. Future transit
                                 plans include a new Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Station at
                                 the eastern border of the City. The Norman Y. Mineta San José
                                 International Airport provides air transportation services that
                                 link the region to the world.
                                 3.2.2 Existing Characteristics
                                 Santa Clara is centrally located in Santa Clara County, which
                                 has been one of the fastest-growing counties in the State. Santa
                                 Clara County’s population is estimated to have increased
                                 by approximately 11 percent between 2000 and 2010, while
                                 employment is estimated to have declined by ten percent during
                                 that same period. The County is home to numerous global high
                                 technology companies. The City of Santa Clara is located in
                                 the center of the County’s industrial core and is home to Intel,
                                 Applied Materials, Sun Microsystems/Oracle, Nvidia, National
                                 Semiconductor and other high technology companies. Mission

College, Santa Clara University and the UCSC Extension are also
located in the City. Santa Clara is adjacent to San José, the largest
city in the Bay Area, the airport and regional transportation
corridors. As a result, pressure is likely to continue for Santa
Clara to absorb a substantial share of the region’s growth.
Existing Development Pattern
As shown in Figure 3.2-3, the City’s 2009 land use pattern is
predominantly characterized by individual uses segregated into
distinct areas, including single-family neighborhoods, retail
commercial corridors and industrial/oﬃce employment centers.
These uses are largely separated by major transportation facilities
located in the City. South of the east-west Caltrain corridor are
much of the City’s residential developments, neighborhood-
serving retail uses, schools and parks. The central portion of the
City, north of the Caltrain corridor and south of U.S. 101, consists
predominately of light and heavy industrial uses, although some
of the area has transitioned into oﬃce/research and development
(R&D) and data centers. The northernmost portion of the City
has the most diverse mix of uses, including oﬃce/R&D, light
industrial and regional entertainment and sports uses, including
Great America theme park, the Santa Clara Convention Center,
and the San Francisco 49ers Training Facility. Commercial uses
and a new, higher-density residential neighborhood (known
as Rivermark) are located to the east. Recent development in
the City has been primarily focused in this northernmost area.

is comprised of mixed-use development. The remaining is
composed of public/quasi-public/institutional (11%), parks and
open space (6%), vacant land and other uses.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      The majority of single-family homes in the City are located south
                      of the Caltrain corridor in residential neighborhoods, with an
                      average density of eight units per acre. These neighborhoods
                      comprise a quarter of the land area of the City and are a
                      significant factor in the City’s character and identity. Residential
                      areas include historic neighborhoods, like the Old Quad, and
                      newer master-planned neighborhoods, like Rivermark. Higher-
                      density residential neighborhoods, with multifamily units, are
                      often located along arterial streets, transportation corridors or at
                      the edges of single-family neighborhoods.
                      Commercial
                      Commercial uses are located on ten percent of the City’s
                      developable land area and make up approximately 18 percent
                      of the total building space in the City. Commercial uses include
                      neighborhood uses, like grocery stores, personal services, small
                      oﬃces and banks, as well as tourist and entertainment uses and
                      professional or medical oﬃces.
                      Retail commercial uses and professional oﬃces are primarily
                      located along El Camino Real and Stevens Creek Boulevard. Uses
                      along El Camino Real include auto-oriented businesses, such as
                      auto repair, service stations and auto sales. Larger properties
                      along both El Camino Real and Stevens Creek Boulevard include
                      community and regional commercial retail uses. Additional
                      community and regional commercial uses are also located
                      north of U.S. 101, including the Rivermark retail center and the
                      Mercado Center. Neighborhood commercial uses are located in
                      pockets throughout the City.
                      Mixed Uses
                      Mixed uses make up less than one percent of the land uses
                      within the City. These developments integrate commercial and
                      residential uses, as well as specialized non-residential uses like
                      retail and oﬃce uses.

                      the large-scale, intense oﬃce uses; however, over 30 percent of
                      the City’s oﬃce and R&D space is located between the Caltrain
                      corridor and U.S. 101.

                      Approximately 18 percent of the City’s developable land area
                      is comprised of low intensity heavy and light industrial uses,
                      primarily located between the Caltrain corridor and U.S. 101.
                      Approximately 36 percent of this space is located north of U.S. 101.
                      The City’s heavy and light industrial businesses are characterized
                      by manufacturing, warehousing and wholesaling activities
                      as well as by low intensity one and two story development.
                      Over the past ten years, some of the light and heavy industrial
                      sites between the Caltrain/U.S. 101 corridors have transitioned
                      from these traditional uses to more intense oﬃce/research and
                      development uses, particularly on larger parcels located along
                      major transportation corridors.
                      Public/Quasi Public
                      Public/quasi public and institutional uses occupy approximately
                      11 percent of the developable land area in the City’s jurisdiction.
                      These uses include civic facilities, such as City Hall, police and
                      fire stations, electric substations and libraries, as well as public
                      and private educational institutions, such as Santa Clara Unified
                      School District facilities, Mission College and Santa Clara
                      University properties, places of assembly, religious institutions,
                      and medical facilities, such as Kaiser Permanente facilities. The
                      majority of public/quasi public uses are located south of U.S. 101
                      near residential neighborhoods.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      Demographics and Employment
                      With its employment and housing opportunities, Santa Clara
                      attracts a population that is diverse in ethnicity and age. The City
                      has a population of 115,500 residents1, representing 6.3 percent
                      of the total population in Santa Clara County. With a growth
                      rate of 12.8 percent since 2000, Santa Clara grew slightly more
                      than the County’s rate of 8.7 percent. The City’s population is
                      represented by 37 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 18 percent
                      Hispanic, two percent African American and four percent
                      other ethnicities; the remaining 40 percent of the population is
                      Caucasian. Racial distribution in the City is generally similar to
                      that of the County.
                      The median age of the population in the City was 34.9 years as
                      of 2008. The median age has increased since 2000, reflecting the
                      aging trend that is evident throughout the Bay Area and country
                      overall.2 Despite this aging trend, enrollment in the Santa Clara
                      Unified School District has increased slightly over the past
                      five years, predominantly as a result of the recent residential
                      development in the Rivermark area. New higher-density and
                      infill development anticipated by this General Plan will likely
                      result in smaller household sizes and a reduced rate of growth
                      for student enrollment. For the 2008-2009 school year, the
                      Santa Clara Unified School District had an enrollment of 14,252
                      students, representing 5.6 percent of the County’s total public
                      school enrollment.3
                      In 2008, 56,100 of the City’s 115,500 residents were employed,
                      representing 6.4 percent of the County’s overall labor force. The
                      City of Santa Clara has an estimated 106,700 jobs4, comprising
                      11.7 percent of total jobs in the County. The resulting 2008 ratio
                      of jobs to employed residents in the City is 1.90 to one as shown
                      on Table 5.2-2. The City is an employment hub and destination
                      within the region. Since only 30 percent of the City’s workers
                      reside within Santa Clara, the vast majority of workers (about 70
                      percent) commute from other cities.5

3.2.3 Growth Potential
Characteristics that will continue the pressure for growth
in Santa Clara are its relatively strong real estate market,
advantageous location, potential for redevelopment with
higher-intensity housing, retail and employment, and existing
and future opportunities for improved transit in addition to
an existing and easily accessible roadway network of freeways
and expressways. Through the ebb and flow of economic cycles
over the past few decades, commercial interest in Santa Clara
has remained relatively strong, due to location advantages
and positive economic conditions specific to the City. This is
expected to continue to the City’s advantage.
Real Estate Market
In 2008, the housing market experienced an economic downturn.
Over the term of this General Plan, it is anticipated that the City
and region’s projected employment and population growth from
2008-2035 (an employment increase of 50 percent in the County
and 45 percent in the City and a population increase of 34 percent
in the County and 26 percent in the City) will be realized. Job
growth will serve as a stimulus for future housing, although
the rate of development will be influenced by interest rates,
home prices, construction costs and the credit market. Future
residential development opportunities will also be constrained
by site availability and density ranges in the City.
Development Opportunities
While selected retail sectors, such as automobile sales, have
traditionally been economically strong in the City of Santa Clara,
these markets have slowed since the downturn in the economy
began in 2001. Even with retail outlets in the nearby cities of
San José, Mountain View, Los Gatos, Campbell, Milpitas and
Sunnyvale, there is the potential for expansion of eating and
drinking establishments, groceries (including specialized ethnic,
natural and other niche outlets), building material sales and major
anchors and sub-anchors not yet represented in the City of Santa
Clara. Opportunities for new retail to replace aged development
are primarily along the City’s major corridors like El Camino
Real and Stevens Creek Boulevard, as well as Homestead Road.
In particular, large sites with existing low-intensity or vacant
retail development provide key opportunities for intensification
and mixed-use development where a residential component will
help to ensure the market viability of new retail enterprises.
                                                                    Page 3-19

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      Opportunities also exist for intensification of the City’s industrial
                      and oﬃce/R&D uses. Current trends for development include
                      oﬃce/R&D uses in former light industrial areas with larger parcel
                      sizes and convenient transportation access. New employment
                      centers can be positioned to take advantage of existing and future
                      alternative transportation modes, particularly transit along
                      Tasman Drive, Great America Parkway and Bowers Avenue.
                      Existing and Future Transit
                      Current options in the City for alternative transportation modes,
                      other than the automobile, are relatively limited. They include
                      light rail along Tasman Drive in the northern part of the City,
                      and Caltrain stations at the east and west borders of the City.
                      An additional ACE/Amtrak station is located at Lafayette Street
                      and Tasman Drive. VTA bus service also operates in the City,
                      with a main hub at the Santa Clara Transit Center/Caltrain
                      Station near Santa Clara University. Future planned and
                      proposed transit opportunities include a BART extension, with
                      the Santa Clara station forming the South Bay terminus, and an
                      Automated People Mover connecting the Norman Y. Mineta San
                      José International Airport to the Santa Clara Transit Center and
                      future BART station. In addition, two bus rapid transit (BRT)
                      corridors are proposed by VTA in the City, one along El Camino
                      Real and the other along Stevens Creek Boulevard. Opportunities
                      to expand bus, BRT and shuttle services to traverse north-south
                      within the City could improve access to employment centers as
                      well as provide better connections to existing transit for Santa
                      Clara residents.

3.3     VISION FOR THE FUTURE AND PUBLIC
        PARTICIPATION
3.3.1 Public Participation
As the City’s primary tool to implement the vision for the physical
form of the community, the General Plan relies on the goals and
policies to carry out the community’s vision. During preparation
of this General Plan, opportunities were designed so that public
input was received directly from City residents, business and
property owners and other community members. The process
encouraged public feedback throughout the development of the
Plan.
Outreach to the community and decision-makers included a
variety of mechanisms:
    •   Community Workshops and Open Houses.             The first
        Community Workshop on Visioning and Issues was
        attended by over 100 persons. Held in June 2008, it set
        the stage for more focused workshops on Housing and
        the Environment in August 2008. Additional workshops
        were held in October 2008 and open houses on the
        Preferred Progressive Plan in April 2009 and on the Draft
        General Plan and EIR in mid-2010.
    •   City-wide Survey. In September 2008, a City-wide survey
        was sent to all City residents and businesses to gather
        input on major planning issues. The more than 1,600
        completed responses provided feedback on specific land
        use and urban design preferences that were subsequently
        incorporated into the Preferred Plan.

                                               City Council-appointed GPSC included representatives
                                               from a variety of community interests. This committee
                                               was responsible for providing input and making
                                               recommendations to staﬀ for the draft Plan. Members

                                       livability and vitality of the City, without sacrificing enjoyment
                                       of neighborhoods, are promoted. These goals and policies
                                       also take into account the City’s diverse cultural and economic
                                       interests and mobility, among other things, for current and
                                       future residents.
                                       Early outreach eﬀorts in the General Plan process focused on
                                       understanding community issues and establishing an overall
                                       vision for the City’s future. These eﬀorts were complemented by
                                       technical analysis of the regional and local context. This process
                                       helped to define land use, character and identity, as well as to
                                       shape the City’s response to regional expectations for population
                                       and employment growth.

Through an iterative public process, several common themes
representing community values emerged to define the City’s
vision:
     • Preserve the small-town feel, particularly by maintaining
        the character and quality of the City’s residential
        neighborhoods.
     • Add opportunities for mixed uses throughout the City in
        places with access to existing and future transit.
     • Revitalize and create a landmark Downtown.
     • Improve the visual and physical character of the City’s
        commercial corridors.
     • Enhance walkability and bicycle circulation throughout
        the City.
     • Reduce traﬃc          congestion   and    expand    public
        transportation.
     • Diversify industrial and business uses that support a
        future, intensified employment base.
     • Provide new neighborhood commercial centers.
     • Continue high quality public services and amenities,
        including open space and parks.
     • Encourage sustainability to protect energy, water supplies
        and air quality.
These themes serve as the basis for the General Plan Major
Strategies, which are described in Chapter 4. They also provide
the context for the General Plan policies as well as for the
population and job growth projections identified in Appendix
8.6.
Regional Expectations
The City of Santa Clara is not isolated from the region. It is
expected to accommodate its fair share of population and job
growth through the 2035 Plan horizon. Overall, the Association
of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects that the County
of Santa Clara will grow by 512,900 (27%) in population and
427,480 (46%) in new employment between 2010 and 2035. For
                                                                  Page 3-23

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      that same period, ABAG projects that the City of Santa Clara will
                      accommodate nearly six percent of this new population, resulting
                      in 28,300 new residents. According to ABAG, job growth in the
                      City is expected to grow just as quickly, matching that of the
                      County, with 48,690 new jobs (45% growth).
                      In addition to the City’s expected share of regional growth,
                      the City participates in several regional eﬀorts that support
                      sustainable growth. The City signed the U.S. Mayors Climate
                      Protection Agreement that calls for a 29 percent reduction in
                      greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. Additionally, the City is a
                      member of Sustainable Silicon Valley, a coalition of businesses,
                      governments and organizations working to reduce regional
                      carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by
                      2010 and 30 percent by 2020. To support regional goals, the City
                      has also adopted a policy to meet Leadership in Energy and
                      Environmental Design (LEED) silver standards for new public
                      buildings of over 5,000 square feet. Silicon Valley Power has also
                      established future goals for expanding its share of sustainable
                      resources beyond the current (as of 2008) 57 percent renewable
                      energy. Similarly, the City is a leader for water recycling and co-
                      ownership of the San José/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control
                      Plant and the South Bay Water Recycling Program.
                      The General Plan provides the framework in which new
                      development within the City will be able to accommodate the
                      City’s projected growth while addressing regional commitments
                      and objectives. The phased approach of the Progressive Plan
                      oﬀers a means to periodically plan and re-evaluate the City’s
                      direction, allowing opportunities for appropriate response to
                      regional trends as well as local demands at specified intervals
                      to ensure that the Plan continues to meet changing community
                      values.

Major Strategies
The seven Major Strategies, defined in the community planning
process in 2008, are presented in this Chapter. These provide
the foundation for decisions in the coming years by the City
Council, the City Planning Commission, other City commissions
and boards, and City staﬀ. These Strategies are the basis for
the goals and policies in the General Plan. In this context, each
Strategy is a focal point of community interest and, used together,
they create the foundation for civic priorities and a framework
to support decisions that will shape the future development and
growth of the City of Santa Clara. The Major Strategies should
be considered and applied in concert in order to reinforce the
purposes of this General Plan. Each Strategy is described below.
One or more is evident within each of the goals, policies and
implementation programs articulated in the General Plan,
providing the basis for City actions.

                                                 LIFE
                                        The City’s high quality of life is available to residents, workers and
                                        visitors. The Plan ensures that existing and new neighborhoods have
                                        access to a full complement of services, including parks, stores and
                                        other amenities for everyday living. New residential neighborhoods are
                                        focused at locations that do not impact existing neighborhoods, with
                                        an emphasis on access to existing and future transit. Comprehensive
                                        planning for new neighborhoods in the Future Focus Areas will address
                                        connections to employment centers, open space and neighborhood
                                        retail. Walkability is a key component. The General Plan encourages
                                        sidewalks and streetscape improvements, connections through large
                                        sites as they redevelop, urban design to facilitate pedestrian movement,
                                        safety and visibility and appropriate transitions between varying
                                        uses. Improved transit, bicycle and trail networks will also enhance
                                        connections throughout the City.
                                        The Santa Clara Community enjoys a high quality of life relative
                                        to many places in the region and the State due to factors such
                                        as geographic location, climate and availability of resources.
                                        Aﬀordable and high quality services and amenities, like utilities,
                                        parks, libraries, roads and public safety, are available for citizens
                                        everyday in Santa Clara. Over many years, decisions by civic
                                        leaders and actions by citizens and the business community,
                                        past and present, have created the conditions that define the
                                        attractiveness of this City. Looking into the future, City decisions
                                        and investments should protect and enhance those very benefits
                                        that reflect this high quality of life.
                                        City residents, workers and visitors have a wide variety of
                                        interests and not everyone takes advantage of all community
                                        assets. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of life should,
                                        however, be applied with all interests in mind. This Major
                                        Strategy promotes:
                                             High quality, aﬀordable City services and utilities;
Santa Clara’s high quality of life is        Broad variety of cultural and recreational facilities and
defined by opportunities for recreation          amenities;
and open space, as well as by well-

and strong employment core.
                                                 education partnerships;
Maintaining and building upon these
elements will continue the City’s high       Convenient and comprehensive retail services;
quality of life for future residents.

                                                                           4
     Safe, eﬀective and convenient access and mobility around
        the City.
The ability to maintain and enhance these amenities will rely
upon eﬃcient and prudent use of City revenues, partnerships
with school districts and other local agencies, and good choices in
development opportunities over time. Land use decision-making
will need to ensure that projects, most of which will replace
existing older uses, contribute both economically and socially to
the community in return for the benefits that will be enjoyed by
becoming a part of Santa Clara. Santa Clara has been successful
since its incorporation in 1852 by not only preserving the important
resources of its past, but also by embracing the future through
new urban development that enriches the City’s social fabric.
4.2     PRESERVE AND CULTIVATE NEIGHBOR-
        HOODS
For Santa Clara residents, a sense of community and neighborhood
identity is an important aspect of City life. Each neighborhood has its
own distinctive character and sense of community. This strategy seeks
to preserve and enhance these community assets. The Plan ensures that
new development fits into each neighborhood’s scale and context through
careful transition policies for scale, height and use. This ensures that
neighborhood cohesiveness is preserved, particularly within single family
residential neighborhoods where change is an issue.
The Santa Clara community places high value on its residential
neighborhoods. Many of these neighborhoods are well-established
and comprised of single family homes with particular styles,
streetscapes and ample trees that define neighborhood character.
Infill development, higher density housing and commercial uses
have all developed within and adjacent to these established
neighborhoods. Updating neighborhood infrastructure, street
design and amenities are supported by this Major Strategy as
a means to continue neighborhood vitality. The General Plan
recognizes the importance and value of the City’s neighborhoods
and promotes opportunities for improvements as an important
part of cultivating neighborhood character. In addition, the
Plan promotes preservation through goals and policies for
neighborhood integrity that address the scale, density and design
of new development adjacent to existing homes. In concert,
the Plan incorporates complementary measures to address the
preservation and cultivation of the City’s existing and future
neighborhoods.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      4.3      PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY
                      The Plan focuses on conservation of resources and reduction of impacts
                      to the local and regional environment. Policies encourage sustainability
                      measures for both new and existing development, ranging from those
                      that help reduce water and energy consumption to those that promote
                      redevelopment of infill sites as a healthy, cost-eﬀective way to improve
                      the local environment. Sustainable land use and design policies
                      emphasize environmentally responsible construction techniques and
                      conservation of energy and water. Additionally, prerequisites for new
                      development include adequate infrastructure, alternate transportation
                      options and public facilities to ensure consistent services to support the
                      growth of the City.
                      Sustainability pervades all aspects of development in a City,
                      from the type, location and intensity of land uses to actual
                      materials for building and landscaping. All of these components
                      have a direct eﬀect on the local and regional environment. By
                      implementing sustainable measures and policies, Santa Clara
                      can reduce its contribution to global climate change, minimize
                      reliance on oil and other fossil-fuels and decrease consumption
                      of natural resources.
                      Santa Clara has been a leader in sustainable development
                      for more than 40 years, and the City’s residents want to see
                      these eﬀorts continue as the City moves forward. The City
                      has collaborated on regional eﬀorts to reduce greenhouse gas
                      emissions, to conserve water and energy resources, to recycle
                      both waste and wastewater and to expand transit-oriented and
                      sustainable development opportunities.
                      The General Plan broadens the City’s participation in
                      sustainability eﬀorts by responsible development through
                      promoting the application of goals and policies to eﬃciently
                      use the City’s resources. Taking into account the City’s existing
                      development pattern, the planned intensification of uses in
                      specific locations will ensure a more eﬃcient use of land and
                      support expanded transit options, partially for new residents.
                      Opportunities for access to sustainable resource, like alternative
                      energy, local and organic food and recycled water, will also
                      provide a means for the City’s residents and businesses to take
                      an active role in ensuring Santa Clara’s sustainable future.

                                                                             4
4.4      ENHANCE CITY IDENTITY
The Plan includes policies to improve the identity and visual character
of the City, emphasizing urban design to shape the character and
appearance of major corridors and Focus Areas. Streetscape design
policies will also help to guide development in order to enhance the
pedestrian experience. New centers of neighborhood-oriented activity
in strategic locations will serve as gathering places, for both current and
new residents, while a regenerated Downtown will further define the
City’s identity as a destination. The General Plan includes standards
for transitions between existing and new development as well as for
urban design concepts along corridors such as El Camino Real and
Stevens Creek Boulevard.
City identity is an important aspect of community living. It is
expressed through the street design, architecture, landscaping
and signage. The resulting visual composite plays a significant
role in the sense of place. The design and character of key
gateways, destinations and corridors provide opportunities
for establishing a strong City identity for visitors and residents
alike.
While Santa Clara is also known as the Mission City, there are a
wide variety of architectural styles represented across the City.
Much of Santa Clara was developed during the rapid growth
period following World War II, with little attention to the Mission
style. Much of the commercial property was developed in the 1950s
and 1960s and is now suitable for renovation or redevelopment
to serve today’s community needs. The General Plan identifies
Focus Areas to support changes in land use and enhance
community identity. These areas constitute the greatest potential
for establishing vibrant, attractive destinations in the City.
From improving the quality of retail development and creating
new centers of activity along El Camino Real, to establishing a
new Downtown and future mixed-use neighborhoods in the
northern half of the City, the General Plan oﬀers a new vision for
the City that preserves existing, vital residential neighborhoods.
In order to better define these opportunities, goals and policies
for the Focus Areas are highlighted in a separate section of the
Plan that provides more detail for future land use and design.
                                                                            Page 4-5

                                          The Plan identifies Focus Areas throughout the City to support and
                                          foster the City’s diverse economic and cultural base. It encourages
                                          improvements to the design and quality of development along El
                                          Camino Real and Stevens Creek Boulevard with a greater mix of land
                                          uses at activity centers, in conjunction with improved commercial and
                                          streetscape design. Santa Clara’s Downtown will also be regenerated,
                                          creating a new center of activity that will serve as a City-wide draw
                                          for shopping, eating and entertainment. New nuclei of employment
                                          activity, particularly along corridors like San Tomas Expressway and
                                          Bowers Avenue, expand overall local and regional accessibility to jobs
                                          with an emphasis on transit accessibility. The Plan builds upon the
                                          City’s strong industrial base, ensuring that key employment areas are
                                          protected and flexibility is retained to promote growth and change over
                                          time.
                                          Providing a strong foundation for economic growth requires
                                          both an investment in the City’s infrastructure, as well as a
                                          well-defined land use strategy to capitalize on local assets. An
                                          attractive physical setting can encourage investment, help retain
                                          existing businesses, and support new businesses that provide
                                          the services and goods desired by residents and visitors. The
                                          City of Santa Clara’s existing infrastructure, location in the heart
                                          of Silicon Valley and access to major transportation corridors all
                                          support future economic prosperity in the City. In addition, the
                                          City’s employment areas north of the Caltrain corridor foster
                                          inter-business relationships and expansion with minimal land
                                          use conflicts. Beyond the focus on enhancing the successful
                                          employment core, the Plan designates Focus Areas for mixed-

                                          cultural amenities. These include redefining El Camino Real as
                                          a pedestrian-oriented corridor, including a diverse array of uses,

4.6     MAINTAIN THE CITY’S FISCAL HEALTH
        AND QUALITY SERVICES
The Plan encourages a mix of uses to ensure that suﬃcient revenues
are garnered to cover the cost of service needs. It is phased to enable
growth that respects existing development while providing new revenue
sources. The Plan includes an opportunity to evaluate the City’s fiscal
health between the Phases as a means to provide appropriate planning
and financing of new infrastructure and services to support future
development.
As new development occurs, it is essential to balance growth
with service and infrastructure requirements. New growth
will strengthen and diversify the City’s tax base. It will also
place demands on infrastructure and essential services. Not
only is a mix of uses important for the City’s fiscal health, the
timing and coordination of development with the provision of
infrastructure and services are also important. Santa Clara’s
strong economic base is indicative that the City has eﬀectively
balanced its growth. To continue to maintain the City’s fiscal
health, the progressive approach for the General Plan provides
the framework for measured growth to ensure adequate
services and infrastructure. The need for maintenance and
replacement of utility and roadway infrastructure serving
existing neighborhoods will be a significant challenge without
new revenue sources. Retaining the City’s diverse employment
base and building on taxable sales through new commercial
development will balance the demand for services associated
with new residential development and with the maintenance
required for existing neighborhoods. The Plan also incorporates
an opportunity to evaluate its fiscal resources and costs at each
phase of the Plan in order to maintain the City’s fiscal health and
quality services.
                                                                        Page 4-7

                      The Plan oﬀers a proactive approach for public safety, crime reduction,
                      sensitivity to hazards and noise and air quality, as well as access to
                      open space and public services. Urban design and transportation
                      policies also emphasize public safety through improved visibility,
                      pedestrian-oriented building design, lighting and infrastructure in
                      order to promote for safe walking, bicycling and driving.
                      Creating successful, attractive business and living environments
                      is directly related to the health and safety benefits that cover a
                      wide range of issues from police services and crime prevention
                      to protection from hazards like floods and earthquakes. A
                      healthy, safe community also requires facilities and land uses
                      to support healthy choices such as recreation, medical services
                      and access to locally-grown food. While Santa Clara is located
                      in an ideal climate for recreation and outdoor activity, the City is
                      also located within an area subject to floods and seismic activity.
                      The City is susceptible to potential health and safety concerns
                      related to hazardous waste and airport-related noise, as well as
                      to poor air quality. To support this Major Strategy, the General
                      Plan employs a combination of goals and policies to promote
                      safe construction practices and to encourage land use patterns
                      that reduce the potential negative eﬀects of development.

5.1     PREREQUISITES
The phasing of development as proposed in the General
Plan, is predicated on the provision of adequate services and
infrastructure. Phasing provides the foundation for continued
re-evaluation of the development and service goals of the General
Plan, as well as the City’s fiscal health and ability to support
development anticipated by the Plan. Prerequisites for land use
and development, therefore, provide the opportunity to monitor
the City’s progress at regular intervals, determine whether
development proposals in any given phase or area are suitable
for support, and confirm that the necessary infrastructure is in
place or will be implemented with the development.
Prerequisite Goals support the Major Strategies and generally
recognize the importance of planning from the “big picture”
perspective. They are intended to take into account the
availability of public resources and infrastructure in order to
enable the development identified in each phase of the Plan in the
long-term, and not overburden existing community resources,
such as schools, parks and utilities, in the short-term. At the
time each phase comes into focus, changes in economic, social,
legal and environmental conditions may warrant corresponding
changes to policies or land use classifications. Phasing, and
the associated prerequisites, helps to coordinate the timing of
development as well as to sustain environmental quality. Land
use and transportation choices will become more and more
diﬃcult as the City continues to grow. For example, options
for widening streets and intersections to accommodate growth
is already constrained under current conditions, necessitating
the need for maximizing opportunities for new tenants to use
transit and alternative transportation modes, while minimizing
impacts on existing residents and neighborhoods. As a result,
prerequisite goals and policies, in conjunction with the phasing
of the General Plan, are the foundation for achieving the City’s
Major Strategies.
The Prerequisite Goals and Policies are described below for
all three phases of the Plan. They identify fundamental steps,
or milestones, that must be completed prior to moving on to
that phase of the Plan. Not only must the goal or objective be
accomplished, but the year of the subsequent phase must also
be reached. Each goal denotes an objective, with the policies
indicating the steps that need to be taken to achieve those goals.
                                                                   Page 5-3

         GENERAL PLAN
                      For example, if the goal is to ensure that the City is fiscally stable,
                      then a corresponding policy would require a fiscal study prior to
                      each phase and prior to development under that phase. Some of
                      the prerequisites may require future General Plan amendments,
                      or adjustments to allowed growth, to ensure that the City
                      continues to meet the infrastructure and service requirements
                      of new development. Some Goals and Policies are specific to a
                      particular year or phase, while others apply to all phases. Each
                      of the policies must be followed to graduate to the next phase.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.1.1-P25      Prior to the implementation of Phase II, the City will
                                     include a community Risk Reduction Plan (“CRRP”)

                      5.2      LAND USE DIAGRAM
                      Land use patterns represent the living, working and visiting
                      experience in any place. In a built-out city like Santa Clara, the
                      focus must be on managing changes so that the Plan continues to
                      achieve the vision described in the General Plan Major Strategies.
                      The Land Use Diagrams presented in this Section are a graphic
                      representation of the physical framework for these changes in order
                      to foster an improved quality of life for residents and workers, and
                      to increase commercial vitality, particularly along El Camino Real
                      and Stevens Creek Boulevard, and in Downtown.
                      This Section includes the City’s Land Use Diagrams for all three
                      phases of the General Plan and the land use classifications, standards
                      and assumptions for development. The Goals and Policies at the end
                      of this Section provide direction for decisions related to all land uses,
                      as well as for those related to specific land use designations. Goals
                      and Policies related to specific areas are provided in Section 5.4:
                      Focus Area Goals and Policies. A matrix showing the relationship
                      between the 1992 General Plan classifications and those in this
                      General Plan is also provided in Appendix 8.3 for reference.
                      5.2.1 Effects of Land Use Changes and Projected
                               Development
                      Development Potential and Assumptions
                      The projected development potential associated with the General
                      Plan is summarized in Table 5.2-1. It represents the level of
                      development that can be expected through the General Plan
                      horizon, using assumed average densities and intensities applied to
                      vacant land and sites with redevelopment/intensification potential,
                      identified as “Areas of Potential Development“ on Figure 2.1-1.
                      Details for these assumptions and “Areas of Potential Development
                      ” by General Plan phase are provided in Appendix 8.6: General
                      Plan Land Use Assumptions.

Designation of a site does not necessarily mean that the use or
development on the property will change. Not all properties may
develop within the General Plan horizon. General Plan projections
quantify the best estimate of the potential eﬀects of the Plan based
on a combination of reasonable development assumptions. Table
5.2-1 summarizes the development that could occur in the City by
2035 based on:
    A. Existing Development (2008). This represents existing
        development on the ground as of the beginning of 2009. It
        includes 44,166 housing units and over 58 million square
        feet of non-residential building space.
    B. Net New Proposed Development (2008-2010). This includes
        the projects approved, on file or under construction, that are
        expected to be implemented before 2010. It includes 2,957
        housing units and approximately 940,000 square feet of non-
        residential development.
    C. Net New Proposed Development (2010-2015). This column
        indicates projects on file or approved as of 2009, but not
        expected to be under construction until after January 1, 2010.
        It includes over nine million square feet of non-residential
        development.
    D. Net New Projected General Plan Development (2010-2035).
        This represents the total expected development for all three
        phases of the General Plan. Existing development lost due to
        anticipated redevelopment was subtracted from gross new
        development, resulting in a net increase of approximately
        13,200 new housing units and 13.5 million square feet of
        non-residential building space between 2010 and 2035.
    E. Net New Proposed + Projected General Plan Development
        (2008-2035). This column summarizes the total potential
        development for both proposed (approved, on file or under
        construction) development and projected General Plan
        development between 2010 and 2035. The estimated increase
        from 2008 is approximately 16,200 housing units and 23.5
        million square feet of non-residential building space.
    F. City at 2035. Adding existing (A) to the total new proposed +
        projected General Plan development (E) provides an overall
        picture of the City in 2035 (F). At build-out of this General
        Plan, the City is expected to have approximately 60,300
        housing units and 82.3 million square feet of non-residential
        building space.

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                       5
Jobs/Housing Balance
A city’s jobs and housing balance is reflected in the ratio of jobs
to employed residents (not necessarily employed within Santa
Clara). It is an indicator of fiscal, social and environmental
health. This ratio shows whether a jurisdiction has a surplus
or deficit of jobs relative to its population and housing supply,
defined as greater or less than 1.0 job for every employed
resident. Evaluation of data from the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) shows that the City of Santa Clara had an
estimated 1.90 jobs for every employed resident in 2008; this is
one of the highest ratios of jobs to employed residents compared
to other cities in Santa Clara County (see Table 5.2-2). County-
wide, the estimated ratio was 1.05 in 2008.1 Santa Clara’s jobs to
employed residents ratio indicates that the City is “job-rich”, but
the figure has decreased slightly over the past decade (from 2.22
in 2000), reflecting regional loss of jobs and regional increases in
housing between 2000 and 2007.
The General Plan anticipates a slight decrease in Santa Clara’s
jobs to employed residents ratio by 2035 as a result of the
potential for new housing north of the Caltrain corridor after
2025. General Plan estimates indicate a potential addition of
approximately 47,500 jobs, resulting in almost 154,000 total jobs
by 2035, and 86,800 employed residents, resulting in a projected
job to employed residents’ ratio of 1.77. Although this ratio would
likely still be higher than other cities in the region, the General
Plan incorporates an increased emphasis on housing from the
prior General Plan and focuses on housing near employment.
Moreover, as Future Focus Areas, which are dominated by
residential uses, are built to their full potential beyond the Plan
horizon, the overall jobs to employed residents ratio is expected
to further decrease.
Fiscal Implications of Land Use
As illustrated by the “Areas of Potential Development” on
Figure 2.1-1, significant change in the City’s character, land use
and development intensity are not anticipated over the next 25
years. The fiscal impacts of any new growth, however, do have
City-wide implications. Fiscal sustainability of new growth, as
well as the City’s role in supporting innovation and expansion
of existing and new businesses, helps determine the feasibility

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      of providing services and infrastructure for development. Since
                      the General Plan Land Use Goals and Policies support housing,
                      businesses and industries that capitalize on, and provide
                      revenues to support existing infrastructure and services, the
                      City’s fiscal health should continue with the implementation of
                      the Plan.
                      Revenues and Expenditures
                      Revenues and expenditures diﬀer between land uses. Santa Clara
                      finances its ongoing costs for public services through the General
                      Fund. General Fund revenue comes from residents, visitors and
                      businesses, predominately through sales taxes and property
                      taxes, with supplemental revenues from transient occupancy
                      taxes and transfers from City enterprise funds (such as City
                      utility services). Aging infrastructure, constructed years ago
                      with new development at that time, will need repair, upgrades
                      and replacement in the near future. New development helps to
                      provide revenues to address these current infrastructure needs.
                      Santa Clara finances its costs for capital improvements through
                      its Capital Improvement Program using a variety of revenue
                      sources, including enterprise funds associated with the City’s
                      utilities, streets and highway funds (such as gas taxes), bonds,
                      service charges and redevelopment tax increment funds. These
                      capital resources are predominately associated with non-
                      residential uses and pay for most of the City’s infrastructure
                      requirements.
                      Commercial uses, like hotel and retail development, make a
                      positive impact on the City’s revenues, based on transient-
                      occupancy and sales tax revenues, respectively. Oﬃce and
                      industrial uses make a significant contribution to property tax
                      and sales tax revenues. While housing contributes proportionally
                      less on an annual basis to property tax revenues, residential uses
                      typically contribute a greater proportion of one-time fees toward
                      capital improvements and facilities, as well as toward school
                      facilities and operations. These one-time fees, as well as new
                      development requirements, provide quality of life improvements
                      such as street modifications, traﬃc signals, new parks and public
                      art. Because services are primarily targeted for City residents,
                      expenditures for residential uses typically exceed revenues. As
                      a “job-rich” community, City of Santa Clara revenues per capita
                      are relatively good when compared to other full-service cities in
                      Santa Clara County as illustrated in Table 5.2-2.

Future Fiscal Effects
It is important to consider the fiscal implications of new growth.
Opportunities for expanding or generating new revenue sources
are limited. In addition, the location and type of development
aﬀects the cost for both services and infrastructure. For the City
of Santa Clara, intensification of development promoted by the
General Plan will maximize the use of existing infrastructure
and the provision of services. While growth may increase
the demand for resources, such as water and sewer capacity,
even with the implementation of “green initiatives,” higher
densities cost less per unit for public infrastructure construction
and maintenance when compared to the lower density,
suburban-style development that has been built over the past
several decades. In addition, the revenues derived from new
development help to support the ongoing maintenance of older
infrastructure in existing neighborhoods, as well as to pay for
the new development’s infrastructure needs.
The requirements associated with the prerequisites for each of
the Plan phases further ensure adequate resources and services.
Cost and revenue projections for 2035 indicate that new growth
can be fiscally accommodated if the 2008 relationships between
specific land use types and revenues are sustained. Maintaining
the solid and stable industrial and commercial economic base, as
supported by this General Plan, as well as a positive jobs/housing
balance overall, is the best means to ensure that resources are
suﬃcient to provide acceptable City services, infrastructure and
public facilities.

                                            5.2.2 Land Use Classifications and Diagram
                                            The General Plan has two components that, in combination with
                                            the Goals and Policies, define the requirements for development
                                            for the City: (1) the Land Use classifications, which are described
                                            in this Section; and (2) the Land Use Diagrams. The land use
                                            classifications defined here apply to all phases of the General
                                            Plan. Implementation of later phases may, however, warrant
                                            changes in the allowances and limitations depending on the
                                            conditions and needs present at that time, subject to appropriate
                                            environmental review.
                                            The land use classifications in this General Plan have been
                                            structured so that each designation “nests” within the
                                            designations in the prior General Plan. A table is provided
                                            in Appendix 8.3 to illustrate this correlation and to serve as a
                                            reference for property owners and developers to translate the
                                            land use designations from the 1992 General Plan designations
                                            into the 2010-2035 General Plan.
                                            Land Use Classifications
                                            The General Plan defines the land use classifications applied to
                                            every parcel in the City. Each land use classification includes the
                                            allowed uses and the associated density and intensity standards.
                                            Typical categories are residential; commercial, including local-
                                            serving oﬃces and retail; industrial, including oﬃce/research and
                                            development; and public, including parks and institutional uses.
                                            Mixed uses and special categories, such as the Downtown Core
                                            designation, are combinations of these categories. Appendix 8.2:
                                            Definitions and Acronyms, provides additional detail regarding
                                            uses that are allowed in a specific land use classification.
                            FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR)
               FAR expresses the ratio of building square footage to
               land square footage. For example, a FAR limit of 1.5
               means that for every square foot of land area, up to
               one and a half square feet of building space may be
               built. The FAR illustration shows two different ways
               that a building could be constructed in order to meet
               the FAR requirement. (Note that this illustration does
               not account for additional policy and development
               constraints that would also apply to the property.)

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                        5
Both density and intensity are calculated on gross land area.
“Densities” are specified as a range of housing units per
gross acre, with required minimum and maximum limits, in
residential and mixed-use classifications. For non-residential
and mixed-use classifications, “intensity” is measured as floor
area ratio (FAR). FAR is a broad measure of building mass that
also controls building height. It is calculated as the ratio of total
building square footage, excluding any building area devoted
to parking, to the gross square footage of the site. The text box
and illustration provides additional detail for FAR. Residential
density and non-residential land use intensity are measured
independently, but can be considered together in evaluating
individual land use proposals, such as those for mixed use
developments. Density and intensity bonuses, such as those for
aﬀordable housing in accordance with State law, are in addition
to the maximum densities and intensities permitted. Criteria
for density and intensity bonuses are provided in Section 5.5.1:
Discretionary Use Goals and Polices.
The standards for land use classifications establish the range
for density and intensity, but do not guarantee development
approval at the maximum density or intensity specified for each
classification. Site conditions may reduce development potential
to less than the stated maximum. In addition, the application
of General Plan policies may also result in consideration of an
increase in that potential. In the event of diﬀerences between
policies and the land use classifications illustrated on the Land
Use Diagrams, the policies take precedence. For example,
development on properties within Focus Areas, defined in
Section 5.4, and for historic properties, defined in Section 5.5,
is governed first by the policies in those Sections. Finally,
the Discretionary Use and Transition Policies provide more
development options and constraints in order to address
neighborhood compatibility.
The land use classifications, illustrated on the Land Use
Diagrams, are defined below.
Residential
Very Low Density Residential
This classification is intended for residential densities of up
to ten units per gross acre. Development is typically single-
family in scale and character, with a prevailing building type
of single-family detached dwelling units. Development in
this classification maintains a feeling of suburban living with

                                       This classification is intended for residential densities of 8 to 18
                                       units per gross acre. Building types may include detached or
                                       attached dwelling units. Low Density Residential development
                                       comes in the form of single-family dwelling units, townhomes,
                                       rowhouses and combinations of these development types.
                                       Medium Density Residential
                                       This classification is intended for residential development at
                                       densities ranging from 19 to 36 units per gross acre. This density
                                       range accommodates a variety of housing types. It is primarily
                                       intended for areas with access from collector or arterial streets
                                       or in close proximity to neighborhood centers and mixed
                                       uses. Building types can include a combination of low-rise
                                       apartments, townhouses and rowhouses with garage or below-

Mixed Use
Neighborhood Mixed Use
This classification combines the Neighborhood Commercial
and Medium Density Residential designations and is intended
for pedestrian-oriented development, with a focus on ground-
level neighborhood-serving retail along street frontages and
residential development on upper floors. A minimum 0.10 FAR
is required for neighborhood-serving retail, service commercial
and/or local oﬃce uses. Auto-oriented uses are not appropriate
in this designation. For sites less than one acre, a minimum
density of ten units per acre is required, and for sites larger than
one acre, a minimum residential density of 19 units per acre is
required, in addition to the minimum commercial FAR. The
maximum number of units per acre is 36.
Community Mixed Use
This classification is a combination of the Community Comm-
ercial and Medium Density Residential designations and is
intended to encourage a mix of residential and commercial uses
along major streets. Auto-oriented uses are not appropriate in
this designation, except under certain circumstances within the
El Camino Real Focus Area. Parking should be behind buildings,
below-grade or in structures, to ensure that active uses face
public streets. Retail, commercial and neighborhood oﬃce uses,        Community Mixed Uses inted to serve
at a minimum FAR of 0.10, are required in conjunction with            larger retail establishments (Belmont,

5.3.1-P6       Allow planned development only if it is consistent
               with General Plan land use density and intensity
               requirements and provides a means to address
               unique situations to achieve high community
               design standards that would otherwise not be
               feasible.
5.3.1-P7       Work with State and regional agencies to ensure
               that their plans and projects are consistent with the
               City’s General Plan.

5.3.4 Mixed Use Land Use Goals and Policies
Mixed-use development in the City includes a range of intensities
and uses, from Neighborhood Mixed Use and Community
Mixed Use with medium-density residential development to
Regional Mixed Use with higher overall allowed development
for both commercial and residential uses. The Land Use Diagram
identifies locations for mixed-use development throughout the
City.
Mixed-use development serves a specific function in the City and
is designated along major transportation corridors, near existing
and future residential neighborhoods. Mixed uses emphasize
access to transit with an active ground floor, neighborhood-
serving retail uses and parking located in the rear or below-
grade. Civic spaces, such as small plazas or gathering areas,
provide a focus for pedestrian activity. Figure 5.3-2 illustrates
these concepts. Mixed-use developments should have an
identifiable palette of streetscape amenities and buildings close
to public sidewalks for pedestrian access and safety, as shown in
Figure 5.3-3.
Goals and Policies related to mixed-use development are listed
below. Additional policies, unique to the City’s Focus Areas
are described in Section 5.4, including specific policies for El
Camino Real and Downtown. Policies defined in the Mobility
and Transportation section, related to transit and pedestrian
accessibility, also apply.                                          Promoting pedestrian activity through

5.3.5 Office and Industrial Land Use Goals and
        Policies
Industrial development in the City is primarily located in the
areas north of the Caltrain corridor. While the majority of the
City’s industrial areas identified in Phase I of the General Plan
will remain, some areas will transition into new residential
neighborhoods. These are identified as Future Focus Areas in
Section 5.4: Focus Areas.
Office and Industrial Land Use Goals
5.3.5-G1       A City that continues to be a major employment
               center in Silicon Valley.
5.3.5-G2       Suﬃcient industrial land that meets the demand for
               local employment and retains the City’s economic
               base.
5.3.5-G3       Higher-intensity employment centers located near
               major transit services and major transportation
               corridors to reduce vehicle miles traveled.
5.3.5-G4       Heavy and Light Industrial areas that reduce
               exposure to hazardous materials by precluding
               sensitive receptors and places of assembly.
Office and Industrial Land Use Policies
5.3.5-P1       Work with existing Santa Clara businesses to
               retain and expand employment opportunities and
               strengthen the existing tax base.
5.3.5-P2       Encourage existing businesses that may be displaced
               by new development to relocate within Santa Clara.
5.3.5-P3       Encourage industrial development to participate in
               the identification and funding of 25 acres for park
               and recreational facilities to serve employment
               centers north of the Caltrain railroad tracks.
5.3.5-P4       Allow Oﬃce/Research and Development uses
               existing as of January 1, 2010, to conform to the
               General Plan intensity provisions of either the Low
               Intensity classification or High Intensity Oﬃce/
               Research and Development classification, regardless
               of the designation of the property.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.4     FOCUS AREAS
                      Focus Areas are an important component of the General Plan.
                      The goals, policies and illustrations for these areas provide
                      guidance for development. Focus Areas have the potential to
                      significantly define the City’s identity. These areas include major
                      corridors and destinations, new centers of activity around transit
                      stations, and new residential neighborhoods. Because of their
                      integral location, changes in these areas oﬀer an opportunity
                      to implement the General Plan Major Strategies to enhance the
                      City’s quality of life and foster economic vitality. Focus Area
                      design and land use policies are in addition to the City-wide
                      land use policies included in Section 5.2: Land Use.
                      The General Plan has nine Focus Areas, listed below. These
                      include four Focus Areas south of the Caltrain corridor and five
                      Future Focus Areas north of the Caltrain corridor, as shown in
                      Figure 5.4-1. Focus Areas represent locations with opportunities
                      for more intense development with limited impact on existing
                      neighborhoods. Future Focus Areas are only identified for
                      Phases II and III of the Plan and require conformance with the
                      applicable Prerequisite Policies in Section 5.1: Prerequisites,
                      including approval of a comprehensive plan for each area, prior
                      to implementation.

           GENERAL PLAN
                                     The following sections provide descriptions, including the
                                     associated goals and policies, of each of the four, near-term
                                     Focus Areas, along with existing conditions, proposed land uses
                                     and priorities for alternate transportation modes. Future Focus
                                     Areas are discussed in general terms, with goals and policies to
                                     guide future planning in these areas.
                                     5.4.1 El Camino Real Focus Area Goals and Policies
                                     The El Camino Real Focus Area is the City’s most visible and
                                     identifiable commercial corridor. As a primary east-west route
                                     and State highway, it is central to, and provides commercial
                                     services for, many of the City’s residential neighborhoods.
                                     Because most properties were developed in the 1950-60s and
                                     are presently underutilized, this corridor provides a unique

                                     Development along El Camino Real is currently comprised of a
                                     mix of small-scale auto-oriented commercial uses and services
                                     and mid- to large-scale strip mall developments. A wide, high-

                                     The General Plan vision for El Camino Real is to transform this
                                     Focus Area from a series of automobile-oriented strip-malls to
                                     a tree-lined, pedestrian- and transit-oriented corridor with a
                                     mix of residential and retail uses. Larger properties, designated
                                     as Regional Mixed Use and located at key intersections, will
                                     provide the primary catalyst for this transformation. These
                                     properties provide opportunities for commercial and transit
                                     destinations, with an emphasis on mixed-use and higher-
                                     intensity development. Pedestrian-oriented retail at these
                                     locations can provide services for surrounding neighborhoods.
                                     Higher-density residential at appropriate locations and enhanced
                                     streetscape design will encourage pedestrian movement and
                                     transit use. Pedestrian pathways will foster walkability and
                                     improve access to transit, stores, restaurants and neighborhood
                                     schools. Connections to surrounding neighborhoods will also
                                     encourage neighborhood activities.

The Regional Mixed Use designation should be developed with
a minimum 0.15 FAR for commercial uses. Overall development
heights would typically be between three and five stories.
Transition Goals and Policies in Section 5.5.2, in conjunction
with the El Camino Real Focus Area Policies, require that
this development respect the scale and character of adjacent
residential uses to promote neighborhood compatibility. Design
elements, like wide sidewalks, special paving materials and
signature landscaping, will help define these areas as pedestrian-
and transit-friendly. The plan on Figure 5.4-2 illustrates these
concepts.
The predominate designation on properties located between
the larger Regional Mixed Use designated properties, is
Community Mixed Use. Within the El Camino Real Focus Area,
this designation may be implemented consistent with either
Community Commercial, or Medium Density Residential,
or a combination of both. Future development in these areas
would be characterized by lower-intensity mixed-, or single-use,
development with signature landscaping, streetscape design,
signage and public art, to contribute to the area’s identity of this
Focus Area. Building design and scale should represent the
City’s historic character, with two- and three-story structures and
special attention to articulation and proportion. The area can
serve as a gateway into the City and help define a boundary for
the City’s historic core. Pedestrian connections to the Downtown
and Old Quad should be emphasized. Again, General Plan
Transition Goals and Policies would apply throughout the El
Camino Real Focus Area.
Transit, including a Bus Rapid Transit or similar facility, is
envisioned along the entire corridor and would take priority
over single occupancy vehicles. Within Regional Mixed Use            Commercial development along
                                                                     El Camino Real can provide
developments, transit, bicycle and pedestrian circulation would

have priority. To support this emphasis, intersections in the El     services.
Camino Real Focus Area may be exempted from the City-wide
LOS standard for vehicles on a case-by-case basis until the City
completes the prerequisite for an alternate Level of Service under
Policies 5.1.1-P12, P13, and P14. This corridor should emphasize
levels of service for pedestrian and transit circulation rather than
single-occupancy vehicles.

The Downtown Focus Area oﬀers opportunities for place-
making and for a unique destination in the City to serve both
local and regional interests. Revitalization will support the
Major Strategies for City identity and community vitality.
Connecting streets and increasing access to transit will attract
residents and visitors. This vision for Santa Clara’s Downtown
also includes approximately 130,000 square feet of retail and
commercial uses along with almost 400 new residences on the
approximately seven-acre site designated as Downtown Core
on Figure 5.4-3. Development under this designation could be
at intensities of almost 2.0 FAR, with building heights between
five and eight stories. Allowed building intensity and heights in
the remainder of the Downtown Focus Area are typically lower,
with maximum heights between three and four stories. Policies
related to Areas of Historic Sensitivity, in Section 5.6: Historic
Preservation, and to transitions, in Section 5.5: Neighborhood
Compatibility, also apply in respect to maintaining the existing
character and development patterns of the surrounding area,
excluding the properties designated as Downtown Core.
Throughout the Downtown Focus Area, pedestrian and bicycle
circulation should be promoted in lieu of increasing vehicular
travel lanes. Streets in this Focus Area may be exempt from the
City-wide vehicle level of service on a case-by-case basis until
the City completes the Prerequisite for an alternative Level of
Service under Policies 5.1.1-P12, P13 and P14. Connections to
nearby destinations, such as Santa Clara Station, Santa Clara
University, the Old Quad neighborhood and City Hall, should
be emphasized for pedestrian movement. The Downtown Focus
Area includes a future transit loop to connect the Downtown to

5.4.3 Santa Clara Station Focus Area Goals and
        Policies
The Santa Clara Station Focus Area is the 244-acre portion located
within the City of Santa Clara of a larger, multi-jurisdictional
planning area. As illustrated on Figure 5.4-5, the area is generally
bounded by De La Cruz Boulevard, Reed Street, and Martin
Avenue to the northeast, and Franklin Street and El Camino Real
to the southwest. At the center of this area is the existing Santa
Clara Transit Station, which is served by Caltrain, Altamont
Commuter Express, and Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
bus service. The Station, itself will include the Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) terminus of the planned Fremont, San José and
Santa Clara extension, as well as a future Automated People
Mover to the Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport
(Airport). The Station will be a major transit hub for the Bay Area
and supports the Major Strategies to promote sustainability and
economic vitality.
Existing development of low-intensity retail, oﬃce, residential
and light industrial uses along El Camino Real would generally
be replaced by larger scale, mixed-use development. The
Santa Clara Station Focus Area will serve as a gateway into the
City, improve the City’s economic base with expanded oﬃce,
hotel and retail uses, maximize opportunities for residential        The Santa Clara Station Focus Area

new oﬃce, hotel and retail uses and add high-density residential
development in order to maximize the use of existing and planned
transit. The Santa Clara Station Focus Area is planned for mixed-
use, transit-oriented development, including a central roadway,
or “main street” to provide connections within the area and link
a series of public spaces. Higher-intensity mixed-use adjacent to
the Station could be developed at the maximum height regulated
by the Federal Aviation Administration. Building intensity and
height would be reduced to a smaller-scale for residential uses
in proximity to the Old Quad neighborhood and Downtown
Focus Area. Approximately 1,650 new residential units and
2,000,000 square feet of non-residential uses, including hotels,
are expected. Discretionary Use and Transition Policies apply to
the Santa Clara Station Focus Area.
Within the Santa Clara Station Focus Area, pedestrian and bicycle
circulation have priority and may be exempt from the City-wide
level of service for vehicles on a case-by-case basis until the City
completes the Prerequisite for an alternate Level of Service under
Policies 5.1.1-P12, P13 and P14. Roadways within this Focus
Area, such as Coleman Avenue and De La Cruz Boulevard, that
provide access to the Santa Clara Transit Station and associated
parking facilities, however, would be subject to the vehicle level
of service standards.

                                Clara Station Focus Area.
                      5.4.3-P9  Encourage streetscape design with street trees,
                                wider sidewalks, pedestrian-oriented lighting,
                                curb bulb-outs and special paving and/or striping
                                within the Focus Area to emphasize accessibility.

5.4.3-P14      Encourage alternative modes of travel to and
               from the Station, including biking, walking and
               shuttles.
5.4.3-P15      Prioritize vehicular and transit transportation
               modes on roadways, such as Coleman Avenue
               and De La Cruz Boulevard, that provide access
               to the Station and prioritize pedestrian and bicycle
               transportation modes on internal streets within
               the Santa Clara Station Focus Area.
5.4.3-P16      Exempt intersections that do not provide a direct
               link to the Station and associated parking from the
               City-wide Level of Service standards for vehicles

5.4.4 Stevens Creek Boulevard Focus Area Goals
        and Policies
The Stevens Creek Boulevard Focus Area is located on the
northern side of Stevens Creek Boulevard, at the southern
border of the City between Winchester Boulevard and Lawrence
Expressway. Just to the east of this Focus Area are Valley Fair
Mall and Santana Row, both of which are regional commercial
destinations. Like El Camino Real, Stevens Creek Boulevard is a
major east-west arterial roadway, with local and regional-serving
commercial uses. Sales of automobiles and durable goods, like
furniture and recreational vehicles, are the primary businesses
in this area and are integral to the corridor’s vitality. Also, like
El Camino Real, the older building stock, extensive signage,
lack of landscaping and wide right-of-way in this Focus Area
detract from the visual quality. Additionally, most of the area
has relatively shallow parcels that abut single-family residential
uses.

          SANTA CLARA
          GENERAL PLAN
Stevens Creek Boulevard is a major commercial corridor dominated by auto dealers [left] that also include some small-scale
one-story strip malls. Some uses along Stevens Creek Boulevard already have structured and underground parking to maximize
the area for commercial uses on small sites [right].
                                            Expanding existing uses and intensifying development along the corridor [Stevens
                                            Creek Boulevard, Santa Clara, left], offer opportunities to bring buildings to the
                                            street edge and improve signage [San Jose, CA, right] and enhance the visual
                                            quality of the corridor.
                                               New development in the Focus Area will gradually replace
                                               existing development. New, non-residential development
                                               is expected with up to 0.6 FAR and higher-intensity, two- to
                                               three-story showrooms to maximize the use of smaller parcels
                                               and minimize conflicts with surrounding neighborhoods.
                                               Professional oﬃces could be a secondary use to the primary
                                               retail commercial uses. The application of Transition policies,
                                               included in Section 5.5: Neighborhood Compatibility will address
                                               appropriate development scale, particularly on smaller lots, in
                                               order to promote compatibility between new development and
                                               existing residences. Vehicular access is a priority along Stevens
                                               Creek Boulevard to support the primary commercial uses, with
                                               transit access a priority for the mixed-use development planned
                                               near Saratoga Avenue and Stevens Creek Boulevard. Parking,
                                               loading and bus rapid transit, in conjunction with streetscape
                                               amenities, street trees and wider sidewalks illustrated on Figure
                                               5.4-6 should be incorporated into the street design along the
                                               corridor. While the City expects that the land uses along the
                                               corridor will generally retain their auto-oriented character, the
                                               streetscape is expected to be improved to better accommodate
                                               multimodal travel including transit, pedestrian, and bicycle
                                               facilities.

               adjacent to the Stevens Creek Boulevard right-
               of-way and near the intersection with Saratoga
               Avenue.

               Boulevard.
Stevens Creek Boulevard Focus Area Policies
5.4.4-P1       All density and intensity for new development
               should be consistent with the specified land use
               designation as defined for the Land Use Diagram
               classifications.
5.4.4-P2       Provide appropriate transitions between new
               development and adjacent uses consistent with
               General Plan Transition Policies.
5.4.4-P3       In cooperation with the City of San José, promote
               development and streetscape design consistent
               with those illustrated in Figure 5.4-5.
5.4.4-P4       Work with the City of San José to coordinate
               streetscape design standards for street trees,
               sidewalks and planted median islands.
5.4.4-P5       Allow flexible sign standards to attract regional-
               serving retail businesses and to provide visibility
               for through traﬃc in the Stevens Creek Boulevard
               Focus Area.
5.4.4-P6       For new mixed use development, residential uses
               should be located on upper floors, with active
               commercial uses at the ground level and oriented
               to Stevens Creek Boulevard.
5.4.4-P7       Residential development should include front
               doors, windows, stoops, porches or bay windows
               along street frontages.
                                                                    Page 5-63

                                    surrounding neighborhoods and across Saratoga
                                    Avenue for new mixed-use development.
                      5.4.4-P10     Promote multimodal transit accessibility at Stevens
                                    Creek Boulevard and Saratoga Avenue.
                      5.4.4-P11     Work with Valley Transportation Authority
                                    to implement a Bus Rapid Transit or similar
                                    transit service along Stevens Creek Boulevard,
                                    retaining on-street parking and median islands for
                                    landscaping.
                      5.4.4-P12     Encourage eﬃcient use of land for retail uses
                                    through consolidated, shared and structured
                                    parking.
                      5.4.4-P13     Provide adequate oﬀ-street loading areas that do
                                    not conflict with bicycle, transit or automobile
                                    movements for new commercial development.
                      5.4.4-P14     Promote variably timed on-street parking and
                                    loading to accommodate business needs along the
                                    street, outside of vehicle lanes and median areas, if
                                    feasible.
                      5.4.4-P15     Prohibit loading and unloading in residential areas
                                    and on residential streets.
                      5.4.5 Future Focus Areas Goals and Policies
                      Future Focus Areas are identified for Phases II and III of the
                      General Plan. Each of these areas requires additional planning
                      as prerequisites for development. Future Focus Areas are
                      located north of the Caltrain corridor, adjacent to existing transit
                      hubs or along major transportation corridors. The Future Focus
                      Areas represent a change from existing underutilized oﬃce
                      and industrial uses to higher-density residential and mixed-use

5.5     NEIGHBORHOOD COMPATIBILITY
The City of Santa Clara’s high quality of life is directly related to
the livability and character of its many residential neighborhoods.
One of the Major Strategies of the General Plan is to ensure that
the City’s existing neighborhoods and community fabric are
maintained as the City grows. The General Plan encourages new
uses that are contextually appropriate, both in land use as well
as in scale and design. This compatibility is supported through
policies that allow flexibility to accommodate unique sites,
development conditions, and the transition between existing
and new development.
Goals and policies related to discretionary uses provide a basis
for flexibility and compatibility both within, and adjacent to, the
City’s existing residential neighborhoods. Discretionary Use
Policies address unique cases in which uses and/or densities,
other than those designated on the Land Use Diagram, may
conform to the General Plan. These alternate uses would be
permitted without a General Plan amendment. Transition
Policies focus on preserving neighborhood identity, ensuring
continuity in design and providing an appropriate transition
between existing lower-intensity development and new higher-
intensity development.
While the focus of new growth within the City will occur on sites
that primarily have underutilized commercial and industrial
uses, there are locations in the City where these sites are adjacent
to, or abutting, well-established residential neighborhoods.
Specific areas vulnerable to conflicts between new and existing
uses are primarily located along the City’s commercial corridors,
where shallow commercial lots abut single-family residences.
Much of Santa Clara’s established residential fabric is comprised
of one- and two-story homes. New, higher-intensity mixed-
use development, particularly along El Camino Real and
Stevens Creek Boulevard, will need to step down in scale and
massing where development is directly adjacent to single-
family homes. Additionally, careful attention to use, massing,
scale and streetscape design along local, residential streets
where new development faces existing development, can also
help to provide a more gradual transition for neighborhood
compatibility.
                                                                      Page 5-67

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.5.1 Discretionary Use Goals and Policies
                      Discretionary Use Policies are applicable under specific conditions
                      for which an alternate use and/or density to the classification
                      on the Land Use Diagram can conform to the General Plan.
                      These policies are intended to promote compatibility with
                      surrounding uses and support the General Plan Major Strategies.
                      Discretionary Use Policies may only be applied singularly, and
                      may not be combined for new development projects.

5.5.1-P14      For properties designated High or Low Intensity
               Oﬃce/Research and Development, allow places
               of assembly and entertainment uses on parcels
               within the designated Exception Area identified
               on the Land Use Diagram.
5.5.1-P15      For Mixed Use properties where there is no history
               of commercial uses, the minimum FAR may be
               reduced by 50 percent of the minimum FAR shown
               under the land use classification.
5.5.1-P16      Allow a limited number of entertainment uses in
               Phase III Industrial designations north of Highway
               101, provided that the use supports the Santa Clara
               Convention Center activities, is compatible with
               neighboring land uses and meets other General
               Plan Goals and Policies.
5.5.1-P17      Allow new parks and open space uses under
               any General Plan Land Use classification, except
               in areas designated as Light Industrial or Heavy
               Industrial, provided that the use is compatible
               with planned uses on neighboring properties,
               consistent with other applicable General Plan
               policies.
5.5.2 Transition Goals and Policies
Transition policies are applicable to sites where new development
is of a diﬀerent land use classification and/or intensity to that of
adjacent neighborhoods. Transition Policies may apply to areas
where residential uses abut retail, commercial, oﬃce, research
and development, or industrial development. Transition Policies
do not apply to new development in the Downtown Core within
the Downtown Focus Area in order to promote a revitalized
destination in the heart of Santa Clara. Transition Policies for
properties in proximity to historic resources are also included in
the Historic Preservation Policies in Section 5.6.
Transition Policies are intended to address compatibility between
existing and new development and may be applied in order to:
     Adjust building height, scale and massing along the site
        perimeter abutting lower-intensity uses. For example, a
        multi-story commercial building could be taller along the
        street frontage, and shorter near the portion of the site
        that abuts a residential parcel, as illustrated in Figure 5.5-
        1.
                                                                       Page 5-71

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                           Provide buﬀers, such as landscaping or setbacks, between
                             diﬀering uses or intensities. For example, a setback
                             could be increased, or a balcony/window screen could be
                             provided, when a taller building is proposed next to a
                             shorter building.
                           Restrict loading and noise generating activities to protect
                             adjacent residential uses.
                           Promote below-grade parking and screen loading areas
                             from street view.
                           Encourage enhanced streetscape design and amenities
                             to integrate new development into neighborhoods and
                             promote pedestrian activity.

                                    existing and planned residential neighborhoods.
                      Transition Policies
                      5.5.2-P1      Require that new development incorporate
                                    building articulation and architectural features,
                                    including front doors, windows, stoops, porches
                                    or bay windows along street frontages, to integrate
                                    new development into existing neighborhoods.
                      5.5.2-P2      Implement design review guidelines for setback,
                                    heights, materials, massing, articulation and
                                    other standards to support Transition Policies and
                                    promote neighborhood compatibility.
                      5.5.2-P3      Implement site design solutions, such as
                                    landscaping and increased building setbacks, to
                                    provide a buﬀer between non-residential and
                                    residential uses.
                      5.5.2-P4      Provide adequate separation between incompatible
                                    land uses in order to minimize negative eﬀects on
                                    surrounding existing and planned development.
                      5.5.2-P5      Require that new development provide an
                                    appropriate transition to surrounding neigh-

                                        5.6     HISTORIC PRESERVATION
                                        Santa Clara’s character and identity are largely products of
                                        its history as a Mission City. Historic resources in the City,
                                        including Mission Santa Clara, numerous historic homes and
                                        relics found in local Native American burial sites, serve as
                                        a reminder of this rich history. The City’s commitment to its
                                        architectural and archaeological history is reflected in General
                                        Plan Goals and Policies that address the preservation and
                                        protection of resources with local, State and national significance.
                                        Policies not only focus on the historic properties themselves but
                                        also the immediate surrounding area that provides the context
                                        for these resources.
                                        In order to support its historic preservation goals, the City
                                        established a Historical and Landmarks Commission and
                                        obtained recognition by the State Oﬃce of Historic Preservation
                                        of the City as a Certified Local Government (CLG). Historic
                                        preservation policies also support the two Major Strategies of
                                        the General Plan to enhance the City’s identity and to preserve
                                        existing neighborhoods.
                                        The City currently uses the following tools to evaluate historic
                                        resources:
                                             The Historical and Landmarks Commission advises

                                                Appendix 8.9, establishes evaluation measures, to
                                                ensure that the resource is at least 50 years old and
                                                that the property is associated with an important
                                                individual or event, an architectural innovation, and/
                                                or an archaeological contribution in order to be deemed
                                                significant. The City maintains a list of qualified historic
                                                consultants for these evaluations.

Architecturally or Historically Significant Properties refer to
prehistoric and historic features, structures, sites or properties
that represent important aspects of the City’s heritage. Historic
Preservation policies strengthen the City’s Historic Preservation
Goals, providing direction for changes to historic resources and
new development proposed within 100 feet of historic properties
in order to evaluate any potential eﬀects on the historic context
for the resource. A 100–foot radius, defined as the Area of
Historic Sensitivity, is approximately equal to all properties
abutting, across the street, and adjacent to abutting properties
from a historic resource. This would comprise a little less than a
typical City block. Preservation of Santa Clara’s long history is
also supported by policies that protect archaeological resources,
such as relics found in burial sites.
5.6.1 Historic Preservation Goals and Policies
Historic Preservation Goals and policies are applicable to the
City’s historic resources in order to provide the basis for their
protection, reuse and identification in the City. These resources
include historic structures, like the Berryessa Adobe, the Harris-
Lass Historic Preserve and the Santa Clara Railroad Depot, as
well as some of the City’s historic homes in areas like the Old
Quad. Appendix 8.9 includes the City’s list of Architecturally or
Historically Significant Properties.
Historic Preservation Goals
5.6.1-G1       Preservation of historic resources and neigh-
               borhoods.
5.6.1-G2       Public awareness of the City’s historic preservation
               programs.
5.6.1-G3       Changes and maintenance of historic resources
               that retain the integrity of the property and its
               historic value.
Historic Preservation Policies
5.6.1-P1       Discourage the demolition or inappropriate
               alterations of historic buildings and ensure the
               protection of historic resources through the
               continued enforcement of codes and design
               guidelines.
5.6.1-P2       Protect the historic integrity of designated historic
               properties and encourage adaptive reuse when
               necessary to promote preservation.
                                                                     Page 5-75

5.6.2 Areas of Historic Sensitivity Goals and Policies
The area immediately surrounding historic resources contributes
to the setting for the resource. It is important to review any
changes in these areas with that in mind. The following goals
and policies provide direction for all properties within a radius of
100 feet to City, State, or federally listed historic resources in the
City. Relevant policies regarding transitions between uses may
be found in Section 5.4: Neighborhood Compatibility. Appendix
8.9 includes an illustration of the Areas of Sensitivity for Agnew
Village and the Old Quad (Figure 8.9-2).
Areas of Historic Sensitivity Goals
5.6.2-G1       New development that is compatible with nearby

               to the context of a historic resource are compatible
               in scale, materials, design, height, mass and use
               with the historic resource or its context.

                                    on new development and/or uses.
                      5.6.3 Archaeological and Cultural Resources Goals
                             and Policies
                      The City of Santa Clara is rich with archaeological and
                      paleontological resources. These resources include the Santa
                      Clara Mission, Native American burial grounds, the Berryessa
                      Adobe and many others. The following Goals and Policies ensure
                      that these resources are protected, now and into the future, and
                      that appropriate mitigation measures to unforeseen impacts are
                      enforced.
                      Archaeological and Cultural Resources Goals
                      5.6.3-G1      Protection and preservation of cultural resources,
                                    as well as archaeological and paleontological
                                    sites.
                      5.6.3-G2      Appropriate mitigation in the event that
                                    human remains, archaeological resources or
                                    paleontological resources are discovered during
                                    construction activities.
                      Archaeological and Cultural Resources Policies
                      5.6.3-P1      Require that new development avoid or reduce
                                    potential impacts to archaeological, paleontological
                                    and cultural resources.
                      5.6.3-P2      Encourage        salvage     and preservation of
                                    scientifically    valuable    paleontological     or
                                    archaeological materials.
                      5.6.3-P3      Consult with California Native American tribes
                                    prior to considering amendments to the City’s
                                    General Plan.
                      5.6.3-P4      Require        that a qualified paleontologist/
                                    archaeologist monitor all grading and/or excavation
                                    if there is a potential to aﬀect archeological or
                                    paleontological resources, including sites within
                                    500 feet of natural water courses and in the Old

5.6.3-P5       In the event that archaeological/paleontological
               resources are discovered, require that work
               be suspended until the significance of the find
               and recommended actions are determined by a
               qualified archaeologist/paleontologist.
5.6.3-P6       In the event that human remains are discovered,
               work with the appropriate Native American
               representative and follow the procedures set forth
               in State law.
5.7      MOBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION
         DIAGRAM
The Mobility and Transportation Diagram is comprised of
three components: the Roadway Network, the Transit Network,
and the Bicycle and Pedestrian Network. Together, these, in
conjunction with the three phases of the Land Use Diagram,
provide the framework for the General Plan land use and
transportation elements. The three components of the Mobility
and Transportation Diagram are based on Santa Clara’s
existing facilities. Future infrastructure will expand the City’s
transportation networks to ensure an integrated, well-connected
system to increase walking, bicycling and transit opportunities.
To maintain internal consistency for the Plan, any plans,
construction or funding of improvements that conflict with
the Transportation and Mobility Diagrams or text, including
those that would alter the classification of a transportation
facility, should include a General Plan Amendment in order to
evaluate the broader implications of the proposal. Balancing
transportation with all other components of the General
Plan supports the Major Strategies for high quality of life,
sustainability, and health and safety, as well as the goals and
policies identified in Appendix 8.13: Community Sustainability
and Health Goals and Policies Matrix.
This Section describes the assumptions and standards for the
three Mobility and Transportation Diagrams, as well as for
Transportation Demand Management (TDM), parking, and rail
and freight movement, as the primary components for mobility
and transportation. Section 5.8 presents the City’s Mobility and
Transportation Goals and Policies.

take advantage of land use density and diversity in order to
increase transit ridership, biking and walking while decreasing
the need for automobile travel. Such a shift from vehicle usage
can reduce air pollution, energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions, which supports the General Plan’s policies for
climate change (as described in Appendix 8.13: Community
Sustainability and Health Goals and Policies Matrix).
Certain Focus Areas may also be exempt from the vehicular LOS
standard in order to support alternate transportation modes.
These areas should include the El Camino Real, Downtown, and
Santa Clara Station Focus Areas. Roadways and intersections
that may be exempt, along with appropriate priorities for
transportation modes, are identified in Section 5.4: Focus
Areas. To implement an alternative LOS standard, such as an
average City LOS, General Plan prerequisites require adoption
of an implementation mechanism, such as an Area Development
Policy for an alternate Level of Service standard, in cooperation
with VTA prior to 2015.
5.7.2 Mobility and Transportation
        Classifications and Diagram
This section describes the components of the Mobility and
Transportation Diagram, including the City’s Roadway Network,
Transit Network, and Bicycle and Pedestrian Network. Each of
these three components are discussed separately. Together, they
comprise the complete Mobility and Transportation Diagram.
Roadway Network
Roadway classifications provide a hierarchical framework for
the design and operation of the City’s streets. Generally, street
classifications define vehicle capacity into, and through, a city,
as well as the number of travel lanes, speed limits and access
points. Local streets have fewer lanes, lower speed limits and
more access points to fronting properties, while arterials have
more lanes, higher speed limits and fewer access points.
The General Plan Roadway Network includes five street types:
freeways, expressways, arterials, collector streets, and local
streets. These are shown in Figure 5.7-1. The Roadway Network
includes opportunities for alternate transportation modes,
recognizing that transportation corridors serve multiple users
with diﬀerent abilities and preferences.

Roadway Classifications
Freeways
Freeways are high-speed travel ways included in the State and
federal highway systems and under the jurisdiction of Caltrans.
Their purpose is to carry regional through traﬃc. Typical
freeway speeds are 55 to 65 miles per hour, and rights-of-way
are 200 to 250 feet, with additional width at interchanges. Access
is provided by interchanges with typical spacing of one mile
or greater. No direct access is provided to adjacent land uses.
No pedestrian or bicycle facilities are provided, although some
transit routes may travel on these roadways. When upgrades
to existing interchanges or grade separations are planned,
pedestrian, bicycle and transit circulation will be accommodated
to the extent feasible.
The existing freeways in the City are:
     U.S. Highway 101
     State Route 237
     Interstate 280
Expressways
Expressways are typically designed to serve regional traﬃc
with speeds of 45 miles per hour and limited access. These
facilities are under the jurisdiction of Santa Clara County and
include transit service and stops. Crosswalks are provided at
all signalized intersections on the expressway system. Wide
shoulders or parallel routes are generally provided. When
upgrades to existing interchanges or grade separations on the
expressway system are planned, pedestrian, bicycle and transit
circulation will be accommodated to the extent feasible. The
expressways serving the City are:
    • Lawrence Expressway
    • San Tomas Expressway
    • Montague Expressway
    • Central Expressway
Major and Minor Arterial Streets
Major and minor arterial streets primarily serve through traﬃc
not served by expressways or freeways, and typically include
transit vehicles. These streets have travel speeds between 35
and 45 miles per hour. Major arterials are generally designed
with four travel lanes and a 100- to 120-foot right-of-way. Minor
                                                                   Page 5-83

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      arterials are generally two to four travel lanes with up to a 95-
                      foot right-of-way. Both types typically have dedicated left-turn
                      lanes, traﬃc signals at major intersections, and parallel street
                      parking. Through traﬃc and transit on these streets is given
                      signal priority. Pedestrians are accommodated with sidewalks
                      and crosswalks. Arterial streets can provide bicycle facilities
                      (such as striped lanes or separate paths) and should include
                      sidewalks and street trees. Transit service is also emphasized,
                      particularly on major arterials.
                      Examples of major arterials are:
                          • De La Cruz Boulevard
                          • El Camino Real

                      Collector Streets
                      These streets provide traﬃc circulation for residential and
                      commercial uses at travel speeds of 25 to 35 miles per hour.
                      Typically, collector streets have two to four lanes and have
                      rights-of-way of 55 to 75 feet. Collector streets penetrate
                      residential neighborhoods, distributing trips from the arterials
                      into neighborhoods. They usually channel traﬃc from local
                      streets to arterials. They also provide pedestrian and bicycle
                      links between destinations and should include sidewalks and
                      street trees. Some collector streets, such as those with adjacent
                      commercial or high-density residential development, may
                      experience greater traﬃc volumes than those with adjacent low-
                      density residential development or schools. Transit services may
                      be provided on some collector streets. Through truck traﬃc is
                      discouraged. Example collector streets in the City of Santa Clara
                      include:

Local Streets
All other streets not designated on the Mobility and
Transportation Diagram are local streets.          They equally
accommodate automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians within
the public right-of-way. Transit use and truck traﬃc, if any, is
incidental. These streets are designed for lower traﬃc volumes
and provide primary access for abutting residential and
neighborhood commercial properties. Typically, these streets
are two lanes and have a 40- to 60-foot right-of-way, with travel
speeds of 25 miles per hour. Traﬃc management strategies for
these streets encourage slower traﬃc. Sidewalks, street trees
and pedestrian amenities are encouraged. In addition to local
streets, some neighborhoods include public alleys. Alleys are
not subject to City street standards such as setbacks, sidewalks
and design criteria.
Interchanges, Grade Separations, Freeway Connector Ramps and
At-Grade Rail Crossings
These facilities accommodate or connect traﬃc over physical
barriers. Any renovation or upgrade of existing facilities should
accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traﬃc as well. Existing
facilities are identified on the Mobility and Transportation
Diagram. Typically, new facilities are discouraged within the
City of Santa Clara’s jurisdictional boundaries.
Transit Network
Santa Clara’s Transit Network includes rail and bus facilities
both on- and oﬀ-street. The Transit Network is comprised of
a variety of services, as shown in Figure 5.7-2. Existing public
transit service within the City is primarily provided by Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) and consists of bus, light rail
transit and paratransit services. Commuter rail lines stopping at
the Santa Clara Transit Station include Caltrain, operated by the
Peninsula Joint Powers Board (JPB), and Altamont Commuter
Express (ACE), operated by the San Joaquin Regional Rail
Commission. In addition to the ACE Train, the Capitol Corridor
                                                                  Page 5-85

commuter rail line, operated by the Capitol Corridor Joint
Powers Authority (CCJPA), stops at the Great America Station,
providing services from Sacramento to San José through the
City of Santa Clara.
The General Plan identifies a number of transit corridors where
frequent transit services are, or will be, provided. Bus rapid
transit (BRT), or similar transit service, is anticipated along
El Camino Real and Stevens Creek Boulevard. The General
Plan identifies additional north-south transit opportunities
along Great America Parkway/Bowers Avenue, to access new
employment and residential centers north of the Caltrain
corridor and along Lafayette Street, with Rivermark, El Camino
Real, Downtown and Santa Clara University. Future transit
in the City also includes Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and
an elevated Automated People Mover from the Airport to the
existing Santa Clara Transit Station. High Speed Rail is also
planned along the Caltrain corridor.
In order to achieve greater transit use, the Land Use and
Mobility and Transportation Diagrams co-locate higher intensity
development with existing and future transit stops to maximize
resident and employee accessibility. Figure 5.7-2 shows potential
transit stops in the City, and the ten-minute, or one-half mile,
walking distance around each. Major transit stops, including the
Santa Clara Transit Station and Lawrence Caltrain Station, are
identified by a ten-minute, or one-half mile, walking distance, as
they are likely to attract both local and regional transit ridership.
Transit Classifications
Bus Service
Bus service is accommodated on the City’s Roadway Network,
primarily along major arterials and expressways. Buses share
the road with vehicles and travel at the posted speed limit. Bus
stops are designated by signage and pedestrian amenities, such
as benches and enclosures.
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service
BRT, or similar services, can be accommodated on the City’s
Roadway Network. These services, or similar, can have a shared
or dedicated BRT lane and would usually include well-defined
station stops that can include curb pullouts and pedestrian
enclosures. BRT would typically have signal priority and travel
at the posted speed limits.

                                         Light Rail Service
                                         Light rail services are typically constructed at the street level, and
                                         located along the rights-of-way of the City’s Roadway Network.
                                         Light rail transit can travel up to 55 miles per hour, although in
                                         high pedestrian traﬃc areas, speeds are more restricted.
                                         Heavy Rail Service
                                         Heavy rail is located along exclusive rail rights-of-way and
                                         typically travels at high speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. High
                                         Speed Rail service will likely use these facilities or rights-of-way
                                         and may travel at speeds of up to 125 miles per hour.
                                         Transit Stations and Transit Centers
                                         These centers are transfer points, or stations, where high volume
                                         transit lines intersect. Transit stations include the Santa Clara
                                         Transit Station, Lawrence Station and Great America Station.
                                         Transit stops, concentrated near high-intensity development

                                         Bicycle and Pedestrian Network
                                         The Bicycle and Pedestrian Network includes facilities on City
                                         streets as well as along the City’s designated trail ways. The
                                         combined existing and future Bicycle and Pedestrian Networks
                                         are shown in Figure 5.7-3. Opportunities for bicycle facilities
                                         and future study corridors for bicycle lanes or trails are also

                                         opportunities. The General Plan expands the City’s network and
                                         support facilities, such as bicycle parking at employment, retail
                                         and other destinations. The Plan also identifies opportunities
                                         to extend trails along the City’s creeks and other north-south
                                         corridors within the City and includes policies to remove barriers
                                         and improve accessibility.

crossings are provided throughout the City; however, some
industrial areas between the Caltrain corridor and U.S. 101 lack
sidewalk facilities. Definitions for both bicycle and pedestrian
classifications are listed below.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Classifications
Bicycle Paths and Trails
Bicycle paths and trails are paved facilities designated for bicycle
use that are physically separated from roadways by space or a
physical barrier. These paths often accommodate pedestrians
and include creek trails within the City. These may be classified
as Class I bicycle facilities according to Caltrans.
Bicycle Lanes
These facilities are lanes on the outside edge of roadways
reserved for the exclusive use of bicycles, and are designated
with special signage and pavement markings. These are typically
classified as Class II bicycle facilities according to Caltrans.
Bicycle Routes
Roadways recommended for bicycle use and often connecting
to bicycle lanes and bicycle paths are defined as bicycle routes.
Routes are designated with signs only and may not include
additional pavement width. These are typically classified as
Class III bicycle facilities according to Caltrans.                  The proposed Santa Clara BART
                                                                     Station includes a pedestrian overpass

Trails
Trails are typically oﬀ-street routes through the City that follow
the existing creeks and riverbeds, such as the San Tomas Aquino/
Saratoga Creek Trail and Guadalupe River Trail. Additional
opportunities for trails and connections between oﬀ-street routes
in the City include public and quasi public rights-of-way, as well
as Santa Clara Valley Water District, school districts, and other
public agencies and utility lands.

Multimodal Facilities
Providing safe, convenient alternative transportation options
reduces the need for driving in the City. As transit, walking
and bicycle trips become more viable and attract trips that
would otherwise be taken by private automobile, greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and air quality is improved.
Reducing the need for local vehicle trips is an important
element of General Plan Major Strategies for quality of life and
community vitality. Pedestrian accessibility is an important part
of the implementation of alternative transportation options. For
the City of Santa Clara, Figure 5.7-4 showing pedestrian access
to public and open space amenities illustrates that walking is a
viable travel mode.
In order to transition toward optimizing travel by all modes,
the General Plan incorporates design concepts to implement
“Full-Service Streets” for all three transportation networks.
Full-Service Streets are designed and operated to enable safe,
attractive and comfortable access and travel for all users.
Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and public transit users of all
ages and abilities are able to safely and comfortably move along
and across a Full-Service Street. Full-Service Streets include
improvements to pedestrian facilities, like sidewalks, crosswalks
and streetscape amenities, along corridors to connect both
residences and employment areas to retail destinations, parks,
recreational and other activity centers. Full-Service Streets also
create a sense of place and improve social interaction, while
generally improving the environment for adjacent properties.
Qualification for a Full-Service Street includes the following
street design components.
Multiple Travel Modes. Full-Service Streets ensure smooth transit
flow, allow safe and convenient pedestrian routes, accommodate
bicycle facilities and provide for on-street parking in mixed-use
locations. Travel lanes can also serve multiple functions and can
accommodate shared transit and vehicle circulation.
Pedestrian-Oriented. With City growth and the addition of over
30,000 new residents, it is essential to ensure access to services
and amenities. Planned mixed-use development, for instance,
will need to attract pedestrians with wider sidewalks, enhanced
amenities, small public plazas, and well-defined crosswalks.
Additional design elements to serve the needs of pedestrians
include pedestrian-scaled lighting, trees, planters and street
furniture. Signalized crosswalks and traﬃc signalization that
prioritizes pedestrian movement are also important components
in high pedestrian traﬃc areas.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      Enhanced Streetscapes. This is especially critical for major streets
                      that traverse the City like El Camino Real, Stevens Creek
                      Boulevard and Great America Parkway in order to enhance the
                      City’s identity. These streets can define major gateways for the
                      City if amplified by distinct planting, signage and streetscape
                      design.
                      Figure 5.7-5 illustrates the Full-Service Street concept as applied
                      to a typical arterial street in the City. Ultimately, the City will
                      encourage all City streets to include Full-Service Street design as
                      they are upgraded and improved.
                      5.7.3 Transportation Demand Management
                      Transportation Demand Management (TDM) refers to a
                      comprehensive strategy to reduce driving by promoting
                      alternatives such as public transit, carpooling, bicycling, walking
                      and telecommuting. Policies in the General Plan encourage
                      both public and private-sector participation in TDM programs.
                      Specific measures include promoting carpooling and vanpooling,
                      car sharing and bicycle sharing programs, telecommuting,
                      flexible/alternate work schedules, and on-site support services,
                      such as child care and cafeterias.
                      5.7.4 Parking
                      The General Plan encourages parking standards that support
                      alternative transportation modes, as well as the development
                      of higher-intensity land uses. Santa Clara’s street standards
                      include parking along public streets, public transit, walking
                      and bicycling. The General Plan allows appropriate oﬀ-sets to
                      account for shared parking, transit availability, and potential
                      time limitations for a balanced and appropriate parking supply.
                      In addition, the General Plan encourages below-grade and
                      structured parking facilities as a means to reduce building
                      heights and massing for greater compatibility with surrounding
                      uses.
                      5.7.5 Rail and Freight Movement
                      The movement of goods with trucks and freight trains is an
                      important component of the City’s transportation network,
                      serving industrial, commercial and retail uses. A street system
                      that accommodates trucks, while protecting neighborhoods

               infrastructure to maximize the use of the existing
               roadway and support eﬃcient traﬃc flow.
Roadway Network Policies
5.8.2-P1       Require that new and retrofitted roadways
               implement “Full-Service Streets” standards,
               including minimal vehicular travel lane widths,
               pedestrian amenities, adequate sidewalks, street
               trees, bicycle facilities, transit facilities, lighting
               and signage, where feasible.
5.8.2-P2       Discourage widening of existing roadway
               or intersection rights-of-way without first
               considering operational improvements, such as
                                                                       Designing roadways to accommodate

5.8.2-P4       Facilitate the implementation of the street system
               based on the roadway classifications and illustrated
               in the Roadway Diagram in Figure 5.7-1.
5.8.2-P5       Support “traﬃc calming” and other neighborhood
               traﬃc management techniques to enhance the
               quality of life within existing neighborhoods and
               to discourage through-traﬃc on local streets.
5.8.2-P6       Interconnect and coordinate traﬃc signals to
               maximize vehicle flow on the City’s roadway
               network to reduce the need for roadway widening.
5.8.2-P7       Concentrate through traﬃc on major streets and
               encourage traﬃc distribution that maximizes the
               eﬃciency of the existing roadway network.
5.8.2-P8       Minimize disruption of traﬃc flow resulting from
               truck traﬃc and deliveries, particularly during
               commute hours.
5.8.2-P9       Require all new development to provide streets

                                business and resident needs as well as avoid an
                                oversupply in order to promote transit ridership,
                                bicycling and walking.
                      5.8.6-P4  Encourage shared, consolidated and/or reduced

                      5.8.6-P5  Allow alternative parking techniques, such as
                                parking lifts, automated and tandem parking, in
                                order to reduce the land area devoted to parking.
                      5.8.6-P6  Provide direct access or oﬀer clear signage to
                                connect local streets with parking supplies.
                      5.8.6-P7  Encourage private property owners to share

                      5.8.6-P9  Consider neighborhood parking programs, such
                                as “permit-only” and timed parking zones, to
                                minimize parking intrusion on residential streets.
                      5.8.6-P10 Support time limits for on-street parking to
                                encourage alternate transportation modes to
                                access destinations, such as Downtown, parks and
                                libraries.
                      5.8.6-P11 Encourage development to “unbundle” parking
                                spaces from leases and purchases to provide
                                greater choices

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.9      PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES
                      The purpose of this section is to address schools, libraries, and
                      cultural facilities; parks, recreation, and open space; and public
                      safety services. While several of these topics are optional for
                      general plans under State law, they are integral to maintaining a
                      high quality of life and livability in the City, a Major Strategy of
                      this General Plan. As such, the Goals and Policies in this section
                      promote the provision of adequate public services, parkland,
                      and community and cultural facilities, along with trails that are
                      linked to parks and open spaces.
                      5.9.1 Parks, Open Space, and Recreation Goals
                               and Policies
                      Parks, open space and recreation facilities are critical in satisfying
                      the diverse outdoor needs of Santa Clara residents and visitors,
                      improving the physical health of the community and providing
                      opportunities for social interaction. Open spaces should oﬀer
                      options for all types of activities, from passive rest areas and
                      trails for walking or jogging, to fields and recreational facilities
                      for organized sports. Overall, parks are an essential contributor
                      to quality of life. As residential and employment populations
                      increase and available land in the City becomes more limited, it
                      will be essential for the City to actively seek additional park and
                      open space.
                      Parks and Recreation Facilities
                      A combination of small and large parks are distributed
                      throughout the City’s residential neighborhoods, as shown on
                      Figure 5.9-1 and described in Table 8.8-1 in Appendix 8.8: Parks
                      and Recreation Inventory. The City’s parks and recreation
                      facilities are organized into categories based on typical size,
                      programming and intended use.
                      Parks categories include:
                           Mini Parks
                           Neighborhood Parks
                           Community Parks
                           Open Space
                           Recreation Facilities

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                            5
Parks and recreation facilities in the City are provided and
maintained by the Department of Parks and Recreation. In
general, each one-square mile of residential area in the City
contains a Neighborhood or Community Park located close to
the center, ensuring that almost all residents live within a ten
minute walk of a park. The centerpiece of the City’s park system
is Central Park, which contains active and passive recreation
areas, and sports facilities. The industrial and business corridor
between U.S. 101 and the Caltrain corridor contains limited open
spaces with the exception of the Municipal Santa Clara Golf &
Tennis Club which serves the entire community.
In 2008, the City’s neighborhood and community parks served
a population of approximately 115,500 residents, resulting in
2.4 acres of local-serving parkland per 1,000 residents.3 This
ratio includes parks that primarily serve Santa Clara residents
and businesses, and excludes regional serving facilities such as
Ulistac Natural Area, the Municipal Santa Clara Golf & Tennis
Club and the Pruneridge Golf Course. Included in this General
Plan are policies to maintain a standard of 2.4 acres of parkland
per 1,000 residents as the City grows. In addition to providing
adequate land, parks need to be appropriately sized to fulfill
specific community purposes. Table 5.9-1 describes these park
size standards. Maintaining these standards will ensure that
current and new residents will continue to enjoy these facilities
throughout the City. In addition, increasing the standard to 3.0
acres of parkland per 1,000 residents will be explored in the
context of the Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment (Parks
Master Plan), referenced in Plan Prerequisite 5.1.1-P24.
Ideally, parks should be located within a ten-minute walking
distance from residential areas and be provided near
employment centers. Additionally, while parks should be
generally spread evenly throughout the City, in order to ensure
equitable distribution, parks may need to be closer together in
areas with higher-intensity and higher-density development to
better serve the demand.
Figure 5.9-1 illustrates potential future locations for new
parkland. With the Future Focus Areas concentrated north of
the Caltrain corridor, much of the new parkland is anticipated in
this area. Figure 5.9-1 also identifies the general area north of the

  Based on DOF January 2008 population of: 115,503 and including 467.5
acres of parks and recreation space. See Appendix 8.8 for a breakdown of
park acreage.

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                       5
The San Tomas Aquino/Saratoga Creek Trail and the Guadalupe
River Trail connect with the regional Bay Trail, which links
perimeter open space areas along San Francisco and San Pablo
Bays. The San Tomas Aquino/Saratoga Creek Trail is comprised
of approximately four miles of existing creek trail and bicycle
lanes. Extension of this trail south of El Camino Real could
provide potential connections to Central Park and future bicycle
routes in the City.
Located on the Bay, just to the north of Santa Clara (and connected
to Guadalupe River Park through bicycle and pedestrian trails),
the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge provides 30,000
acres of a habitat and conservation area for wildlife, migratory
birds, and threatened and endangered species. Within Santa
Clara, the 40-acre Ulistac Natural Area, located in Santa Clara
along Lick Mill Boulevard south of Tasman Drive, is home to
several natural Bay Area habitats. Opportunities for additional
regional open space within the City are limited as most of
the City is built-out. Enhancement of existing non-park open
space, such as the Hetch-Hetchy Aqueduct right-of-way, east of
Lafayette Street, and the City’s two retention basins, located near
the Baylands, have some potential as open space resources.
Private and SCUSD School District Facilities
In addition to City parks and regional open space and trails,
there are several private and Santa Clara Unified School District
(SCUSD) facilities that serve the community. The privately-
owned Pruneridge Golf Course oﬀers sports recreation
opportunities in the community. In addition, SCUSD facilities
include several sports fields adjacent to school properties that
serve many Santa Clara neighborhoods south of the Caltrain
corridor. Sports fields include the Townsend, Elmer Johnson,
Lou Vierra and Washington Park ball fields.
The following Goals and Policies provide direction for expected
new parks, open space and recreation in the City. Additional
policies related to the disposition of surplus, unused or
underutilized parks and open space lands and required land use
classifications for new parks and open space lands are defined in
the Discretionary Alternate Use policies in Section 5.5.1.

5.9.2 Schools and Community Facilities Goals
        and Policies
This section outlines existing public school enrollment and
conditions, projected enrollment, and planned facilities.
Community facilities are also discussed, including existing and
planned community centers, museums, civic buildings and
libraries. Public facilities are mapped in Figure 5.9-2.
Schools
Schools that serve children in grades K-12 who reside in the
City of Santa Clara are operated by six school districts: Santa
Clara Unified School District (SCUSD), San José Unified School
District, Cupertino Union School District, Fremont Union High
School District, Campbell Union School District, and Campbell
Union High School District. In addition, the City of Santa Clara
houses a number of private and charter schools serving these
same grades.
SCUSD serves children in the cities of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale
and San José, and is responsible for 16 elementary, three middle,
two high, one K-8, and two continuation high schools, as well as
one adult education school. The majority of students residing
in the City of Santa Clara attend SCUSD schools. Three of the
District’s schools are located within the City of Sunnyvale and
one is in San José. Cupertino Union also operates one school
within the City of Santa Clara’s boundaries. The remaining
districts listed above accommodate Santa Clara residents within
their respective boundaries, but do not operate schools within
Santa Clara. See Appendix 8.11 for more detailed information
about current school facilities, enrollment and capacity, broken
down by district.

            GENERAL PLAN
                                         New development projected under the General Plan will fall
                                         primarily within the jurisdiction of SCUSD. Approximately
                                         12,500 households are expected to be added to the SCUSD area,
                                         which would result in approximately 2,000 additional students.4
                                         The Campbell Union (K-8) and Campbell Union High (9-12)
                                         school districts, which overlap, will realize approximately 500
                                         additional households as a result of implementation of the
                                         General Plan, generating approximately 38 new K-8 and 42 new
                                         9-12 grade students.5 SCUSD currently has four closed school
                                         sites (three of which are located in the City of Santa Clara)
                                         that could be used to serve new development. Alternatively,
                                         SCUSD may choose to modify school catchment areas or add
                                         modular classrooms to accommodate new students. SCUSD
                                         is also anticipating the construction of new school facilities in
                                         north San José as a result of an agreement with that city and

                                         add more capacity for new students and can reduce the number
                                         of students now in Santa Clara facilities. The Campbell K-8
                                         and Campbell 9-12 districts will be able to accommodate the
                                         relatively modest gain in students from the City by modifying
                                         school catchment areas, busing and adding modular classrooms.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      In addition to existing facilities, a 15,700-square-foot Northside
                      Branch Library was approved for development in Rivermark.
                      The design phase is scheduled to begin in 2010. Land has been
                      set aside for this purpose.
                      Additional library facilities may be needed to meet the demand
                      from the addition of approximately 33,000 new residents
                      anticipated as a result of this General Plan. Given that the large
                      Central Park Library facility is located in the southern portion
                      of the City, it is relatively close to, and could serve, anticipated
                      new development along El Camino Real, Homestead Road,
                      Kiely Boulevard and Stevens Creek Boulevard. New library
                      facilities may, however, be needed to serve the anticipated
                      development in the northern portion of the City. This will need
                      to be evaluated as part of the comprehensive planning process
                      for new residential development in the Future Focus Areas.
                      Arts, Cultural and Community Facilities
                      New growth as a result of the implementation of the General
                      Plan is expected to increase the demand for arts, cultural and
                      community facilities. This future demand does not, however,
                      appear to exceed the existing service capacity or generate the
                      need for additional facilities particularly when the City can
                      optimize the use of streets or other existing neighborhood
                      amenities for community events.
                      The City benefits from the following arts and cultural facilities:
                          •    Berryessa Adobe is the City’s oldest adobe structure which
                               features documents, objects, and other artifacts from the
                               era before California’s Statehood in 1850. It was purchased
                               and restored by the City, and is open to tours as a historic
                               resource for the community.
                          •    de Saisset Museum, part of Santa Clara University (SCU),
                               is open and free to the public with art and California’s
                               native history exhibits.
                          •    Harris-Lass Historic Preserve was purchased and restored
                               by the City and the Historic Preservation Society of Santa
                               Clara to provide a community resource that demonstrates
                               the City’s history as a farming community.
                          •    Headen-Inman House was originally part of the Headen
                               estate and moved to its current location in the Civic
                               Center in 1985. The Craftsman Bungalow museum house,

               new development.
Schools and Community Facilities Policies
5.9.2-P1       Provide a diverse range of community, art, cultural
               and recreational facilities to meet the varying
               needs of residents in the City, including youth and
               seniors.
5.9.2-P2       Periodically evaluate library services and facilities
               in order to respond to changing community
               demands.
5.9.2-P3       Provide library services that are accessible and
               of adequate size to serve community residents,
               particularly for Future Focus Areas, north of the
               Caltrain corridor.
5.9.2-P4       Work with the school districts as part of the
               planning process for Future Focus Areas.
5.9.2-P5       Coordinate with Santa Clara Unified School
               District, Santa Clara University and Mission

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.9.3          Public Services Goals and Policies
                      Safety and security are essential and integral to quality of
                      life in a community. Good public safety services play an
                      important role in increasing livability. Crime and disorder in
                      neighborhoods, parks and business districts can cause citizen
                      frustration, uneasiness and fear. Community design elements,
                      including lighting, separation between pedestrians and vehicles,
                      and windows along street frontages, contribute to public safety.
                      Active uses, as well as property maintenance, can help deter
                      crime by providing surveillance and access.
                      Police Services
                      The Santa Clara Police Department (SCPD) has maintained a
                      relatively low crime rate since the mid-1980s. Most common
                      concerns expressed by residents and business representatives
                      are graﬃti, vandalism and drug activity. The Department
                      currently has two police stations: the headquarters located on El
                      Camino Real and a substation in Rivermark, near Agnew Road
                      and De La Cruz Boulevard (shown in Figure 5.9-2). The SCPD
                      also operates the Firearms Training Center, Tech Service Center,
                      and 911 Dispatch.
                      In 2008, the City had 132 sworn police oﬃcers and 76 non-
                      sworn personnel, divided into three divisions: Field Operations
                      Division, Investigations Division, and Administrative Services.
                      The SCPD’s response time standard is three minutes or less for
                      high priority calls. In 2006, the SCPD received 37,600 911 calls,
                      and met this standard.
                      Fire and Life Safety Services
                      The Santa Clara Fire Department (SCFD) headquarters is located
                      at Benton and Alviso streets, as shown in Figure 5.9-2. In 2008,
                      the Department had ten fire stations throughout the City, with
                      179.5 paid personnel and 65 reserve employees. Each station is
                      equipped with at least one three-person engine or ladder truck-
                      company. Three stations also have a two-person ambulance that
                      provides paramedic services. A Rescue Response vehicle and a
                      Hazardous Materials Response vehicle are housed at two other
                      stations. An increase in the City’s senior citizen population could
                      result in additional demands on the Departments’s Emergency
                      Medical Services.

The current SCFD response time standard is a three minute
average for all areas of the City. This response time has resulted
in a Class 2 ISO rating for the City which helps to reduce property
insurance premiums for homeowners and businesses. Neither
current traﬃc flow nor building standards in the City have
impeded SCFD’s service delivery. The City also participates in
the Santa Clara County Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid Response
Plan to further ensure that fires and other emergencies are
handled eﬃciently.
The following goals and policies provide direction for public
services.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.10 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
                      Environment aﬀects quality of life, as well as physical, mental
                      and emotional health. In Santa Clara, environmental conditions,
                      and the patterns of urban and industrial development, can
                      pose risks to human health and property. General Plan Major
                      Strategies emphasize the importance of health and safety, and
                      provide direction for sustainable, environmentally sensitive
                      development to accommodate the City’s growth based on the
                      implementation of the General Plan. The Goals and Policies in
                      this section promote the protection of existing habitats, maximize
                      solid waste disposal capacity through recycling and composting,
                      conserve energy and water resources, and protect people and
                      property from natural and man-made hazards. The following
                      Goals and Policies are organized based on conservation, air
                      quality, energy, water, hazards and noise.
                      5.10.1         Conservation Goals and Policies
                      This section includes a description of the City’s plants, fish and
                      wildlife, including special-status species, as well as a discussion
                      of planning issues and implications related to biological
                      resources and the regulations that protect them.
                      Biological Resources
                      Most of Santa Clara is developed with few open spaces and very
                      little remaining native habitat. Landscaped areas can provide
                      some habitat value to common native species, particularly birds
                      and insects. Native habitats have largely been replaced with
                      urban hardscape accompanied by ornamental landscaping. As
                      a result, natural habitats in the City are not representative of
                      the biological diversity found throughout the Bay Area. One
                      important exception is the Ulistac Natural Area, 40 acres of
                      open space located along the Guadalupe River that is owned
                      and maintained by the City. Ulistac contains restored native
                      grassland, riparian woodland, emergent wetland and other
                      habitats.
                      Grassland
                      Non-native annual grassland is the most common “natural
                      community” in the City of Santa Clara. This habitat type is often
                      called ruderal, or disturbed, and is composed almost entirely of
                      annual grasses and other herbaceous species. Ruderal grassland

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                                                       5
areas can be found in freeway cloverleaf areas, along roadways,
and in vacant, undeveloped urban lots. They occasionally oﬀer
suitable habitat for Congdon’s tarplant, a special-status plant
species.6 Other special-status plant species are unlikely to occur
in the City because of the limited undeveloped land available.
Riparian
Three major waterways flow through the City. Calabazas Creek
runs along the west boundary of the City and the Guadalupe
River defines its northeast boundary. San Tomas Aquino Creek
and its largest tributary, Saratoga Creek, also pass through the
City. All of these creeks have been modified for flood control
purposes. As a result, there is limited native riparian vegetation
along these creek corridors, providing the City an opportunity
to restore habitat in these areas.
Wildlife
Few special status wildlife species are likely to be present in the
City because of the available natural habitats. The Western pond
turtle, American peregrine falcon, Cooper’s hawk and Saltmarsh
Common Yellowthroat are special-status wildlife species listed
as having a moderate potential to occur in the City. Ruderal
grassland areas in the City support the Western burrowing owl,
also a special-status wildlife species. Although the grassland
areas do not support many other native wildlife species, they
can be a refuge for many common species, such as raccoon, dark-      Very little vacant land remains in the
                                                                     City [top]. Natural habitats have been
eyed junco, lesser goldfinch and many others.

The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB           The Heritage Tree Inventory helps to
939) mandated cities and counties to divert 50 percent of all        protect older significant trees in the
                                                                     City [bottom].
solid waste by 2000 through source reduction, recycling and
composting activities. The City of Santa Clara met this threshold,
diverting 52 percent (174,579 of the 340,894 tons)7 of its solid
waste in 2006. General Plan Goals and Policies encourage an
increase in solid waste diversion and in recycling.
Collection
In 2008, Santa Clara’s solid waste and commercial recycling
from properties zoned for institutional and commercial uses
is collected by Mission Trail Waste Systems (MTWS). MTWS

         GENERAL PLAN
                      also provides residential waste, as well as recycling collection.8
                      Stevens Creek Disposal & Recycling provides residential
                      recycling pickup. These collection providers have contracts that
                      expire on December 31, 2010 and January 10, 2020, respectively.
                      Solid waste and recycling collection for industrially-zoned
                      properties in the City are provided by eight non-exclusive
                      franchise industrial refuse handlers. The majority of the
                      collection service is provided by MTWS, Allied Waste, Green
                      Waste Recovery and Los Gatos Garbage Company.
                      Disposal
                      The City of Santa Clara has disposal agreements for residential,
                      commercial and institutional property generated waste with the
                      Newby Island landfill that runs through 2024, as well as with
                      other landfills located outside of Santa Clara County.9 The Santa
                      Clara County Integrated Waste Management Plan estimates
                      that there is adequate waste capacity through its planning
                      horizon of 2024. An expansion of the Newby Island landfill is
                      being evaluated. Increases in recycling and reductions in waste
                      generation could prolong the life of the landfill. In addition, a
                      prerequisite for new residential development in Phase III of this
                      General Plan requires that the City identify adequate solid waste
                      disposal sites. The City owns property outside its jurisdictional
                      boundaries that could potentially provide this service.
                      Wastewater Conveyance and Treatment
                      The City of Santa Clara Departments of Public Works and Water
                      and Sewer Utilities are responsible for the wastewater collection
                      system within the City. Wastewater is collected by sewer systems
                      in Santa Clara and is conveyed by pipelines to the San José-Santa
                      Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), located in San José.
                      The WPCP is used by other cities within Santa Clara County and
                      has available capacity to treat up to 167 million gallons per day
                      (mgd). The WPCP presently operates at an average dry weather
                      flow of 109 mgd, which is 58 mgd (or 35 percent) under its 167
                      mgd treatment capacity.10
                      Approximately ten percent of the total treated wastewater from
                      the WPCP is routed into the South Bay Water Recycling pipelines

                                                                         5
for use in landscaping irrigation, dual plumbing, industrial
uses and other approved uses around the southern Bay Area.
Recycled water distribution pipelines are located throughout
the City. The treated water not routed into the South Bay Water
Recycling pipelines is discharged into the southern portion of
San Francisco Bay.
The Plant Master Plan addresses the City’s sewage treatment
plant capacity and operational needs, recommends a long-
term capital improvement program, and sets the sanitary sewer
treatment connection fees required from developers to cover the
cost of the treatment plant.

               from 48 inches above-grade on private and public
               property as well as in the public right-of-way.
5.10.1-P5      Encourage enhancement of land adjacent to creeks
               in order to foster the reinstatement of natural
               riparian corridors where possible.
                                                                      Page 5-125

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.10.1-P6      Require adequate wastewater treatment and sewer
                                     conveyance capacity for all new development.
                      5.10.1-P7      Encourage the use of local recycling facilities to
                                     divert waste from landfills.
                      5.10.1-P8      Encourage a 90 percent reduction per capita for
                                     solid waste tonnage from 2010-2025.
                      5.10.1-P9      Encourage curbside recycling and composting of
                                     organic and yard waste.
                      5.10.1-P10     Promote the reduction, recycling and safe disposal
                                     of household hazardous wastes through public
                                     education and awareness and through an increase
                                     in hazardous waste collection events.
                      5.10.1-P11     Require use of native plants and wildlife-
                                     compatible non-native plants, when feasible, for
                                     landscaping on City property.
                      5.10.1-P12     Encourage property owners and landscapers to
                                     use native plants and wildlife-compatible non-
                                     native plants, when feasible.
                      5.10.2          Air Quality Goals and Policies
                      Potential air pollution in the Santa Clara Valley is high due to
                      its large population and automobile use. The Valley is a major
                      source of carbon monoxide, particulate and photochemical air
                      pollution in the Bay Area. In addition, vehicle emissions and
                      industrial air pollution from San Francisco, San Mateo and
                      Alameda counties can be carried along by the prevailing winds
                      to the Santa Clara Valley. Pollution in the southeast portion of
                      the Valley tends to be the worst due to wind patterns and limited
                      air flow at the Gabilan and Diablo ranges which form the Santa
                      Clara Valley.
                      Bay Area Air Basin
                      Santa Clara is located in the southern portion of the Bay Area Air
                      Basin, which includes most of the nine-county Bay Area. Air basin
                      quality is monitored by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
                      District (BAAQMD), which operates a regional network of
                      air pollution monitoring stations to determine whether or not
                      the federal and State standards for criteria air pollutants and
                      emission limits of toxic air contaminants are being achieved.
                      Required by the passage of the federal Clean Air Act in 1977,
                      the Environmental Protection Agency identified six criteria air

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                           5
pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur
dioxide, particulate matter and lead, which are pervasive in
urban environments and for which State and national health-
based ambient air quality standards have been established.
The Bay Area, as a whole, is considered in attainment for all
national standards, except for ozone. It is in nonattainment for
State standards for ozone and particulate matter. The air quality
monitoring station closest to Santa Clara is located six miles
away in San José.11
Toxic air contaminants are airborne substances capable of
adversely aﬀecting human health. They are emitted from a variety
of common sources, including gasoline stations, automobiles, dry
cleaners, industrial operations, hospital sterilizers and painting
operations. BAAQMD regulates toxic air contaminants from
stationary sources through its permit process. Mobile sources of
toxic air contaminants are regulated indirectly through vehicle
emissions standards and through fuel specifications. Cities play
a role in reducing public exposure to toxic air contaminants by
enforcing zoning ordinances and ensuring proper buﬀer zones
between stationary sources that emit toxic contaminants and
sensitive receptors located down wind. As of 2003, there were
no facilities located in Santa Clara identified as a significant risk
for toxic air contaminants.12
BAAQMD began preparing the 2009 Bay Area Clean Air Plan in
2008 in accordance with the requirements of the California Clean
Air Act. The Plan will address the eﬀectiveness of ozone control
measures on particulate matter, air toxins and greenhouse gases
(GHGs) in order to implement feasible measures to reduce
ozone. The Clean Air Plan will also establish emission control
measures.
Greenhouse Gases
Gases that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere are called
greenhouse gases (GHGs). These gases play a critical role in
determining the earth’s surface temperature. Part of the solar
radiation that enters the earth’s atmosphere from space is
absorbed by the earth’s surface. The earth reflects this radiation
back toward space, but GHGs absorb some of the radiation. As
a result, radiation that otherwise would have escaped back into
space is retained, resulting in a warming of the atmosphere.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      Without natural GHGs, the earth’s surface would be about
                      61°F cooler (CCAT, 2006). This phenomenon is known as the
                      greenhouse eﬀect. However, many scientists believe that
                      emissions from human activities, such as the generation of
                      electricity and the use of automobiles, have unnaturally elevated
                      the concentration of these GHGs in the atmosphere, contributing
                      to global climate change.
                      The City of Santa Clara General Plan has Goals and Policies
                      to address sustainability (see Appendix 8.13: Sustainability
                      Goals and Policies Matrix) aimed in part at reducing the City’s
                      contribution to GHG emissions. Policies within the Land Use and
                      Mobility and Transportation sections also reduce air pollutants,
                      by encouraging alternative transportation modes, sustainable
                      building practices and other energy eﬃciency measures.
                      Air Quality Goals
                      5.10.2-G1      Improved air quality in Santa Clara and the
                                     region.
                      5.10.2-G2      Reduced greenhouse gas emissions that meet
                                     the State and regional goals and requirements to
                                     combat climate change.
                      Air Quality Policies
                      5.10.2-P1      Support alternative transportation modes and
                                     eﬃcient parking mechanisms to improve air
                                     quality.
                      5.10.2-P2      Encourage development patterns that reduce
                                     vehicle miles traveled and air pollution.
                      5.10.2-P3      Encourage implementation of technological
                                     advances that minimize public health hazards and
                                     reduce the generation of air pollutants.
                      5.10.2-P4      Encourage measures to reduce greenhouse gas
                                     emissions to reach 30 percent below 1990 levels by
                                     2020.
                      5.10.2-P5      Promote regional air pollution prevention plans
                                     for local industry and businesses.
                      5.10.2-P6      Require “Best Management            Practices” for
                                     construction dust abatement.

5.10.3            Energy Goals and Policies
Although the City is largely built-out and future growth
will be accommodated almost entirely through infill and
redevelopment, development associated with the General Plan
will nonetheless consume energy using oil and natural gas,
electricity and transportation. Multiple aspects of the General
Plan have energy implications, including land use, housing,
transportation and water usage. Goals and policies throughout
the Plan encourage reduced energy use.
Electricity and Natural Gas
The City of Santa Clara owns and operates the municipal electric
utility, a department of the City, also known as Silicon Valley
Power (SVP). SVP maintains over 288 miles of underground
and 162 miles of overhead distribution lines and has 51,000
electric meters in its service area.13 Electricity is provided from
various sources, including natural gas, wind and hydroelectric
generation resources in California and other western states.14
Through the Santa Clara Green Power Program, a voluntary
renewable energy program from SVP, residents and businesses
can choose renewable energy for 100 percent of their energy
usage. In 2009, 30 percent of the electricity provided by SVP was
renewable; by 2020, anticipating additional users, SVP aims to
increase renewable sources to a third of all electricity provided.15
The City’s natural gas is provided by Pacific Gas & Electric
Company (PG&E) via natural gas lines stretching from Oregon
to Arizona. Gas is delivered from basins in California, Canada
and the Western United States by transmission mains.
Fuel
Transportation accounts for 41 percent of California’s overall
energy use.16 If transportation patterns remain similar to current
patterns, total vehicle miles traveled will increase due to the
projected population increase, but total fuel use should decline
as automobile fuel eﬃciency improves, and per capita vehicle
miles traveled may decrease as alternative transportation options
become more viable and convenient through implementation of
the General Plan.

          GENERAL PLAN
                                  The City has some control over the production and supply
                                  of energy resources through its ownership and operation of
                                  SVP. In addition, the General Plan includes policies to address
                                  energy consumption through a mix of land uses and alternate
                                  transportation options which support an increase in the eﬃcient
                                  movement of people and goods. Through the implementation
                                  of sustainably oriented goals and policies (Appendix 8.13), Santa
                                  Clara can also positively aﬀect energy supply and consumption

5.10.4          Water Goals and Policies
The provision of water is critical to the City’s future. To oﬀ-
set increased demand associated with the implementation of
the General Plan, the City of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara
Valley Water District (SCVWD) have instituted a series of water
conservation measures. These measures are designed to reduce
water use and include public education programs, distribution
of water conservation kits, regulation of water waste, rebates
for high-water-eﬃciency toilets and washers, and rebates for
water-eﬃcient residential irrigation systems and water-eﬃcient
landscaping. In addition, the City has measures to ensure
adequate supply and distribution of water resources built into
the prerequisites of this General Plan.
Water Supply
The City of Santa Clara receives its potable water supply from
a combination of the City of San Francisco’s Hetch-Hetchy
aqueduct system, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, and
groundwater from City-owned wells. Groundwater contributes
almost 70 percent of the City’s supply. Santa Clara also uses
recycled wastewater for certain landscape irrigation, industrial
and construction purposes.
                                                                   Page 5-131

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      Prior to development in the Santa Clara Valley, groundwater flow
                      largely paralleled surface-water drainage. In the early years of
                      the 20th century, the pressure surface was above the Valley floor
                      elevation in much of the area, and artesian wells were common.
                      By the late 1960s, heavy use of groundwater had lowered the
                      water table by more than 200 feet, resulting in subsidence and
                      detectable saltwater incursion as much as ten miles inland.
                      These trends, however, were reversed by increased reliance on
                      imported surface water and improved water management in the
                      last three decades.17 Currently, water production wells in the
                      Santa Clara Valley average about 278 feet in depth below ground
                      surface, and yield an average of 425 gallons per minute.
                      The City’s Water and Utilities Department reports that City
                      production wells consistently meet the applicable water quality
                      criteria. Total dissolved solids are reportedly not a concern for
                      the City, in contrast to other areas adjacent to San Francisco Bay
                      where saltwater intrusion has been an issue. Even with the
                      long agricultural history of the Santa Clara Valley, nitrates have
                      not been a problem and are below one-half of allowable levels
                      in water extracted from City wells. Manganese, a naturally
                      occurring metal in groundwater, has been detected at one future
                      well. The City is installing a manganese removal system prior to
                      putting the well into production.18
                      There were no water use restrictions in the City for the past
                      ten years, indicating that water supply has kept pace with the
                      growing population of the City.19 The City’s 2005 Urban Water
                      Master Plan (UWMP) projects that with conservation programs
                      in place, demand for water in 2030 will be approximately 36,337
                      acre feet (af). The UWMP is updated every five years and
                      projects water demand over a 25-year horizon. The 2010 update
                      will include demand projections for 2035.
                      For the Santa Clara Valley as a whole, the UMWP concludes
                      that the Santa Clara Valley Water District cannot meet demands
                      through 2030 without significant investments to preserve the
                      District’s current mix of water supplies. In addition to protecting
                      these existing sources, the District must make investments

in new water supplies and maximize opportunities for water
conservation.20 The General Plan focuses on conservation and
expansion of recycled water infrastructure. Prerequisite Goals
and Policies require water availability prior to the implementation
of each phase.
Water Recycling
Recycled water comprises approximately ten percent of the
City’s overall water supply. It is supplied from the San José/
Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), which is an
advanced tertiary treatment plant. Even though WPCP eﬄuent
water meets California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 22
Division 4 requirements for “unrestricted use,” recycled water
is not used for potable supply. Its primary use is irrigation of
large turf areas at golf courses, parks and schools. Several City
industries also use recycled water as industrial process water, for
cooling towers, or for toilet flushing in dual-plumbed buildings.
In addition, the City’s electric utility operates a 147-MW power
plant that uses recycled water exclusively for cooling and steam
for power production.21
Water Goals
5.10.4-G1      A reliable, safe supply of potable water adequate
               to meet present and future needs.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.10.4-P4     Require an adequate water supply and water
                                    quality for all new development.
                      5.10.4-P5     Prohibit new development that would reduce
                                    water quality below acceptable State and local
                                    standards.
                      5.10.4-P6     Maximize        the use of recycled water for
                                    construction, maintenance, irrigation and other
                                    appropriate applications.
                      5.10.4-P7     Require installation of native and low-water-
                                    consumption plant species when landscaping new
                                    development and public spaces to reduce water
                                    usage.
                      5.10.4-P8     Require all new development within a reasonable
                                    distance of existing or proposed recycled water
                                    distribution systems to connect to the system for
                                    landscape irrigation.
                      5.10.4-P9     Work with Santa Clara Valley Water District to
                                    improve the Santa Clara Distributary.
                      5.10.4-P10    Work with Santa Clara Valley Water District to
                                    minimize undesirable compaction of aquifers and
                                    subsidence of soils.
                      5.10.4-P11    Require that any unused wells be abandoned
                                    properly.
                      5.10.4-P12    Encourage diversion of run-oﬀ from downspouts,
                                    and replacement of hardscapes to landscaped
                                    areas and permeable surfaces.
                      5.10.5         Safety Goals and Policies
                      This section, and related goals and policies, identify potential
                      hazards and measures that can lessen risks for the City’s
                      population and property from seismic activity, geologic and soil
                      conditions, flooding, toxic chemicals, fires and air traﬃc.
                      Emergency Preparedness
                      Emergency preparedness is an eﬀective method of reducing risk
                      to life and property from natural disasters, such as earthquakes
                      or fires, through planning. In Santa Clara, planning for
                      emergency response has resulted in the adoption of the Local
                      Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP), in conformance with the
                      Federal Disaster Mitigation Act (DMA).
Page 5-134

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                             5
In 2003, the federal Disaster Mitigation Act22 established a
national hazard mitigation program to reduce the loss of life and
property, human suﬀering, economic disruption and disaster
assistance costs resulting from natural disasters. The DMA also
provided a source of pre-disaster hazard mitigation funding
to assist local governments in implementing eﬀective hazard
mitigation measures to ensure the continued functionality
of critical services and facilities after a natural disaster. In
accordance with the DMA, local agencies are required to adopt
a LHMP to be eligible for Federal Emergency Management
Authority (FEMA) funding for pre-disaster hazard mitigation
and projects that prevent disaster.
The City of Santa Clara participated in the Multi-Jurisdictional
Regional Hazard Mitigation Plan entitled, Taming Natural
Disasters, developed in cooperation with other local agencies
and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The
Plan provides jurisdiction-specific information that has been
reviewed and approved by FEMA.
Seismic, Geologic, and Soil Hazards
The San Francisco Bay Area is a seismically active region with
numerous active faults. No active faults run through the City,
although several are present in the surrounding region. The City
is seven miles from both the San Andreas and Calaveras faults,
and five miles from the Hayward Fault. Other principal faults
are also located in the Bay Area. Although the risk of surface
fault rupture is considered low, the City could experience ground
shaking in the event of an earthquake. Geologists with the
U.S. Geological Survey and other agencies foresee a 62 percent
probability of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake in the San
Francisco Bay region before 2032.23 Further, the State continues to
revise and update its Earthquake Fault Zoning Maps to identify
any new faults in the region.
As shown in Figure 5.10-1, the City is almost entirely within a
liquefaction hazard zone. Development in a liquefaction hazard
zone requires adherence to the guidelines for evaluating and
addressing seismic hazards as required by Public Resources Code
Section 2695(a). Before a development permit can be granted

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      within this zone, a geotechnical investigation of the site must be
                      conducted and appropriate measures, such as edge containment
                      structures, driving piles or treatment of soils, incorporated into
                      the project design.
                      The General Plan recognizes these seismic hazards and provides
                      policies to address safety for earthquake activity and geologic
                      conditions. In addition, the City has adopted the California
                      Building Code with local amendments, which is implemented
                      and enforced by the City’s Building Inspection Division. The
                      Building Code includes provisions to address appropriate
                      design and construction in seismically active areas. It also
                      includes provisions to ensure that foundation and building
                      design is appropriate to site soil conditions, including standards
                      to address expansive soils conditions.
                      Flooding and Drainage
                      Flooding
                      Flood zone mapping by the Federal Emergency Management
                      Authority (FEMA) indicates that approximately ten percent of
                      the City is located within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA),
                      as shown in Figure 5.10-2. Development may occur within the
                      SFHA, provided it complies with local floodplain management
                      ordinances and meets the minimum federal requirements.
                      Policies to reduce hazards associated with flooding and to
                      monitor potential sea level rising as a result of global warming
                      are included in the General Plan. In addition, the City has
                      adopted the Flood Damage Prevention Code, 1987 ed., to address
                      requirements for flood protection.
                      Drainage
                      Surface water drainage in the City is primarily into the Guadalupe
                      River, San Tomas Aquino Creek, Saratoga Creek and Calabazas
                      Creek, all of which originate in the largely undeveloped Santa
                      Cruz Mountains and drain northward across the urbanized
                      Santa Clara Valley floor to discharge into San Francisco Bay.
                      Within the City, all four of these regionally important streams
                      have been substantially channelized and modified to reduce
                      flood hazards.
                      The City’s storm drain system consists of curb inlets that collect
                      and channel surface water, from rainfall and other sources,
                      into a series of pipelines beneath City roadways. Stormwater
                      is conveyed through these underground pipelines to the
                      channelized creeks within the City, which then direct flow into
                      the San Francisco Bay.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      Urban Runoff
                      The City of Santa Clara participates in the regional program
                      for the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoﬀ Pollution Prevention
                      Program (SCVURPPP), which includes members from twelve
                      other cities and towns, the County of Santa Clara, and the Santa
                      Clara Valley Water District that collectively discharge stormwater
                      to San Francisco Bay. Like other members of SCVURPPP, Santa
                      Clara is committed to improving water quality in the Bay
                      and streams by reducing urban runoﬀ pollution through the
                      implementation of the City’s Urban Runoﬀ Management Plan
                      (URMP). The City’s URMP, along with other local Urban Runoﬀ
                      Management Plans, collectively constitute the regional plan that
                      conforms to the federal requirements of the National Pollution
                      Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. This regional
                      plan is the basis for the NPDES permit issued by the San Francisco
                      Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). This
                      permit requires all members, including the City of Santa Clara,
                      to implement programs that reduce urban runoﬀ pollution by
                      targeting pollutant reduction and surface flow prevention from
                      urban activities and development. Implementation of the City’s
                      UWMP also includes promoting public awareness and clean up
                      eﬀorts as well as monitoring local streams and storm drains to
                      determine the eﬀectiveness of the program.
                      Hazardous Materials
                      Hazardous material generation, use, storage, disposal and
                      transport can pose hazards to the environment and public health
                      if improperly handled. Sites where previous, ongoing or future
                      activities have, or will result in known or suspected release of
                      hazardous materials into air, soil or groundwater are concerns
                      for exposure to humans and potential environmental damage.
                      Uses that generate hazardous waste related to solvents and
                      petroleum fluids include auto body shops, machine shops, and
                      auto dismantlers. Other hazardous materials related to the use,
                      storage, transport and generation of toxic chemicals in Santa
                      Clara occur in employment areas north of the Caltrain corridor.
                      Figure 5.10-3, indicates sites identified in 2008 that are subject
                      to some investigation, remediation, operation or monitoring for
                      potential soil or groundwater contamination. Unknown future
                      contaminants may also require actions to ensure environmental
                      protection.
                      In addition to City ordinances and safety practices, the
                      implementation of General Plan policies will provide some

         GENERAL PLAN
                      protection from exposure to both existing and future hazardous
                      materials, restrict future development of property, and require
                      appropriate remediation.
                      Fire Hazards
                      The City of Santa Clara does not have the terrain or vegetation
                      conditions for large or devastating wildfires. However, urban
                      fires pose some hazard. The implementation of General Plan
                      policies will reduce this threat. In addition, the City requires
                      all new development and subdivisions to meet or exceed the
                      provisions of the California Fire Code with local amendments.
                      For example, to accommodate access by fire apparatus,
                      roadways are required to have a minimum width of 20 feet and a
                      minimum turning radius of 36 feet. Other requirements include
                      fire sprinklers for structures over a specified size and height or
                      with a specified type of use, as well as minimum standards for
                      construction and water pressure. A discussion of and policies
                      concerning the Fire Department and firefighting services are
                      included in Section 5.9: Public Facilities and Services.
                      Airport Hazards
                      The Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport (Airport)
                      is located to the east of, and adjacent to, the City. While its
                      proximity is an asset, airport activities also represent potential
                      risks related to noise and safety. A discussion of and policies
                      concerning Airport related noise and other noise sources may be
                      found in Section 5.10-6: Noise Goals and Policies.
                      Safety Zones
                      Airport safety is primarily related to potential damage to
                      property and injury the event of an aircraft accident. It can
                      involve the distribution and type of land uses in order to enable
                      safe aircraft take-oﬀ and landing, particularly under emergency
                      conditions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
                      Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) have established Safety
                      Zones, and associated policies, for land uses and structures based
                      on the risk for aircraft accidents in these Zones. Portions of the
                      City are located within the designated Safety Zones identified
                      in the ALUC’s adopted land use plan, including the Runway
                      Protection Zone, Inner Safety Zone, Turning Safety Zone, Outer
                      Safety Zone and Traﬃc Pattern Zone. These zones are defined in
                      Appendix 8.2: Definitions and Acronyms.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      Airspace Protection
                      Airspace protection addresses land use features that can
                      contribute to aircraft accidents. Most critical are tall structures
                      that penetrate the navigable airspace around an airport. Other
                      physical, visual and electronic land use features, however, can
                      also create airspace hazards.
                      The navigable airspace around an airport is delineated in
                      accordance with standards set forth in Federal Aviation
                      Regulations (FAR) Part 77. These regulations define a set
                      of imaginary surfaces around an airport. Any object that
                      penetrates one of the imaginary airspace surfaces is considered
                      an obstruction.       California State law precludes airspace
                      obstructions without a permit from the State or approval from
                      the FAA. Other hazards to aircraft include bird strikes. Because
                      of widespread concern, the FAA recommends that uses known
                      to attract birds, such as sanitary landfills, water retention areas
                      and certain crops, be kept at least 10,000 feet from any runway
                      used by turbine-powered aircraft.
                      The FAA has not set any precise standards defining land use
                      characteristics for visual or electronic hazards. In general, visual
                      hazards include sources of dust, steam, smoke or glare that can
                      impair visibility, as well as light sources that can be mistaken
                      for airport lights. Electronic hazards are those that can cause
                      interference with aircraft communications or navigation.

                                     for safety.
                      Safety Policies
                      5.10.5-P1      Use the City’s Local Hazard Mitigation Plan as the
                                     guide for emergency preparedness in Santa Clara.
                      5.10.5-P2      Work with school districts and other public/quasi
                                     public building owners to use facilities as shelters
                                     in the event of emergencies.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.10.5-P35    Establish minimum buﬀers between odor sources
                                    and new residential or other uses with sensitive
                                    receptors, consistent with BAAQMD guidelines,
                                    unless a project-specific study demonstrates that
                                    these risks can be reduced to acceptable levels.
                      5.10.6         Noise Goals and Policies
                      Unacceptable noise is defined as a sound, or series of sounds,
                      that are intrusive, irritating, objectionable and/or disruptive to
                      daily life. Factors that can influence human response to noise
                      include the intensity, frequency, and time patterns, the presence
                      of background noise, and the nature of activity exposed to
                      the noise. Noise in the vicinity of sensitive uses, such as
                      residences, motels and hotels, schools, libraries, churches,
                      hospitals, nursing homes, auditoriums, natural areas, parks
                      and open spaces, is generally more objectionable than noise in
                      less sensitive commercial and industrial areas. Consequently,
                      noise standards for sensitive land uses are more stringent than
                      those for less sensitive uses. Santa Clara’s standards are based
                      on db CNEL, which is defined as a unit of measurement used to
                      express the relative intensity of sound as heard by the human
                      ear, averaged over a 24-hour period to estimate the community
                      noise equivalent level. Appendix 8.14 provides more details on
                      noise measurements.
                      Noise Levels and Sources
                      Figures 5.10-4 and 5.10-5 reflect the 2008 noise level contours in
                      the City of Santa Clara. The roadway and railroad noise levels in
                      Figure 5.10-4 are based in part on a series of noise measurements
                      made in 2008 as part of the background work for this General Plan.
                      Airport noise contours in Figure 5.10-5 are mapped separately
                      based on information from the Airport Land Use Commission’s
                      Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Noise from transportation
                      sources, including vehicles, trains and aircraft, are factors in
                      determining the noise environment of the City. The quietest
                      areas of the City are those furthest from major City streets,
                      while the noisiest areas are under the airport flight pattern and
                      immediately adjacent to freeways and railways. Future noise
                      contours, included in the General Plan Environmental Impact
                      Report, reflect projected noise based on future traﬃc volumes as
                      a result of implementation of General Plan land uses, as well as
                      projected railroad and Airport operations.

Noise Exposure Standards
State Regulations
Section 1207 of the 2007 California Building Code contains
the State Noise Insulation Standards, which specify interior
noise standards for new hotels, motels, apartment houses and
dwellings other than single-family homes. Such new structures
must be designed to reduce interior noise levels attributable to
exterior sources to a maximum of 45 dB CNEL in any habitable
room. In areas subject to exterior noise levels greater than 60
dB CNEL, these regulations require an acoustical analysis
demonstrating that dwelling units have been designed to
meet this interior standard. The noise standards are enforced
through the City’s General Plan policies and the building permit
application process.
Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan            TABLE 5.10-1: NOISE AND LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
Standards
The      ALUC         Comprehensive
Land Use Plan contains noise
compatibility and guidelines for
noise/land use compatibility in the
vicinity of the Airport and defines a
Noise Restriction Area as the 65 dB
CNEL contour. Portions of the City
of Santa Clara are within this Noise
Restriction Area.
City of Santa Clara Noise Standards
General Plan noise standards in the
City of Santa Clara are shown on
Table 5.10-1. These noise standards
are consistent with accepted
State standards and apply to all
areas of the City, including those
within Airport noise contours. To
regulate noise exposure levels,
land uses are classified as being
either     “normally     acceptable”,
“conditionally      acceptable”    or
“normally unacceptable” as defined
below. All outdoor land uses are
compatible at noise exposure less
than 60 dB CNEL and all indoor
uses are compatible at less than 45
dB CNEL.
                                                                                           Page 5-147

         GENERAL PLAN
                                     Normally Acceptable
                                     Indoor Uses: Activities associated with the land use are inherently
                                     noisy or standard construction methods suﬃciently attenuate
                                     exterior noise to 45 dB CNEL indoors for sensitive land uses
                                     or 50 db CNEL for oﬃces, retail and other less sensitive indoor
                                     spaces.
                                     Outdoor Uses: Outdoor activities associated with the land use
                                     may be carried out with minimal interference.
                                     Conditionally Acceptable
                                     Indoor Uses: Noise reduction measures must be incorporated into
                                     the design to attenuate exterior noise to the normally acceptable
                                     levels for indoor noise.
                                     Outdoor Uses: Noise reduction measures must be incorporated
                                     into the design to attenuate exterior noise to normally acceptable
                                     levels. Acceptability is dependent upon characteristics of the
                                     use.
                                     Normally Unacceptable
                                     Indoor Uses: Extensive noise reduction techniques are required
                                     to reduce indoor noise to normally acceptable levels and noise
                                     level reduction methods to meet these standards are diﬃcult or
                                     infeasible.
                                     Outdoor Uses: Severe noise interference makes the outdoor
                                     environment unacceptable for activities. Noise level reductions
                                     necessary to attenuate exterior noise to normally acceptable
                                     levels are diﬃcult or infeasible.

Noise Goals
5.10.6-G1      Noise sources restricted to minimize impacts in
               the community.
5.10.6-G2      Sensitive uses protected from noise intrusion.
5.10.6-G3      Land use, development and design approvals that
               take noise levels into consideration.
Noise Policies
5.10.6-P1      Review all land use and development proposals
               for consistency with the General Plan compatibility
               standards and acceptable noise exposure levels
               defined on Table 5.10-1.
5.10.6-P2      Incorporate noise attenuation measures for all
               projects that have noise exposure levels greater
               than General Plan “normally acceptable” levels, as
               defined on Table 5.10-1.
5.10.6-P3      New development should include noise control
               techniques to reduce noise to acceptable levels,
               including site layout (setbacks, separation and
               shielding), building treatments (mechanical
               ventilation system, sound-rated windows, solid
               core doors and baﬄing) and structural measures
               (earthen berms and sound walls).
5.10.6-P4      Encourage the control of noise at the source
               through site design, building design, landscaping,
               hours of operation and other techniques.
5.10.6-P5      Require noise-generating uses near residential
               neighborhoods to include solid walls and heavy
               landscaping along common property lines, and to
               place compressors and mechanical equipment in
               sound-proof enclosures.
5.10.6-P6      Discourage noise sensitive uses, such as residences,
               hospitals, schools, libraries and rest homes, from
               areas with high noise levels, and discourage high
               noise generating uses from areas adjacent to
               sensitive uses.
5.10.6-P7      Implement measures to reduce interior noise levels
               and restrict outdoor activities in areas subject to
               aircraft noise in order to make Oﬃce/Research and
               Development uses compatible with the Norman Y.
               Mineta International Airport land use restrictions.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.10.6-P8      Continue to encourage safe and compatible land
                                     uses within the Norman Y. Mineta International
                                     Airport Noise Restriction Area.
                      5.10.6-P9      Work with the City of San José Norman Y. Mineta
                                     International Airport to implement mitigation
                                     from aircraft noise to the fullest extent possible.
                      5.10.6-P10     Encourage transit agencies to develop and apply
                                     noise reduction technologies for their vehicles to
                                     reduce the noise and vibration impacts of Caltrain,
                                     Bay Area Rapid Transit, future High Speed Rail,
                                     light rail and bus traﬃc.
                      5.10.6-P11     Develop and include noise reduction measures
                                     with improvements and extensions of City streets.
                      5.11 SUSTAINABILITY
                      The City of Santa Clara’s goal for sustainability is to pursue
                      the principles of sustainable development by “meeting the
                      needs of the present, without compromising the ability of
                      future generations to meet their own needs,” through the
                      implementation of General Plan policies that better the
                      environment and quality of life.24
                      General Plan Major Strategies, as well as Environmental Quality
                      Goals and Policies, emphasize the preservation of natural
                      resources, including air, water, habitat, building materials and
                      non-renewable energy sources; the well-being of all community
                      members; and the fiscal health of the City government and its
                      ability to provide adequate public services. These ultimately
                      will provide the basis for measurement and implementation of
                      sustainable development, as described in Section 5.11.3: General
                      Plan Approach, and in Appendix 8.13: Community Sustainability
                      and Health Goals and Policies. The following sub-sections
                      summarize the City’s leadership in sustainability, in terms of
                      its current policies and programs; describe the regional context
                      and strategies to address climate change and greenhouse gas

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                       5
5.11.1          Santa Clara’s Leadership
For over 40 years, the City of Santa Clara has been a leader in
sustainable innovation. The City has solar energy and recycled
water systems as well as rebates and incentives for energy
eﬃciency and green building. The City has demonstrated a
commitment to improving and expanding the City’s overall
sustainability through initiatives and eﬀorts, some of which are
described below. The General Plan provides policies to support
this existing framework of successful programs.
    • Transit-Oriented Development. Pending and recently
        approved projects support transit-oriented and walkable
        development. Housing has been approved near major
        intersections and walkable centers. Rivermark, located
        north of the Caltrain corridor, represents a successful
        mixed density residential community with convenient
        access to public facilities and neighborhood services.
    • Open Spaces. Eﬀorts towards open space preservation
        include the 40-acre Ulistac Natural Area and the 12-mile
        San Tomas Aquino/Saratoga Creek Trail system that
        extends from the San Francisco Bay into San José.
    • Tree Protection. A tree protection program known as
        Tree City U.S.A. has been supported by the City for the
        past 20 consecutive years.
    • Regional Air Quality. Bay Area Air Quality Management
        District (BAAQMD) prepares the Clean Air Plan to provide
        a comprehensive strategy for reducing air pollution from
        industry, commercial processes, and mobile sources. It
        oﬀers guidelines for evaluating project impacts on air
        quality and also provides a competitive grant program,
        the Transportation Fund for Clean Air, for local projects
        that reduce motor vehicle emissions.
    • U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement. In January
        of 2008, the City signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection
        Agreement in order to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions
        by 5.2 percent below the 1990 levels by 2012, or 29 percent
        from current levels.
    • Sustainable Silicon Valley. Santa Clara is a member
        of this coalition of businesses, governments, and non-
        government organizations working to reduce regional
        carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels
        by 2010.
                                                                    Page 5-153

            GENERAL PLAN
                                       • Renewable Energy. In 2008, 30 percent of the electricity
                                         provided by Silicon Valley Power (SVP) was renewable.
                                         This is substantially higher than the ten percent Statewide
                                         average estimated by the Energy Commission. The City
                                         already exceeds the State goal of 20 percent renewable
                                         energy by 2017. In fact, by 2020, SVP projects that one-
                                         third of the electricity provided will be from renewable
                                         sources.
                                       • Recycled Water. Use of recycled water in the City is
                                         well-established through the recycled water program.
                                         In 2009, the program delivered more than one billion
                                         gallons of recycled water throughout the City for parks,

greenhouse gases.
                                       • Solid Waste Recycling. In 2009, eﬀorts in the City
                                         included a curbside program which collects recyclable
                                         materials and yard clippings. The program has resulted
                                         in diverting over 50 percent of the City’s waste from the
                                         landfill.
                                       • City Council Priorities. The City Council has prioritized
                                         the additional expansion of renewable energy, including
                                         the installation of photovoltaic systems on City-owned
                                         land in order to provide renewable energy directly into
                                         the electric system, a reduction in CO2 emissions from
                                         City Hall buildings by ten percent by 2010, steady fleet
                                         vehicle fuel usage through 2010, and an increase in the
                                         number of high eﬃciency City vehicles. As of 2009, 69
                                         percent of the City’s fleet of non-public safety vehicles is
                                         comprised of alternative fuel/hybrid vehicles.
                                       • Neighborhood Solar Program. Under this program,
                                         SVP matches resident and business contributions for
                                         non-profit solar facilities in the City. Additionally, SVP
                                         provides rebates for local businesses and residents for
                                         the installation of solar electric systems.
                                       • Green Power Program. SVP provides a mechanism for
                                         residents and businesses to pay slightly higher rates to
                                         buy power from 100 percent renewable energy sources,
                                         including solar facilities within the City.

    • Rebates. Rebates are oﬀered by the City for a variety of
        energy-eﬃcient appliances, insulation, lighting, cooling
        and process eﬃciency changes.
    • Optimal Power Use Services (OPUS). This program
        provides assistance to business customers for analysis
        and plans that reduce energy consumption.
    • Green Building. The City requires that development
        proposals submit a completed Leadership in Energy and
        Environmental Design (LEED) or GreenPoint’s Build
        It Green checklist as part of a planning application.
        Although private-sector applicants are not required to
        implement green building practices, City construction
        and renovation projects over 5,000 square feet are
        required to achieve a minimum LEED Silver Certification
        and to recycle at least 50 percent of materials.
5.11.2          Global Climate Change
Global climate change (GCC) is currently one of the most
important, and widely debated, scientific, economic and political
issues in the United States. It is an issue that pervades most
aspects of sustainability, from air and water quality to global
health and habitat preservation. GCC is a change in the average
weather of the Earth that may be measured by wind patterns,
storms, precipitation and temperature. While scientists are
certain that human activities are changing the composition of the
atmosphere and that increasing concentrations of greenhouse
gases (defined in Section 5.10.2: Air Quality), will change the
planet’s climate, they are less certain about the rate and eﬀects.
Nonetheless, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) has reached consensus that GCC is “very likely” caused
by humans, and that hotter temperatures and rising sea levels
will continue for centuries no matter how much humans control
future emissions.25

         GENERAL PLAN
                      Regional and Local Implications
                      According to the California Climate Action Team, accelerating
                      GCC has a number of adverse implications in California.26 These
                      include but are not limited to:
                          • Reduced water supply due to a shrinking Sierra
                               snowpack;
                          • Negative eﬀect on public health due to higher
                               temperatures and increased smog;
                          • Less productive agriculture due to decreasing water
                               storage capacity, rising temperatures as well as increasing
                               salt water intrusion, flooding and pest infestations;
                          • Loss of critical habitats due to modification and
                               destruction from climate changes;
                          • Eroded coastlines and a rise in sea level due to increased
                               temperature;
                          • Increased wildfire risk due to reduced water supplies;
                               and
                          • Increased electricity demand due to human need to
                               counteract the eﬀects of climate change.27
                      26
                         The Climate Action Team (CAT) is made up of representatives from
                      the California Environmental Protection Agency, Business, Transportation
                      and Housing Agency, Department of Food and Agriculture, Resources
                      Agency, Air Resources Board, Energy Commission, and Public Utilities
                      Commission as well as numerous other State Boards and Departments.
                      The CAT works to coordinate statewide eﬀorts to implement global
                      warming emission reduction programs and the State’s Climate Adaptation
                      Strategy. The CAT publishes reports on the progress made toward meeting
                      statewide GHG targets.

Climate Change in California
In December 2009, the California Natural Resources Agency
published the California Climate Adaptation Strategy Report,
which outlines possible solutions that can be implemented
within and across state agencies to promote resiliency to climate
change. The cross-agency report addresses mitigation for both
prevention of climate change with mechanisms such as the
reduction of GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change
with mechanisms such as levees to protect against storm surges
and sea-level rise. The California Climate Adaptation Strategy
Report focuses on the following issues29:
    1. Public Health;
    2. Biodiversity and Habitat;
    3. Oceans and Coastal Resources;
    4. Water Supply;
    5. Agriculture;
    6. Forestry; and
    7. Transportation and Energy Infrastructure.
The report included the preliminary strategies to address local,
regional and Statewide action including the following general
plans and local planning eﬀorts:
    • Communities with general plans should amend their
        plans to assess climate change impacts, identify areas
        most vulnerable to these impacts, and develop reasonable
        and rational risk reduction strategies using the Climate
        Adaptation Strategy as guidance. Every eﬀort should be
        made to provide tools, such as interactive climate impact
        maps, to assist in these local eﬀorts.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      5.11.3          General Plan Approach
                      Sustainability is a primary focus in the Major Strategies and
                      Environmental Goals and Polices of the General Plan. Both
                      provide support for sustainability through the conservation of
                      local and regional resources, as well as through the maintenance
                      of fiscal health and quality public services in the City. The
                      diversity of land uses and the phased General Plan are the
                      foundation for the City’s sustainability approach and primary
                      implementation tools. As a required prerequisite for Phase II, a
                      climate action plan (CAP) will be prepared by the City following
                      the adoption of the General Plan Update. Once completed, the
                      CAP will be included in Appendix 8.13.
                      Summary of General Plan Sustainability Policies
                      Sustainability is a guide for the entire General Plan. It is
                      embedded in each section of the Goals and Policies Chapter,
                      from Land Use and Transportation and Mobility to Historic
                      Preservation and Environmental Quality, as summarized below:
                          • Land Use and Transportation. Policies for an eﬀective
                              transportation and mobility network accommodates cars,
                              transit, walking and biking, combined with an eﬃcient
                              land use pattern that connects community members to
                              basic resources, such as jobs, neighborhood shopping,
                              parks and public services. Mixed uses along major
                              transportation corridors and near transit centers will
                              reduce trip generation, support use of alternative modes,
                              promote public health, improve congestion, and reduce
                              emissions and air pollution.
                          • Air Quality. The City’s land use, transportation, open
                              space and regulatory goals and policies support a
                              reduction in driving, a primary contributor to air
                              pollutants. This should result in reduced trip generation
                              and related emissions, as well in improving public health.
                          • Energy Use. With its public utility, SVP, City policies
                              promote energy eﬃciency programs and incentives,
                              develop cost-eﬀective new alternative power sources,
                              encourage energy conservation, and educate users.
                          • Green Building. The General Plan sustainable building
                              and siting policies will be implemented for all new
                              development and incorporated into the City’s ordinances
                              and regulations, including energy eﬃcient appliances

Chapter Five: GOALS AND POLICIES
                                                                            5
         and materials, recycling of construction materials,
         and the installation of green roofs to reduce energy
         consumption.
    •    Water Conservation. Plan policies promote the use
         of recycled water for construction, maintenance and
         irrigation, and encourage low-water-consumption
         landscaping.
    •    Waste Reduction. The City intends to meet new State
         law SB 1016 by working toward a 50 percent per capita
         solid waste reduction and by expanding the residential
         curbside recycling and composting programs to divert
         recyclable and compostable materials from the solid
         waste stream.
    •    Biological Resources Protection. Natural diversity is
         the best protection against ecosystem deterioration and
         malfunction. The Plan supports the conservation of
         riparian vegetation and habitats and the protection of
         fish and wildlife, including rare and endangered species.
Climate Action Plan
SVP is leading the City’s eﬀort to prepare a Climate Action Plan
(CAP) Once completed, the CAP will be appended to the General
Plan and will serve as a primary implementation tool for the
sustainability goals and policies referenced in Appendix 8.13:
Community Sustainability and Health Goals and Policies. The
CAP will include a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions inventory.
While CAP standards for local jurisdictions throughout the
State is neither defined under State law, nor required, several
jurisdictions have adopted CAPs as a proactive strategy to
reduce GHG emissions and to address the potential eﬀects of
climate change. BAAQMD, the California Air Resources Board
and the State Attorney General’s Oﬃce have oﬀered suggestions
and guidelines for the preparation of CAPs.
According to BAAQMD, a CAP should include the following
components: 30
     A GHG Inventory for the current year and for 1990 if the
         reduction goal is based on 1990 emission levels, as well as
         projections for 2020.

Recent changes to the California Environmental Quality Act
Guidelines include an analysis of GHG emissions as part of
environmental review. The California Attorney General has
also indicated that a CAP can serve as a mitigation strategy for
climate change impacts and that cities’ should prepare the CAP
in concert with general plans, and associated Environmental
Impact Reports, if the CAP is to serve as a mitigation strategy
for GHG emissions.

Local and Regional
Planning Context
Other local and regional planning eﬀorts parallel planning
eﬀorts in the City. Surrounding jurisdictions, as well as regional
agencies and school districts, all have land use and transportation
initiatives with implications for Santa Clara. Planning initiatives
and development projects moving forward in neighboring cities
may aﬀect Santa Clara residents and land use decisions near the
City’s border. In addition, regional initiatives, including planning
eﬀorts along El Camino Real, may provide development and
funding opportunities for the City. Any conflicts between plans
or improvements proposed within Santa Clara’s jurisdictional
boundaries and the City’s General Plan Land Use Diagrams,
Transportation and Mobility Diagrams or text should be resolved
through a General Plan Amendment, in order to evaluate the
broader implications of the proposal and maintain internal
consistency of the Plan, prior to any City endorsement or funding
contribution. Figure 6.1-1 provides an overview of other local
and regional eﬀorts.

                      6.1.1 City of Santa Clara Planning Efforts
                      Santa Clara Station Area Plan
                      The cities of San José and Santa Clara, and the Santa Clara
                      Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) have cooperated in the
                      development of a plan for 432 acres of land surrounding the
                      Santa Clara Transit Center and future Bay Area Rapid Transit
                      (BART) Station. Approximately 244 acres of the area is located
                      in Santa Clara. The Santa Clara Transit Center is currently
                      served by Caltrain, Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) and
                      VTA bus lines. Amtrak’s Capital Corridor train and the future
                      high speed rail line pass through the area. The future BART
                      extension will also terminate at this location. An Automated
                      People Mover is also proposed to connect the Norman Y. Mineta
                      San José International Airport (Airport) with both the Santa
                      Clara Transit Center and VTA’s Airport light rail station. With
                      direct rail service to virtually all parts of the San Francisco Bay
                      Area and beyond, the expanded Santa Clara Transit Center is an
                      important intermodal transit hub for the region.
                      The Santa Clara Station Area Plan has been incorporated into
                      this General Plan as the Santa Clara Station Focus Area, with
                      specific land uses and policies included in Chapter 5. It provides
                      opportunities for the development of housing, oﬃces, retail,
                      hotels, restaurants, parks and other amenities. Approximately
                      two million net new square feet of commercial uses and 1,650
                      housing units are anticipated within the City of Santa Clara’s
                      jurisdiction.
                      Downtown Plan
                      Revitalization of Santa Clara’s historic Downtown is a priority
                      for the City. In 2007, the City initiated a Downtown Plan for
                      the City-owned 7.3 acres bounded by Homestead Road and
                      Lafayette, Jackson and Benton Streets. This plan was the subject
                      of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit developer interest.
                      The RFP suggested an urban, mixed-use center, including over
                      129,000 square feet of retail commercial space with 396 residential
                      units for the site. This project is currently on hold pending
                      improvement in overall economic and real estate conditions.
                      The Downtown includes a City-owned site as well as some
                      surrounding properties and is designated as a Focus Area in this
                      General Plan.

6.1.2 Adjacent Jurisdictions’ Planning Efforts
City of Cupertino
City of Cupertino General Plan
Cupertino shares a small portion of Santa Clara’s western
boundary. For this area, Cupertino’s General Plan identifies
streetscape and other landscaping improvements along Stevens
Creek Boulevard to support residential and oﬃce uses mid-block,
and neighborhood commercial uses at corners. The South Vallco
Park area, just west of the shared boundary, is approved for 711
housing units. The Cupertino General Plan allows building
heights of up to 60 feet in this area.
North Vallco Master Plan
The City of Cupertino has initiated planning for the North Vallco
area, bounded by Homestead Road, Tantau Road, Interstate 280
and Wolfe Road. Already a substantial employment center, the
intensification of commercial oﬃce and industrial uses as well
as retail services is anticipated. Residential development is
also under consideration in conjunction with currently allowed
hotels.
City of San José
City of San José General Plan Update
Santa Clara shares its eastern, northern and southern boundaries
with the City of San José. To the south along Stevens Creek
Boulevard, San José’s current General Plan supports auto sales
and discourages residential development. To the east, adjacent
to the Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport, San José’s
General Plan promotes the redevelopment of the area under the
Rincon South Planned Community which includes residential,
retail, commercial and industrial uses to take advantage of
light rail access and Airport proximity. To the North, plans are
underway for the Alviso area. The City of San José is currently
looking at these areas through an update of its General Plan.
Alviso Specific Plan
The Specific Plan for the historic Alviso neighborhood in the
City of San José, which borders Santa Clara to the north, projects
modest growth to accommodate some retail, commercial and
light industrial uses on a closed landfill site and an existing
industrial site. Residential uses are currently allowed within the
existing residential areas.
                                                                   Page 6-3

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      North San José Vision Plan
                      The City of San José has approved a Vision Plan for North San
                      José. The area for this plan is located adjacent to Santa Clara’s
                      eastern boundary. This plan provides opportunities to increase
                      oﬃce, industrial and research and development uses by over 26
                      million square feet to create up to 80,000 new jobs. The plan
                      also proposes to convert 285 acres of existing industrial land to
                      residential use and allow mixed-use residential development
                      within industrial areas. This could result in up to 32,000 new
                      residential units adjacent to Santa Clara.
                      City of Sunnyvale
                      City of Sunnyvale General Plan Update
                      Santa Clara shares its western boundary with the City of
                      Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale’s 1997 General Plan designates the area
                      bordering Santa Clara for industrial uses north of the Caltrain
                      railroad tracks and residential uses south of the railroad tracks,
                      with the exception of the existing residential and mobile home
                      park between U.S. 101 and Tasman Drive. The Calabazas
                      Creek provides a natural buﬀer between these Sunnyvale
                      neighborhoods north of the Caltrain railroad tracks and the
                      existing and planned employment centers in Santa Clara. The
                      City of Sunnyvale is currently in the process of updating several
                      elements of its General Plan.
                      Lawrence Station Area Plan
                      In cooperation with the City of Santa Clara, the City of Sunnyvale
                      has initiated a Station Area Plan for the area around the Lawrence
                      Caltrain Station. This eﬀort is expected to identify opportunities
                      for higher-density residential and oﬃce development near the
                      station; add neighborhood commercial services to serve existing
                      and future residents; and improve access to the station, including
                      enhanced signage and circulation for pedestrians, bicyclists and
                      motorists. Santa Clara’s comprehensive planning prerequisites
                      for this area are described as part of the Future Focus Areas
                      discussion in Chapter 5.
                      Precise Plan for El Camino Real
                      The City of Sunnyvale has adopted a precise plan for its portion
                      of El Camino Real, providing design guidelines and identifying
                      opportunities for redevelopment at specific locations. It includes
                      the “gateway” into Santa Clara at Lawrence Expressway. The
                      design guidelines encourage landscaping and signage to signify
                      arrival into Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale’s zoning ordinance allows
                      building heights of up to 75 feet and residential densities of up
                      to 45 units per acre.

         GENERAL PLAN
                      Lakeside Specific Plan
                      Just southeast of the U.S. 101 and Lawrence Expressway
                      intersection, and west of the Calabazas Creek, the City of
                      Sunnyvale approved the redevelopment of an existing hotel into
                      a mixed hotel and residential development.
                      Mission College
                      Mission College is the only public community college in Santa
                      Clara. Currently, the College is undergoing an update to their
                      Master Plan, planning for future facilities. Mission College has
                      spoken with the City about future housing on their property, as
                      well as other future expansion opportunities.
                      Santa Clara Unified School District
                      Santa Clara Unified School District (SCUSD) covers
                      approximately 90 percent of the City, enrolling 89 percent of the
                      City’s student population (2009). Demographic trends indicate
                      an increase in school age children, possibly requiring additional
                      school facilities in the future. The City maintains an open
                      relationship with the District, with members of staﬀ sitting on
                      the long range planning committee and District representatives
                      sitting on the General Plan Steering Committee.
                      Santa Clara University
                      Santa Clara University (SCU) is one of the major universities in
                      the region. SCU is an asset to the community, providing highly
                      educated graduates to the workforce. The City works closely
                      with the University regarding new buildings, both on and oﬀ
                      campus, as well as regarding community relations and student
                      activities.

6.2     REGIONAL PLANNING CONTEXT
6.2.1 Regional Land Use and Transportation
        Planning
Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network
Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network is a collaboration of
city, regional and business leaders that have worked together
on several region-wide initiatives for a sustainable future and
improved quality of life for Silicon Valley. Initiatives include
Climate Protection, Disaster Planning, Economic Development
and the El Camino Real Grand Boulevard (discussed below).
Planning eﬀorts include A Greenprint for Silicon Valley, county-
wide greenhouse gas inventories and the creation of a Disaster
Resiliency Center at Moﬀett Field.
El Camino Real Grand Boulevard Initiative
The revitalization of El Camino Real is a collaborative eﬀort of
cities and counties located between South San Francisco and
San José. Through the eﬀorts of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley
Network, the El Camino Real Grand Boulevard Initiative
encourages residential development and job growth in targeted
areas and promotes urban design and landscape improvements
along the corridor. The project is intended to improve mobility
for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists. The Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is also sponsoring a “corridors
program” to encourage coordination of transportation and land
use, as well as infill residential development, along major State-
owned roadways, including El Camino Real.
San José/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant
Master Plan
The San José/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP)
is in the process of developing a Master Plan for its 2,600-acre
property in Alviso, at the southern tip of the San Francisco
Bay. Co-owned by and serving the cities of San José and Santa
Clara, the WPCP also serves Milpitas, Cupertino, Campbell, Los
Gatos, Monte Sereno and Saratoga, as well as several sanitation
districts in unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County. The
master plan will address the facility’s infrastructure, land uses
and technologies in order to better serve the Plant’s growing
service population over the next 30 years. The three-year
planning process began in 2008 and includes a short-term five-
                                                                   Page 6-7

                      Metropolitan Transportation Commission
                      Transportation 2035 Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area
                      The      Metropolitan      Transportation    Commission (MTC)
                      has adopted Transportation 2035, which is the Regional
                      Transportation Plan for the Bay Area. This plan outlines eight
                      goals: Maintenance and Safety, Reliability, Eﬃcient Freight
                      Travel, Security and Emergency Management, Clean Air, Climate
                      Protection, Equitable Access and Livable Communities. These
                      goals are framed by the three ‘E’s’ of sustainability: Economy,
                      Environment and Equity. It transitions transportation priorities
                      from purely moving people and goods, to emphasizing the
                      relationship between land uses and transportation in order
                      to improve the region’s natural, built and social environment.
                      The Plan also addresses the challenges associated with meeting
                      climate change goals, in response to AB 32, and reducing
                      greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
                      Major transit projects included in the Transportation 2035 Plan
                      include a BART extension from Fremont to San Jose/Santa Clara;
                      electrification of the Caltrain system; enhanced service along
                      the Amtrak Capitol Corridor; and improvements to local and
                      express bus services (including Bus Rapid Transit services on
                      San Jose’s Santa Clara Street/Alum Rock Corridor).

FOCUS Program: Priority Development Areas
The Bay Area’s regional agencies of ABAG, Bay Area Air Quality
Management District, San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, and Metropolitan Transportation
Commission initiated the FOCUS Program. The purpose of
this program is to encourage growth and revitalization near
transit facilities in existing communities. The program provides
planning and construction funding for projects in “Priority
Development Areas” (PDAs) with high transit accessibility and
potential for redevelopment. The Santa Clara and Lawrence
station areas, VTA light rail stations, El Camino Real and Stevens
Creek Boulevard all have the potential to be PDAs in the City of
Santa Clara, subject to a land use plan and resolution adopted by
the City Council.
Valley Transportation Authority
Valley Transportation Plan 2035
The Valley Transportation Plan 2035 (VTP 2035) identifies the
programs, projects and policies the Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) would like to pursue by 2035. It connects
projects with anticipated funds and lays out a framework for the
development and maintenance of the transportation system over
the next 25 years. It considers all travel modes and addresses the
links between transportation and land use, air quality, energy
use and community livability. VTP 2035 incorporates themes
for a new direction for the future of Santa Clara County. These
themes include Connectivity, Congestion Pricing, Transportation
Eﬃciency, Land Use and Air Quality. This Plan shares common
themes with the Transportation 2035 Plan for the San Francisco
Bay Area, prepared by the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission.
Transit Sustainability Policy and Service Design Guidelines
VTA’s Transit Sustainability Policy (TSP) is a ridership-based
policy that provides a framework for the eﬃcient and eﬀective
expenditure of transit funds, and for realizing the highest
return on investment in terms of public good and ridership
productivity. It is intended to assist the VTA Board of Directors
with its decision-making process by making available the
most complete information possible regarding options, cost,
benefits, and trade-oﬀs for various transit projects and service
proposals prior to a selection of mode and funding decisions.
The Service Design Guidelines (SDG) associated with the TSP
                                                                   Page 6-9

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      were developed to evaluate and make recommendations on
                      design, implementation and the monitoring of transit services
                      in the region.
                      Bus Rapid Transit Facilities Design
                      VTA is studying design options for bus rapid transit (BRT)
                      and other express bus service throughout Santa Clara County,
                      including potential BRT lines along El Camino Real and Stevens
                      Creek Boulevard. As a first step to BRT along El Camino Real,
                      VTA introduced the Rapid 522 transit line, which provides fast,
                      frequent and more direct service between San José and Palo
                      Alto. The land uses and policies for the El Camino Real and
                      Stevens Creek Boulevard areas in Santa Clara’s General Plan
                      support BRT service and provide preferred design options for
                      VTA consideration.
                      California High-Speed Rail
                      In July 2008, the California High–Speed Rail Authority (CHRA)
                      selected the Pacheco Pass–San Francisco and San José alternative
                      as the preferred corridor and alignment for the future High-
                      Speed Train (HST) service. The selected alignment uses the
                      Caltrain right-of-way through the City of Santa Clara, between
                      San Francisco and San José along the San Francisco Peninsula.
                      Stations are proposed in San Francisco, Millbrae and San José,
                      with another potential station in the same reach. In December
                      2008, the CHRA issued a Notice of Preparation, and the Federal
                      Railroad Administration issued a Notice of Intent for a Project
                      Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement
                      (EIR/EIS) for the San Francisco to San José section of the HST
                      system; initiating the State environmental review process
                      under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
                      the federal environmental review process under the National
                      Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Additionally, 2009 federal
                      economic stimulus funding for the project could add further
                      incentives for the HST project.
                      Caltrain Electrification Project
                      Electrifying Caltrain will result in a more eﬃcient and
                      environmentally-friendly rail system, than the current diesel
                      powered trains. Electric trains accelerate and decelerate faster
                      than diesel trains, which could provide a savings of up to 13
                      percent in travel time between San Francisco and San José.
                      Additionally, the switch to electric locomotives will reduce
                      air pollutant emissions from trains by up to 90 percent, and

decrease energy consumption. Most of the design work has been
completed, and the recent federal economic stimulus package
will provide funding for construction. Work will occur along the
length of the rail corridor for the overhead wires contact system
that powers trains and enables speeds of up to 90 miles per hour.
The electrification of this system will provide a capacity of 114
trains at ten-minute headways during the peak.
Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) develops
comprehensive land use plans to provide the orderly growth
of the area surrounding each airport within the County, one of
which is directly adjacent to Santa Clara. Although the ALUC
has no jurisdiction over existing land uses, its role is to ensure
that new land uses or other proposed actions are compatible
with the Airport environment. The ALUC produces the Airport
Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP), which provides guidance
for compatible land uses in Santa Clara near the Airport. The
ALUC is currently in the process of updating its CLUP. The
current and future plan outlines development intensities, uses,
building height, safety and noise constraints. These constraints
have been taken into consideration for this General Plan. Specific
policies related to land proximate to the Airport are included in
Chapter 5. City amendments to the General Plan and Zoning
are reviewed by the ALUC for consistency with its CLUP.
6.2.2 Regional Environmental Planning
ABAG Local Hazard Mitigation Plan: Taming Natural
Disasters
The City participates in a multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation
planning eﬀort led by the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG). This hazard mitigation planning eﬀort addresses
natural disasters such as earthquake, landslide, wildfire and
flooding. The goal of this eﬀort is to maintain and enhance the
disaster resistance of the region and to fulfill the requirements
of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The City is currently
participating in an update of the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.
Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan
The Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural
Communities Conservation Plan (HCP/NCCP) project is a
regional partnership between six local partners (the County of
                                                                   Page 6-11

Turning the General Plan
Into Action
This Chapter describes the implementation process for the General
Plan. Discussion includes the general responsibilities of the City,
other public agencies and private organizations. It describes the
primary implementation tool for the land use proposals, which will
be administration of the Zoning Ordinance through the Zoning
Map. It also outlines a process for neighborhood-level planning,
which includes Future Focus Areas development and neighborhood
conservation and improvement eﬀorts.

                      Several background reports were prepared as part of the
                      General Plan Update process. Two working papers analyzed
                      the local economic market, and opportunities and challenges,
                      respectively. In addition, several reports were prepared
                      summarizing findings from community outreach activities. A
                      list of relevant reports and publication dates is provided below.

                      7.1.2 Environmental Impact Report
                      A comprehensive Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been
                      prepared in conjunction with this General Plan, pursuant to
                      the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). An EIR
                      is a detailed analysis of the potential environmental eﬀects of
                      a plan or development project. It identifies alternatives to the
                      proposed plan and presents ways to reduce or avoid potential
                      environmental eﬀects. Mitigations have been incorporated into
                      the General Plan as policies.
                      7.1.3 General Plan Amendments
                      State law limits the number of times a general law city can amend
                      each mandated element of its general plan to no more than four
                      times per year, although each amendment may include more than
                      one change. This restriction does not, however, apply to charter
                      cities like the City of Santa Clara. In addition, amendments that

Chapter Seven: TURNING THE GENERAL PLAN INTO ACTION
                                                                      7
update optional elements (such as Historic Preservation), allow
development of aﬀordable housing, or comply with a court
decision may have multiple amendments in a year. While
the City may amend the General Plan as it chooses within the
parameters of State law, in practice, consolidation of amendments
may serve to streamline the process for General Plan amendments.
Note that changes to Appendices are managed as General Plan
Amendments.
In order to maintain internal consistency within the General
Plan, updates to the safety and conservation elements (Section
5.10: Environmental Quality) may also require amendments to
the General Plan Housing Element (Appendix 8.12). Additional
review of flood hazards and safety (consistent with AB 162) may
aﬀect land use and Housing Element Goals and Policies, as well
as the inventory of land suitable for development. Any proposed
development, plan or funding of improvements that conflict with
the Land Use Diagrams, Transportation and Mobility Diagrams
or text should include a General Plan Amendment in order to
evaluate the implications of the proposal as well as to ensure
the required internal consistency for the Plan. As part of the
prerequisites to graduate from one phase to the next, the City
will re-examine the Plan, in its entirety, and propose appropriate
policy and land use amendments in order to address changing
conditions, community priorities, and regulatory requirements.
7.1.4 Responsibilities for Implementation
Implementing the General Plan will involve the City Council,
the Planning Commission, other City boards and commissions,
the City Manager, City departments and the community
throughout the public participation process. The City also will
need to consult with Santa Clara County, adjacent cities and other
public agencies about implementation proposals that aﬀect their
respective areas of jurisdiction. The principal responsibilities
of City oﬃcials and staﬀ for Plan implementation are briefly
summarized below. Details on their powers and duties are
documented in the Santa Clara City Charter and Municipal
Code.

                      for implementing public safety policies described in the Public
                      Facilities and Services, and Environmental Quality components
                      of the General Plan.
                      Silicon Valley Power
                      The City of Santa Clara owns and operates the municipal
                      electric utility, Silicon Valley Power (SVP). SVP serves over
                      50,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal
                      customers within the City. It owns, operates and participates
                      in the production of more than 510 megawatts of electricity.
                      SVP can supplement this power through purchase agreements
                      for an additional 261 megawatts of capacity. SVP is responsible
                      for many of the energy conservation and consumption policies
                      in the General Plan and for those summarized in Appendix
                      8.13: Community Sustainability and Health Goals and Policies
                      Matrix.
                      Other Boards, Commissions and Committees
                      The City has established a number of other boards, commissions
                      and committees, some of which will be involved in Plan
                      implementation in their respective areas of expertise. These
                      may include the Board of Library Trustees, Cultural Advisory
                      Commission, Civil Service Commission, Historical and Land-
                      marks Commission, International Exchange Commission, Parks
                      and Recreation Commission, Senior Advisory Commission,
                      Youth Commission, and Housing Rehabilitation Loan
                      Committee. The General Plan does not envision any substantive
                      change in the responsibilities assigned to these boards and
                      commissions. They will be administering new or amended
                      regulations adopted pursuant to Plan policies, and their actions
                      will need to be consistent with the General Plan.
                      Community at Large
                      The City oﬀers multiple opportunities for public participation in
                      the decision-making process for development approval. Initially,
                      applicants are encouraged to solicit input and feedback on
                      preliminary ideas as part of their due diligence. Once a formal
                      application is on file, the City also provides open communication
                      with interested parties in addition to meeting the requirements
                      for public notification and public hearings.

Regional, State, Federal and Private Agencies
Santa Clara Unified School District
The Santa Clara Unified School District, led by the School Board,
manages most of the public schools in the City. The District is
responsible for projecting student enrollment and meeting school
facility needs. Joint-use of school facilities to help meet parks
and recreation needs, as discussed in the Public Facilities and
Services component of the General Plan, requires coordination
between the SCUSD, other school districts and the City.
Santa Clara County
Santa Clara County provides a variety of services to
unincorporated portions of the County as well as the 15 cities
within it. Services include roads, parks, law enforcement,
emergency response services and libraries. The County has
jurisdiction over the expressway network, including Lawrence,
San Tomas/Montague and Central Expressways. The County
also delivers many State services, such as foster care, public
health care, social services, jails and elections. The City of Santa
Clara has opportunities to collaborate with, and benefit from,
these County services, particularly in terms of housing, social
service programs and emergency management.
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is an
independent special district that is responsible for county-wide
transportation planning and specific roadway improvements.
VTA also provides bus, paratransit and light rail operations
within the County, and serves as the region’s Congestion
Management Agency (CMA). As the CMA, VTA sets the State
and federal funding priorities for improvements aﬀecting
Congestion Management Program facilities, which include U.S.
101; State Route (SR) 237; Interstate 280; Lawrence, San Tomas
and Central Expressways; Great America Parkway; El Camino
Real; and Stevens Creek Boulevard.
Association of Bay Area Governments
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the
regional association of governments that includes all counties
and cities, including the City of Santa Clara, in the nine-county
Bay Area. ABAG does not have authority over land use in the
City of Santa Clara; however, in recent years ABAG has been
working toward a land use vision for the region. In particular,
ABAG supports growth in the inner urban ring of the Bay Area,
                                                                     Page 7-9

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      which includes the City of Santa Clara, as opposed to adding
                      development in the outlying portions of the region. To that end,
                      ABAG, along with three other regional agencies, initiated the
                      FOCUS program to provide funds for Priority Development
                      Areas (PDA) that have a high level of transit accessibility and
                      potential for redevelopment. The Santa Clara Station Focus
                      Area and the Lawrence Caltrain Station area, the El Camino Real
                      Focus Area and the Stevens Creek Boulevard Focus Area all have
                      the potential to be designated by ABAG as PDAs, as discussed in
                      Chapter 6: Local and Regional Planning Context.
                      Metropolitan Transportation Commission
                      The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) serves
                      as both the regional transportation planning agency (a State
                      designation) and as the region’s metropolitan planning
                      organization (a federal designation). MTC is responsible for the
                      Regional Transportation Plan, a comprehensive plan covering
                      transit, roads, airports, ports, rail, bicycle and pedestrian
                      facilities. It also administers funds to local jurisdictions and
                      transit agencies based on the Regional Transportation Plan.
                      MTC has several grant programs including:
                           The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
                               The federal stimulus package, which is being distributed
                               in part through MTC, provides funding for improvements
                               to existing local streets.
                           The New Freedom Program. A federal initiative, which is
                               being distributed in part through MTC, provides grants
                               in large urban areas for new capital and operational
                               projects aimed at reducing, beyond the requirements of
                               the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, transportation
                               barriers faced by individuals with disabilities.
                           Transportation for Livable Communities. Supports
                               projects that enhance community vitality and promote
                               walking, bicycling and transit use.
                           Housing Incentive Program. Assists housing construction
                               near transit hubs.
                           Low Income Flexible Transportation. Funds services
                               that assist low-income residents travel to and from work,
                               school and other essential destinations.

Railroad Owners and Operators
Several rail lines run through Santa Clara. Union Pacific
runs freight trains on tracks through the City’s industrial
areas, adjacent to Lafayette Street and to the Agnew Village.
Approximately ten to 12 freight trains pass through the City on a
daily basis. In addition to rail freight operators, the Joint Powers
Board/Caltrain right-of-way manages the track near the Santa
Clara Station for commuter rail services. Rail lines are consulted
on any proposed crossings and relevant noise mitigations that
the City might pursue. During the horizon of this General Plan,
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) will likely be extended to the
City. The Santa Clara Transit Station will be the terminus of
BART’s South Bay extension.
California Department of Transportation
The Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, is the State
agency that owns and operates freeways and State routes that
provide access to, and through, the City, including Interstates
280 and 880, U.S. 101 and SR 237 and 82 (El Camino Real).
Particularly along El Camino Real, where changes are envisioned
in the General Plan, coordination between the City and the
Caltrans is necessary.
California Environmental Protection Agency
The California Environmental Protection Agency is charged
with developing, implementing and enforcing the State’s
environmental protection laws that ensure clean air, clean water,
clean soil, safe pesticides and waste recycling and reduction. It
includes the following sub-agencies that have authority related
to specific environmental elements in Santa Clara:
     Department of Toxic Substance Control
     Water Resources Control Board
     Integrated Waste Management Board
     Air Resources Board
                                                                     Page 7-11

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      7.2     REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
                      The City will use a variety of regulatory mechanisms and
                      administrative procedures to implement the General Plan. The
                      Zoning Ordinance serves as one of the primary implementation
                      tools. Other regulatory mechanisms, including the Subdivision
                      Ordinance, building and housing codes, capital improvement
                      programs and environmental review procedures, are also
                      used to implement Plan policies. These should all be reviewed
                      periodically to comply with the Plan. Development projects and
                      other discretionary actions should be consistent with the Plan as
                      criteria for approval.
                      7.2.1 Zoning Regulations
                      Under California law, strict consistency between the General
                      Plan and Zoning Ordinance is not required for charter cities
                      like the City of Santa Clara. General Plan policies do, however,
                      commit the City to zoning and other regulations that support
                      the General Plan. Consistency is an important component for
                      Plan implementation. Without it, there is no assurance that
                      the City can achieve its vision or that environmental protection
                      measures will be implemented. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
                      translates General Plan policies into specific use regulations,
                      development standards and performance criteria in order
                      to govern development on individual properties. While the
                      General Plan establishes the policy framework, the Zoning
                      Ordinance prescribes the rules and procedures for development.
                      The Zoning Map is part of the Ordinance and should be updated
                      as project proposals are approved.
                      7.2.2 Subdivision Regulations
                      Under the California Subdivision Map Act, no subdivision
                      of land may be approved unless it is consistent with both
                      the relevant zoning district and the General Plan land use
                      classification and other applicable policies in the General Plan.
                      The City’s Subdivision Regulations supplement and implement
                      the Subdivision Map Act.

7.3     NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING
7.3.1 Changes to Existing Focus Area Plans
The General Plan establishes land uses and Focus Area Plans
for four Focus Areas: El Camino Real, Downtown, Santa Clara
Station and Stevens Creek Boulevard. To implement General Plan
policies for each Focus Area, additional planning eﬀorts may be
required in order to provide guidance for future development
projects. These planning eﬀorts may include streetscape plans,
master plans or revisions to existing plans, such as for the
Downtown Core. Specific components of these planning eﬀorts
would vary by Focus Area and would be defined during the
planning process. Depending on the extent of land use changes
or potential environmental impacts, a General Plan amendment
or additional environmental review may be required, and should
be approved by City Council.
7.3.2 Future Focus Area Comprehensive Plans
Focus Area comprehensive plans are required prerequisites
for new residential development in the Future Focus Areas, as
described in Chapter 5. The purpose of these plans and the
prerequisite requirements ensure that new neighborhoods are
self-suﬃcient, with easy access to retail, services and public
amenities. Comprehensive planning will also ensure that
adequate public services and facilities are provided in tandem
with new development so that they are available to current and
future residents. The location and boundaries of each Future
Focus Area are identified on Figure 5.4-1. These areas include
Central Expressway, De La Cruz, Great America Parkway,
Tasman East, Tasman West and Lawrence Station. The required
content and implementation process for Future Focus Area
comprehensive plans is described in the policies in Section 5.1:
Prerequisites and in Section 5.4.5: Future Focus Areas Goals and
Policies.
Preparation
The City will coordinate planning eﬀorts for each Future Focus
Area and determine the appropriate time for plan preparation.
One or more property owners may request early initiation of
planning. Alternatively, the City may choose to initiate the plan
preparation. A work program should be prepared to complete
the plan, including a schedule for preparation and a program for
public participation. Ample opportunities for the involvement
of citizens, public agencies, public utilities and other community
groups should be provided.
                                                                   Page 7-13

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                      Approval
                      Comprehensive plans for the Future Focus Areas should be
                      approved before any rezoning, consistent with the long-range
                      General Plan vision and policies. While these comprehensive
                      plans could be adopted by the City prior to initiation of the
                      appropriate General Plan phase, actual development should not
                      proceed until the appropriate phase has begun. For example,
                      development in the Great America Parkway Future Focus
                      Area is not identified until Phase III, which begins in 2025. A
                      comprehensive plan for that Focus Area could be approved a
                      year or two prior to 2025 to provide development certainty, but
                      entitlements should wait until 2025 in order to be consistent with
                      the General Plan.
                      Environmental Review
                      The General Plan land uses and assumptions identified for the
                      Future Focus Areas have been analyzed in the Environmental
                      Impact Report for this General Plan. However, additional
                      environmental review may be required for the subsequent Future
                      Focus Area comprehensive plans based on changing conditions
                      as well as on any alternate or varying circumstances.
                      7.3.3 Neighborhood Improvement Plans
                      Neighborhood Improvement Plans may be privately initiated
                      for the benefit of existing neighborhoods in the City. These plans
                      are intended to provide a means for existing neighborhoods to
                      work toward improving their neighborhoods. This may be in
                      the form of neighborhood design guidelines, or other similar
                      planning tools that will work in conjunction with other City
                      guidelines, plans and regulations, to help define and preserve
                      individual neighborhood character.
                      Neighborhoods should identify an organizational structure
                      that is best suited to represent their goals and objectives. Such
                      organizations could include a neighborhood association, co-
                      op, development corporation, neighborhood watch group, or
                      a committee of neighbors. Eﬀective neighborhood planning
                      requires opportunities, formal and informal, for neighborhood
                      leaders to meet among themselves to discuss implementation
                      strategies for their Neighborhood Improvement Plan. The City
                      can provide information, particularly with respect to consistency
                      with the City’s General Plan, that will assist neighborhoods in
                      their planning eﬀorts.

8.2     DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
8.2.1 Definitions
Access. The ability to enter a site from a roadway and exit a site onto a roadway by
motorized vehicle.
Acres, Gross. The entire acreage of a site, including easements, calculated to the centerline
of any new proposed bounding streets and to the edge of the right-of-way of existing or
dedicated streets.
Acres, Net. The portion of a site that can actually be built upon. The following generally
are not included in the net acreage of a site: public or private road rights-of-way, public
open space, easements and ﬂoodways.
Adaptive Reuse. The conversion of obsolescent or historic buildings from their original
or most recent use to a new use. For example, the conversion of former hospital or school
buildings to residential use, or the conversion of an historic single-family home to oﬃce
use.
Adverse Impact. A negative consequence for the physical, social or economic environment
resulting from an action or project.
Aﬀordable Housing. Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household
with very low-, low-, or moderate-income, based on a household’s ability to make
monthly payments necessary to obtain housing. Housing is considered aﬀordable when
a household pays less than 30 percent of its gross monthly income (GMI) for housing,
including utilities.
Agency. The governmental entity, department, oﬃce or administrative unit responsible
for carrying out regulations.
Air Pollution. Concentrations of substances found in the atmosphere that exceed naturally
occurring quantities and are undesirable or harmful in some way.
Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). A land use plan developed by the Airport
Land Use Commission to provide guidance for land use planning around publicly owned
airports. The two major issues addressed are: promoting compatibility between aircra$
noise and various types of land uses; and ensuring safety of aircra$ operations and people
and property on the ground.
Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). The ALUC prepares and adopts a comprehensive
land use plan for areas in the vicinity of each public use airport in Santa Clara County.
The commission reviews general plans, speciﬁc plans, zoning and building regulation
changes proposed by local agencies, as well as other proposed projects near publicly
owned airports, for consistency with its plan.

         GENERAL PLAN
            Airport Safety Zones.
                    The Runway Protection Zone at the Airport as adopted by the airport and the
                    FAA, begins 200 feet out from the runway’s displaced landing thresholds (not the
                    pavement ends). It is a trapezoidal area centered on the extended runway centerline.
                    The size is related to the expected aircra$ use and the visibility minimums for that
                    particular runway.
                    The Inner Safety Zone represents the approach and departure corridors that have
                    the second highest level of exposure to potential aircra$ accidents. The Inner Safety
                    Zone is centered on the runway centerline and extends from the outer edge of the
                    Runway Protection Zone to the outer edge of the Turning Safety Zone boundary.
                    The length of the runway determines the dimensions.
                    The Turning Safety Zone represents the approach and departure areas that have

            of Santa Clara, and the Santa Clara Valley Water District.
            Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCWD). The primary water resources agency for
            Santa Clara County, California. It acts not only as the county’s water wholesaler, but also

            Section 8, Rental Assistance Program. A federal (HUD) rent-subsidy program that is
            one of the main sources of federal housing assistance for low-income households. The
            program operates by providing “housing assistance payments” to owners, developers
            and public housing agencies to make up the diﬀerence between the “Fair Market Rent”
            of a unit (set by HUD) and the household’s ability to contribute toward the rent, which
            is calculated at 30 percent of the household’s adjusted gross monthly income (GMI).
            “Section 8” includes programs for new construction, existing housing and substantial or
            moderate housing rehabilitation.

            such as children, the elderly, the acutely ill and chronically ill, adults with mental or
            physical disabilities, and persons with mobility limitations or diﬃculty understanding
            and executing directions due to age, physical or mental conditions. The term “sensitive
            receptors” can also refer to the land use categories where these people live or spend a
            signiﬁcant amount of time. Such land uses include residences, schools, playgrounds,
            child-care or senior daycare centers, hospitals, retirement homes and convalescent homes.
            Service Station (Gas Station). A building or use intended to provide fuel, repair, testing,
            or other service for automobiles and trucks.

8.6     GENERAL PLAN LAND USE ASSUMPTIONS
This section provides an overview of assumptions for land use and development used
in the General Plan, including existing and projected development, population, and
employment.
8.6.1 Projected Development
The General Plan provides a framework for the future of the City of Santa Clara. While
it identifies areas of potential growth and development, it is not expected that the full
potential of all areas will be reached in the 25-year horizon of the Plan. Areas identified
for potential development, as well as others that may be identified in the future, will
develop according to market demand and the availability of infrastructure and services.
The phased progression of development identifies specific areas, time-frames, average
densities/intensities and absorption rates as a means to quantify and evaluate the potential
eﬀects resulting from the implementation of this General Plan. This means that while
some areas may build-out to their full potential within the Plan horizon, others may not.
Figures 8.6-1, 8.6-2, and 8.6-3 illustrate the assumed development by phase, location and
land use.
The assumed development potential calculated for each phase of the General Plan provides
a reasonable expectation for development within the General Plan horizon based on the
following:
    1. Average densities and intensities were applied to sites identified as potential
        development areas. Sites identified in each phase as potential development areas are
        shown in Figures 8.6-1, 8.6-2, and 8.6-3. The assumptions for density and intensity
        for each land use are listed in Table 8.6-1 based on recent development trends in
        the region, except for Regional Commercial along Stevens Creek Boulevard which
        was assumed at an average of 0.40 FAR to recognize the potential for auto-sales.
    2. The land absorption by 2035 for each developable land area was assumed as 75
        percent of the average density and/or intensity of the potential development as
        calculated under number one (1) above.
    3. New open space, public/quasi public space, and retail services indicated on the
        land use map were assumed as ten (10) percent of the potential developable land
        area each, except for the Tasman East Future Focus Area, identified in Figure 5.4-
        1, where new open space comprises 15 percent of the potential developable land
        area. New retail square footage in Future Focus Areas was assumed at 0.40 FAR
        except in the Lawrence Station Focus Area where new commercial development
        was assumed at 0.50 FAR for ten (10) percent of the land area designated for High
        Density Residential uses only. New open space associated with Future Focus Areas
        is assumed to be completed by 2035
                                                                                             Page 8.6-3

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
               4. For both residential and non-residential uses, an additional five (5) percent of
                   the land area was attributed to site access, roads and other rights-of-way, which
                   correspondingly reduced the development assumed in each area.
               5. All sites identified in Phase I are assumed to reach build-out, as defined under one
                   through four (1-4), above, by 2035. Future Focus Areas identified in Phase II and
                   III, including Central Expressway, De La Cruz, and Great America Parkway, as
                   well as any other sites only shown for development in these Phases, are assumed
                   to require a 25 year timeframe, as assumed for Phase I development in order to
                   reach the build-out defined under one through four (1-4), above. This reduces
                   development projections to approximately 80 percent and 40 percent of the full
                   potential for Phase II and Phase III, respectively. The areas with development
                   potential beginning in Phases II and III are assumed to reach their full potential
                   beyond the Plan’s 2035 horizon.
               6. Assumed development for the Santa Clara Station Focus Area, designated as “Santa
                   Clara Station Area” on the General Plan Land Use Diagrams, is consistent with the
                   projected development proposed for the portion of the Santa Clara Station Area
                   Plan within the City of Santa Clara, discussed in 6.1.1: City of Santa Clara Planning
                   Eﬀorts. This includes approximately 1,490,000 square feet of commercial (retail/
                   hotel) development, 550,000 square feet of oﬃce development, and 1,663 dwelling
                   units.
               7. Assumed development for the Downtown Focus Area on the General Plan Land
                   Use Diagrams is consistent with the projected development identified in the
                   Downtown Plan discussed in 6.1.6: City of Santa Clara Planning Eﬀorts. This
                   includes 129,300 square feet of commercial space and 396 dwelling units.
               8. Projections for jobs are based on the square footage per employee for new uses
                   shown on Table 8.6-3, reduced by the jobs lost as a result of redevelopment, with a
                   6.5 percent vacancy rate applied to new non-residential buildings.
               9. Projections for population are based on the number of new dwelling units with an
                   estimated 2.78 percent vacancy rate and 2.5 persons per household.
               10. Approximately seven (7) percent of new square footage for High and Low Intensity
                   Oﬃce/Research and Development is assumed as supporting commercial services.

             Land Use Classifications and Diagram.
            8.6.2 Proposed Development
            Proposed projects, or development that is approved, pending or under construction as of
            the end of 2008, are included in the General Plan build-out. Between 2008 and 2010, the
            City anticipates that all proposed residential, commercial, mixed-use and public/quasi
            public projects will be completed (resulting in 523,600 square feet of commercial space,
            130,000 square feet of quasi public space, and 2,957 dwelling units). For proposed Oﬃce/
            Research and Development projects, 287,300 square feet are anticipated to be complete by
            2010 and the remaining 9,012,100 square feet is anticipated for completion between 2010
            and 2015. Note that the proposed non-residential square-footage on Table 8.6-2 excludes
            the proposed San Francisco 49ers Stadium proposal because its unique development
            characteristics do not translate into equivalent square feet. Table 8.6-2 provides a
            breakdown of the proposed development projects by land use.

8.6.3 Population and Housing
For existing population and housing estimates, the City used the Department of Finance
(DOF) E-5 City and County Estimates from January 2008. New population and housing
projected from the General Plan development assumptions were added to these numbers
to estimate the City’s population and housing units for 2035. These projections are
provided in Table 5.2-1: Summary of General Plan Development Potential 2008-2035.
New population and housing projections were based on two assumptions: (1) an average
housing vacancy rate of 2.78 percent to estimate the number of households in the City,
and (2) an average of 2.5 residents per household to estimate the new population. These
assumptions are based on Santa Clara’s steady vacancy rate of 2.78 percent, according to
DOF estimates from 2000 to 2008. This trend is expected to continue through 2035 due to
the regional demand for housing and the City’s high jobs-to-employed-resident ratio.
The City’s current 2008 ratio of residents per household is 2.68, according to the DOF. Over
the next 25 years, however, the anticipated change in demographics will likely fluctuate
from 2.79 in 2020 to 2.16 in 20301, as shown in Figure 8.6-1. The resulting average ratio for
the extent of the General Plan horizon is 2.51. This ratio is also supported by the General
Plan development assumptions that the majority of new housing units will be higher
density, and likely smaller units, with a lower ratio of residents per households than the
2.6 in 2008.

         GENERAL PLAN
            8.6.4 Employment Projections
            The estimated number of existing jobs in the City for 2008 was based on ABAG employment
            estimates and projections for 2005 and 2010, with the diﬀerence averaged over the five-
            year interval, resulting in a total of 106,680 jobs in the City in 2008. Projections for net
            new jobs for 2035 in the City based on the General Plan development assumptions
            were calculated by reducing the estimated jobs created from new development by the
            estimated loss of existing jobs as result of demolition of building at those locations. Both
            existing and new job estimates were based on two assumptions: (1) ratios of square feet
            per employee by land use, and (2) an average vacancy rate of six and one half (6.5) percent
            for future non-residential uses. The assumed square-footage for new employment related
            to specific land uses are listed in Table 8.6-3. The building square feet per employee ratios
            were derived from applicable studies and existing employment information for the City
            of Santa Clara and surrounding region. The assumed vacancy rates represent an average
            rate for the next 25 years, which takes into account the cyclical nature of the real estate
            market and economy.

8.7.3 Travel Demand Forecasting
The City of Santa Clara’s newly developed Travel Demand Model (Model) was completed
as part of this General Plan Update. The Model was developed to provide improved
City-wide travel demand forecasting as part of continued planning eﬀorts to address
transportation infrastructure needs and assist in the update of the City’s General Plan.
The Model was developed from the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Countywide
Travel Demand Model, which uses a four-step process to forecast person trips. The process
begins with identifying trip generation by estimating the number of trips that would
occur with the proposed General Plan land uses. The Santa Clara Model includes person
trip generation that is based on the regional Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC) Travel Demand Model. Trip generation is estimated based on the type and density/
intensity of land uses (for example, the number of households) within each traﬃc analysis
zone (TAZ). Trip generation rates are also cross-classified by income quartile to provide
a more realistic estimate of trip-making patterns.
                                                                                          Page 8.7-5

         GENERAL PLAN
            The Model produces trip estimates in person trips (as compared to vehicle trips, which
            are often quoted in transportation analyses). Table 8.7-3 summarizes the number of trips
            estimated by the Model for existing (2008) and future (2035) projected development.
                 TABLE 8.7-3: NET CHANGE IN CITY-WIDE TRIP GENERATION FROM EXISTING CONDITIONS
              Time Period                          Existing Conditions (2008)     Future Conditions (2035)

            Off-Peak Period                                          292,135                     +42,806
            Total (Daily)                                            545,900                     +80,863
            Source: Fehr & Peers, 2010.
            Once trip generation is determined by the Model, the trips are distributed to various
            internal and external gateways. The Model pairs trip origins and trip destinations
            (starting and ending points) for each person trip based on the type of trip (from home-
            to-work, home-to-school, etc.) and typical distances a person is willing to travel for that
            purpose. Next, the model determines the route for travel between the trip origin and
            destination and assigns the trips to the Roadway Network in a way that minimizes travel
            time between the start and end points of the trip.
            Lastly, the choice for transportation mode is identified by the Model. This determines
            the mode a person will choose for each trip based on the availability of a vehicle, the
            trip distance, and the trip purpose. Subsequent trip distribution, assignment, and mode
            choice iterations are completed by the Model to account for roadway congestion until the
            Model identifies an acceptable combination.
            Future Traffic Volume Projections
            Future year (2035) traﬃc volume projections for the major roadways and study
            intersections in the City were developed using the Santa Clara Travel Demand Model.
            Forecasts were estimated by adding the diﬀerence between the base (2008) and future
            year (2035) outputs to existing traﬃc counts. Daily traﬃc forecasts were completed for
            General Plan build-out as defined in Appendix 8.6: General Plan Land Use Assumptions.
            Tables 8.7-4 and 8.7-5 and Figure 8.7-1 summarize the existing (2008) and future daily
            roadway forecasts. The information on these tables indicates that the average VMT for
            Santa Clara’s estimated 154,990 resident population in 2035 for trips originating and/or
            ending in Santa Clara will be reduced from the VMT for the City’s 2008 resident population
            of 115,503 with the implementation of the General Plan (14.35 VMT per person in 2008 vs.
            12.19 VMT per person in 2035). This means that the future General Plan land use mix will
            result in shorter trips for residents within the City of Santa Clara due to closer proximity
            of jobs and services to housing as well as the increased availability and accessibility to
            other modes of travel, such as bicycle and walking.

Forecasts for study intersections were completed using a similar methodology to the
roadway segment forecasts. The diﬀerence between Model outputs for the existing and
future years was added to existing traﬃc counts. This forecast represents the eﬀects of
the implementation of the General Plan in conjunction with the regional trips assumed by
VTA and foreseeable development in cities adjacent to Santa Clara. The LOS results are
shown in Table 8.7-6 for the weekday AM and PM peak hours.

8.8      PARKS AND RECREATION INVENTORY
Table 8.8-1 lists the City’s existing parks and recreation facilities, and includes acreage
and types of activities provided at each facility. Table 8.8-2 provides a breakdown of
parks and recreation facilities that are planned with proposed (approved, not constructed
and pending development as of February 2009). As shown in these tables, there are five
classifications for parks and recreation in the City. These include Community Parks, Mini
Parks, Neighborhood Parks, Public Open Space and Recreation Facilities. Descriptions of
each facility type follow the tables. These tables only include facilities owned by the City
or those publicly accessible to all community members, excluding school sites. Facilities
such as cemeteries, that are not specifically for recreation, as well as those that are regional
in nature, such as the Santa Clara Golf and Tennis Club, are also not defined as “parks”
for the purpose of the General Plan.

8.8.1 Mini Parks
Although most of Santa Clara’s parks are larger than one acre, the City does contain a
few mini parks, defined here as parks of no more than one acre in size. These parks
typically have small service areas, dedicated to smaller-scale, more specific activities. For
example, the 0.2 acre Rotary Park, located behind the Triton Museum of Art, oﬀers a
playground, picnic tables and sitting area for families. Overall, the 1.6 acres of mini-parks
comprise only a minor proportion, less than one percent, of the City’s parkland space. As
new development occurs on smaller, confined parcels, the percentage of mini parks may
increase as a new alternative for open space within the City.
8.8.2 Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood parks are generally between one and fifteen acres in size and oﬀer both
open space and amenities for individual neighborhoods. They provide facilities for
various activities, including passive uses, children’s playgrounds and sports fields. For
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Page 8.8-5

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
           example, the 2.4-acre Fuller Street Park, near Fuller Street and Esperanca Avenue, serves
           the surrounding neighborhood with open space, a play area and picnic facilities. This is
           a typical size for parks within the City, accounting for 134.5 acres, or almost 50 percent of
           the City’s total parkland.
           8.8.3 Community Parks
           Community parks draw visitors from a larger radius, often from the entire City, due to
           their larger size (over fifteen acres) or unique recreation amenities. Central Park is the
           centerpiece of the City’s park system and the only community park. This 52-acre park has
           open space, picnic areas and a playground, as well as recreation facilities that include the
           George F. Haines International Swim Center, Santa Clara Tennis Center, playing fields,
           lawn bowling and an exercise course.
           8.8.4 Public Open Space
           Several of the City’s prominent civic and community buildings are located within parks,
           oﬀering open space focused on civic activities. For example, the Agnews Historic Park,
           on Sun Microsystems/Oracle’s Santa Clara campus, provides a peaceful open space
           that also houses four historic buildings, preserved through a historic easement. Use of
           these parks is primarily passive; however, they provide an open, landscaped setting for
           historic resources in the City. Ulistac Natural Area, 40 acres of open space located along
           the Guadalupe River on Lick Mill Boulevard, between Tasman Drive and Montague
           Expressway, showcases seven distinct natural California and wildlife habitats. Only a
           few parks are classified as public open space, making up a little more than six percent of
           the City’s total park acreage.
           8.8.5 Recreation Facilities
           The City has an array of recreation facilities, including sports fields, a skate park, swimming
           pools/centers, senior center and youth center. Many of these facilities are located within
           larger park sites, creating a variety of options at a single location. Host parks are shown
           in parentheses on Table 8.8-1. The City’s Department of Parks and Recreation oﬀers a
           variety of classes and programs at these sites. In total, recreational facilities account for
           almost a quarter of the City’s total park acreage.

8.9      HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND RESOURCE INVENTORY
Table 8.9-1 and Figure 8.9-1 identify the names and locations of the historic properties in
the City of Santa Clara. In addition, this Appendix includes a depiction of the Areas of
Historic Sensitivity, defined as 100 feet from the property line of an identified historically
significant property. Figure 8.9-2 shows this 100-foot area around historic properties in
the Old Quad and Agnew neighborhoods where a number of the City’s resources are
located.
Following the list and description of historic properties are the adopted Criteria for Local
Significance for the City of Santa Clara. These criteria establish evaluation measures that
help to determine significance for properties not yet included on the list. As buildings
and other resources age, additional properties will be added to the inventory. In order
to accomplish this, a property owner can apply to have their property listed as a historic
resource, or the City can nominate properties. The Historical and Landmarks Commission
evaluates these applications and forwards a recommendation to the City Council. Updates
to the Historic Preservation and Resource Inventory is considered an amendment to the
General Plan.

            Definition of Integrity
            Integrity refers to a property’s ability to convey its significance. Significance is conveyed
            by the retention of a resource’s visual and physical characteristics and its surroundings.
            The National Register criteria recognize seven aspects to integrity. The seven aspects of
            integrity are location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.
            To retain historic integrity, a property will always possess several, and usually most, of
            these aspects.
            Properties must have suﬃcient integrity in addition to meeting the criterion for significance
            in order to be considered a qualified historic resource.
            Note that application of the adopted criteria is required for all CEQA documents
            evaluating potential or listed historic resources and required for preparation of historic
            resource inventory forms (surveys).

8.12-1          INTRODUCTION
8.12-1.1        Scope and Purpose
The 2009 City of Santa Clara Housing Element has been prepared to meet the intent
and requirements of State law and is intended to be integrated into the City’s General
Plan. The Housing Element covers the 2007 to 2014 planning period, focusing on ways
to promote residential infill development, given land supply and cost constraints. The
intent of this Element is to plan for an adequate variety of safe, appropriate and well-built
housing for all residents of Santa Clara. The format of this Element follows very specific
State guidelines with respect to data, evaluation, and topics. The Element addresses the
requirements of Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 3, Article 10.6 of the State Government Code
and is organized as follows:
     Chapter 8.12-1 provides an overview of the Housing Element, its relationship to
        other elements in the General Plan, and a description of public outreach activities.
     Chapter 8.12-2 reviews the 2002 Housing Element, drawing lessons learned
        from its successes and challenges in order to improve this updated Element.
        This discussion includes an assessment of the eﬀectiveness of the 2002 Element,
        its progress in implementation, and the appropriateness of its continuing goals,
        policies, and actions for this planning period. A summary is provided in this
        chapter with a complete comparison matrix provided in Appendix A.
     Chapter 8.12-3 is a summary of the housing needs assessment, including
        population, household and employment trends; housing characteristics; special
        needs populations; and aﬀordable units at risk of conversion to market-rate. The
        complete housing needs assessment is provided in Appendix B.
     Chapter 8.12-4 reviews financing resources for subsidized housing and services,
        focusing on the Redevelopment Agency (RDA) as the largest source of funds.
     Chapter 8.12-5 reviews constraints to housing development and potential
        programs and policy changes that could reduce these barriers. The analysis
        considers governmental constraints (e.g. zoning regulations, fees, and permit
        review procedures), as well as non-governmental factors (e.g. availability of
        financing, land and construction costs, and environmental conditions).
     Chapter 8.12-6 describes potential housing sites, including current development
        projects, vacant land, and underutilized properties appropriate for residential
        development. Several major projects, including the Rivermark master plan
        area, have been completed since the last Housing Element. New development
        proposals, such as the Station Area and Downtown Focus Areas, are under
        consideration and would provide over 2,000 new housing units through mixed-
        use and transit-oriented development projects. This chapter also describes
        energy and resource conservation programs currently supported by various City
        departments and the City owned public utilities for water, sewer and electricity.
                                                                                              Page 8.12-5

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                  Chapter 8.12-7 articulates Santa Clara's vision for the City's housing supply in
                     light of current constraints to housing development, markets, and aﬀordability.
                     It establishes a framework to guide decision-making and an action program to
                     help the City meet its housing needs. The goals, policies and programs in the last
                     section of this chapter focus on four key issues: housing opportunities, housing
                     aﬀordability, housing sites and production, and neighborhood conservation.
                     Finally, the chapter provides quantified objectives that establish targets for
                     aﬀordable, rehabilitated, and replacement housing.
             8.12-1.2        Relationship to Other Elements
             Since statutory requirements addressed in this Element overlap with other General
             Plan elements, such as Land Use, Transportation, Environmental Quality, and Public
             Facilities and Services, it is necessary to look at the General Plan in its entirety for
             an understanding of the relationship between the Housing Element and these other
             elements. This Element meets the minimum standards required by State law for a
             housing element. Related housing issues can be found elsewhere in the General Plan.
             This Element bridges the 1992 General Plan and the recently adopted 2010-2035 General
             Plan, referencing the former land uses, which nest within the land uses of the adopted
             plan.
             8.12-1.3        Public Outreach
             The California Government Code requires that local governments make diligent eﬀorts
             to solicit public participation from all segments of the community in the development
             of the Housing Element.
             During preparation of the 2009 Housing Element, public input was actively sought and
             encouraged. Twelve representatives from local organizations and agencies that provide
             housing or housing-related services were interviewed in June 2008, to obtain input
             on housing trends, needs, constraints, and opportunities in the City of Santa Clara.
             These individuals included representatives from market rate and aﬀordable housing
             developers, fair housing service providers and mediators, government housing agencies,
             and other housing advocates. The public-at-large provided input through a community
             workshop on housing on August 4, 2008. Approximately 1,600 community members
             responded to a Citywide survey on housing and quality of life issues in Santa Clara,
             reporting their preferences for future housing locations, types, densities, and designs.
             Two newsletters have been sent to all addresses in the City, describing the purpose
             of the Housing Element and General Plan updates, explaining progress on planning
             eﬀorts, and inviting community members to participate in the update process through
             the project website, survey, community workshops, and other meetings.
             Since the Housing Element has been prepared concurrently with the City’s General Plan
             Update, the City’s General Plan Steering Committee, made up of stakeholders from
             a range of interests, backgrounds, and organizations, also provided input on housing

and a draft of the Element, at three of its meetings (August 28, 2008; January 15, 2009;
and January 31, 2009). Finally, Planning Commissioners and City Council members
provided input on housing needs and issues during joint meetings in September 2008
and February 2009. Noticed public hearings for Planning Commission and City Council
hearings took place in May and June 2009, authorizing the submittal of the Element to
the State for review, and adoption hearings took place in October and November 2010.

8.12-2.1          Effectiveness
Santa Clara last adopted its Housing Element in 2002, covering the 1999 to 2006 time
period. Table 8.12-2-1 summarizes the accomplishments during this period. At that
time, the City’s total Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) projected by the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) was 6,339 units. Actual construction,
according to building permit records, was 4,163 units. Although the RHNA targets
were not achieved in actual construction for all aﬀordable income levels, the City made
available a suﬃcient number of appropriate housing sites, in each category to meet the
RHNA requirements. This was made possible through the re-designation of sites as
Mixed Use, Gateway Thoroughfare Mixed Use and Transit-Oriented Mixed Use in the
General Plan, pursuant to the 2002 Housing Element Update.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             The City helped to finance 1,385 aﬀordable housing units during this period, representing
             33 percent of all units constructed. The City met 81 percent of the need for low income
             housing, 35 percent of the need for moderate income housing, and 22 percent of the
             need for very-low income housing through construction. Sites available for market-rate
             residential redevelopment accounted for the remaining percentages of the 4,163 units
             constructed. Most of the below-market rate (BMR) units were subsidized with RDA
             funds. A total of 123 units resulted from the City’s inclusionary housing policy which
             requires that at least ten percent of the units in residential projects of ten units or more be
             set aside for aﬀordable housing. Much of the 1999-2006 period was impacted by rising
             land and construction costs, as well as competition for land for non-residential uses.
             Still, this number is high in comparison with the previous Housing Element period,
             1988 to 1995, in which the City constructed 1,963 units, or 38 percent, of its RHNA
             allocation.
             8.12-2.2       Progress and Appropriateness
             A complete description of the implementation of the 2002 Housing Element policies and
             programs can be found in Appendix 8.12-A. In addition, reflections on lessons learned
             and recommendations for policy changes for this planning period are included in the
             Appendix.
             8.12-3         HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
             A complete Housing Needs Assessment for the City of Santa Clara is provided in
             Appendix 8.12-B. This chapter highlights the major findings from this Appendix,
             including: the projected increase in the senior population, the prevalent special needs
             populations, and the range of household incomes found in the City.
             8.12-3.1       Population & Household Trends
             The type and amount of housing needed in a community are largely determined by
             population growth and various demographic variables. Factors such as age, race/
             ethnicity, occupation, and income level combine to influence the type of housing needed
             and the ability to aﬀord such housing.
             Population
             Actual and projected population estimates are reported in Table 8.12-3-1. According
             to the U.S. Census, Santa Clara’s population grew 49 percent between 1960 and 1980.
             Since that time, constraints on available land for residential development have limited
             new housing development and population growth. During the 20-year period between
             1980 and 2000, the City’s population grew only 17 percent, from 87,700 to 102,361. More
             recently, the City has experienced an increase in the rate of population growth. In the
             year 2006, the American Community Survey (ACS) reported a population of 112,098,
             an increase of ten percent since 2000. As of January 2008, the California Department of
             Finance (DOF) estimated the City’s population to be 115,503 (not shown in Table 8.12-
             3-1).

ABAG projects that the City will grow at a moderate rate over the next seven years,
resulting in a population of approximately 124,700 by 2015.

Santa Clara’s projected population growth is consistent with countywide expected
growth over time. The population of Santa Clara County as a whole (1.8 million in
2008, according to DOF), is projected to increase by 27 percent between 2010 and 2035,
compared with the City of Santa Clara’s 24 percent projected growth rate during this
period.
Households
According to ABAG, households are expected to grow at a similar rate as population,
suggesting consistency in household size (about 2.6). There were approximately 41,510
households in 2005; an additional 6,000 households are anticipated by 2015, for a total
of 47,330 households.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             Age
             The City of Santa Clara has experienced increases in young and older residents in recent
             years. Children under four and adults between the ages of 45 and 64 are the age cohorts
             with increasing shares of the population, as shown in Table 8.12-3-3. The median age in
             2006 was 35 years. This data suggests that as the City becomes both older and younger,
             there may be a need for additional family housing, with two or more bedrooms, as well
             as housing for seniors.
             At the County level, ABAG projects that seniors (65 and over) will continue to increase as
             a percent share of Santa Clara County’s population, representing 13 percent of residents
             by 2015, compared with just ten percent in 2005 (not shown in table). This represents the
             largest percent share increase of any age cohort.

                 2006 data should be compared with caution to 2000 values. This is due to the fact the
                 entire population continually ages into older age groups over time, such that the popu-
                 lation of a certain age is made up of a completely different group of people in 2000 and
                 2006.

             Gender
             In 2006, 53 percent of residents were male and 47 percent female. Demographic
             characteristics related to female heads of household are described in Section 8.12.B.6:
             Special Needs Populations of Appendix 8.12-B.
             Ethnicity
             Santa Clara has become more ethnically diverse in recent years. The proportion of white
             residents has decreased somewhat, accounting for 41 percent of the population in 2006.
             The Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic populations have increased to 34 percent and
             18 percent, respectively. The black population also increased, but still only accounts for
             a three percent share. The category of “Other,” which includes residents self-identifying
             as two or more races, accounts for four percent of the City’s population.
             Race and ethnic characteristics of a population imply certain housing needs as some
             demographic and economic characteristics correlate with race. For example, the average

household size for the City of Santa Clara was 2.6 in 2000 (not shown in table). However,
the average household size for Hispanics was 3.4 and for Asian or Pacific Islanders 3.0.
These numbers reflect multi-generation families and/or a higher number of children
which may require larger units with more bedrooms.

8.12-3.2           Employment Trends
Employment
Santa Clara County is one of the Bay Area’s major job generators. The City added about
24,000 jobs between 1990 and 2000, growing from approximately 108,000 to nearly
132,000 jobs (a 22 percent increase), as shown in Table 8.12-3-5. Following the dot-
com collapse, ABAG estimates show reductions in jobs across all sectors in 2005, with
employment in the City decreasing to about 105,000. Approximately 49,000 residents of
Santa Clara were employed in 2005; in 2000, 30 percent of employed residents worked
in the City, while the remaining 70 percent commuted to other cities (primarily within
the County).
The Manufacturing, Wholesale and Transportation sector accounts for the largest
share of total jobs in the City, with 43 percent. The Financial and Professional Services
(which includes Research and Development activities) and Health, Education, and
Recreational sectors are the next largest sectors, accounting for 19 and 18 percent of all
jobs, respectively. ABAG estimates that the number of jobs in Santa Clara will increase
to nearly 117,000 by 2015, the end of the Housing Element planning period. The Health,
Education and Recreational sector is expected to see the largest increase in job growth
during this period. These employment projections suggest a need for housing to serve
a growing and diverse workforce.

             The list of major employers in the City, as shown in Table 8.12-3-6, supports the industry
             breakdown reported above. Santa Clara’s top employers are dominated by high-tech
             manufacturing companies, with Applied Materials and Intel topping the list.

             Unemployment Rate
             According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD) the
             unemployment rate in the City of Santa Clara was 4.3 percent in 2007. By comparison,
             the unemployment rate was 4.7 in Santa Clara County and 5.4 percent Statewide.
             Preliminary data for 2008 from EDD suggest that this rate has risen from 2007. The
             November 2008 unemployment rate in the City was 6.5 percent compared with 4.5
             percent in November 2007. The current regional and national economic downturn
             suggests that the unemployment rate may continue to rise in 2009.

Housing Trends
Between 2000 and 2008, the number of housing units in Santa Clara increased from
39,521 to over 44,166 (12 percent), as shown in Table 8.12-3-7. The majority of these
units, 42 percent, were single-family detached units. However, housing developments
with five or more units have been the fastest growing housing type in recent years,
adding over 3,000 units (an increase of 24 percent) since 2000. This suggests an increase
in higher-density, smaller, more aﬀordable (though not necessarily subsidized) units.

Tenure
According to the U.S. Census, approximately 54 percent of housing units in Santa Clara
were renter-occupied in 2006, while 46 percent of units were owner-occupied. These
proportions have not changed since 2000.
Housing Conditions
Age of Structures
Most of the housing stock in Santa Clara was built before 1980: 43 percent between 1960
and 1980 and 30 percent before 1960, as shown in Table 8.12-3-8. The median year that
structures were built was 1968. When units are 30 years or older, they typically begin to
require some major improvements and repairs in order to retain their quality.

         GENERAL PLAN
             Vacancy Rate
             The City has generally had low vacancy rates, with just three percent of units vacant in
             2006. In comparison, the County has a slightly higher vacancy rate, at four percent.
             Overcrowding
             Unacceptable overcrowding is generally defined as housing units where the number of
             occupants is greater than the number of rooms. Typically, overcrowding occurs because
             the household is unable to aﬀord larger accommodations. Overcrowding is not a major
             problem in Santa Clara; still, 1,843 households (or 4 percent of all households) are living
             in overcrowded conditions, as shown in Table 8.12-3-9. This represents an improvement
             over conditions in 2000, when seven percent of units were considered overcrowded.

             Substandard/In Need of Rehabilitation
             Consistent with prior General Plans and the Zoning Ordinance, the City supports
             maintenance and preservation of housing and the quality of residential neighborhoods.
             In 2005, the City’s Consolidated Plan 2005-2010 identified 1,569 units in need of
             rehabilitation. In the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the City assisted in the rehabilitation of
             155 units occupied by low income households. Since 1976, the City of Santa Clara has
             assisted in the rehabilitation of more than 1,000 homes. (A complete description of
             this program is provided in Chapter 8.12-4: Financing and Subsidy Resources of the
             Housing Element.)
             8.12-3.4            Special Needs Populations
             Housing is a basic necessity of life for everyone. However, the search for decent
             aﬀordable housing is greatly complicated for many individuals because of various
             barriers, including disability, advanced age, and life crisis. The City has identified several
             special populations that are in need of particular housing services and are most likely
             to be in the extremely-low income category: seniors, persons with disabilities, large
             families, single-parent households, college students, and families and persons in need of
             emergency shelter. (Given Santa Clara’s urban location, farmworkers are not considered
             a population with special needs, but a short description is provided below.)

Seniors
Seniors are expected to be the fastest growing age cohort in the County over the Housing
Element planning period. In 2006, the ACS reported approximately 11,500 residents 65
years or older living in the City of Santa Clara, representing ten percent of the population.
Countywide, ABAG projects a 47 percent growth rate among seniors over 65 between
2005 and 2015, suggesting that the City of Santa Clara could have nearly 17,000 seniors
by the end of the Housing Element planning period. Proportionally, seniors are expected
to compose nearly 40 percent of the total population increase.
As shown in Table 8.12-3-10, 61 percent of seniors in Santa Clara are homeowners and 39
percent are renters. Among seniors 85 years old and greater, however, only 46 percent
are homeowners, while 54 percent are renters. This may be due to the fact that as seniors
age, they may choose to sell their homes because their homes are too large or they
require additional care at a retirement or assisted living facility.

 Source: ACS, 2006.
In 2000, there were 4,348 extremely-low income households documented among all
households. Of this total, 42 percent were defined as elderly (62 years and over). Senior
housing needs may be more problematic to meet than the needs of other age cohorts
since seniors are often receiving a fixed income. In 2000, the Comprehensive Housing
Aﬀordability Strategy (CHAS) database reported that seniors compose a substantial
share of low income households as shown in Table 8.12-3-11. In addition, CHAS reported
an additional 4,098 very-low income households, with 37 percent of those composed of
elderly households; and 3,782 low income households, with 24 percent composed of
elderly populations.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             Additionally, many seniors have special housing needs such as handicap accessible
             living arrangements. In 2006, the ACS indicated that 35 percent of the elderly population
             in Santa Clara had a disability (3,797 seniors).
             Historically, waiting lists for aﬀordable senior housing have been long, suggesting
             that demand exceeds supply. Since the last planning period, the City has added more
             aﬀordable senior housing to the housing stock. There are currently five BMR senior
             housing developments in the City, containing a total of 615 studio, one- and two-
             bedroom units. There are another 55 beds within two assisted living facilities for seniors
             with mental or physical disabilities. Additionally, a 28-unit aﬀordable senior housing
             development was approved for construction as of 2008.
             Persons with Disabilities
             Persons with disabilities may require certain housing features or services. In 2000, the
             U.S. Census reported that 14,915 residents (16 percent of the City’s population) had one
             or more disabilities. Table 8.12-3-12 presents disabilities, by type (note that the table
             counts disabilities, not the number of persons with disabilities). Other disabilities, such
             as developmental disabilities, are not counted by the U.S. Census, but may also require
             special housing needs.

             While many of these persons do not require special housing, the U.S. Census indicated
             that approximately 36 percent of the disabled population in the City was unemployed
             in 2000. Therefore, low income is one significant obstacle to housing for the disabled
             population in Santa Clara. To help meet this need, the City has subsidized the acquisition
             of two residences for persons with developmental disabilities, accommodating six
             individuals in each home. In addition, the 450-unit Estancia/Archstone apartments have
             90 units reserved for low income households and 23 units designed and reserved for

those with developmental and physical disabilities. Housing Authority of the County
of Santa Clara (HACSC) also has three units within the City available to persons with
physical or developmental disabilities.
Large Families
Large households, those with five or more persons, often have special housing needs
due to their income and the lack of adequately sized, aﬀordable housing. As a result,
large households may live in overcrowded conditions. Although one-, two-, and three-
person households account for the majority of household sizes in the City (81 percent),
there are a small number of five or more person households. In 2006, the ACS reported
2,980 households with five or more members in Santa Clara, representing seven percent
of total households, as shown in Table 8.12-3-13. Large owner-occupied units are
more prevalent than large renter-occupied units. The CHAS data further indicate that
among large households in the City, approximately 65 percent experience some form
of overcrowding, cost burden, and/or substandard conditions. This statistic seems to
illustrate that Santa Clara has a need for aﬀordable housing units with three or more
bedrooms.

Since 2000, most new development, approximately 4,600 units, has been multi-family
development, with five or more units. Currently, 55 percent of the housing stock is
composed of studios, and one- or two-bedroom units. Three-bedroom units compose
nearly a third of all units, but four-bedroom units only account for 12 percent, and five
or more bedrooms just one percent.
Potentially compounding the unmet housing needs of larger families is that household
incomes typically decrease with household size. Table 8.12-3-14 shows that household
income is highest among four-person households, at $100,703, but declines as household
size increases above four people, to $59,473 for households with seven or more members.
It is likely these larger households have more children or grandparents who are not
employed.

             Single-parent Households
             Single-parents may also have greater unmet housing needs, as sole income earners
             with dependent children. In 2006, there were 3,266 households (or eight percent of total
             households) occupied by a female-headed household, with no male present. Of these,
             over 61 percent (2,022 households) included children. In comparison, single-male-
             headed households with children made up only 993 households.
             Families and Persons in Need of Emergency Shelters
             Families and persons in emergency shelters have critical and immediate needs for
             transitional, supportive and long-term permanent housing. This population may include
             many of the groups described above, as well as other extremely-low income households,
             youth, victims of domestic violence, and temporarily or chronically homeless.
             Homelessness
             The number of homeless persons and families has been increasing nationally and
             in the Bay Area. The demographics of the homeless also have been changing, from
             predominately single persons, often with substance abuse or mental illness, to an
             increasing number of families unable to aﬀord high rents.
             According to the 2007 Santa Clara County Homeless Census and Survey, there were
             7,202 homeless people in Santa Clara County counted in January 2007. Over 70 percent
             of these individuals were found in shelters, 29 percent were unsheltered. In the City of
             Santa Clara, 480 people were counted during this survey; 206 people were identified in
             emergency shelters or tansitional housing facilities, 274 were counted as unsheltered.
             These 274 people represent our estimate of additional emergency and transitional
             housing need, recognizing that this could over or underestimate the actual need.
             Moreover, the report annualizes these numbers, assuming that people cycle in and
             out of homelessness at diﬀerent points during the year. Using this assumption, over
             18,000 persons were estimated to be homeless at some point in Santa Clara County
             during 2007. Although these numbers represent small fractions of the total population
             (less than one percent at both the City and County level), the shelter and care needs of
             homeless individuals are great.

Appendix Twelve: HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                             8.12
The City is currently undergoing a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update.
Through Program C-3.4 of this Housing Element, the City proposes to revise the
Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters in at least one zoning district, by right.
Allowing emergency shelters by right eliminates permit processing, development
and management standards that may have previously stood in the way of facilitating
development. In order to accommodate almost 300 homeless individuals, multiple sites
will need to be identified, in addition to the facilities already provided by the City (see
Emergency Housing Provided in the City, below). Emergency shelters will be allowed
by right in the Public Facilities (B) district, and also be encouraged in existing multi-
family residential districts or commercial districts that are close to transit and services,
through Planned Development Zoning or conversion of older hotels and motels.
Although the Public Facility zone has not been identified in the Housing Opportunities
Table (Table 8.12-6-3 and 8.12-6-4), there are multiple sites throughout the City that can
accommodate emergency shelters. Since the City controls many of these sites, and other
sites are home to schools, churches and other government or non-profit facilities, the
likelihood of an emergency shelter being constructed at these locations is higher than
on other commercial or multi-family sites, due to market conditions.
Youth
Housing stakeholders and providers interviewed for this Housing Element identified
a need for transitional, supportive and permanent housing for youth. These housing
types could come in various forms, from a renovated single-family home with just a
few residents, to larger residences serving 20 youth. This type of housing requires on-
site social services or other support. In addition, stakeholders recommended additional
single-room occupancy units (SRO) to serve various populations with limited incomes,
from homeless and transitional populations, to seniors and young people, just out of
high school or college.
Emergency Housing Provided in the City
The City of Santa Clara has seven sites where persons in need of emergency shelter can
seek a bed and other assistance, as shown in Table 8.12-3-15.
                                                                                             Page 8.12-19

              Center
             The Bill Wilson Center, partially funded by the City of Santa Clara, provides short-term
             housing for runaway and homeless youth ages 11-17, and transitional and supportive
             housing services for youth and young adults 17-21 years old and young-parent families.
             The City helped fund the acquisition of an apartment building and a house located on
             another site that provides transitional housing services to ten young homeless families.
             A triplex purchased using Federal HOME funds and City RDA funds houses eight single
             homeless teens.
             The Emergency Housing Consortium’s Sobrato Family Living Center provides
             emergency housing for up to 43 families. The Center also provides eight units of
             permanent aﬀordable housing, a community center, and a computer learning center.
             The shelter houses up to 100 persons per night. Clients may remain at the shelter for
             up to 90 days and receive tenant education as well as information on area housing and
             jobs, children’s programs, case management and other subjects. RDA funds also have
             assisted with the construction of a 24 unit Homesafe Transitional Housing project on
             City-owned land for those who have experienced domestic violence.
             Policy C-3 and its implementation actions, identified in Chapter 7, respond to State
             requirements under Senate Bill 2 to identify at least one zone containing uses
             compatible with emergency shelters and that will permit emergency shelters by right, to
             accommodate the needs of the youth and adult population described above. This change
             will be part of the City’s Zoning Ordinance Update currently underway. The Ordinance
             is expected to be adopted within the one year of Housing Element adoption. To date, the
             City has shown an ability to provide transitional, supportive and emergency housing
             through group homes and small apartment complexes.

Farmworkers
Since the closest agricultural production operations are located more than 30 miles from
the City, in southern Santa Clara County, farmworkers have not been identified as a
subgroup with special housing needs. The 2000 U.S. Census reported just 94 City of
Santa Clara residents working in the farming, fishing, or forestry industries.
College Students
The City of Santa Clara contains several higher education institutions: Santa Clara
University (SCU), Golden State Baptist College, and Mission College.
SCU currently has a total enrollment of over 8,000 students. The University has begun
a program of expanding its on-campus housing with the intent of encouraging more
students to live on campus. SCU is currently updating its master plan. At this time,
SCU anticipates an increase in the number of students served by on-campus housing,
from 2,500 to 3,500. The City supports the expansion of the variety of types of housing
opportunities provided on-campus, in order to minimize impacts on the City’s oﬀ-
campus housing stock. Students tend to have limited incomes and traditionally seek
small units, or share housing units. Since the previous Housing Element period, the
University constructed apartment-style living quarters to house 290 students.
Golden State Baptist College is an undergraduate facility that houses over 400 students
in on-campus dormitories. Mission College is a community junior college attended by
over 9,000 full- and part-time students who commute from in and outside the City and
County. Currently, Mission College has no on-campus residency.
Extremely-Low Income and Very-Low Income Households and Housing
Provided
The CHAS database reported 4,348 extremely-low income households in 2000,
representing 11 percent of total households in the City of Santa Clara. In addition, 4,086
households were defined as very-low income, representing another 11 percent of total
households. Table 8.12-3-16 estimates the number of households, by income, in 2006
and 2015 by assuming these same income category proportions over time (i.e. no change
in income) and by using the total number of households estimated by the ACS and
projected by ABAG, respectively. As a result, 5,344 extremely-low income households
and 5,037 very-low income households may be expected by the end of the planning
period. For the purposes of meeting the RHNA, half of the very-low income units are
assumed to be needed by extremely-low income households. This is consistent with the
proportion determined by the CHAS data and HCD provisions.

        Section 8 Vouchers
        The City of Santa Clara contracts with the HACSC to administer its rental assistance programs,
        specifically the Section 8 Voucher program. According to an HACSC oﬃcial, there is a waiting
        list of 58,000 households seeking Section 8 vouchers at the County level. As of March 2008,
        there were 867 City of Santa Clara residents with Tenant-Based Section 8 Vouchers, 732 of
        which (85 percent) were considered extremely-low income. Another 2,627 residents were on
        the waiting list, of which 1,751 (71 percent) were extremely-low income households. Although
        many of these individuals and families already have housing, this waiting list suggests a high
        demand for additional aﬀordable housing opportunities.
        Redevelopment Agency Affordable Housing Fund
        The Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan for the July 1, 2009 to June 20, 2019 coincides
        with this Housing Element planning period and estimates funding projected to be available
        for low income households. Between 2009 and 2014 the Agency anticipates that nearly $31
        million will be available for construction and rehabilitation of housing for very-low income
        households (producing 461 units). These funds can assist private, for-profit and non-profit
        developers both in developing new housing and in acquiring/rehabilitating existing housing.
        Projects to acquire and rehabilitate existing housing will typically be multi-family rental
        housing. Rents are restricted to insure that the units remain aﬀordable for lower-income
        households.
        The City’s 2005 Five-Year Consolidated Plan describes aﬀordable housing priorities that
        place extremely-low and very-low income households among the most important needs to
        fund. This plan calls for the City to select proposed eligible projects based on the following
        priorities:
                 •       No medium or low priority needs will be funded with federal funds.
                 •       Projects leveraging non-City funds at greater than 4-1 will be given higher
                         priority.
                 •       Entitlement funds will focus on limited, special population projects,
                         particularly extremely-low income households;
                 •       RDA funds will focus on larger, new construction projects.

        •      Entitlement funds will focus on renter projects.
        •      Self-Help homeowner projects for very low income households will be given
               high priority.
Public Housing
HACSC also manages 325 public housing units throughout the City, in six separate
developments. These developments are described in Table 8.12-3-17.
Assisted Housing Units
As shown in Table 8.12-3-17, the City’s RDA plays an active role in funding aﬀordable housing
and has placed long-term aﬀordability restrictions on several projects. Some of these housing
developments also contain support services. In addition, BMR units are provided through
the City’s inclusionary housing requirement, which requires new developments with ten
or more dwelling units to provide at least ten percent of their units at below-market rates.
During the previous housing element period (1999-2006), this policy helped to produce 123
aﬀordable units.
Factors in determining the applicable income levels for restricted housing units in a subsidized
project tend to include 1) characteristics of the resident base to be served, 2) the RHNA
needs and the City’s current status in addressing the needs, 3) the financial subsidy amount
and the anticipated return on investment, and 4) the characteristics of the housing project
being proposed. In regard to the City’s Inclusionary Housing Policy, generally, ownership
housing is geared toward moderate income (80% - 120% AMI) households and rental housing
(established typically through a development agreement) for low income (51% - 80% AMI)
and very low income (50% and less AMI).
The Housing and Community Services Division of the City’s Planning and Inspection
Department implements the aﬀordable housing programs. These programs are based on
three planning documents:
    1. The Housing Element – 2009-2014
    2. RDA Implementation Plan – 2009-2019
    3. Consolidated Plan for use of federal funds – July 2010 to June 2015.
The Consolidated Plan is the only document that sets forth a comprehensive strategy
incorporating all the City’s aﬀordable housing initiatives. The document includes needs and
strategies put forth in the other two documents. The Redevelopment Agency’s approach in
using the Aﬀordable Housing Fund is to create, sustain and improve aﬀordable housing
in situations where market forces normally do not come to bear. This is most evident with
Special Needs groups that are generally considered to be extremely low income (30% and
less AMI).

8.12-3.5         At-Risk Housing
The State’s housing element and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) consolidated
plan regulations require cities to prepare an inventory of all assisted aﬀordable multi-
family rental units which are eligible, or “at risk,” to convert to market rate housing due
to termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions.
This inventory covers the ten-year evaluation period following the statutory due date of
the Housing Element (July 1, 2009) and the five-year planning period of the Consolidated
Plan as required by the State regulations and the HUD Consolidated Plan, respectively.
To satisfy both State and federal requirements, the at-risk housing analysis period in
this Housing Element is from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2019. The analysis represents
a review of current status and options, rather than a statement of City policy.
According to an assessment by California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC), no
assisted development in the City of Santa Clara is considered at high risk of conversion
to market rate housing.1 Only the following project identified on Table 8.12-3-17 was
determined to be at low risk of conversion during the 2009-2019 period.
Located at 890 Main Street, Liberty Towers is a 100-unit apartment complex, with all
of the units allocated for occupancy by very-low income seniors. The project receives
Section 8 project-based assistance. Under the Section 8 contracts, the project owner
provides units aﬀordable to lower income families for a specified time period. The City
has a currently funded rehabilitation project for Liberty Towers, scheduled to begin
in 2009. This project will extend the aﬀordability restriction for five years after the
date of project completion, or until about 2015. In addition, Liberty Towers receives
financial assistance through the HUD Section 236 and Section 202 programs. Through
these programs, the owner was provided mortgage insurance and interest reduction
payments. The earliest termination date of Section 236 and Section 202 loan assistance is
September 20, 2013. Given its non-profit ownership, however, it is unlikely that Liberty
Towers will be converted to market-rate housing within the 2009-2019 time period.

  CHPC is a non-profit organization that maintains a database of aﬀordable housing developments at-
risk of conversion to market rate; this list is available to local governments and non-profit partners.

         GENERAL PLAN
        8.12-4         FINANCING AND SUBSIDY RESOURCES
        The City has three primary sources of revenue to support the development of aﬀordable
        housing: the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Santa Clara Aﬀordable Housing
        Set-Aside (RDA), the Home Investment Partnerships Act (HOME) and the Community
        Development Block Grant (CDBG). The administration of these sources and the
        development of new housing and maintenance of existing housing are coordinated
        through the City’s Housing and Community Services Division. A portion of the RDA
        funds will be used for homebuyer assistance, primarily addressing households between
        80 and 110 percent of the area median income. CDBG and HOME funds can only be
        used for lower income households, those at or below 80 percent of the area median
        income. The following opportunities are derived from these sources.
        8.12-4.1       Local Opportunities
        The following local housing assistance programs are available to support the provision
        of aﬀordable housing in the City of Santa Clara:
             City of Santa Clara Below Market Price Program: The City of Santa Clara
               has a Below Market Price (BMP) housing program that creates new housing
               opportunities for low and moderate income households. Under the program,
               new housing developments with ten units or more must include ten percent of
               the units as aﬀordable. A resale restriction is placed on the aﬀordable homes for
               a period of 20 years. If the home is sold prior to the 20th year, the homeowner
               must repay to the City the diﬀerence between the below-market price and the
               market rate price established at the time of initial purchase as well as a portion
               of the appreciated value. Payments made to the City through this program are
               then available to fund more aﬀordable housing projects in the future.
             City of Santa Clara 1st Time Home Buyer’s Financing Program: Through the 1st
               Time Home Buyer’s Financing Program, the City provides a second mortgage
               to qualified moderate income home buyers to assist in the purchase of their first
               homes in the City of Santa Clara. The first mortgage is provided through Metlife
               Home Loans, or Neighborhood Housing Services Silicon Valley, Inc. utilizing
               California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) as a primary lender.
             City of Santa Clara Neighborhood Conservation Improvement Program: The
               Neighborhood Conservation Improvement Program (NCIP) is a multi-purposed
               program oﬀering technical and financial assistance to qualified residents of the
               City of Santa Clara with gross household incomes at or below 80 percent of the
               area median income. Qualified homeowners work with City staﬀ to correct
               building/housing code deficiencies and abate hazardous conditions, such as
               those related to roofing, plumbing, heating/cooling, electrical, termite damage,
               foundations and weatherization. Financial assistance can be in the form of a low
               interest loan, grant, or combination of both. Since 1976, the City has assisted
               more than 1,000 low income homeowners through this program.

     Housing Trust of Santa Clara County: The Housing Trust of Santa Clara County
        has a multi-family rental program and a first-time homebuyer program to assist
        in creating housing opportunities for low and moderate income households.
        The multi-family rental program is designed to promote the development,
        rehabilitation, and maintenance of aﬀordable multi-family rental projects in
        Santa Clara County through five financing products:
        1. Land or property acquisition loans;
        2. Construction gap loans;
        3. Predevelopment loans;
        4. Debt service coverage guaranties; and
        5. Long term gap/permanent loans.
These funds, which are available for projects, to a maximum of $500,000 per project,
are restricted to projects aﬀordable to households earning from 30 to 80 percent of the
area median income. The first-time homebuyer program has a downpayment assistance
program of up to $75,000 per household as well as a BMR second loan program that
is used to reduce the first loan’s interest rate and prepay private mortgage insurance.
Through the City’s support of the Trust, funding supports housing projects within the
City of Santa Clara.
Redevelopment Agency
The RDA of the City of Santa Clara has two project areas, the University project area and
the Bayshore North project area. Under State law, 20 percent of annual tax increment
funds from redevelopment project areas are required to be used for aﬀordable housing.
Beginning in July 2002, the RDA increased the set-aside for the Bayshore North project
area to 30 percent. The City Council reviews the need for the additional 10 percent
set-aside annually. For the period July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2014, the current RDA
Implementation Plan projects that the required housing set-aside will provide revenues
of $43.4 million available for aﬀordable housing.
The Agency has several programs that use housing set-aside funds:
     Rental housing development, which generally subsidize 100 percent aﬀordable
        projects with non-profit owners, a high proportion of which serve very-low
        income households;
     Subsidies for BMR rental and ownership units through the City’s inclusionary
        housing policy that requires that 10 percent of new units be rented/sold to
        qualified low and moderate income households;
     A first-time homebuyer loan program; and,
                                                                                          Page 8.12-27

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                  A homeless/transitional/supportive housing program for new construction and
                     acquisition of housing for special needs populations. This funding category was
                     established to assist non-profit housing organizations in either developing new
                     facilities or rehabilitating existing facilities.
             RDA Administration funds have also been used to fund several aﬀordable housing
             service agencies supported by the City. Eight housing services, including transitional
             housing support for homeless families, persons with disabilities, seniors, and survivors
             of domestic violence, a shared housing broker, mortgage credit counseling and first-
             time homebuyer training, and fair housing services, are funded with RDA funds. These
             programs target extremely-low and very-low income households.
             Between 1992 and 2003, the RDA utilized its housing set-aside funds to assist in the
             development of approximately 900 very-low and low income rental units and 49 moderate
             income for-sale homes through the City’s BMP program. Between 1996 and 2003, the
             RDA assisted 238 low and moderate income households in purchasing homes through
             the First Time Home Buyer program. According to the current RDA Implementation
             Plan, between FY 2008/2009 and 2013/2014, it is estimated that the Agency will use
             approximately $70 million of housing set-aside funds to assist in creating and preserving
             561 housing units for very-low, low, and moderate income households.
             8.12-4.2         Regional Opportunities
             Section 8 Housing Choices Voucher Program
             HACSC administers the federal Section 8 Housing Choices Voucher Program, which
             assists very-low income households in renting safe and sanitary housing. Under the
             program, each very-low income household is responsible for finding appropriate
             housing within the private market. The federal government mandates that the voucher
             recipient pay 30 percent of its monthly adjusted gross income for rent and utilities.
             HUD, through the Housing Authority, then pays the remainder of the rent directly to
             the landlord. If the household chooses a unit where costs are greater than market rate,
             the voucher recipient is expected to pay the additional amount. The HUD-established
             fair market monthly rents applicable to the City of Santa Clara, eﬀective October 2008,
             are $961 for studios, $1,113 for one-bedroom units, $1,338 for two-bedroom units, $1,924
             for three-bedroom units and $2,118 for four-bedroom units.
             According to HACSC, there are almost 15,000 households being assisted by the Housing
             Choice Voucher Program countywide. As of March 2008, there were 865 Section 8
             participants in the City of Santa Clara, and over 2,500 applicants on the waiting list
             (which is currently closed). HACSC has created new aﬀordable housing opportunities
             through new construction and rehabilitation projects throughout the county. HACSC
             projects currently open and operating in the City of Santa Clara include John Burns
             Gardens (100 units), RiverTown (100 units), Deborah Drive Apartments (20 units),
             Eklund Gardens (16 units), Miramar Apartments (16 units), Klamath Gardens (17 units),
             and Bracher Senior Apartments (72 units).

8.12-4.3       State Opportunities
State funding programs to assist in the development and preservation of aﬀordable
housing are primarily administered through the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) and CalHFA. Funding for a number of HCD
and CalHFA programs has been made possible through passage of Proposition 1C, the
Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2006. The following is a select list of
programs oﬀered through HCD and CalHFA:
     Building Equity and Growth in Neighborhoods Program: The Building Equity
       and Growth in Neighborhoods Program (BEGIN) provides grants to cities and
       counties to make deferred-payment second mortgage loans to qualified buyers of
       new homes in projects with aﬀordability enhanced by local regulatory incentives
       or barrier reductions.
     CalHOME: Grants to local public agencies and nonprofit developers are oﬀered
       through this program to assist individual households through deferred-payment
       loans and direct, forgivable loans to assist development projects involving
       multiple ownership units, including single-family subdivisions.
     Infill Infrastructure Grant Program: Assisting in the new construction and
       rehabilitation of infrastructure, this program supports higher-density aﬀordable
       and mixed income housing in locations designated as infill.
     Multifamily Housing Program: The Multifamily Housing Program (MHP)
       assists the new construction, rehabilitation and preservation of permanent and
       transitional rental housing for lower income households.
     TOD Housing Program: Permanent financing for the development and
       construction of mixed use and rental housing development projects, for
       homeownership mortgage assistance, and for grants for infrastructure necessary
       for the development of housing near transit stations, or to facilitate connections
       between housing and the transit station is provided by the TOD Housing
       Program.
     CalHFA First Mortgage Loan Program: This is a 30-year low interest, fixed rate
       mortgage program.
     CalHFA Down Payment Assistance Loan Programs: The program oﬀers low
       interest and deferred payment subordinate loans.
     CalHFA Multifamily Lending Programs: This program provides acquisition,
       predevelopment, construction, and permanent financing for acquisition,
       rehabilitation, and new construction of rental housing that includes aﬀordable
       rents for low and moderate income families and individuals.
                                                                                          Page 8.12-29

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             8.12-4.4        Federal Opportunities
             Federal resources available and used by the City include the following:
                  Community Development Block Grant: The                   Community    Development
                     Block Grant (CDBG) funds are annual direct grants provided to metropolitan
                     areas and urban counties to revitalize neighborhoods, expand aﬀordable housing
                     opportunities, and/or improve community facilities and services. The City of
                     Santa Clara is an entitlement city under the CDBG program. According to the
                     City’s current Consolidated Plan, the City uses CDBG funds for administration
                     (20 percent), public services (15 percent), and capital improvements for both
                     housing and non-housing activities (65 percent). The City has three major
                     programs for which it uses CDBG funds:
                     1. Rental rehabilitation, generally 100 percent aﬀordable projects working with
                         non-profit owners;
                     2. Homeowner rehabilitation through the City’s NCIP; and
                     3. Public facilities.
                     According to the City of Santa Clara’s 2007 CDBG and HOME Program Annual
                     Plan, it was estimated that the 2007 entitlement of CDBG funds was about $1.1
                     million. With additional unexpended funds from the previous period, the City
                     spent approximately $1.6 million in CDBG funds during that fiscal year. Only
                     about 14 percent of these funds went to planning and administrative costs, with
                     the remaining 86 percent allocated towards programs that benefited low or
                     moderate income households.
                  HOME Investment Partnerships Program: The HOME program provides
                     grants to states and departments of local governments to implement local
                     housing strategies designed to increase homeownership and aﬀordable housing
                     opportunities for extremely-low and very-low income households. These funds
                     can be used for housing rehabilitation, tenant-based rental assistance, assistance
                     to homebuyers, housing acquisition, and new housing construction. The City
                     of Santa Clara is a Participating Jurisdiction in the HOME program and uses
                     90 percent of its HOME funds for capital projects. The City has four primary
                     programs for using HOME funds:
                     1.      Rental rehabilitation: Generally 100% aﬀordable projects working with
                     non-profit owners. The City has developed a HOME Rental Rehabilitation
                     Program for private owners, but no owner has chosen to participate in the pro-
                     gram because of the rent and income restrictions. Projects are usually targeted
                     for special populations such as seniors, the homeless, persons with disabilities
                     and extremely low income households. While focused on rehabilitation, this
                     program also assists acquisition and re-habilitation of existing rental properties,
                     usually in conjunction with RDA funds;

Appendix Twelve: HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                           8.12
       2.      Homeowner rehabilitation: HOME funds are usually focused on higher
       cost rehabilitation projects;
       3.      “Sweat equity” homeownership (such as Silicon Valley Habitat for
       Humanity): In the last five years, the City has developed a working partnership
       with Silicon Valley Habitat for Humanity. Because Habitat brings substantial
       in-kind contributions, particularly labor, it can eﬀectively reduce home purchase
       prices to a level aﬀordable to very low income households. Such projects
       generally need City help in obtaining land, and are often small, in-fill projects;
       and
       4.      Homeless/transitional housing: Assists non-profit housing organizations
       in new construction and acquisition of housing for special needs populations.
       HOME funds are often combined with RDA funds, which are the primary source
       of the City’s HOME Program local match. The beneficiaries of this program are
       primarily extremely low income.
       According to the City of Santa Clara’s 2007 CDBG and HOME Program Annual
       Plan it was estimated that the 2007 entitlement of HOME funds was about
       $618,000.
     HUD Programs: The United States Department of Housing and Urban
       Development oﬀers a number of programs in support of new construction and
       preservation of aﬀordable housing. Among the many programs oﬀered by HUD
       are the Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESG) for emergency or transitional
       shelters for the homeless, the Section 202 program to finance the development
       of rental housing with supportive services for the elderly, and the Section 811
       program to finance the development of rental housing with the availability of
       supportive services for persons with disabilities.
     Low Income Housing Tax Credits: Federal tax credits support new construction
       and rehabilitation of multi-family rental units aﬀordable to very-low and low
       income households. The tax credit program is administered in California by the
       Tax Credit Allocation Committee (TCAC), which also administers the State tax
       credit program.
8.12-5         HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
8.12-5.1       Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints for aﬀordable housing development are defined as policies,
standards, requirements or actions imposed by the various levels of government upon
land and housing development. Although State and federal agencies play a role in the
imposition of governmental constraints, local government’s ability to influence these
agencies is generally limited. Housing constraints associated with these State and federal
                                                                                           Page 8.12-31

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             governmental constraints are, therefore, not significantly addressed in this document.
             Municipal Boundaries
             The City of Santa Clara is completely surrounded by the boundaries of other cities: San
             José to the north, east and south; and Cupertino and Sunnyvale to the west. Other than
             a small parcel on Homestead Road, there are no other developable lands potentially
             annexable to the City. In addition, there are only five acres of vacant land within the
             City limits with the potential for residential development. The City’s new housing
             opportunities, therefore, must come from within the existing City limits, and primarily
             through redevelopment of existing parcels.
             Land Use Controls and Development Standards
             Land use controls have helped maintain the quality of the City’s residential
             neighborhoods, consistent with community established goals. These land use controls,
             however, can be viewed as constraints in that they determine the amount of land to be
             developed for housing and establish a limit on the number of units that can be built on
             a site. These standards have not been changed substantially since 1969.
             Based on interviews with housing stakeholders, development requirements were
             not generally identified as a constraint to development because City staﬀ are helpful
             and regulations are clear and reasonable. Stakeholders did identify a few potential
             improvements that could increase their ability to provide housing, such as flexibility in
             parking, height, and density requirements. Interdepartmental consistency in the City
             was also identified as an area for improvement.
             Stakeholders also generally agreed that the City’s inclusionary housing program, which
             requires that 10 percent of the units are aﬀordable for projects of 10 or more units, has
             been successful, working for both developers and the City, to appropriately increase the
             amount of aﬀordable housing for residents.
             General Plan
             The City’s current (1992) General Plan includes a range of residential land use
             designations and densities, from Single Family Detached with a minimum density of
             one dwelling unit per acre to a High Density with a minimum density of 37 units per
             acre. The City’s Transit-Oriented Mixed Use designation allows residential densities up
             to 45 dwelling units per acre. Because of high land costs in the City, sites that are zoned
             for high-density housing are typically occupied by multi-family housing developments.
             The City has few instances where single-family homes occupy sites that are zoned for
             higher density housing.
             Zoning Ordinance
             The Zoning Ordinance establishes use districts in conformance with the General Plan.
             It also specifies parking requirements and on- and oﬀ-site improvement requirements

which have an impact on development cost and project feasibility.
Use Districts
Residential uses are permitted in ten zoning districts and in the City’s mixed-use, overlay
and combining districts, allowing flexibility for mixing land uses and supporting large-
scale and master-planned development projects. Permitted housing types are described
in Table 8.12-5-1. Although single-family uses are permitted in multi-family zones, this
rarely occurs in the City on sites large enough for multi-family housing.

As shown in Table 8.12-5-1, emergency shelters are not explicitly permitted in any
zoning district by right, as required by Senate Bill 2. Policy C-3 and its implementation
actions, identified in Chapter 7, respond to these State requirements and are expected
to be adopted within the one year of Housing Element adoption. To date, the City has
shown an ability to provide transitional and emergency housing through group homes
                                                                                                                 Page 8.12-33

        GENERAL PLAN
               and small apartment complexes. These facilities are detailed in Section 3.4: Special
               Needs Populations.
               In addition to the residential categories above, the Planned Development zoning
               district also permits residential development. It allows flexibility in both development
               standards and land use mix not permitted in other zones in order to adapt to specific
               site constraints without reducing housing density or adding cost to aﬀordable housing
               units. Mixed use combining districts additionally allow residential development on
               commercial properties.
               Development Standards
               Table 8.12-5-2 outlines the residential standards under each zoning classification.
               The current Zoning Ordinance stipulates minimum lot sizes, setbacks, widths, and
               densities, as well as restrictions on building and landscape coverage. The Ordinance
               does not define maximum floor-area ratios. As to the maximum development potential,
               some of the housing stakeholders suggested that more flexibility in building heights
               and densities could expand the type of housing products constructed. At least one
               stakeholder suggested establishing minimum densities to preclude lower densities on
               the sites available for higher density housing. The City’s historic Old Quad area can pose
               added constraints to housing due to development standards that often require variances
               on applications in this neighborhood, adding time and costs to the development process.

An analysis of Santa Clara’s development regulations compared with those of Mountain
View, Sunnyvale, and San José showed that these cities have fairly similar standards. For
example, front and rear minimum setbacks are all in the 15 to 25 foot range and, where
maximum building coverage is specified, it is in the 35 to 45 percent range. In terms of
maximum building height, Sunnyvale and San Jose permit higher height limits (30-55
and 35-45 feet, respectively), compared to Santa Clara. Stakeholders described Santa
Clara’s development regulations as appropriate and often more flexible compared with
surrounding jurisdictions. Likewise, stakeholders felt that standards such as minimum
landscaping requirements improved the attractiveness of developments and were an
important component of projects, not just requirements to be met. In sum, the City’s
development standards do not substantially restrict the cost and supply of housing
overall or lower income housing in particular.
The majority of the residential areas in the City are composed of single-family districts.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the construction of multi-family units, as
shown in Chart 8.12-5-1, where housing types with five or more units have increased.
Existing development standards have not discouraged multi-family development,
which typically provide a good opportunity for aﬀordable housing in the City.

Most residential approvals since 1985 have been Planned Developments of various
types, all at densities above typical single-family densities, due to the fact that there
are very few housing sites that can be developed under the standard multi-family (or
R-3 zoning district) standards due to lot size constraints. To illustrate, Table 8.12-5-3
and Figure 8.12-5-1 show underutilized sites (where the assessed value is less than the
land value or the FAR is less than 0.35) in the R-3 districts. Of the 87.5 acres available for
multi-family housing, one-third consists of lots of less than 8,500 square feet which do
not permit multi-family development without a variance.

             Parking Standards
             Parking can substantially add to the cost of housing. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
             currently requires two spaces per unit in both single-family and multi-family districts.
             The Mixed-Use and Transit-Oriented Mixed Use classifications require one space for a
             studio, one and a half spaces for a one-bedroom unit and two spaces for two- or more
             bedroom units.
             At a forum conducted as part of the Housing Element outreach, stakeholders had
             mixed opinions about parking requirements. Stakeholders were also concerned that
             an under-supply of parking could lead to neighborhood opposition to development
             proposals. An option of unbundled parking (where residents are charged separately
             for parking and housing costs) could have the unintended consequence of creating
             additional purchasing costs for BMR units. Parking requirements can be a constraint
             to development but the development standards relating to parking may be relieved
             through a Planned Development process, allowing more flexibility on the site.
             Building Codes and Enforcement
             Building Codes and their enforcement in the City are not a constraint to residential
             development, as compared to neighboring jurisdictions. New construction is required
             to meet California Building Code regulations, without substantial supplemental local
             requirements. Existing single-family, duplex and triplex units are inspected only when
             an owner seeks a permit for additional construction or complaints are received. Certain
             types of major additions require the applicant to bring the building or portion thereof
             up to current codes. Site improvement standards for residential development in the
             City, with the exception of minimum parking requirements, are not more restrictive
             than those in surrounding jurisdictions.
             During community outreach workshops and meetings, a desire for green building
             standards in the City surfaced. Housing stakeholders did not see such standards as a
             constraint, as long as there were incentives in place (e.g. additional height or intensity

             Policies in 2008.
             Persons with Disabilities
             Compliance with Building Codes and State accessibility laws and regulations (California
             Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 24) may increase the cost of housing production and
             impact the viability of rehabilitating older properties. These regulations are minimum
             Statewide standards to ensure safety and accessibility and do not significantly contribute
             to governmental constraints with regard to housing for persons with disabilities. In
             addition, the City does not impose supplemental local requirements with respect to
             accessibility.
             A request to retrofit an existing residence with accessibility equipment (i.e., a ramp,
             landing, lift, etc.) is typically approved “over the counter,” if the proposal does not
             negatively impact the neighborhood or surrounding properties. When more review is
             required, the City’s Architectural Committee reviews the request. Since the City’s multi-
             family housing zones are typically located along major corridors, such as Lawrence
             Expressway and Homestead Road, the result is convenient access to services and public
             facilities. Senior housing in Santa Clara also includes many features to meet the needs
             of persons with disabilities. Finally, accessibility to services and public transportation to
             meet the needs of individuals with disabilities is encouraged through the City’s flexible
             development standards for mixed-use developments.
             Approximately $1.8 million in CDBG and HOME funds were provided to the City in
             the previous planning period to implement ADA and State building code requirements
             for accessible housing units. In addition, the City’s Neighborhood Conservation &
             Improvement Program provided grants of up to $10,000 for accessibility improvements
             in the 216 homes occupied by low-income homeowners. The City expects to issue a
             similar number of grants during the 2007-2014 planning period.
             On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
             On- and oﬀ-site improvements, including public streets, curbing, sidewalks, street
             lights, water, sewer, and drainage requirements, have an impact on the cost of residential
             development. Improvement requirements for new developments are regulated under
             the Subdivision Ordinance (Chapter 17.05 of the Municipal Code). Oﬀ-site improvement
             requirements are less costly in a fully developed community since infrastructure needed
             to serve infill development is already in place. The financial burden of improvements
             as the City’s infrastructure ages is, however, a concern. To assist private developers and
             public projects in the development process, the City has published the Standard Details
             document which outlines construction standards for the most common improvement
             requirements, such as sidewalks, storm drains, and sewer connections. This publication is
             updated periodically and available on the City’s website. The standards are as follows:
                  Dedication of streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way or easements may be
                      a condition of approval for a tentative, or parcel map. These requirements may be
                      easements that are needed for streets, alleys, access, drainage, public greenways,

        scenic easements, public utilities, and other public purposes. In addition, these
        easements or dedications may include requirements for improvements.
     Required on-site street improvements can include construction of curbs,
        sidewalks, driveway approaches, and transitions.
     Storm drain systems must be designed to collect and convey storm water, avoid
        damage to adjacent properties, and support the ultimate development of the
        watershed. Oﬀ-site storm drain improvements may also be required to satisfy
        this requirement.
     Projects must connect to sewer, water, gas, and electric lines.
     Development located in the Utility Underground District, as designated in the
        current General Plan, is required to underground utility lines (or pay an in lieu
        fee).
The City’s Project Coordinating Committee (a development review committee made up
of representatives from diﬀerent departments in the City) reviews new development
applications and determines, pursuant to each City department, required infrastructure
improvements and conditions of approval.
Architectural Review Process
Architectural review in Santa Clara is intended to ensure the implementation of Zoning
Ordinance standards and General Plan policies. This process is codified in Chapter 18.76
of the City’s Zoning Ordinance and summarized below.
     Applicant submits plans and drawings for any sign, building, structure, or
        alteration of the exterior of a structure in a form and detail prescribed by Director
        of Planning and Inspection to the Architectural Committee.
     The Architectural Committee makes findings based on the following standards
        of architectural design:
      - Oﬀ-street parking areas, screening strips and other facilities and improvements
      must meet the Zoning Ordinance and General Plan intent.
      - Design and location of the proposed development and its relation to neighboring
      developments and traﬃc will not impair the desirability of the neighborhood, will
      not create traﬃc congestion or hazard, and will not be detrimental to harmonious
      development.
      - Approval will not adversely impact the health, comfort or general welfare of
      persons residing or working in the neighborhood.
      - The architectural committee may require the applicant to modify buildings,
      parking areas, landscaping, signs, and other facilities and improvements to meet
      Zoning Ordinance and General Plan intent and requirements.
                                                                                              Page 8.12-39

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                  The architectural committee must make a decision within 40 days following filing
                     of the application with the planning division oﬃce, except where the applicant
                     consents to an extension. Failure of the committee to render a decision within
                     this period shall be deemed to be a decision of denial.
                  The granting of any architectural approval is an administrative function;
                     therefore, the action is final and conclusive, except in the event of an appeal.
                  In the event the applicant or others aﬀected are not satisfied with the decision of
                     the architectural committee, he may within seven days after the decision appeal
                     in writing to the Planning Commission. The architectural committee may refer
                     any application for architectural consideration to the Planning Commission for
                     its decision with the same eﬀect as if an appeal had been taken.
                  Any architectural review approval granted shall be automatically revoked and
                     terminated if not used within two years of original grant or within the period of
                     any architectural committee-authorized extensions.
             Architectural review is typically required for most residential projects, including multi-
             family developments, as well as single-family attached developments and taller than
             one story. This process does not provide any additional burden for aﬀordable housing
             projects and therefore are not considered a constraint to development.
             Local Processing and Permit Procedures
             Development review can aﬀect housing costs. Timelines for permit processing are
             estimated for various permit and approval types in Table 8.12-5-4 and 8.12-5-5 below.
             There are no constraints to aﬀordable housing or multi-family housing over and above
             requirements for single-family and market rate units. Moreover, permit processing
             in Santa Clara is consistent with, if not faster and more eﬀective than, permitting in
             comparable nearby cities. During stakeholder interviews, several housing developers
             commented that the City’s development process was one of the most coherent and
             timely compared with other cities in the area. One stakeholder explained that permits
             for an aﬀordable housing project were obtained in six months, remarking that this
             would have taken years in other nearby jurisdictions. Processing, from initial submittal
             through discretionary review and building permit approval, averages six months for
             most residential developments.
             The following review and hearing bodies would typically be involved in the approval
             process for a new housing or mixed use development project:
             Project Clearance Committee (PCC): the development review committee made up of
             representatives from diﬀerent departments in the City (typically including Planning,
             Public Works (Engineering and Traﬃc), Utilities (Water, Sewer, and Electric), Police,
             Fire, and the Building Division;
             Architectural Committee (AC): a three person committee made up of two Planning
             Commissioners and a Councilmember, who assesses the project against the City’s
             Design Guidelines, if applicable, and considers neighborhood compatibility. The City’s

Design Guidelines apply to certain neighborhoods and areas of town, such as The Old
Quad and El Camino Real.
Historical Landmarks Commission (HLC): an appointed commission of members of
the public who review proposals related to structures on the local, State, or national
register of historic places, as well as applications for Mills Act contracts.
Planning Commission (PC): an appointed commission of members of the public who
review development applications for consistency with the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Santa Clara.
City Council (CC): a body of seven elected individuals who act as the governing body
for the City of Santa Clara.
A typical residential development project would be required to obtain approval from the
Planning Commission for site planning, the Architectural Committee for design, and the
City Council for final approval. Such a project would typically be subdivided, requiring
a Tentative Map, as well. To obtain these entitlements, this project would go through
the processes of review by the project planner; the Project Coordinating Committee
to work out details and conditions from each City department; Architectural Review
with the Architectural Committee; the Planning Commission, and the City Council for
final approval. The associated environmental review per the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) would also be completed during this process. The time it takes to
complete this process varies per project, however, from initial submittal to approval
typically takes anywhere from four to six months.
Because application and building fees are relatively reasonable according to local
housing developers, fees are not considered a significant constraint to the construction
of market-rate or aﬀordable housing.
Fees and Other Exactions
The City and other agencies assess a number of fees that aﬀect                            Per Unit Fees

         GENERAL PLAN
             Airport Noise and Land Use Limitations
             The most significant governmental constraint is the State-required airport noise and
             Airport Land Use Commission regulations that prohibit and limit new housing near the
             San José International Airport within noise and safety zones. Proposed housing in these
             areas is potentially required to have noise limiting construction methods including
             specially designed windows, walls and insulation. These additional construction
             requirements often burden the developer and limit new construction near the airport.
             8.12-5.2       Non-Governmental Constraints
             Shortage of Vacant Land
             In 2008, one percent (136 acres) of the land in the City was vacant. About five acres are
             zoned appropriately for housing; the remaining acres are commercial and State-owned
             properties. Many of the vacant sites are small or awkward in shape or location.
             Parcel Size and Multiple Ownership
             Of those sites identified as appropriate for new housing, some are too small to
             accommodate higher density development unless combined with adjacent parcels.
             Since most of these sites are held by unrelated property owners combining properties
             is problematic. This, in combination with the proximity of single-family neighborhoods
             in many cases, could lengthen the time required for approval of new housing. The
             City revised its General Plan designations in 1992 to encourage high-quality infill
             redevelopment that includes higher-density housing in addition to commercial
             businesses in some locations.
             Community resistance
             Since 1985, there has been community opposition to residential infill development at
             higher densities. The primary concern is that most underutilized and vacant sites are
             located along major transportation corridors and directly adjacent to long-established
             single-family neighborhoods. These factors, along with the relatively shallow depth of
             the properties, makes the transition between densities challenging. Several substantial
             medium- and high-density developments have, however, been approved in spite of
             such opposition. Over the past 20 years, aﬀordability for lower and moderate income
             households has not been the primary concern for community opposition to residential
             development. Community resistance has, instead, been based on density as well as
             traﬃc impacts and parking.
             Approximately 175 acres of underutilized land has been identified for potential new
             higher-density residential or mixed-use redevelopment, predominantly along El
             Camino Real. Directing higher density housing to commercial areas, with convenient
             access to transportation and retail services, and separation from lower-density existing
             neighborhoods may reduce community opposition. City regulations that require
             appropriate transitions between uses and densities, as well as ensure adequate parking,
             could reduce some constraints for the approval of new housing.

Environment and Natural Resources
Because new development in the City will be infill, infrastructure is already in place to
serve new development or planning eﬀorts are underway to support future growth.
Water Supply
The City of Santa Clara receives its potable water supply from the City of San Francisco’s
Hetch-Hetchy aqueduct system, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), and
groundwater from City-owned wells. The City of Santa Clara’s Urban Water Management
Plan indicates that the City of Santa Clara will be able to meet projected growth through
2015 and probably through 2025. Supplies are projected to be suﬃcient during all but
severe drought years, when supplies could be reduced by up to approximately 40
percent in the worst-case scenario.
The City’s 2008-2009 Capital Improvements Program (CIP) allocated $1.0 million
toward ongoing maintenance and improvements to the water utility system. Projects
include construction of water treatment systems, replacement of obsolete pumps, and
installation or mains, hydrants, and services in new developments.
Wastewater
Wastewater is collected by sewer systems in the cities of Santa Clara and San José and
conveyed by pipeline to the San José-Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP).
The WPCP is also used by six other cities as well as unincorporated areas within Santa
Clara County, serving a total of 1.4 million residents and 600,000 workers. The plant has
the capacity to treat up to 167 million gallons per day (mgd), but only presently operates
at an average dry weather flow of 109 mgd, well under its treatment capacity. Therefore,
the WPCP is expected to be able to meet new residential development proposed by this
Housing Element through the planning period.
In 2008, the WPCP began an expected three-year process to update its Master Plan to
improve aging infrastructure, increase energy eﬃciency, accommodate population and
job growth, and address stricter State and federal water quality regulations Moreover,
the Master Plan Technical Advisory Group predicts that the liquid flow to the WPCP
might actually decrease in the future, due to water conservation eﬀorts (resulting in
lower flows, but higher concentrations of pollutants and biosolids).2
The City committed $14 million in bonded funding in 2008-2009 (with the remaining to
be committed in 2009-2010), according to the 2008-2009 CIP. Funding will be used toward
maintenance and upgrades to ensure that sanitary sewer utility has the conveyance
capacity to meet future development plans.
Energy
The City of Santa Clara owns and operates the municipal electric utility. Silicon Valley
Power (SVP) services over 50,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal

             customers in the City of Santa Clara. It owns, operates and participates in more than
             510 megawatts of electric generating resources supplemented by purchase agreements
             for 261 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity. Residential electricity demand is low
             compared with the energy needs of data centers and other high-tech firms that are
             located in Santa Clara.
             SVP forecasts power demand using three primary factors: historical patterns, new
             substantial requests for power, and econometrics that focus on financial health of SVP’s
             largest-served industries. SVP expects continued moderate (1-3%) load growth for the
             next ten years, with periods of rapid growth as new large projects are completed—
             primarily large oﬃce projects and data centers. Moreover, SVP oﬀers a range of energy
             eﬃciency programs, including rebates for installing energy-eﬃcient systems in homes
             and businesses. As a result of these factors and based on SVP’s ability to negotiate
             contracts with energy suppliers, SVP expects to be able to meet new residential demand
             accommodated in the Housing Element.3
             The City’s 2008-2009 CIP allocated $6.6 million towards several projects, including
             modifications to the distribution system for new customers and load increases to existing
             customers.
             Street System
             Vehicular circulation in the City includes a wide network of surface streets. With the
             influx of workers into the job-rich City during the day, commute patterns are northbound
             in the morning and southbound in the evening. Existing and perceived future traﬃc
             delays are a major concern expressed by residents during community outreach
             activities. Since most of the City streets are fully improved with limited opportunity for
             widening, alternative travel modes, such as public transit, bicycling, and walking, oﬀer
             opportunities to address traﬃc constraints. The 2008-2009 CIP included $1.7 million
             from gas tax funds for ongoing street maintenance, traﬃc signal modification to improve
             flows and safety.
             High Housing Costs
             Market constraints substantially influence the cost of housing and pose a challenge to
             providing housing aﬀordable for all income levels. Land prices are typically the most
             significant component of the cost. The cost of land has increased rapidly over the past
             decade. Construction costs and fluctuating interest rates are also major contributors to
             the increasing cost of housing in the San Francisco Bay Area.
             Land Costs
             Due in large part to limited land availability in the City, there have been very few sales of
             residential land. Based on data provided by CoStar (a commercial real estate information
             company), since January 2006 there have only been four sales of residential land in the
             City of Santa Clara. Those sales ranged from about $50 per square foot of land area to
             over $100 per square foot of land area depending on the size of the parcel, the location,

and other factors. While it is possible that residential land values may decline somewhat
in the near term due to the downturn in the housing market, it is likely that land values
in the City will remain high and will continue to present challenges for the production
of aﬀordable housing.
Construction Costs
According to local developers in and around the City, over the last several years
construction costs have been increasing rapidly, driven in part by global demand for
construction materials. Costs have moderated recently, however, in conjunction with
the downturn in the housing market as well as a general slowdown in the overall
economy. Construction costs are currently in the $90 per square foot range for single-
family detached homes and $110 per square foot for townhouses. Typical site work
costs (grading, utilities, and other “in-tract” infrastructure) are about $50,000 per unit
for single-family detached homes and $30,000 per unit for townhouses.
For multi-family apartment buildings, the type of parking is a key variable in the overall
cost of construction. For lower density buildings (2-4 story wood-frame buildings), in
which surface parking is provided, construction costs are in the $175 per square foot
range. For projects that include structured parking, the garage construction costs add
about $20,000 per parking stall to the $175 per square foot for the units. Site-specific
constraints, such as flood hazards, could add additional costs if mitigations are
required.
Availability of Financing
Given strong housing demand in Santa Clara, residential developers have historically
not encountered diﬃculty in obtaining financing for projects in the City. Still, financing
costs do aﬀect rental and sales prices and currently contribute about 10 percent to total
development costs for multi-family rental housing.
As of 2008, interest rates for 30-year fixed rate home mortgages are fluctuating in the
general range of six to eight percent, depending on the size of the loan. In general, credit-
worthy buyers in Santa Clara have not historically had diﬃculty obtaining mortgage
loans. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for 2007 as reported by the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council indicate that the rates of approval for home purchase
loans and refinance loans for residents of the City of Santa Clara are higher than for
residents of Santa Clara County as a whole.
It can be diﬃcult for very-low, low, and moderate income first-time homebuyers
to acquire suﬃcient savings and income to pay for a down payment, closing costs,
monthly mortgage, and tax and insurance payments. There are local housing programs
available to low and moderate income first-time homebuyers to address this problem.
These programs, more fully described in Chapter 8.12-4, Section 8.12-4.1, reduce the
constraints associated with the availability of financing for lower income households.
                                                                                              Page 8.12-47

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
             Financing for mixed-use development is a constraint for redevelopment along El
             Camino Real. Many lenders are not convinced that the mixed use residential market is
             durable and, therefore, place higher financial burdens on developers of such projects.
             Local developers have expressed some resistance to mixed-use development due to
             such financing problems. In a diﬃcult economic market or in periods of low demand,
             such burdens eﬀectively make the construction of mixed use projects more diﬃcult.
             8.12-5.3        Removing Constraints
             The City periodically evaluates and takes actions to remove or mitigate constraints
             to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing. As part of a Zoning
             Code Update currently underway, the City will take a comprehensive look at further
             eliminating constraints identified in this chapter in order to reduce barriers to housing
             development, including the following implementation actions (more completely
             described in Section 8.12-7.2.)
                  Consider parking requirements that balance parking demand and reduce the
                     land area, and associated expense, devoted to parking supply.
                  Allow emergency shelters in at least one zoning district by right and encourage
                     their provision in existing multi-family residential districts close to transit and
                     services.
                  Relieve constraints on higher density housing development through zoning
                     classifications that preserve existing neighborhoods and create appropriate
                     transitions to these developments.
                  Promote a lot consolidation program to assist property owners in developing
                     multi-family housing.
                  Continue to work with neighborhood residents, businesses, and institutions to
                     ensure compatible development that addresses design, density, and parking
                     concerns.
                  Improve education and outreach eﬀorts to foster a better understanding of
                     housing issues, particularly related to the needs of families and the perceptions
                     of residential densities.

8.12-6.1            Summary
Identification of land suitable for housing development is necessary to determine the
City’s ability to accommodate the housing need as defined by the RHNA for a range
of income groups and to establish a program for rezoning, if necessary, to meet these
needs. The City already has development projects in the pipeline that will accommodate
much of the RHNA. To supplement these sites, other sites with redevelopment
potential have been identified. Potential housing sites documented in this chapter are
summarized in Table 8.12-6-1 and in the map on Figure 8.12-6-1. As shown on Table
8.12-6-1, development projects, underutilized and vacant sites could accommodate
up to 10,138 housing units, including 3,243 BMR units. As a result, the City has the
potential to exceed the RHNA at each income level. The methodology for determining
appropriate sites and their dwelling yield is described in the following sections. Note
that these values were updated between the first and second round of HCD review due
to City Council action (e.g., project approvals) and additional analysis of potential sites’
existing uses and realistic capacity.

                 Affordability Assumptions
                 Table 8.12-6-2 describes the status of proposed projects that are referenced in Table 8.12-
                 6-3, including documentation of potential aﬀordability. (See Table 8.12-B-23 for details
                 on how aﬀordability is assured for completed, under construction, and approved units
                 identified in Table 8.12-6-3.)
                 Between 2009 and 2014, the Redevelopment Agency anticipates $70.2 million in its
                 Aﬀordable Housing Fund. Nearly $30.8 million is allocated for construction and
                 rehabilitation of housing for very-low income households and $16.0 for low-income
                 households, which may be used for development of housing for seniors, families, and
                 other groups with special needs. The current Agency Implementation Plan estimates

that these funds will help create 516 units including 416 units for very-low income
households.
Summary
The status and housing unit count of development projects and plans are reported in
Table 8.12-6-3. Between January 2007 and December 2009, 1,181 housing units were
constructed in the City. An additional 155 are under construction and another 1,551
units have been approved. Proposed projects and focus area plans would result in
another 2,553 housing units in the City. The focus areas include 1,663 units as part of
the Santa Clara Station Focus Area, and 400 units in the Downtown Focus Area, both of
which were adopted in the General Plan. All proposed sites will fall under one of the
new mixed-use zoning classifications so that they can construct housing. In total, the
Development Projects account for 5,440 units, including 1,540 BMR units. These projects
already exceed the RHNA for market-rate units. To meet the RHNA for aﬀordable units,
the City needs to identify sites that would accommodate an additional 1,670 units at
BMR levels.
Status of Proposed Projects:
3610 and 3700 El Camino Real: This project is still on file with the Planning Division, with
regular meetings occurring between City staﬀ and the project applicant. Additionally,
other interested persons have contacted the Planning Division about the potential
development of this property.
Santa Clara Station Focus Area: The cities of San Jose and Santa Clara, and the Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) have cooperated in the development of
a plan for 432 acres of land surrounding the Santa Clara Transit Center and future Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART) Station. Approximately 244 acres of the area is located in
Santa Clara. With direct rail service to virtually all parts of the San Francisco Bay Area
and beyond, the expanded Santa Clara Transit Center is an important intermodal transit
hub for the region. The Santa Clara Station Focus Area provides opportunities for the
development of housing, oﬃces, retail, hotels, restaurants, parks and other amenities.
Downtown: Revitalization of Santa Clara’s historic Downtown is a priority for the City.
In 2007, the City initiated a Downtown Plan for the City-owned 7.3 acres bounded by
Homestead Road and Lafayette, Jackson and Benton Streets. This plan was the subject of
a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit developer interest. The RFP suggested an urban,
mixed-use center, including over 129,000 square feet of retail commercial space with 396
residential units for the site. This project is currently on hold pending improvement in
overall economic and real estate conditions.

8.12-6.3             Vacant and Underutilized Sites
Vacant and underutilized sites either already zoned for residential development or
requiring rezoning in order to develop housing are analyzed in this section. Only three
vacant sites are large enough or otherwise appropriate for residential development. As
shown in Table 8.12-6-3, these sites total five acres and have a development capacity of
67 housing units. As shown in Table 8.12-6-5 (at the end of this section), underutilized
sites appropriate for residential redevelopment total 175 acres and have a potential
development capacity of 4,591 housing units with 1,694 BMR units. Only four of these
acres are currently zoned for residential development, with a potential for 87 housing
units. (Note that these tables are located at the end of this chapter.)
Methodology
The inventory of sites only includes parcels that are vacant or underutilized—meaning
that they are poised for redevelopment.
Underutilized Criteria
Underutilized sites are defined as parcels with a land value that is greater than the
assessed building value; with a floor area ratio of less than 0.35 (typically sites with
large surface parking lots); where residential uses are allowed through zoning or
General Plan designations; or parcels that have been identified as opportunity sites by
City staﬀ (which have been deemed good candidates for redevelopment).
Small Sites
Due to the ineﬃciency of redevelopment, sites smaller than a half-acre have not
been included, unless they are located adjacent to another underutilized site and/or
share common ownership and could reasonably be consolidated. The City does have
experience in developing high-density residential projects on small lots. Table 8.12-6-6
describes three examples, constructed between 2004 and 2008, of developments with

Appendix Twelve: HOUSING ELEMENT

densities at above 20 units per acre, built on lots less than one acre in size.
Density Criteria and Density Bonus
Dwelling unit yields have been assumed at 80 percent of maximum density allowed under
the current General Plan. Government Code Section 65583.2 indicates that a jurisdiction of
Santa Clara’s size and location should assume that sites with an allowable density of at least
30 dwelling units per acre (du/ac) are appropriate for BMR units. The City’s experience with
building aﬀordable housing supports this assumption. Note that the flexibility built into this
methodology permits a variety of allowable densities and opportunities to build aﬀordable
housing. As a result, if a site is constructed at a lower density than what has been identified as
the number of “potential units” on Table Table 8.12-6-5 and 8.12-6-6, other sites can take on the
higher densities and additional units. Implementation Action B-3.1 calls for a periodic inventory
of housing sites to ensure that suﬃcient land exists to meet the needs of a range of household
types and income levels.
Due to the City’s inclusionary housing policy and the diversity of housing construction in recent
years, aﬀordable housing at a range of density levels has been produced in the City of Santa
Clara. Table 8.12-6-7 shows a breakdown of the total number of units and the number of BMR
units built within diﬀerent density ranges over the previous housing element planning period.
Of the 864 units constructed at over 45 or more du/ac, 624 units (or 72 percent) were aﬀordable.
The largest share (76 percent) of aﬀordable units was produced in the 35 to 44 du/ac per acre
range. Notably, many of the aﬀordable units were included in lower density projects, with a
total of 262 BMR units constructed at densities below 24 du/ac.

Chart 8.12-6-1 illustrates the breakdown of aﬀordability by density range. Very-low income
units were produced in various density ranges, with most constructed at 45+ and 5-14 du/acre.
Moderate income units were developed predominantly in the 45+ and 35-44 du/acre density
ranges. This suggests that while most BMR units should be targeted at higher density sites (35
du/ac and above), there are also opportunities for BMR construction on sites with low- and
medium-density designations. For the purposes of the underutilized sites analysis, where
site density assumptions are greater than 35 du/ac, 60 percent of housing units on the site are

             During the last Housing Element planning period, only one developer took advantage
             of the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance, producing 32 additional units. The City intends
             to update the Ordinance to increase its promotion of the program during the 2007-2014
             planning period to expand housing opportunities in appropriate places, particularly
             near transit and services.
             Feasibility of Redevelopment
             Market Conditions
             Many of the sites identified as underutilized and appropriate for residential and mixed-
             use development under the current General Plan are located along El Camino Real and
             are occupied by older commercial uses, typically developed with low-intensity buildings
             surrounded by surface parking. The viability of redeveloping underutilized sites to
             include housing will depend on market conditions. In 2006, the real estate market in
             Santa Clara County was recovering from the dot-com collapse, led by the phenomenal
             strength of the residential and retail markets and followed by the oﬃce/research and
             development and hotel markets. The more recent problems associated with the housing
             and credit markets, however, have stalled this recovery. As it is extremely diﬃcult to
             anticipate the duration and full impact of the current recession, this analysis assumes
             that, in time, the economy and markets will recover, consistent with the past cyclical
             nature of the real estate market.
             Realistic Development Capacity
             Many of the identified sites are commercial uses along El Camino Real that are
             designated for mixed use in the City’s General Plan. These sites are typically low-

intensity, one-story buildings, surrounded by large surface parking lots. These sites are
envisioned to redevelop as mixed use developments with a variety of residential and
non-residential uses, including retail development and public open space. Although the
City’s current General Plan does not prescribe minimum or maximum use types within
these mixed use categories, Implementation Action B-2.1 described in Chapter 8.12-7 of
this Housing Element seeks to establish minimum density requirements for zones that
permit residential development to match General Plan designations and to ensure that
sites are developed at appropriate density levels.
Recent mixed use development projects demonstrate how these sites could develop.
Projects at 3951 Stevens Creek Boulevard and 3450 El Camino Real were developed
at 82 percent commercial and 88 percent residential. These examples have zoning
designations for Planned Development, which allows flexibility in both development
standards and land use mix not permitted in other zones. The sites are designated
for mixed use development, either “Mixed Use” or “Transit-Oriented Mixed Use.”
These General Plan designations do not regulate minimum or maximum residential
densities or proportions of non-residential and residential development. However, such
stipulations are included in the programs section of Chapter 8.12-7.
Rezoning Program
Although all vacant and underutilized sites are primed and appropriate for residential
redevelopment, rezoning will be required for most of these sites. Currently, sites are
predominately zoned as Community Thoroughfare (CT) and Community Commercial
(CC). Through text amendments these categories will be expanded to allow for
residential uses by right. An update of the City’s Zoning Ordinance is already underway
and expected to be completed within one year of Housing Element adoption.
Recent Development Trends
The City has extensive experience in infill development. Due to land constraints, much
of the recent development in Santa Clara has been redevelopment of existing developed
sites for multi-family housing. In some instances, lots with one unit have been replaced
with three or four units. For example, at 1000 El Camino Real, Gateway Santa Clara,
a senior housing development, was constructed on a former commercial site. At 3601
Flora Vista, oﬀ of El Camino Real, a 228 unit complex replaced a mobile home park.
In the northern portion of the City, the Rivermark development, a 152-acre mixed-use
development with over 3,000 housing units, is nearing completion on the former State-
owned Agnews Developmental Center.
Mixed Use sites along El Camino Real are an opportunity for new housing. Market
conditions, specifically along El Camino Real, have caused sites to have high vacancies,
making them suitable for redevelopment. For example, the former tenant space of
Mervyn’s, Albertson’s and smaller retail establishments at 2010 El Camino Real have
been vacant for over one year. Also, other structures on large sites along this major
arterial were development over 40 years ago and likely to be replaced, in part or in
whole. Redevelopment interest for the former Mervyn’s site, as well as a large site at
                                                                                          Page 8.12-57

         GENERAL PLAN
             Lawrence Expressway and El Camino Real, has been recently expressed to the Planning
             and Inspection Department.
             Many small sites are also available for redevelopment, and have shown potential for
             residential or mixed use development. Table 8.12-6-6 identifies the housing opportunity
             sites, identifying smaller sites (under one half acre) that have the potential to be
             consolidated with adjacent sites. Also, the establishment of a lot consolidation program
             through Implementation Action C.3-6 will encourage development of the small parcels
             for housing.
             Availability of Public Facilities & Services
             With the exception of the three vacant properties, all of the potential housing sites are
             infill already served by utilities. On-site infrastructure upgrades may be required in some
             locations, but, overall, demand for services can be met under current capacity levels.
             The analysis of non-governmental constraints in Section 8.12-5.2 further describes the
             City’s infrastructure capacity, namely for water, wastewater and electricity. The analysis
             concluded that existing supplies, coupled with ongoing improvements to increase
             supply, predict that demand from new residential growth described in this Housing
             Element can be accommodated.
             Flooding Hazards
             There may be an increased flood risk if residential development proceeds on the housing
             sites identified in this chapter. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
             provides information regarding the extent of flooding, based on predicted flood flows
             and land elevations. In addition, the Pacific Institute estimates areas vulnerable to sea
             level rise in the next 100 years. Portions of the City, particularly adjacent to creeks and
             rivers, lie within the potential flood zone. These zones are shown in Figure 8.12-6-2.
             In particular, the underutilized sites near the intersections of El Camino Real and San
             Tomas Expressway, and El Camino Real and Lawrence Expressway, lie within this zone.
             Since most new housing development in Santa Clara will result from infill development,
             the total amount of impervious surface is not expected to increase substantially, if at
             all. Still, as a mitigation, stormwater management and flood policies are addressed in
             the Safety Element of the General Plan and will be revisited in the 2035 General Plan
             Update. New policies may include landscape and architectural design guidelines in
             flood prone areas to reduce flood risk and potential damage.

8.12-6.4       Opportunities for Energy and Resource Conservation
In addition to its strategic location near jobs, transit and services, the City of Santa Clara
owns and operates its own electric utility, water and sewer utility, and jointly owns the
sewage treatment plant with the City of San José. The City, therefore, has greater control over
production and consumption than most other jurisdictions in the State. This control provides
an opportunity to implement programs and policies that encourage energy and resource
conservation.
Land Use and Transportation
Santa Clara, given its built-out nature, is in many ways already practicing resource conservation
through eﬀective use of limited resources. New housing has already been approved near key
corridors and walkable centers. As future development is planned in the City, there are new
opportunities to locate housing and jobs in proximity to transit and to expand transit services
along designated corridors, resulting in the potential for fewer vehicle trips. For example, the
Santa Clara Station Area Plan, comprised of about 250 acres around the Santa Clara Transit
Center, could generate over 1,600 new housing units within a half-mile walking distance of
the transit center.
Energy
The City supports several regional eﬀorts with sustainable goals for conservation of energy
resources and greenhouse gas reductions. In January 2008, the City signed the U.S. Mayors
Climate Protection Agreement with a target of meeting or exceeding the Kyoto Protocol
for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 (a 29
percent cut). Additionally, Santa Clara is a member of Sustainable Silicon Valley, a coalition
of businesses, governments, and non-government organizations working to reduce regional
carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.
The City is well-established in sustainable eﬀorts through its utilities and public services,
including the eﬀorts of the City’s municipal electric utility, SVP. Today, SVP and the City are
focused on expanding the utility’s sustainable resources. One of the City’s 2007-2009 Principles
and Priorities aﬃrms a commitment to reduction of greenhouse gases and development of
sustainable renewable energy green power resources. In 2007, about 30 percent of the power
mix for SVP was from renewable geothermal, small hydroelectric, solar and wind sources (57
percent if large hydroelectric sources are included). From these sources, SVP oﬀers a Green
Power option to all residents and businesses in the City comprised of 100 percent clean wind
and solar power resources located in California. Several of these resources are solar facilities
within the City itself.
SVP also operates a Neighborhood Solar Program, matching resident and business
contributions to the fund for non-profit solar facilities in the City. Additionally, SVP provides
rebates for local businesses and residents for installation of solar electric systems. Rebates
are also oﬀered by the City for a variety of energy-eﬃcient appliances, insulation, lighting,
cooling and process eﬃciency changes.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
        Water and Wastewater
        Santa Clara is also involved with water resource conservation and recycling, through co-
        ownership of the San José/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), which treats
        wastewater from sinks, tubs, toilets, and industrial processes. The WPCP is on track to be
        energy self-suﬃcient in five years and carbon neutral in 20 years. An update to the WPCP
        Master Plan is also looking at revenue strategies that could oﬀset projected sewer rate
        increases, address rising sea levels and flood control, and increase recycled water usage.
        Medium- or large- housing developments with landscaping needs are eligible for recycled
        water. Due to high infrastructure costs, single-family homes are not eligible.
        Waste Reduction
        Recycling eﬀorts in the City include a curbside recycling program which collects recyclable
        materials and yard clippings. These eﬀorts divert over 50 percent of the City’s waste from the
        landfill.
        Green Building
        In 2008, the City adopted Green Building Policies that recognize the Leadership in Energy
        and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) rating system and the GreenPoint residential rating
        system of Build It Green. These policies require the submittal of a completed LEEDTM or Green
        Point checklist as part of a planning application. At this time, applicants are not required to
        implement green building practices. New public construction and renovation projects over
        5,000 square feet, however, are required to achieve a LEEDTM Silver Certification level or
        better and to recycle at least 50 percent of materials.
        8.12-7        QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES, GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
        The goals, policies, and actions delineated in this chapter serve to support the State of
        California’s overarching aim of providing, “decent housing and a suitable living environment
        for every Californian” (Government Code Section 65580).
        8.12-7.1        Quantified Objectives
        As required by Section 65583 of the California Government Code, the goals, policies, and
        actions in this chapter seek to meet quantified housing objectives. Table 8.12-7-1 summarizes
        these findings, which result in a total estimated capacity of 10,138 housing units. All of these
        units will be produced through new construction. Although the City expects to rehabilitate
        homes—through the Neighborhood Conservation Improvement Program and other funding
        sources—these upgrades may not meet the definition of “substantial rehabilitation” as
        required under Section 65583.

   Note: The “extremely-low income” category is not included in the RHNA. However, cities are charged with address-
   ing the housing needs of this population in the housing element. Although ELI need was not calculated by ABAG,
   HCD allows the City to assume that approximately half of the very-low income households qualify as ELI. This is
   consistent with the CHAS data and the analysis completed in Chapter 3 (see Table 3-16).

   New moderate income units produced as a result of condo conversions are included under the subtotal for New
   Construction.
Second units or accessory units are permitted by right on single family lots of 7,000 square
feet or greater. Approximately 64 new such units are anticipated in the new planning
period. However, given this low number and the low precedent (only 40 accessory units
were constructed in the last planning period), these are not identified as contributing
toward meeting the City’s RHNA. The Zoning Ordinance Update expects to increase
the opportunity for second units by reducing the minimum lot size requirement to 6,000
square feet, in the R1 district.
8.12-7.2            Goals, Policies, and Implementation Actions
The Housing Element identifies the City’s goals for neighborhood conservation, housing
sites and production, housing support, and housing opportunities. The goals are
supported by policies which are implemented through the provision of funding, review
for new housing developments and allocation of low income units. These policies are
put into action by the individual Implementation Actions. The format and labeling of
the Goals, Policies and Implementation Actions is consistent with other elements in the
General Plan. Each Goal is supported by one or more Policies, and some Policies are
implemented by multiple Implementation Actions.
                                                                                                                     Page 8.12-73

             Neighborhood Conservation
             Neighborhood Conservation focuses on the preservation and maintenance of the
             physical housing units in a neighborhood. Maintaining quality development is an
             important goal of the City, regarding new and aging homes.
              GOAL A: Create and maintain high-quality, livable, and unique residential neighborhoods and preserve
              established single-family neighborhoods.
              Policy A-1: Maintain and improve the quality of residential neighborhoods, eliminate housing deficiencies

    •     Work with Potential Purchasers: The City will establish
          contact with public and non-profit agencies inter-
          ested in purchasing and/or managing units at risk. As
          necessary and feasible, the City will provide financial
          and technical assistance to these organizations.

Housing Sites and Production
Housing sites and production identifies the potential physical location for new housing
development. Density, unit types, aﬀordability, and compatibility of new development with
existing neighborhoods are major factors when reviewing new housing proposals. The City
strives to provide enough housing units to meet the needs of the population, while balancing
new housing development with preservation of established neighborhoods.

             HOUSING ELEMENT APPENDIX 8.12-A
             ACCOMPLISHMENTS SINCE 2002 HOUSING ELEMENT
             The California Department of Housing and Community Development requires that each
             housing element review the eﬀectiveness of the previous housing element (specifically,
             its goals, objectives, policies and programs); describe progress in implementation; and
             analyze the appropriateness of these measures (i.e. whether and how these policies/
             programs should continue). The following series of tables list the policies and programs
             identified in the City of Santa Clara’s 2002 Housing Element, describes the implementation
             process, reviews its eﬀectiveness, and provides a recommendation whether the policy
             or program should continue.
             Neighborhood Conservation
                  Policy A:         Maintain and improve the quality of residential neighborhoods,
                     eliminate housing deficiencies and prevent future blight through: encouragement
                     of ongoing maintenance and conservation of existing housing stock; review of
                     proposed new construction, reconstruction, removal or rehabilitation; and code
                     enforcement of strengthened City Code and Zoning Ordinance regulations.
                  Policy B:        Additions or new construction in single family neighborhoods
                     shall be consistent with City Design Guidelines.
                  Policy C:        Promote compatibility between neighboring developments.
                  Policy D:        Disperse aﬀordable housing units throughout the City to avoid a
                     concentration in any one neighborhood.

 Implementation Action 1: Maintain and Expand Inspection and Code Enforcement
 Maintain and expand where appropriate a strong housing inspection and code enforcement program
 to ensure adequate maintenance of the housing stock and quality of the residential neighborhoods.
 Continue the multi-family residential housing inspection and educational programs. City inspection
 staff will aggressively respond to violations of housing codes. Special attention shall be given to main-
 taining the stability of residential neighborhoods through development and enforcement of minimum
 standards of allowed use of the City’s streets, as well as maintenance of front and other yard areas vis-
 ible from the public right-of-way.

         GENERAL PLAN
              Implementation Action 2: Low-Income Owner Occupied Rehabilitation Grants & Loans
              Rehabilitate low income owner occupied housing through the City’s Neighborhood Conservation
              Improvement Program (NCIP). Under the NCIP, low income homeowners are provided grants and loans
              for needed home repairs. The program is available on a citywide basis and is marketed periodically to
              areas with concentrations of lower income households and homes needing improvements. Applicants
              are first screened for income qualifications. A City Housing Inspector then evaluates the home for sub-
              standard conditions.
              Low cost projects such as a new furnace or stair repairs are often paid for through grants of up to
              $5000. Larger projects are estimated and presented to the City’s Loan Committee made up of a Council
              member and appointed citizens. The Committee approves the applicant, work totals and loan terms.
              The current maximum loan amount is $75,000 with interest at 6% for the upper low income range and
              3% deferred for incomes below 50% of the median. The City prepares the bid package and solicits bids
              with the homeowner’s participation. A City Housing Inspector monitors the contractor’s work and dis-
              burses funds.

 Implementation Action 3: Multi-Family Housing Acquisition & Rehabilitation
 Work with non-profit entities to acquire and rehabilitate existing multi-family structures to be main-
 tained as affordable rental housing. With the elimination of the Federal Rental Rehabilitation Program,
 the focus has shifted to the use of the Redevelopment Housing Fund in conjunction with the County
 Housing Authority and other non-profit housing developers. Existing apartments with substandard
 conditions are targeted especially when their renovation would enhance their neighborhood. The
 Agency provides loans, usually on a residual receipts basis, to non-profits to acquire and rehabilitate
 targeted complexes. Deed restrictions are placed on the property to ensure the continuing affordabil-
 ity of units and the management expertise of the non-profit keeps maintenance at an acceptable level.

         GENERAL PLAN
              Implementation Action 4: One- and Two-Story Additions
              Encourage affordable, compatible one and two story additions for upgrading single family homes. In
              a housing market like Santa Clara’s, homeowners often find that adding on is far more affordable that
              buying a larger home. Existing mortgages, property taxes and neighborhood connections all play a
              part in these decisions. Santa Clara’s zoning regulations for single family homes are liberal enough that
              virtually every home can be added onto. The major exception is when older homes with only a one car
              garage are expanded beyond three bedrooms or by another 500 square feet. This triggers a two car
              covered parking requirement. However, parking variances are usually granted when the house layout
              makes a two car garage impossible. Other restrictions such as setbacks and building coverage rarely
              present a constraint to reasonable additions. The City is developing a Historic Conservation District for
              the older, presubdivision area which would allow increased flexibility for houses built prior to the cur-
              rent zoning requirements.

      Policy E: Encourage the annual construction of the number of housing units
         necessary to meet the City's regional housing needs determination through
         housing finance and reducing constraints on the private housing market.
      Policy F: Work towards the mitigation of jobs/housing ratio impacts created by
         developments with significant employment.
      Policy G: Encourage the building of higher density housing on appropriate
         vacant or underutilized (infill) land.
      Policy H: Encourage higher density residential development in transit-oriented
         mixed use areas where appropriate.
 Implementation Action 8: Identify Housing Sites (including TOD and Mixed Use) in General Plan
 Designate in the General Plan Land Use Element sites suitable for future housing development. Review
 additional sites for possible designation as residential or mixed use, considering their location relative
 to existing residential uses, parks, and support services such as transit, and for environmental suitabil-
 ity. Encourage developments that are transit-based or in close proximity to transit when determining
 City affordable housing funding decision priorities. Create a Transit-Oriented Mixed Use designation
 in the Land Use Element. Adopt that designation as an overlay zone for the 96.6 acres so designated.
 That zone, as proposed by City staff, would include housing as a use-by-right. This is detailed in Figures
 3-N, 3-O, 3-P and 3-Q.

 Implementation Action 10: Encourage Mixed Use Development
 Encourage Mixed Use development where appropriate to provide increased opportunities for hous-
 ing development. Mixed use could include a ground floor of commercial plus one or more stories of
 residential, as well as multifamily infill in commercial districts. The inclusion of housing in any new
 developments in Mixed Use-designated areas will be encouraged. Provide an outreach/marketing
 program to notify owners of mixed use designated sites. As part of the land use redesignation of these
 sites, property owners will be made aware of the new options for redevelopment of their property. The
 major incentive is the enhanced economic return and the mutual market support of the different uses.
 The redesignation will also streamline the land use approval process. This involves 177 total acres. This
 is detailed in Figures 3-N, 3-O, 3-P and 3-Q.

              forming and there would be no requirements to redevelop. Development standards, such as minimum
              lot size, building heights, open space requirements and separation from potential nuisances would be
              included in the Overlay Zones, and would be designed to facilitate development, while ensuring com-

              Implementation Action 13: Evaluate Ordinance Permitting Accessory Units
              Accessory units are conditionally permitted on single family lots that have sufficient lot area to meet
              minimum parking, maximum building coverage, and minimum setbacks. The City will evaluate the
              current ordinance to include performance standards relating to those impacts that are considered a
              concern to neighbors. The intent is to increase the flexibility of the ordinance, particularly in areas with
              non-subdivision development, and increase the number of applications for accessory units. Conduct an
              ongoing promotional program including mailings to owners of single family properties with adequate
              size for accessory living units.

Housing Affordability
      Policy I:           Encourage construction and preservation of aﬀordable housing
          for lower and moderate income households. Encourage such housing through
          public subsidy, regulatory incentives and flexible development standards,
          depending on the nature of the use.
      Policy J:           Provide assistance to temporarily house the homeless, battered
          spouses, and others in crisis situations.
 Implementation Action 14: Fund Affordable Housing with Redevelopment Agency Funds
 Continue to use the City’s Redevelopment Agency (RDA) Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund to
 assist in creating and/or preserving affordable ownership and rental housing. RDA funding has be-
 come the largest steady source of affordable housing financing in the community. Since its inception
 in 1990, the fund has received $30 million plus another $5.8 million in interest. It has been leveraged to
 obtain a wide variety of other Federal, State, tax credits and private funding. Between 1990 and 2001, a
 total of 1,279 affordable units have been assisted or approved. Of these, 51% of these are for very low
 income households, 28% for low income and 21% for moderate income households. Emphasis will be
 placed on programs that create rental housing for the senior population, home ownership for moder-
 ate income households, especially first-time buyers, rentals for lower income households, homeless as-
 sistance and housing services and administration. First priority for housing units is given to those who
 currently live in or are employed in the City. From 2001 through 2006, it is estimated that 25 million
 dollars in set-aside funds will be available.

 Implementation Action 18: Modify Zoning Ordinance to Provide Incentives for Affordable
 Housing Projects
 Adopt land use regulations that will promote affordable housing by reducing constraints and increas-
 ing incentives. Amend the Zoning Ordinance to reduce parking requirements in appropriate locations
 for certain housing types, such as Senior, Transit-Oriented and Single Room Occupancy. Include the
 standard State “affordable housing” definition in the Zoning Ordinance and as a “permitted and encour-
 aged” use in the residential and Planned Development zones. The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance and
 the Planned Development Zone District are examples of how the City allows flexibility in the zoning
 regulations. The City will encourage housing developers to use these options.

 Implementation Action 20: Promote and Fund Transitional Housing Programs
 Assist in funding locally administered programs that provide shelter, food and clothing for those with
 transitional housing needs. The redevelopment of the Agnews property provided the vehicle for the
 construction of new homeless family housing - the Sobrato Family Living Center with thirty-three
 apartment units with a second phase of eighteen transitional units. This style of housing is far more
 satisfactory for families than the previous dormitory. The RDA is contributing $2.5 million over five
 years for capital costs and the City’s CDBG program underwrites some of the annual shelter costs. The
 City has been a strong supporter of efforts to protect runaway and homeless teenagers. The RDA has
 provided $980,000 for a twenty bed facility, $400,000 for acquisition and rehabilitation of a five unit
 project for homeless teen mothers and $375,000 for transitional housing for six to eight homeless
 teens. The CDBG program provides operating funds for the Bill Wilson Center as well. The City will eval-
 uate and work towards eliminating constraints to the provision of emergency housing, and will amend
 the Zoning Ordinance to allow homeless shelters and transitional housing in appropriate commercial
 and Planned Development zones.

 Implementation Action 22: Preserve Assisted Rental Housing at Liberty Towers
 One assisted rental project in Santa Clara - Liberty Towers - is identified to be at potential risk of conver-
 sion to market rate use between 2002 and 2012. While this 100 unit senior apartment project is under
 non-profit ownership, project affordability is in part tied to a short-term Section 8 contract subject to
 renewal by HUD in 2005. As project based Section 8 funding is likely to remain intact, this project is
 considered at low risk of conversion. Nonetheless, the City will take the following actions to ensure
 preservation of Liberty Towers:
 Continue to Assist the Property Owners: Liberty Towers is a regular applicant for CDBG and HOME fund-
 ing to make periodic improvements to the property. These have included life safety projects for sprin-
 klers and alarms, as well as roof repairs. Such assistance helps the project maintain its affordability.
 Monitor the Status of Section 8 Legislation: The project based Section 8 program is undergoing con-
 stant and substantial changes that make planning for the preservation of at-risk units a difficult task.
 City staff will monitor the legislative changes concerning the Section 8 program in order to be strategi-
 cally prepared for the potential conversion of at-risk units.
 Monitor At-Risk Units: The City will monitor the at-risk project through maintaining contact with the
 property owner regarding their long term plans for the project.
 Work with Potential Purchasers: The City will establish contact with public and non-profit agencies in-
 terested in purchasing and/or managing units at risk. As necessary and feasible, the City will provide
 financial and technical assistance to these organizations.
 Conduct Tenant Education by:
 Notifying tenants as far in advance as possible of potential conversion to market rate housing.
 Providing information regarding tenant rights and conversion procedures.
 Offering tenants information regarding Section 8 rental subsidies and other available assistance
 through City and County agencies as well as non-profit organizations.

         GENERAL PLAN
              Implementation Action 35: Provide Referral Services and Support for Discrimination Concerns
              Provide referral services and promotional support to link those experiencing discrimination in hous-
              ing with public or private groups who handle complaints against discrimination. The City funds pam-
              phlets explaining fair housing services that are available in such City facilities as City Hall, libraries,
              and the community center. The City holds an annual Open House at which the pamphlets and other
              information on fair housing are made available to the public. The non-profit agency with which the
              City contracts also holds several community information meetings each year at which the pamphlets
              are distributed. The City refers disputes between property owners to the County Human Relations
              Commission’s Dispute Officer. Through the Tri-County Apartment Owners Association, the City contrib-
              uted to a Rental Housing Handbook that provides guidance to both tenants and landlords. Continue to
              seek state and federal enforcement of fair housing laws and continue to cooperate with local agencies
              investigating claims of discrimination.

 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This Needs Assessment describes and analyzes local demographic, household, and
housing characteristics and trends in an eﬀort to determine the nature and extent of
Santa Clara’s housing needs.
8.12-B.1           Population & Household Trends
The type and amount of housing needed in a community are largely determined by
population growth and various demographic variables. Factors such as age, race/
ethnicity, occupation, and income level combine to influence the type of housing needed
and the ability to aﬀord housing.
Population
Actual and projected population estimates are reported in Table 8.12-B-1. According to
the United States Census, Santa Clara’s population grew 49 percent between 1960 and
1980. Since that time, constraints on available land for residential development have
limited new housing development and the resulting population growth. During the
next 20 year period, between 1980 and 2000, the City grew only 17 percent, from 87,700
to 102,361. More recently, the City has experienced an increase in the rate of population
growth. In the year 2006, the American Community Survey reported a population
of 112,098, an increase of ten percent just since 2000. More recently, the California
Department of Finance estimated the city’s population as of January 2008 to be 115,503
(not shown in table).
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects that the City will grow at
a moderate rate over the next seven years, resulting in a population of approximately
124,700 by 2015.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
              Santa Clara’s projected population growth is consistent with countywide expected
              growth over time. The population of Santa Clara County as a whole (1.8 million in
              2008, according to State Department of Finance), is projected to increase by 27 percent
              between 2010 and 2035, compared with the City of Santa Clara’s 24 percent projected
              growth rate during this period.
              Households
              Households are expected to grow at a similar rate as population, suggesting consistency
              in household size (about 2.6). There were roughly 41,510 households in 2005; an
              additional 6,000 households are anticipated to be added by 2015 for a total of 47,330
              households.

              Age
              The City of Santa Clara has seen increases in young and older residents in recent years.
              Children under four and adults between the ages of 45 and 64 are the age cohorts with
              increasing shares of the population. The median age in 2006 was 35 years old (not shown
              in table). At the County level, ABAG projects that seniors (65 and over) will continue to
              increase as a percent share of Santa Clara County’s population, representing 13 percent
              of residents by 2015, compared with just 10 percent in 2005 (not shown in table). This
              represents the largest percent share increase of any age cohort.
              These data suggests that as the City becomes both older and younger, there may be a
              need for additional family housing, with two or more bedrooms, as well as housing for
              seniors.

  2006 data are based on a sample of 1,413 residents. The U.S. Census Bureau advises that 2006 data
should be compared with caution to 2000 values. This is due to the fact the entire population con-
tinually ages into older age groups over time, such that the population of a certain age is made up
of a completely different group of people in 2000 and 2006.

Gender
In 2006, 53 percent of residents were male and 47 percent female. Demographic
characteristics related to female heads of household are described in Section 8.12-B.6:
Special Needs Populations.
Ethnicity
Santa Clara has become more ethnically diverse in recent years. The proportion of white
residents has decreased somewhat in recent years, accounting for 41 percent of the
population in 2006. The Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic populations have increased
to 34 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The black population also increased, but still
only accounts for a three percent share. The Other category, which includes residents self-
identifying as two or more races, accounts for four percent of the City’s population.
Race and ethnic characteristics of a population imply certain housing needs as some
demographic and economic characteristics correlate with race. For example, the average
household size for the City of Santa Clara was 2.6 in 2000 (not shown in table). However,
the average household size for Hispanics was 3.4 and for Asian or Pacific Islanders 3.0.
These numbers reflect multi-generation families and/or a higher number of children
which may require larger units with more bedrooms.

              Employment Trends
              Santa Clara County is one of the Bay Area’s major job generators. The City added about
              24,000 jobs between 1990 and 2000, from approximately 108,000 to nearly 132,000 jobs
              (a 22 percent increase), as shown in Table 8.12-B-5. Following the dot-com collapse,
              ABAG estimates show reductions in jobs across all sectors in 2005, with employment in
              the City reaching nearly 105,000. Approximately 49,000 residents of Santa Clara were
              employed in 2005. In 2000, 30 percent of employed residents worked in the City, while
              the remaining 70 percent commuted to other cities (primarily within the County).
              The Manufacturing, Wholesale and Transportation sector accounts for the largest share
              of total jobs with 43 percent. The Financial & Professional Services (which includes
              Research and Development activities) and Health, Education, & Recreational sectors are
              the next largest sectors, accounting for 19 and 18 percent of all jobs, respectively. ABAG
              estimates that the number of jobs in Santa Clara will increase to nearly 117,000 by 2015,
              the end of the Housing Element planning period. The Health, Education & Recreational
              sector is expected to see the largest increase in job growth during this period. These
              employment projections suggest a need for housing to serve a growing and diverse
              workforce.

Unemployment Rate
According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD) the
unemployment rate in Santa Clara County was 4.7 percent in 2007. By comparison, the
unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in San Mateo County and 5.4 percent statewide.
Preliminary data for 2008 from EDD suggest that this rate has risen somewhat from 2007
values. For example, the November 2008 unemployment rate was 7.1 percent compared
with 4.9 percent in November 2007. The current regional and national economic
downturn suggests that the unemployment rate may continue to rise in 2009.
8.12-B.3          Housing Characteristics
Housing Units
Housing Trends
Between 2000 and 2008, the number of housing units in Santa Clara increased from
39,521 to over 44,166 (12 percent), as shown in Table 8.12-B-7. The majority of these
units, 42 percent, are single-family detached units. However, housing developments
with five or more units have been the fastest growing housing type in recent years,
adding over 3,000 units (an increase of 24 percent) since 2000. This suggests an increase
in higher-density, smaller, more aﬀordable (though not necessarily subsidized) units.

              Tenure
              According to the US Census, approximately 54 percent of housing units in Santa Clara
              were renter-occupied in 2006, while 46 percent of units were owner-occupied. These
              proportions have not changed since 2000.
              Housing Conditions
              Age of Structures
              Most of the housing stock in Santa Clara was built before 1980: 43 percent between 1960
              and 1980 and 30 percent before 1960, as shown in Table 8.12-B-8. The median year that
              structures were built was 1968. When units are 30 years or older, they begin to require
              major improvements and repairs in order to maintain quality standards. Inspectors
              from the Building Inspection Division will continue to conduct inspections of homes
              on a request and complaint basis, providing advice and assistance where possible to
              correct problems.

              Source: American Community Survey 2006
              Vacancy Rate
              The City has generally had low vacancy rates, with just three percent of units vacant
              in 2006 and the other 97 percent of units occupied. In comparison, the County has a
              somewhat higher vacancy rate, at four percent.
              Overcrowding
              Unacceptable overcrowding is generally defined as housing units where the number of
              occupants is greater than the number of rooms. Typically, overcrowding occurs because
              the household is unable to aﬀord larger accommodations. Overcrowding is not a major
              problem in Santa Clara; still, 1,843 households (4% of all households) are living in
              overcrowded conditions, as shown in Table 8.12-B-9. This represents an improvement
              over conditions in 2000, when seven percent of units were considered overcrowded.

The Building Inspection Division conducts annual inspections of licensed residential
buildings of four units or more with regard to State Housing and Building Code
requirements. This inspection program includes an assessment of possible overcrowding,
based on State Code requirements regarding maximum allowed occupancy. Complaints
regarding possible overcrowding in other types of residential structures are also
investigated.
Substandard/In Need of Rehabilitation
Consistent with prior General Plans and the Zoning Ordinance, the City supports the
maintenance and preservation of housing and the quality of residential neighborhoods.
In 2005, the City’s Consolidated Plan 2005-2010 identified 1,569 units in need of
rehabilitation.
The City operates the Neighborhood Conservation and Improvement Program (NCIP)
to provide technical and financial assistance to qualified homeowners (those earning
less than 80% of Area-Median Income) for housing rehabilitation. In the 2004-2005 fiscal
year, the City assisted 113 low-income households through a combination of loans and
grants. Homeowners undertook home repairs, accessibility improvement, lead-based
paint testing, and other improvements. The program also provided rehabilitation of
42 HUD Section 215 subsidized housing units. Since 1976, the City of Santa Clara has
assisted more than 1,000 homeowners to rehabilitate and increase the value of their
homes through the NCIP. (A complete description of this and other funding sources is
provided in Chapter 8.12-3, Section 8.12-3.5: Financing and Subsidy Resources of the
Housing Element.)

         GENERAL PLAN
              8.12-B.4           Cost of Housing
              Income
              In 2006, the median household income in the City of Santa Clara was just over $80,000, as
              shown in Table 8.12-B-10. In absolute dollars, incomes increased by 15 percent between
              2000 and 2006. However, adjusting for inflation, household incomes actually decreased
              during this time period—not surprising given the dot-com collapse during this period.4
              The City’s income levels are on par with the County of Santa Clara as a whole.
              Despite a high median income level, households in the City reflect a range of income
              levels. Nearly 30 percent of households have incomes over $100,000, another 37 percent
              have incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, and the remaining one-third of households
              have incomes below $50,000. These findings suggest that the City needs a range of
              housing types to accommodate residents with various income levels.

              The poverty rate in 2006 was seven percent, according to the American Community
              Survey. Table 8.12-B-11 shows the number of residents whose incomes fell below the
              poverty line within a 12-month period. This small and vulnerable population may
              require housing assistance. The highest poverty rates were among young adults ages
              18 to 24—a large portion of whom are likely students who do not work or only work
              part-time.

Income Limits
HCD publishes household income limits to determine eligibility for housing programs
and subsidies. In 2008, the area median income (AMI) for a family of four in Santa Clara
County was $105,500, as shown in Table 8.12-B-12. This value represents a 21 percent
increase (unadjusted) since 2001, when AMI was $87,300. Adjusted for inflation, this
change in the median income has only risen 2.2 percent (not shown in table).

Housing stakeholders interviewed for this Housing Element agreed that, in terms
of low-income populations, the greatest need existed among extremely low-income
populations. These stakeholders felt that households above 50% of AMI can usually
find an adequate rental unit. In addition, they noted that developers cannot qualify for
tax credits for aﬀordability levels above 50 percent of AMI.
However, stakeholders also identified a need for middle income populations who,
despite holding full-time jobs, are not able to aﬀord the high rents and ownership prices
of housing in Santa Clara. Even moderate and above moderate income households
(over 120% of AMI) struggle to keep up with market-rate rents and home sale prices.
Stakeholders expressed concern that the professional class of middle-income wage
earners, central to the workforce, is leaving the City and region because of high housing
prices.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
              Rent Prices
              In terms of rental units, a market inventory of 45 rental properties in the City of Santa
              Clara by RealFacts indicates that the following were the average monthly apartment
              rents in the City of Santa Clara as of the 3rd Quarter 2008 (rounded):
                   1-bedroom/1-bathroom = $1,600
                   2-bedroom/1-bathroom = $1,700
                   2-bedroom/2-bathroom = $2,100
                   3-bedroom/2-bathroom = $2,800
              The average apartment rent for all unit types in the City of Santa Clara was about $1,800,
              which was lower than some other communities in Santa Clara County such as Palo Alto,
              Los Gatos, and Cupertino, but higher than others such as Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
              and Milpitas. The 2008 overall occupancy rate for all projects surveyed in the City of
              Santa Clara was about 96 percent. Given the above rents, very low and low income
              households (up to 50% and 80% of the area median income respectively) will find it
              challenging to aﬀord to rent the average apartment in the City of Santa Clara.
              Home Sale Prices
              According to the Santa Clara County Association of Realtors, the median price for a
              single family detached home in the City of Santa Clara as of the 2nd Quarter 2008 was
              $709,000, a decline of about 5 percent from 2007. The median price for a condominium/
              townhouse as of the 2nd Quarter 2008 was $469,000, a decline of about 2.5 percent from
              2007. In general, home prices in the City of Santa Clara have held up better to the broad
              downturn in the housing market than those in most areas in California. One outcome of
              the decline in housing prices has been an increase in ownership housing aﬀordability.
              The California Association of Realtors reports that, as of the 2nd Quarter 2008, about 33
              percent of households could aﬀord to purchase an entry-level home in Santa Clara, as
              compared to 21 percent in late 2007.
              Nonetheless, housing prices are still high in the City of Santa Clara. Assuming a 20
              percent down payment, a 30-year mortgage, and a seven percent interest rate, mortgage
              payments and property taxes on the median-priced single family detached home
              ($709,000) would be about $4,400 per month. The gross annual income required to aﬀord
              such a home (assuming no more than 30 percent of gross income is spent on housing)
              is at least $175,000. Additional homeowner costs (insurance, utilities, maintenance, etc.)
              would require an even greater income, as would any secondary debt. A four-person
              household in Santa Clara would need to earn well over the median income of $105,500
              in order to aﬀord the median-priced single family detached home with the preceding
              assumptions. Using the same assumptions, the gross annual income required to aﬀord
              the median-priced condominium/townhouse ($469,000) would be about $115,000, also
              above the median income for a household of four in Santa Clara ($105,500).

                                                                                            8.12
Overpayment
With the high cost of housing in and around the City of Santa Clara, households often
spend a large portion of their income on housing. Table 8.12-B-13 reports that 40 percent
of all renter-occupied households and 44 percent of owner-occupied households are
overpaying for housing. According to the US Census, housing overpayment refers to
spending more than 30 percent of income on housing.
Overpayment disproportionately aﬀects younger households (between 15 and 24 years
old) and older households (65 years and above). A full 100 percent of homeowners in
the youngest category were overpaying for housing. This is likely due to the fact that
they recently purchased homes at high prices and are stretching their incomes to pay
monthly costs. The next most severe overpayment demographic is renters in the oldest
category; 79 percent of older renters are paying more than 30 percent of their incomes
toward their rent. This is likely due to the fact that residents in this age group may
receive fixed income.

8.12-B.5           Assisted Housing Developments At-Risk of Conversion
The State Housing Element law and HUD Consolidated Plan regulation require cities to
prepare an inventory including all assisted multi-family rental units which are eligible
to convert to non-low-income housing uses due to termination of subsidy contract,
mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions. State Housing Element law requires
this inventory cover a ten-year evaluation period following the statutory due date of the
Housing Element (July 1, 2009); whereas the HUD regulation requires the inventory to
cover only the five-year planning period of the Consolidated Plan. To satisfy both state
and federal requirements, this at-risk housing analysis period covers this period from
July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2019. This analysis represents a review of current status
and options, rather than a specific statement of City policy.
According to a risk assessment by California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC),
no assisted development in the City is considered at high risk of conversion to market
use. Of the assisted units identified above, one project was determined to be at low risk
of conversion during the 2009-2019 period.
                                                                                           Page 8.12-135

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
                   Liberty Towers: Located at 890 Main Street, Liberty Towers is a 100-unit
                       apartment complex, with all of the units allocated for occupancy by very low-
                       income seniors. The project receives Section 8 project-based assistance. Under
                       the Section 8 contracts, the project owner provides units aﬀordable to lower-
                       income families for a specified time period. The City has a currently funded
                       rehabilitation project for Liberty Towers, scheduled to begin in 2009. This project
                       will extend the aﬀordability restriction for five years after the date of project
                       completion.
              Liberty Towers was also assisted through the HUD Section 236 and Section 202
              programs. Through these programs, the owner was provided mortgage insurance and
              interest reduction payments. Earliest termination date of Section 236 and Section 202
              loan assistance is September 20, 2013. Given its non-profit ownership, it is unlikely that
              Liberty Towers will be converted to market-rate housing.
              8.12-B.6        Special Needs Populations
              Housing is a basic necessity of life for everyone. However, the search for decent
              aﬀordable housing is greatly complicated for many individuals because of various
              barriers, including disability, advanced age, and life crisis. The City has identified several
              special populations that are in need of particular housing services and are most likely
              to be in the Extremely Low-Income category: seniors, persons with disabilities, large
              families, single-parent households, college students, and families and persons in need of
              emergency shelter. (Given Santa Clara’s urban location, farmworkers are not considered
              a population with special needs, but a short description is provided below.)
              Seniors
              Seniors are expected to be the fastest growing age cohort in the County over the
              Housing Element planning period. In 2006, the American Community Survey reported
              approximately 11,500 residents 65 years or older living in the City of Santa Clara,
              representing ten percent of the population. Countywide, ABAG projects a 47 percent
              growth rate among seniors over 65 between 2005 and 2015, suggesting that the City
              of Santa Clara could have nearly 17,000 seniors by the end of the Housing Element
              planning period.
              As shown in 8.12-B-14, 61 percent of seniors are homeowners and 39 percent are renters.
              These numbers are consistent with homeownership rates for seniors between 65 and 74
              years old. However, as seniors age, these rates tend to reverse. Of seniors 85 year old
              and greater, only 46 percent are homeowners, while 54 percent are renters. This may
              be due to the fact that as seniors age, they may choose to sell their homes because their
              homes are too large or they require additional care at a retirement or assisted living
              facility.

In 2000, there were 4,348 extremely low income households documented among all
households. Of this total, 42 percent were defined as elderly (62 years and over). Seniors
housing needs may be more intense since they are often earning a fixed income. In
2000, the Comprehensive Housing Aﬀordability Strategy (CHAS) database reported
that seniors compose a substantial share of low-income households as shown in 8.12-B-
15. In addition, CHAS reported an additional 4,098 very low-income households, with
37 percent of those composed of elderly households; and 3,782 low-income households,
with 24 percent composed of elderly populations.

Additionally, many of these seniors need special housing such as handicap accessible
living arrangements. The 2006 ACS indicated that 35 percent of the elderly population
in Santa Clara had a disability (3,797 seniors).
Historically, waiting lists for senior housing have been long, suggesting demand
exceeded supply for aﬀordable senior housing. Since the last planning period, the City
has added more aﬀordable senior housing to the housing stock. There are currently
five below-market senior housing developments in the City, containing a total of 615
studio, one- and two-bedroom units. There are another 55 beds within two assisted
living developments for seniors with mental or physical disabilities. Additionally, a 28-
unit aﬀordable senior housing development was approved for construction as of 2008.
The City also provides funding support to a shared housing provider that matches frail
seniors with younger persons who can provide assistance with household tasks, such
as cleaning and cooking. This agency places 15 to 20 shared housing relationships each
year.

              Persons with Disabilities
              Persons with disabilities may require certain housing features or services. In 2000, the
              US Census reported that 14,915 residents (16 percent of the City’s population) had one
              or more disabilities. Table 8.12-B-16 shows a tally of disabilities, by type (note that the
              table counts disabilities, not the number of persons with disabilities).

              Many of these persons do not require special housing. However, the 2000 Census indicated
              that approximately 36 percent of the disabled population in the City was unemployed.
              Therefore, low income is one significant obstacle to housing for the disabled in Santa
              Clara. The City provides financial assistance to support transitional housing for persons
              with physical disabilities. Through the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program, the City
              meets the needs of access-impaired or handicapped owner-occupants by removing
              architectural barriers where appropriate. Private developers are encouraged to meet
              or exceed State requirements and any additional local policies regarding handicap
              accessible living arrangements.
              The City has also subsidized the acquisition of two residences for persons with
              developmental disabilities, accommodating six individuals in each home. As part of
              the 450-unit Estancia/Archstone apartments with 90 units reserved for low-income
              households, 23 units are designed and reserved for those with developmental and
              physical disabilities. The County Housing Authority also has three units within the City
              available to persons with physical or developmental disabilities.
              Large Families
              Large households, those with five or more persons, often have special housing
              needs due to their income and the lack of adequately sized, aﬀordable housing. As
              a result, large households often live in overcrowded conditions. Although one-, two-,

and three- person households account for the majority of household sizes in the City
(81 percent), there are a small number of five or more person households. The 2006
American Community Survey reports 2,980 households with five or more members in
Santa Clara, representing seven percent of total households, as shown in Table 8.12-B-
17. Large owner-occupied households are somewhat more prevalent than large renter-
occupied households. The CHAS data further indicate that among the large households
in the City, approximately 65 percent experienced some form of a housing problem,
which is defined as overcrowding, above the cost burden, and/or substandard housing
conditions. This illustrates that Santa Clara has a need for aﬀordable housing units with
three or more bedrooms.

Since 2000, most new development—approximately 4,600 units—has been multi-family
development, with five or more units.
Currently, 55 percent of the housing stock is composed of studios, and one- or two-
bedroom units. Three-bedroom units compose nearly a third of all units, but four-
bedroom units only account for 12 percent, and five or more bedrooms just one
percent.
Potentially compounding the housing needs of larger families is the fact that household
incomes decrease with household size. Table 8.12-B-18 shows that household income
is highest among four-person households, at $100,703, but declines as household size
increases above four people, to $59,473 for households with seven or more members.
Most likely these larger households contain more children or grandparents who are not
employed.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
              Single-parent Households
              Single-parents may have additional housing needs, as sole income earners with
              dependent children. In 2006, there were 3,266 households occupied by a female-headed
              household, with no husband present (8 percent of total). Of these, over 61 percent,
              2,022 households, had children present. In comparison, single fathers made up 993
              households.
              To address the needs of single parent families, the City of Santa Clara previously
              participated in Project Self-Suﬃciency, which has since been renamed Partners in Self-
              Suﬃciency. Project Self-Suﬃciency was a HUD pilot program aimed at making single
              parent families economically self-suﬃcient through job-training, aﬀordable childcare
              and, most importantly, aﬀordable housing. The rationale was that if a parent’s home life
              is stable, then the parent’s success through job-training will increase and with successful
              training they will be able to earn more in the job market. Although federal sponsorship
              of Project Self-Suﬃciency has expired, the City of Santa Clara continues to carry on
              the intent of the program through the cooperation of the Housing Authority of the
              County of Santa Clara. The goal of the program remains to help low-income single-
              parents make the transition from public assistance to gainful employment by providing
              the means for individuals to locate and utilize existing programs and resources. The
              Housing Authority gives program preference to new participants of Section 8 housing
              certificates.
              Families and Persons In Need of Emergency Shelters
              Families and persons in need of emergency shelter have critical and immediate needs for
              transitional and long-term permanent housing. This population may include many of
              the groups described above, as well as other extremely low-income households, youth,
              victims of domestic violence, and temporarily or chronically homeless.
              Homelessness
              The number of homeless persons and families has been increasing nationally and
              in the Bay Area. The demographics of the homeless also have been changing, from
              predominately single persons often with substance abuse or mental illness to an
              increasing number of families unable to aﬀord high rents.
              According to The 2007 Santa Clara County Homeless Census and Survey, there were 7,202
              homeless people in Santa Clara County counted in January 2007. Over 70 percent of
              these individuals were found in shelters, 29 percent were unsheltered. In the City of
              Santa Clara, 480 people were counted during this survey; 58 percent were identified in
              shelters, the remaining 42 percent were unsheltered. Moreover, the report annualizes
              these numbers, assuming that people cycle in and out of homelessness at diﬀerent
              points during the year. Using this assumption, over 18,000 persons were estimated to
              be homeless at some point in Santa Clara County during 2007. Although these numbers
              represent small fractions of the total population (less than one percent at both the City
              and County level), the shelter and care needs of homeless individuals are great.

Youth
Housing stakeholders and providers interviewed for this Housing Element identified
a need for transitional and permanent housing for youth. These housing types could
come in various forms, from a renovated single-family home with just a few residents,
to larger residences serving 20 youth. This type of housing requires on-site social
services or other support. In addition, stakeholders recommended additional single-
room occupancy units (SROs) to serve various populations with limited incomes, from
homeless and transitional populations, to seniors and young people, just out of high
school or college.
Emergency Housing Provided in the City
The City of Santa Clara has seven sites where persons in need of emergency shelter can
seek a bed and other assistance, as shown in Table 8.12-B-19.

The Bill Wilson Center, partially funded by the City of Santa Clara, provides short-term
housing for runaway and homeless youth ages 11-17 and transitional housing services
for youth and young adults 17-21 years old and young-parent families. The City helped
fund the acquisition of an apartment building and a house located on another site
that provides transitional housing services to ten young homeless families. A triplex
purchased using Federal HOME funds and City Redevelopment funds houses eight
single homeless teens.
The Emergency Housing Consortium’s Sobrato Family Living Center provides
emergency housing for up to 43 families on Agnew Road just east of Lafayette Street.

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
              The Center also provides eight units of permanent aﬀordable housing, a community
              center, and a computer learning center. The shelter houses up to 100 persons per night.
              Clients may remain at the shelter for up to 90 days and receive tenant education as well
              as information on area housing and jobs, children’s programs, case management and
              other subjects.
              Redevelopment Agency funds also have assisted with the construction of a 24 unit
              Homesafe Transitional Housing project on City-owned land for those who have
              experienced domestic violence.
              The Zoning Ordinance does not identify a zoning classification that allows emergency
              shelters by right. This program will be undertaken in the Zoning Ordinance Update and
              will occur within two years of adoption of this Housing Element, in compliance with
              SB 2.
              Farmworkers
              Since the closest large-scale agricultural production operations are more than thirty
              miles away from the City, in southern Santa Clara County, farmworkers have not been
              identified as a subgroup with special housing needs. The only farming operation is
              the City has been the Bay Area Research Extension Center, a part of the University of
              California’s agricultural studies. However, this facility has been closed and in 2007, this
              site was approved for housing. The 2000 U.S. Census reported just 94 City of Santa Clara
              residents working in the farming, fishing, or forestry industries.
              College Students
              The City of Santa Clara contains several higher education institutions: Santa Clara
              University (SCU), Golden State Baptist College, and Mission College.
              SCU currently has a total enrollment of over 8,000 students. The University has begun
              a program of expanding its types of on-campus housing with the intent of encouraging
              more students to live on campus. SCU is currently updating its master plan, but
              anticipates an increase in its student body and in the number of students served by on-
              campus housing, from 2,500 to 3,500. The City supports the expansion of the variety of
              types of housing opportunities provided on-campus, so as to minimize the impacts on
              the City’s oﬀ-campus housing stock. Students tend to have limited incomes, but can be
              accommodated by small units. Since the previous Housing Element period beginning in
              1999, the University has constructed apartment-style housing with 290 beds.
              Golden State Baptist College is an undergraduate facility that houses over 400 students
              in on-campus dormitories. Mission College is a community junior college attended by
              over 9,000 full- and part-time students who commute from their homes in and outside
              the City and County. Currently, there is no on-campus residency.

Section 8 Vouchers
The City of Santa Clara contracts with the Housing Authority of the County of Santa
Clara (HACSC) to administer its rental assistance programs, specifically the Section 8
Voucher program. According to a Santa Clara County Housing Authority oﬃcial, there
is a waiting list of 58,000 households seeking Section 8 vouchers, at the County level. As
of March 2008, there were 867 City of Santa Clara residents with Tenant-Based Section 8
Vouchers, 732 of which (85%) were considered extremely low-income earners. Another
2,627 residents were on the waiting list at this time, of which 1,751 (71%) were extremely
low-income households. Although many of these individuals and families on the
waiting list already have housing, this high number suggests a demand for additional
aﬀordable housing opportunities.
Public Housing
HACSC also manages 325 public housing units throughout the City of Santa Clara,
within six developments. These developments are described in Table 8.12-B-20.
Assisted Housing Units
The City’s Redevelopment Agency plays an active role in funding aﬀordable housing
and has placed long-term restrictions on several projects, as shown in Table 8.12-B-20.
Some of these housing developments also contain supportive services.
Additional below-market rate units are provided through the City’s inclusionary housing
requirement, which requires new developments with ten or more dwelling units, to
provide ten percent of their units at below-market rates. During the previous housing
element period (1999-2006), this policy helped to produce 123 aﬀordable units.
                                                                                           Page 8.12-143

8.12-B.7            Projected Housing Needs
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State law requires that each jurisdiction make available an adequate number of housing
sites at a range of income levels. In the Bay Area, each city and county’s “fair share”
of housing units is determined by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process. This process accounts
for factors such as existing and expected employment, population growth, and transit
accessibility and allocates housing units accordingly. The Housing Element is the
implementing tool for documenting these potential housing sites.
Table 8.12-B-21 describes the allocation for the City of Santa Clara and the County as a
whole. According to ABAG, Santa Clara’s fair share for the 2007 to 2014 period is 5,873
units. This total is then broken down into subtotals for each household income level.
Although extremely low-income (ELI) need was not calculated by ABAG, HCD allows
the City to assume that approximately half of the very low-income households qualify
as ELI. Therefore, the Housing Element assumes that 647 units should be available to
ELI households.

Although the population of the City of Santa Clara comprises just six percent of the
County’s total population, the City’s RHNA number represents nearly ten percent of the
Countywide regional housing need. This is due to Santa Clara’s high number of jobs,
compared to its population; the City had twice as many jobs as employed residents in
2005.

              Units Built, Under Construction or Approved During the Planning Period
              Table 8.12-B-22 identifies the City’s progress since January 2007 on fulfilling the regional
              housing needs. Between January 2007 and December 2008, the City constructed 1,146
              units, of which 125 were designated for moderate income households. In addition, an
              average of four-to-five accessory units are approved and constructed each year.
              Current development projects include 155 units under construction and 740 units
              approved, a portion of which will be available at below-market rates. In sum, completed
              projects and current development projects will produce 2,041 housing units, of which
              403 will be available at below-market rates.

              units.

8.13 COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY AND HEALTH GOALS AND POLICIES
The City of Santa Clara is committed to the principles of sustainable development through the
implementation of the its General Plan policies. This Appendix identifies policies that are sustainably
oriented. It is intended to provide the basis for the future measurement and tracking necessary for
implementation and, ultimately, for inclusion in a Climate Action Plan.
8.13.1             Implementation Matrix
The matrix below cross references policies from the General Plan and organizes them with respect to
the topics listed in Chapter 5: Goals and Policies. Implementation of these policies will help the City
of Santa Clara address the goals defined by AB 32 (2006) and SB 375 (2008), as well as California’s
aggressive approach toward combating climate change.

8.14 NOISE
This section provides the basis for which noise is evaluated for the General Plan, including
noise measurement and sources applicable to the City of Santa Clara.
Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive, irritating, objectionable
and/or disruptive to daily life. Background noise is primarily the product of many distant
noise sources, which constitute a relatively stable noise background exposure, with
individual contributors unidentifiable. Noise levels are also aﬀected by short duration
single event noise sources (e.g., aircraft flyovers, motor vehicles, sirens), which are readily
identifiable to the individual. The known eﬀects of noise on humans include hearing
loss, communication interference, sleep
interference, physiological responses and
annoyance.
Factors that can influence human response
to noise include intensity, frequency, and
time pattern of noise sources; the amount
of background noise present prior to the
intruding noise; and the nature of work or
human activity that is exposed to the noise.
People in residences, motels and hotels,
schools, libraries, churches, hospitals,
nursing homes, auditoriums, natural
areas, parks and outdoor recreation areas
are generally more sensitive to noise than
are people at commercial and industrial
establishments. Consequently, noise
standards for sensitive land uses are more
stringent than for those at less sensitive
uses. To protect various human activities
in sensitive areas, lower noise levels are
generally required.
8.14.1          Noise Measurement
Noise is measured in decibels (dB), which are units of sound energy intensity. Sound
waves, traveling outward from a source, exert a sound pressure level measured in dB.
The typical human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies of the audible sound
spectrum. To account for this variation, the A-weighted scale is used. A-weighting is a
method of frequency weighting to account for the variation in sensitivity of the human
ear to the range of frequencies of the audible spectrum. Average noise exposure in the
community is measured by a Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). This is the
computed average of noise over a 24-hour period, weighted to reflect the increased
sensitivity to noise during the evening and night.
                                                                                                  Page 8.14-3

         SANTA CLARA
         GENERAL PLAN
            Typically, decibel level changes of 1 dB cannot be distinguished, a 3 dB change is just
            noticeable, a change of 5 dB is distinct and a change of 10 dB is perceived as a doubling of
            noise. The General Plan noise standards are reflected on the following table.
  TABLE 8.14-1: GENERAL PLAN NOISE STANDARDS
            8.14.2         Noise Levels and Sources
            Transportation facilities, including vehicular traﬃc, railroads and the San José Norman Y.
            Mineta International Airport (Airport) are all factors in determining the noise environment
            of the City. The quietest areas of the City are those furthest from major City streets. The
            noisiest areas are under the airport flight pattern and immediately adjacent to freeways
            and railways.
            8.14.3         Vehicular Traffic
            Roadway traﬃc is one of the more prevalent sources of noise within the City. Traﬃc
            noise varies in how it aﬀects land uses depending upon the type of roadway, distance of
            the land use from that roadway, topographical setting, and other physical land features
            such as walls, buildings and other structures. Some variables that aﬀect the amount of
            noise emitted from a road are speed of traﬃc, flow of traﬃc and type of traﬃc (e.g. cars
            versus heavy duty trucks). Another variable aﬀecting the overall measure of noise is a
            perceived increase in sensitivity to noise at night. Because of the high traﬃc volumes
            for the freeways and expressways in the area, U.S. 101, Central Expressway, Lawrence
            Expressway, San Tomas Expressway and Montague Expressway constitute the loudest
            roadway source noise in the City. Industrial and commercial uses are located primarily
            along U.S. 101 and Central Expressway; however, there are residences located along the
            Lawrence, San Tomas and Montague Expressways. Noise from arterial roadways is also
            a contributor to the noise environment.

                                                                                              8.14
8.14.4         Airports
The San José Norman Y. Mineta International Airport is located to the east of, and
adjacent to, the City. Noise generated by aircraft using the Airport has a noticeable
eﬀect on Santa Clara residents in the area north of the U.S. 101. The City uses the oﬃcial
Santa Clara County ALUC Referral Boundary (65 dB CNEL) Map as a basis of referring
proposed projects to the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC). This is consistent with
noise restrictions in the California Administrative Code, Title 21, Subchapter 6 “Noise
Standards.” Local plans, policy actions or development activities that aﬀect areas within
the ALUC boundary need approval, or a finding of overriding consideration, prior to the
issuance of local permits.
An important factor for calculated CNEL values is that, while the maximum noise levels
produced by individual aircraft are a major component, CNEL does not explicitly measure
peak, or maximum, noise levels. A CNEL of 65 dB means that peak noise levels above
65 db will likely be experienced. At CNEL 65 dB, individual aircraft noise events loud
enough to be disruptive are common. Based on the noise monitoring survey conducted
for the General Plan update, aircraft generate maximum noise levels in the range of 75 to
78 dBA Lmax at residences located north of U.S. 101.
8.14.5         Railroads
Two Union Pacific Railroad rail lines run through the City. The San Francisco line bisects
the City in a generally east-west direction and generally forms a boundary between
residential uses to the south and industrial uses to the north. The other rail line parallels
Lafayette Street from State Route 237 in the north to El Camino Real where it turns to the
east toward the Airport. Operations on these lines include both passenger and freight
service, with spur tracks in industrial areas. Based on noise monitoring survey of existing
operations, the San Francisco rail line generates a noise level of about 65 dBA CNEL at
a distance of 100 feet and the Lafayette Street rail line generates a noise level of about 64
dBA CNEL at a distance of 100 feet.
8.14.6         Industry
Industrial and manufacturing facilities within the City involve moving and stationary
noise sources that may aﬀect adjacent noise-sensitive land uses. Industrial processes,
such as fabricating and grinding, have the potential to exert a relatively high level of
noise impact within their immediate operating environments. In addition, activities
such as truck movements and deliveries can also generate noise along the local Roadway
Network. The scope and degree of noise from industrial uses depends on various critical
factors, including the type of industrial activity, hours of operation and the site’s location
relative to other land uses. Residential land uses are adjacent to industrial land uses in
the northeast area of the City, north of Bayshore in the Rivermark area. During the noise
monitoring survey, industrial uses in this area generated a constant noise level of about
45 dBA at adjacent residences. Noisy activities could take place at other times of the day/
year were not accounted for in the noise monitoring survey.
                                                                                               Page 8.14-5

         GENERAL PLAN
            8.14.7        Other Noise Sources
            Other sources of noise include commercial, recreational and school uses. Noise sources
            associated with commercial uses include mechanical equipment, as well as activities
            associated with parking lots and loading docks. Noise generating activities associated
            with schools include children at play, bells and public address systems. High schools may
            include stadiums for day and evening athletic events, and public address/loudspeaker
            systems.
            Intermittent or temporary noise sources include construction noise and noise from
            landscaping maintenance activities. Although these noise sources are typically short in
            duration, they are often loud and can be a source of annoyance.
