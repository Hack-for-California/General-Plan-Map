1                           I NT  TRODUCTION
  This chapter provides the vision of Santa Rosa in 2035, as identified through
  preparation of the General Plan. State planning requirements, guidelines developed
  by the city‚Äôs General Plan Program Management Team (PMT), the citizen par-
  ticipation process, and plan format are all described.
  1-1     VISION
  In 2035, Santa Rosa is a vibrant community featuring a diverse range of housing
  and employment opportunities. Urban development is focused within the city‚Äôs
  Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), and job growth is balanced with the availability of
  housing. Infill development is designed to maintain the local quality of life through
  compatibility with adjacent land uses, provision of parks and open spaces, and
  connection between neighborhoods and activity centers. Safe, livable residential
  neighborhoods provide a variety of housing types for households of all income
  levels. Neighborhood-scale retail and service uses, schools, and recreational facilities
  are connected by bicycle and pedestrian paths.
  Downtown serves as the heart of the community. Historic structures and
  districts surrounding downtown are preserved, lending character to the city‚Äôs
  center. Commercial and multifamily development has occurred along regional/
  arterial corridors that provide access to downtown, including Santa Rosa Avenue
  and Sebastopol Road. Community and regional retailers have invested in these
  areas, and many of the streets have acquired a ‚Äúboulevard‚Äù character, with street
  trees, medians, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks. A range of higher density housing
  opportunities exists within walking distance of these regional/arterial streets,
  providing residents with convenient access to services and transit without use of a
  car. Public art is displayed at major activity centers and public spaces.
  Santa Rosa is now a regional leader in environmental stewardship by actively
  pursuing programs of resource conservation, energy efficiency and greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emission reductions. Santa Rosa reduced its GHG emissions for city
  operations to 20 percent below 2000 levels by 2010 and facilitated community-wide
  reductions of 25 percent below 1990 levels in 2015.

INTRODUCTION
A wide range of transportation alternatives is available to Santa Rosa residents, including car,
bus, rail, bicycle, and foot. The city‚Äôs circulation network accommodates bicyclists, motorists,
pedestrians, public transportation users, children, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
The majority of the city‚Äôs vehicle fleet is composed of alternative fueled and hybrid vehicles
while many residents of the community are also utilizing sustainable fuel technologies for
transportation. Transit systems provide timed transfers and convenient routes, while bicycle
facilities are provided at large employment centers, shopping areas, and transfer stations.
Major entries to the city‚Äôs UGB feature distinct landscaping and signage, while scenic roadways
within the city preserve views of significant natural and cultural features. Reduced traffic
congestion and improved levels of service have contributed to better air quality.
Neighborhood and community parks are distributed throughout the city, and offer a variety of
passive and active recreational opportunities. Citywide Parks and Special Purpose Parks and
Facilities, containing facilities such as community centers and aquatic facilities are also located
in different parts of the city, for convenience and accessibility. Creeks and wetland areas are
preserved for their biological resources and wildlife habitat, as well as their contribution to the
regional storm water system. Multi use paths have been constructed along creek corridors to
provide linkages between different parts of the city.
Educational facilities needed to serve Santa Rosa residents are located throughout the
community. Elementary and middle school facilities are accessible by bicycle and foot from
most neighborhoods. After-school youth programs feature continuing education, music
and dance, sports, culture and arts. Santa Rosa Junior College provides adult education
opportunities, including training programs for technical skills desired by local employers.
Expansion of water supply, sewer treatment, and solid waste collection systems have been
timed with the growth of housing and employment uses, and conservation has helped the city
to do more with less. Police and fire response capabilities match the distribution and needs
of land uses. Development is located away from hazardous areas, and incorporates safety
considerations. New development and reuse projects have considered geologic and seismic
hazards during construction. Noise sensitive uses are located in the quieter parts of the city
and attenuation programs are in place to reduce noise levels in structures adjacent to the
highways and regional/arterial streets. New developments utilize natural drainage systems,
and where appropriate, capacity of the storm water system has been increased with new
development so that flooding does not pose risks to persons or property.
Santa Rosa is a safe, livable community in which to both live and work. Provision of housing,
transportation, employment, recreation, and entertainment opportunities result in a high
quality of life for residents of all ages. Preservation of natural and cultural features throughout
the city contributes to the city‚Äôs identity and character. The city remains a regional leader in
sustainable practices, resource conservation, and efficient operations with limited GHG
emissions.

1-2     ROLE AND PURPOSE
State law requires each California city and county to prepare a general plan. A general plan is
defined as ‚Äúa comprehensive, long-term plan for the physical development of the county or city,
and any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency‚Äôs judgment bears relation to
its planning.‚Äù State requirements call for general plans that ‚Äúcomprise an integrated, internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency.‚Äù State law further
requires each jurisdiction to comply with the adopted GHG emission reduction strategies. The
City of Santa Rosa is able to do so as a result of General Plan policies found throughout this
document as well as specific programs such as the City‚Äôs Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program
and Climate Action Plan. Users of Santa Rosa‚Äôs General Plan will note that policies related to
GHG emission reductions are designated by a leaf.             All greenhouse gas related goals and
policies are listed in an appendix at the end of this general plan.
The Santa Rosa General Plan addresses issues related to physical development, growth
management, transportation services, public facilities, community design, energy efficiency,
greenhouse gas reduction strategies, and conservation of resources in the Planning Area. The
General Plan:
        ‚Ä¢   Outlines a vision of long-range physical and economic development that reflects the
            aspirations of the community, and provides specific implementing policies that will
            allow this vision to be accomplished;
        ‚Ä¢   Establishes a basis for judging whether specific development proposals and public
            projects are in harmony with said vision;
        ‚Ä¢   Allows city departments, other public agencies, and private developers to design
            projects that will enhance the character of the community, preserve and enhance
            critical environmental resources, and minimize hazards; and
        ‚Ä¢   Provides the basis for establishing and setting priorities for detailed plans and
            implementing programs such as the Zoning Code, specific and area plans, and the
            Capital Improvement Program.
GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
A city‚Äôs general plan has been described as its constitution for development ‚Äì the framework
within which decisions on how to grow, provide public services and facilities, and protect and
enhance the environment must be made. California‚Äôs tradition of allowing local authority over
land use decisions means that the state‚Äôs cities have considerable flexibility in preparing their
general plans.
                                                                                                     1-3

INTRODUCTION
While they allow considerable flexibility, state planning
laws do establish some requirements for the issues that
general plans must address:
        ‚Ä¢  The General Plan Must Be Comprehensive.
           The general plan must be geographically
           comprehensive ‚Äì that is, it must apply
           throughout the entire incorporated area and
           include other areas that the city determines
           are relevant to its planning. Also, the general
           plan must address the full range of issues Twelve neighborhood meetings, and numerous
                                                           Program Management Team workshops were
           that affects the city‚Äôs physical development.   held as part of the General Plan update process.
        ‚Ä¢  The General Plan Must Be Internally Consistent.
           The General Plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each
           other without conflict. ‚ÄúHorizontal‚Äù consistency applies to figures and diagrams,
           background text, data and analysis, and policies. All adopted portions of the general
           plan, whether required by state law or not, have equal legal weight.
        ‚Ä¢  The General Plan Must Be Long Range. Because anticipated development will affect
           the city and the people who live and work there for years to come, state law requires
           every general plan to take a long-term perspective.
State law also requires that the city provide an annual report on the status of the plan and
progress in its implementation. The Planning Commission and City Council hold a joint study
session each March to review the General Plan annual report.
1-3     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Santa Rosa 2035 depends largely on the extensive public participation program conducted
for its predecessor General Plan, Santa Rosa 2020, since the revision process to develop
Santa Rosa 2035 was focused on updating the Housing Element, incorporating policies from
recently adopted planning efforts, and including policies related to climate protection. Public
participation efforts were centered on the Housing Element and are described in greater detail
there. In response to testimony at Planning Commission public hearings held regarding Santa
Rosa 2035, commissioners reviewed the General Plan element by element to facilitate increased
public participation, and dialogue between stakeholders.
Public participation in preparation of the 2020 General Plan occurred in a variety of ways.
An oversight committee - the General Plan Program Management Team (PMT) - was formed
of elected and appointed officials and members of the public. The PMT met throughout 2000
1-4

                                                                S A N TA R O S A G E N E R A L P L A N
and in early 2001, discussing existing conditions and planning issues related to land use,
housing, public services, transportation, open space and resources, downtown, economics,
and neighborhood livability. Additionally, the PMT reviewed two alternative land use plans,
and provided direction on population, employment growth, and development patterns for the
General Plan.
Twelve community meetings, hosted by the PMT, were held to allow citizens an opportunity
to comment on General Plan related issues. Three community meetings were held in each
quadrant of the city to encourage discussion of neighborhood-specific, as well as citywide,
planning issues. At these meetings, Santa Rosa residents were asked to brainstorm issues
and opportunities for the city, quadrants, and
neighborhoods. The community meetings were
advertised through the community cable channel, the
Press Democrat, the city‚Äôs quarterly Update newsletter,
the city‚Äôs website, and flyers distributed throughout the
community.
1-4     GUIDING PRINCIPLES
After all of the community meetings were held and
planning issues identified, the PMT developed a
set of Guiding Principles. Drafted in August 2000,
the Guiding Principles describe the most important
directions which were to be followed in drafting the
General Plan. Additionally, the Guiding Principles were
used in conceptualizing two sketch plan alternatives.
The Guiding Principles are advisory only and do not
represent General Plan policy.
Santa Rosa is a special place set in an agricultural county
with an inviting climate, superior natural beauty, desirable
residential neighborhoods, and a strong, diversified
economy. As the area accepts its share of the region‚Äôs
growth, these characteristics must not be sacrificed.
Instead, the growth must protect the positive qualities
which make the city attractive and build new features which
provide enduring value and beauty and further improve the
quality of life. It is our duty to assure that, twenty years
from now, Santa Rosa is an even more desirable city than it  Guiding Principles call for linkages, increased

INTRODUCTION
    1. Because the remaining land within the Santa Rosa
        Urban Boundary is limited, all new development

        and pedestrian elements. Pedestrians=cars=bikes on all streets in Santa Rosa.
    8. New, high quality development shall be used to improve the areas of Santa Rosa which have
        undergone deterioration or require increased vitality. Building and zoning codes shall be
        enforced.
    9. The natural assets of Santa Rosa, such as creeks, mature trees and skylines, shall be conserved,
        restored, and showcased.
    10. The entire spectrum of housing needs of community residents shall be anticipated and
        addressed with each new residential development and the rehabilitation of existing residences.
        In addition, all new non-residential development will participate in meeting local housing
        needs.
    11. Higher density residential development will be sited to reduce unit costs and provide more
        efficient transportation alternatives and neighborhood amenities.

INTRODUCTION
1-5        GENERAL PLAN FORMAT
State law requires that a general plan address seven mandatory elements - land use, circulation,
conservation, open space, safety, noise, and housing. Specific topic areas are prescribed for
each mandatory element. The Santa Rosa General Plan is organized as shown in Table 1-1,
addressing each of the mandatory elements and several optional elements.

INTRODUCTION
GOALS AND POLICIES
Each element of the General Plan is organized to provide a short statement of existing
conditions and vision, followed by goals and policies. In some instances, commentary is also
included.
        ‚Ä¢   Goals present broad policy direction; a larger end-state the city is hoping to achieve.
        ‚Ä¢   Policies provide more specific direction on how to achieve goals. Policies outline
            actions, procedures, programs, or techniques to attain the goals. Some policies
            include quantitative statements that can be implemented by city staff.
        ‚Ä¢   Commentary below some policies simply provides further discussion of and potential
            implementation for the policy statement.
1-6     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS
Santa Rosa 2035 incorporates significant policy direction from other plans. Policy references
from the following plans are included in this document:
        ‚Ä¢   Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Citywide Creek Master Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Downtown Station Area Specific Plan
        ‚Ä¢   North Santa Rosa Station Area Specific Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Economic Sustainability Strategy
        ‚Ä¢   Northern Downtown Pedestrian Linkages Study
        ‚Ä¢   Recreation and Parks Business and Strategic Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Sebastopol Road Urban Vision and Corridor Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Southeast Area Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Southwest Area Plan
        ‚Ä¢   Climate Action Plan
The Southeast and Southwest Area Plans are superseded with the adoption of this plan. The
remainder of above-noted plans are in full effect and should be consulted for additional goals,
policies, and information.
The Climate Action Plan was adopted in 2012 in recognition that climate change poses a
threat to Santa Rosa and the larger environment. Activities taking place within the City have
an impact on global warming and climate change. The Climate Action Plan provides specific
measures regarding how the City plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and outlines the
effects of community wide actions on climate change.

In preparation of the prior general plan, Santa Rosa 2020, various background reports were
prepared. These reports may be reviewed at the City of Santa Rosa‚Äôs Department of Community
Development.
1-7      CHANGING THE GENERAL PLAN
As the city‚Äôs premier policy document, the General Plan is not changed without good cause.
The City Council, Planning Commission, or staff, in reviewing the General Plan, may find that
certain portions should be changed due to circumstances which arise within the community.
Amendment of the General Plan may be necessary due to changing policies of the City Council
or if it is found through periodic review that certain portions of the Plan are inadequate or do
not meet the needs of the community.
The General Plan Land Use Diagram or the text of any element may be amended. General
Plan Amendment applications may be filed by individual applicants or may be initiated by
the Community Development Director, Planning Commission or City Council. Concurrent
processing of General Plan Amendments with other land use applications is permitted.
Applications for General Plan Amendment must address why an amendment is warranted,
describe events which have rendered the General Plan inadequate or unattainable, and describe
any studies which have brought policies or portions of the plan into question.
The General Plan may be amended three times per year. The Planning Commission shall
conduct hearings regarding General Plan Amendment applications in February, June and
October of each year. The City Council shall conduct hearings after consideration of the
Planning Commission, in March, July and November. To meet this hearing schedule, the
following application deadlines are established: February 1 for hearing in June; June 1 for
hearing in October; and October 1 for hearing in February. When the first day of the month
falls on a weekend, the following Monday is the final day for submittal.
                                                                                                 1-11

2            L AND USE AND LI VABI LI T Y
  The text, goals, and policies of the Land Use and Livability Element and the Land
  Use Diagram (enclosed foldout) constitute the physical framework for the General
  Plan. The diagram designates the proposed general location, distribution, and
  extent of land uses. As required by state law, land use classifications, shown as
  color designations, symbols, or graphic patterns on the diagram, specify a range
  for population density and building intensity for each type of designated land use.
  These standards of population density and building intensity allow circulation
  and public facility needs to be determined; they also reflect the environmental
  constraints established by other elements of the General Plan. In addition, this
  element addresses livability ‚Äì those qualities of the city that affect everyday
  living; such as how well the city works for its residents and workers, as well as how
  comfortable and enjoyable neighborhoods are.
  The Land Use and Livability Element incorporates significant policy direction from
  other city planning documents that have relevant land use implications. Those
  policies are assigned a Land Use and Livability number and shown in the goals and
  policy section. Adopted city plans with land use implications and approved policies

  2-1     VISION
  Santa Rosa‚Äôs growth has been compact, with urban development in 2035 contained
  within the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Downtown is the city‚Äôs primary activity
  node, and retail and multifamily development has occurred along regional/arterial
  corridors leading to downtown. Smaller-scale mixed use shopping centers are

interspersed throughout the city to provide residents easy access to daily shopping needs. New
residential development has occurred in a variety of settings and housing types to meet the
needs of a diverse population.
Downtown is an energetic center of commerce in the North Bay. New offices, stores, hotels and
cultural facilities have located here. Because of new housing development, downtown is vital
during evenings and weekends. The new residents of downtown ‚Äì families, students, seniors,
and others ‚Äì enjoy urban living, and are able to walk to jobs and shops. Railroad Square is a
lively nucleus of galleries, shops, arts education workshops, and other cultural facilities. Some
of the older industrial buildings to the north have been converted to live/work lofts and higher
density residential.
Major corridors leading into downtown have a boulevard character, with rows of trees,
landscaped medians, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks. Sebastopol Road is the focus of activity
in southwest Santa Rosa; it has pedestrian orientation, and among its attractions is an
International Marketplace. Businesses along Mendocino Avenue serve students and workers
of the adjacent Junior College. Santa Rosa Avenue features regional shopping destinations
accessible by automobile, transit, or bicycle. The city‚Äôs largest retail and office center outside of
downtown is the Fountaingrove Parkway/Old Redwood Highway area, which is complemented
by adjacent new business parks.
2-2     EXISTING LAND USES
Since its incorporation in 1868, with an area of about one square mile and 900 residents,
Santa Rosa has evolved into the commercial, financial, medical, and industrial center of the
North Bay. Santa Rosa is also the largest city between San Francisco and Eugene, Oregon.
Santa Rosa voters approved a five-year UGB in 1990, and a 20-year UGB measure in 1996,
assuring that the current UGB will not be significantly changed at least until 2016. The UGB
encompasses 45 square miles. Figure 2-1 shows the city limits, UGB, and Planning Area.
Santa Rosa has a traditional downtown, which, together with the nearby Santa Rosa Junior
College (JC) area, holds approximately one-quarter of the 16.5 million square feet of
commercial/office space within the UGB. About half of the city‚Äôs commercial acreage (660 acres
of a total of 1,370 acres) is in strip retail uses. Another 10.6 million square feet of industrial
space is scattered in peripheral locations. The city‚Äôs residential neighborhoods are diverse,
ranging from the traditional - such as JC, Burbank, and West End ‚Äì with grid street patterns
and moderately high densities, to low density hillside neighborhoods such as Chanate/Hidden
Valley, Rincon Valley, and Fountaingrove. With the exception of downtown, land uses are
contained in single-use districts, and mixed use (residential and non-residential) development
is sparse. Approximately 16 percent of land (approximately 4,655 acres of a total of 29,140
acres) within the UGB is vacant.

2-3     LIVABILITY
The concept of livability is complex and encompasses many aspects of daily urban life. For
many urban residents, livability encompasses such diverse qualities as the health of the
environment, protection from natural disasters, and absence of crime, as well as opportunities
for employment, affordability of housing, and the quality of schools and public services. Santa
Rosa is valued by its residents for its livability ‚Äì its comfortable neighborhoods, its relaxed
‚Äúsmall town‚Äù lifestyle, its vital downtown, its climate, and its beautiful setting in California
farming and wine country.
Livability is affected by all scales of urban form, from the design of individual homes and yards,
to neighborhood streets and parks, to citywide systems of regional/arterial streets and open
space corridors. A highly livable city works at each scale. The physical form of a neighborhood
‚Äì the character and pattern of streets, the land use pattern, the quality of its public spaces,
the landscape and natural features, the quality and character of its built form ‚Äì contributes
significantly to its livability and long term success as a neighborhood. It respects the natural
setting and builds on its landscape qualities as well as on its history, providing visible
connections with its past. Chapter 3: Urban Design Element provides additional discussion and
policy framework relating to neighborhood design.
Santa Rosa has enhanced its livability through the use of sustainable materials and efficient
design of the built environment. With its emphasis on multimodal transportation systems
and initiation of green building programs, the city is producing less waste and pollution and
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

GREEN BUILDING REQUIREMENTS
Santa Rosa adopted the voluntary Santa Rosa Build It Green (SR BIG) Program in 2004.
Shortly thereafter, a more aggressive approach was needed to achieve the greenhouse gas
(GHG) reduction targets the City Council established in 2005. In 2007 the Santa Rosa City
Council adopted specific and mandatory green building standards for all new residential,
commercial, industrial, and municipal construction effective in 2008.
In 2010 the City Council adopted the Cal Green building code and established a Tier
One standard requirement for all construction, which is one level beyond the basic state
requirements for green building.
Existing building stock in Santa Rosa is a substantial contributor to energy inefficiencies and
community-based GHG emissions. A city program to improve energy efficiency in existing
buildings will help reduce this impact. The state has approved legislation (AB 811) to help
owners of existing buildings finance the costs of energy efficiency improvements. The City
of Santa Rosa in partnership with the County of Sonoma is facilitating the Sonoma County
Energy Independence Program (SCEIP) which provides financing for energy efficiency upgrades
to homes and businesses in Sonoma County. If City Council chooses to provide direction, the
city may develop its own program as well as participate in the county-wide SCEIP program
which establishes parameters for retrofit of existing buildings.
2-4      LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
The classifications in this section represent adopted city policy. They are meant to be broad
enough to give the city flexibility in implementation, but clear enough to provide sufficient
direction to carry out the General Plan. The city‚Äôs Zoning Code contains more detailed
provisions and standards. More than one zoning district may be consistent with a single
General Plan land use classification. Table 2-1 shows the allowed density and intensity of each
land use classification. The section on Parks and Recreation contains information on different
types of city parks and with the exception of ‚ÄúParks and Recreation,‚Äù does not contain specific
land use classifications.
The General Plan Land Use Diagram is enclosed as a separate fold-out map. The Land Use
Diagram and Urban Growth Boundary are parcel specific. A parcel‚Äôs land use designation can
be determined by viewing the Diagram. Proposed park locations are not parcel specific, and red
tree symbols identify the general vicinity of a future park. Figure 2-2 illustrates the land use
classifications within the downtown area.

RESIDENTIAL
Seven residential land use classifications are established to provide for development of a
full range of housing types. Densities are stated as number of housing units per gross acre
of developable land, provided that at least one housing unit may be built on each existing
legal parcel designated for residential use. Gross acreage includes the entire site acreage.
Development is required within the density range (both maximum and minimum) stipulated in
the classification.
Some residential use classifications include descriptions of housing types that are permitted
in the classification. Mobile home developments, if within the stipulated density range of a
residential classification, are permitted in all residential categories. In addition to housing type
and density standards stipulated below, the Zoning Code establishes development standards,
parking, and other requirements.
Second units permitted by local regulation, as stipulated in the Zoning Code, are in addition to
densities otherwise permitted. Density bonuses may be approved for projects with affordable
housing and housing for elderly residents with specific amenities designated for residents,
provided the design and development standards are in conformance with those specified in the
Zoning Code.
Country Residential
Five to 20 acres per residential unit, with no service by a public sewer system. The term
‚ÄúCountry‚Äù is used to avoid confusion with the Rural Residential classification in the Sonoma
County General Plan, which permits much higher densities. This designation is applied only to
areas outside the UGB.
Very Low Density
Residential development from 0.2 to 2.0 units per gross acre (i.e., 0.5 to 5.0 acres per unit).
This density range accommodates rural and hillside developments within the UGB and is
intended for single family detached units, but clustered single family attached and multifamily
may be permitted.
Low Density/ Open Space
Single family residential development at density of 2.0 to 8.0 units per gross acre, assumed at
only 80 percent of each site due to wetlands constraints. The classification is mainly intended
for detached single family dwellings, but attached single family and multiple family units may
be permitted.
Low Density
Single family residential development at density of 2.0 to 8.0 units per gross acre. The
                                                                                                     2-9

L A N D U S E A N D L I VA B I L I T Y
classification is mainly intended for detached single family dwellings, but attached single family
and multiple family units may be permitted.
Medium Low Density
Housing at densities from 8.0 to 13.0 units per gross acre. The classification is intended
for attached single family residential development, but single family detached housing and
multifamily development may be permitted. Development at the mid-point of the density
range is desirable but not required.
Medium Density
Housing densities from 8.0 to 18.0 units per gross acre. This designation permits a range of
housing types, including single family attached and multifamily developments, and is intended
for specific areas where higher density is appropriate. New single family detached housing is
not permitted except in historic preservation districts and historic neighborhoods where single
family detached units are allowed.
Medium High Density
Residential development, with densities ranging from 18.0 to 30.0 units per gross acre. This
designation permits a range of housing types, including single family attached and multifamily
developments, and is intended for specific areas where higher density is appropriate. Single
family detached housing is not permitted.
Mobile Home Parks
Residential mobile home development of two or more mobile home units, with densities
ranging from 4.0 to 18.0 units per gross acre. Mobile homes are the only allowed housing type.
MIXED USE SITES AND CENTERS
Mixed use development is planned downtown and in specific neighborhood and community
shopping centers. Around existing and proposed rail and bus transfers locations, Transit Village
Medium and Transit Village Mixed Use is designated. While Transit Village Medium is more
residential in nature, ground floor retail is desirable, especially downtown. Neighborhood and
community shopping centers designated for a mix of retail and medium density residential
land uses are identified with a symbol on the Land Use Diagram.
In addition, there are several areas outside downtown and neighborhood and community
shopping centers which have been designated for multiple land uses. These areas are
distinguished by a striped pattern on the Land Use Diagram. Single or multiple uses are
allowed in these areas, consistent with land use designations.

Transit Village Medium
This classification is intended to accommodate mixed
use development within approximately one-half mile
of a transit facility. Development should transition
from less intense uses at the outlying edges to higher
intensity uses near the transit facility. Residential uses
are required, and ground floor neighborhood serving
retail and live‚Äìwork uses are encouraged. Housing
densities range from 25.0 to 40.0 units per gross acre.
Transit Village Mixed Use
This classification is intended to accommodate a Neighborhood and community shopping
well integrated mix of higher intensity residential, centers provide grocery and other daily
office and commercial uses within one-quarter mile services, as well as community gathering

of a transit facility. Development is designed and
oriented to create a central node of activity at or near the transit facility. Housing densities
shall be a minimum of 40.0 units per acre; there is no maximum density requirement for this
designation.
Community Shopping Center
The vision for Community Shopping Centers is a complex of retail services and enterprises
anchored by a large grocery store, and serving a community clientele. Typical uses include
restaurants and shops offering convenience goods. These sites are located in areas surrounded
by residential development and are intended to be walkable centers of neighborhoods and
to intensify with a mixture of uses that would meet the shopping needs for surrounding
neighborhoods and provide housing integrated with the commercial development.
Residential uses shall be incorporated into the overall design but may be provided over time
as part of a phased development. Existing community shopping centers are not required to
include residential uses for minor alterations or reoccupancy, but would be required to evaluate
and demonstrate through site planning that future residential would not be precluded when
significant additions or reconstruction are proposed. Proposed new community shopping
centers include three in southwest, one in southeast, and one in northwest Santa Rosa.
Neighborhood Shopping Center
A small complex of retail and service enterprises providing shopping and services to satisfy
the day-to-day needs of local neighborhoods and workplaces. Typical neighborhood center
uses include small grocery stores, restaurants, barber or beauty shops, cleaners, shoe repair,
and shops offering convenience goods. Residential development is encouraged but not
required. Proposed new neighborhood shopping centers include three in southwest and three
in southeast Santa Rosa. New neighborhood centers in other areas of the city are not shown
on the Land Use Diagram and are allowed in any land use designation where they can be
supported.

COMMERCIAL
Retail and Business Services
Allows retail and service enterprises, offices, and restaurants. Regional centers, which are
large complexes of retail and service enterprises anchored by one or more full line department
stores, and destination centers, which are retail centers anchored by discount or warehouse
stores, are allowed. Large grocery stores are expressly permitted in Community Shopping
Centers and downtown only, and may be considered through a Conditional Use Permit process
on other commercial sites.
OFFICE
Provides sites for administrative, financial, business, professional, medical, and public offices.
BUSINESS PARK
Planned, visually attractive centers for businesses which do not generate nuisances (noise,
clutter, noxious emissions, etc). This designation accommodates campus-like environments for
corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, offices, light manufacturing and
assembly, industrial processing, general service, incubator-research facilities, testing, repairing,
packaging, publishing and printing, and research and development facilities. Warehousing and
distribution facilities, retail, hotels, and residential uses are permissible on an ancillary basis.
Restaurants and other related services are permitted as accessory uses. Outdoor storage is not
permitted.
INDUSTRIAL
Light Industry
Accommodates light industrial, warehousing and heavy commercial uses. Uses appropriate
to this land use category include auto repair, bulk or warehoused goods, general warehousing,
manufacturing/assembly with minor nuisances, home improvement retail, landscape
materials retail, freight or bus terminals, research oriented industrial, accessory offices, and
employee-serving commercial uses, and services with large space needs, such as health clubs.
Professional office buildings are not permitted.
General Industry
Provides areas for manufacturing and distribution activities with potential for creating
nuisances, along with accessory offices and retailing. Unrelated retail and service commercial
uses that could be more appropriately located elsewhere in the city are not permitted. Uses
may generate truck traffic and operate 24 hours a day.
PUBLIC/INSTITUTIONAL

and government office centers, etc. Minor governmental offices located in a private building,
places of religious assembly not occupying extensive land areas, and similar facilities are
not shown on the General Plan Diagram. New facilities may be appropriate in any land use
category based on need and subject to environmental review.
PARKS AND RECREATION
Neighborhood, community, and citywide parks and special purpose parks and facilities
including recreation complexes, golf courses, and creekways are all part of the city‚Äôs park
system. The ‚ÄúR‚Äù symbol on the Land Use Diagram indicates a resort facility. Park facilities are
categorized as follows:
Neighborhood Parks
City- or county-owned land intended to serve the recreation needs of people living or working
within one-half mile radius of the park. Neighborhood parks are generally more than two acres
in size but less than ten acres. They provide spaces for informal or casual play, family or small
group activities such as picnics, community gardens, children‚Äôs play areas, a special feature
such as a splash area, hard court or multi-use field space for fitness, and passive natural areas.
The city aims to provide access to neighborhood parks within one-half mile of residential
neighborhoods.
Community Parks
Land with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities beyond those
supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood
parks (generally 10-25 acres in size). They provide spaces for organized sports, larger group
events, children‚Äôs play areas, several unique features, pathways and natural areas, community
gardens and recreational facilities such as community centers. The city aims to provide access
to community parks within one mile of residential neighborhoods.
Citywide Parks
Generally larger than 25 acres, they include special signature elements such as lakes, sports
complexes, an amphitheater, lighted features, recreational facilities and buildings, large play
structures, and spaces for large group activities such as citywide camps or corporate picnics.
These facilities are used by residents throughout the city.
Special Purpose Parks and Facilities
Park lands generally designated for single use such as golf courses, heritage museums, botanical
gardens, and environmental interpretive experiences. These facilities are used by residents
throughout the city.
Park Identification on the General Plan Land Use Diagram: Existing and proposed parks
are identified on the Land Use Diagram. Existing parks are identified in green showing the
                                                                                                  2-13

approximate extent and boundaries of the park. Proposed neighborhood parks are identified
with small red tree symbols. Proposed community and citywide parks are identified with large
red trees symbols in the vicinity of the proposed parkland. The location of proposed park
facilities is not site specific; the tree symbols identify the general vicinity where a park facility is
needed.
Public Plazas and Gathering Places: In addition to neighborhood, community, citywide and
special purpose parks and facilities, the City of Santa Rosa encourages the development of
public plazas and gathering places. While they are not part of the park standard of 3.5 acres/
thousand residents, these spaces have an important role in connecting residents and visitors
to the wider network of parks, creek trails, and bike and pedestrian pathways. These spaces
are defined as follows: Generally less than two acres in size; they contain vegetation (trees,
grass, greenery) when possible and are generally pursued when there is not adequate space for
a neighborhood park. They provide connectivity to pathways and trails or commercial centers.
They can take the form of a trailhead that is improved as a small plaza, a small area with special
amenities for relaxation or public art, or areas that are sometimes referred to as ‚Äúpocket‚Äù parks
where benches and/or a tot lot may be available. The city aims to provide access to public plazas
and gathering places within one-quarter mile of residential neighborhoods.
Open Space Areas: In addition to larger open space areas, some areas of open space and
undeveloped parkland are components of many of the city‚Äôs parks within the categories
defined above. Other larger open spaces are preserved for a variety of purposes, often in
association with other agencies.
OPEN SPACE
Areas with special environmental conditions or significance, subject to wildfire or geologic
hazards, or watershed or important wildlife or biotic habitat. Where otherwise not excluded
by noise, aircraft safety or other environmental standards, residential development is generally
permitted at a density not to exceed one housing unit per 40 acres. The Sonoma County
Zoning Ordinance may establish larger minimum parcel sizes for areas outside the UGB.
AGRICULTURE
This classification is applied only to sites outside the UGB. Includes orchards and cropland,
grasslands, livestock, and related processing and distribution facilities. Residential density may
not exceed one housing unit per 20 acres, provided that one housing unit is allowed on each
existing parcel. Agriculture is permitted with fewer restrictions on keeping animals than in the
residential classifications.

2-5      POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT
Given the development pace established in the city‚Äôs Growth Management Program, Santa
Rosa has land within its UGB for urban development through 2035. The General Plan
reflects appropriate urban designations on all lands within the UGB, including vacant and
underdeveloped areas. The Growth Management Element of the General Plan paces residential
development in order to manage population growth through 2035.
POPULATION
With the development pace established in the Growth Management Element, population
within Santa Rosa‚Äôs UGB is expected to reach a total of 237,000 by 2035. (Table 2-2).
Approximately 25,225 new housing units will be developed within the UGB. However, it is not
possible to predict the specific location or distribution of these housing units; market trends
and/or environmental constraints will direct this growth.

2-6     GOALS AND POLICIES
LUL-A           Foster a compact rather than a scattered development pattern in order to
                reduce travel, energy, land, and materials consumption while promoting
                greenhouse gas emission reductions citywide.
LUL-A-1         As part of plan implementation ‚Äì including development review, capital
                improvements programming, and preparation of detailed area plans ‚Äì foster
                close land use/transportation relationships to promote use of alternative
                transportation modes and discourage travel by automobile.
LUL-A-2         Annex unincorporated land adjacent to city limits and within the Urban
                Growth Boundary, when the proposal is timely and only if adequate services
                are available. Ensure that lands proposed for annexation provide a rational
                expansion and are contiguous to existing urban development.
LUL-A-3         Require development in county areas within the Santa Rosa Urban Growth
                Boundary to be built to City of Santa Rosa standards to ensure consistency upon
                annexation.
LUL-A-4         Review the policy of providing city services to county areas prior to annexation.
                Evaluate the following:
                ‚Ä¢   Annexation prior to allowing development;
                ‚Ä¢   City and county development standards;
                ‚Ä¢   Payment of development impact fees; and
                ‚Ä¢   Agreements with county for provision of services.
LUL-B           Promote planning as a positive, cooperative community function.
LUL-B-1         Promote and participate in cooperative planning efforts with Sonoma County
                and its cities, especially related to countywide and sub-regional issues such as
                transportation, waste management, and affordable housing.
LUL-B-2         Review the General Plan annually and assess the implementation of its goals and
                policies.
LUL-B-3         Conduct regular meetings of Santa Rosa and Sonoma County staff and Planning
                Commissions to coordinate land use issues of mutual concern within the Urban
                Growth Boundary.

DOWNTOWN
LUL-C   Maintain downtown as the major regional office, financial, civic, and
        cultural center in the North Bay, and a vital mixed-use center.
LUL-C-1 Promote downtown as the center of the business, residential, social, and
        civic life of Santa Rosa by directing high intensity office uses, government,
        residential, and entertainment uses to locate downtown.
LUL-C-2 Review parking regulations downtown to consider its role as a pedestrian- and
        transit-friendly center.
LUL-C-3 Establish development standards in the Zoning Code to reinforce downtown‚Äôs
        traditional development pattern. These should include:
        ‚Ä¢   Maximum build-to lines for development;
        ‚Ä¢   Upper-story stepback requirements; and
        ‚Ä¢   Reduced setback requirements for residential areas.
LUL-C-4 Control the development of new theaters through the Conditional Use Permit
        process. If a theater is proposed outside downtown, give consideration to the
        economic effects of the proposed theater on downtown theaters.
LUL-C-5 Encourage the development of a per-
        forming arts center in downtown.
LUL-C-6 Encourage a new grocery store in the
        downtown area.
LUL-C-7 Permit residential uses in all land use
        categories within downtown.
LUL-C-8 Allow buildings up to 10 stories in height
                                                    Downtown serves as the region‚Äôs major
        within downtown except buildings up to employment center.
        12 stories are allowed downtown at 740
        and 770 Third Street and 100 D Street and up to 14 stories is allowed downtown
        at 620 Third Street.
LUL-C-9 Preserve and protect the character of older established residential
        neighborhoods within and adjacent to downtown. Promote the retention of
        existing housing units when possible, especially those located in structures of
                                                                                          2-17

                architectural or historic interest and significance through a ‚Äúno net housing loss
                policy.‚Äù Permit developments that will result in net loss of housing units only
                with findings that such loss would be unavoidable and that new development
                would provide greater public benefits.
LUL-D           Foster compact, vibrant, and continuous retail at the core of downtown.
LUL-D-1         Require that the first floor of downtown buildings house activity generating
                uses such as retailing, entertainment and dining establishments, theaters
                and galleries, except as specified in Appendix B of the Downtown Station Area
                Specific Plan. Upper floors of downtown buildings may also contain such uses.
                The intent is to foster a compact, walkable core with continuous street-level retail and
                activity at the heart of downtown.
LUL-D-2         Require that uses such as parking garages and theaters provide ground-level
                uses that generate activity or provide visual interest, and are compatible with
                surrounding ground-level uses.
RESIDENTIAL
LUL-E           Promote livable neighborhoods by requiring compliance with green building
                programs to ensure that new construction meets high standards of energy
                efficiency and sustainable material use. Ensure that everyday shopping,
                park and recreation facilities, and schools are within easy walking distance
                of most residents.
LUL-E-1         Provide new neighborhood parks and recreation facilities, elementary schools,
                and convenience shopping in accordance with the General Plan Land Use
                Diagram and Table 2-4 below:

LUL-E-2 As part of planning and development review activities, ensure that projects,
        subdivisions, and neighborhoods are designed to foster livability.
        Utilize the city‚Äôs Design Guidelines as a reference when evaluating the following
        neighborhood components:
        ‚Ä¢   Streets. Street design, traffic calming, and landscaping can make great
            contributions to the creation of successful neighborhoods. Neighborhood
            streets should be quiet, safe, and accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists.
        ‚Ä¢   Connections. Neighborhoods should be well connected to local shops and
            services, public plazas and gathering places, park lands, downtown, schools,
            and recreation by adequate and safe streets, bike lanes, public pathways,
            trails, general infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks and crosswalks), and transit.
        ‚Ä¢   Public Spaces. Downtown serves as the most important public place in the
            city. Developments in the area should further this by incorporating natural
            features and bicycle/pedestrian connections, to encourage use and social
            interaction.
        ‚Ä¢   Neighborhood Character. Each neighborhood should maintain a distinct
            identity, such as the historic preservation districts featuring Victorian
            cottages and California bungalows.
        ‚Ä¢   Diversity and Choice. Neighborhoods should provide choices for residents
            with different values. Different housing types and locations within the city
            accommodate a diverse range of needs.
LUL-E-3 Avoid concentration of large community
        care facilities in any single residential
        neighborhood.
LUL-E-4 Protect the rural quality of Very
        Low Density areas within the Urban
        Growth Boundary through design and
        development standards in the Zoning
        Code, and development review.
                                                       Residential neighborhoods should be designed
                                                       to provide a pleasant pedestrian environment.
LUL-E-5 Maintain the lower density character
        of the residential area west of Wright Road upon annexation to the city. Apply
        zoning that will disallow increased densities and further subdivision. Should
        increased densities be requested, require a land use plan for the entire area west
        of Wright Road within the Urban Growth Boundary addressing how that can
        be accommodated, with particular emphasis on pedestrian, bicycle, and motor
        vehicle circulation.
                                                                                                 2-19

LUL-E-6         Allow residential or mixed use development in the Retail and Business Services
                or Office designations.
LUL-E-7         Develop a zoning category to implement the complete neighborhoods concept
                to allow the development of compact, walkable, mixed use neighborhoods
                including various housing types, non-residential job generating uses, services,
                and public facilities which center on a square or green and which include a
                transit stop. Include criteria for the district‚Äôs application in developed and
                undeveloped sites, such as ideal size, and consider the use of form-based
                regulations.
LUL-F           Maintain a diversity of neighborhoods and varied housing stock to satisfy a
                wide range of needs.
LUL-F-1         Do not allow development at less than the minimum density prescribed by each
                residential land use classification.
LUL-F-2         Require development at the mid-point or higher of the density range in the
                Medium and Medium High Density Residential categories. Allow exceptions
                where topography, parcel configuration, heritage trees, historic preservation or
                utility constraints make the mid-point impossible to achieve.
LUL-F-3         Maintain a balance of various housing types in each neighborhood and ensure
                that new development does not result in undue concentration of a single
                housing type in any one neighborhood. Downtown is excepted.
LUL-F-4         Allow development on sites with a Medium Density Residential designation to
                have a maximum density of 24 units per gross acre (and up to 30 units per acre
                provided at least 20 percent of the housing units are affordable, as defined in
                the Housing Element), provided all of the following conditions are met:
                ‚Ä¢   At least half of the site is within one-quarter mile of a potential rail transit
                    station, transit mall or transfer station, or Community Shopping Center;
                ‚Ä¢   Direct pedestrian access, to the extent feasible, from the development to the
                    transit facility or Community Shopping Center is provided;
                ‚Ä¢   Development is not fenced or walled-off from the surroundings; and
                ‚Ä¢   High level of pedestrian and bicycle orientation, evidenced through design
                    review, is provided.

MIXED USE SITES AND CENTERS
LUL-G     Promote mixed use sites and centers.
LUL-G-1   Develop the following areas as mixed use centers (see General Plan Land Use
          Diagram):
          Community Shopping Centers:
          ‚Ä¢   South of Hearn Avenue, at Dutton Meadow Avenue
          ‚Ä¢   West of Corporate Center Parkway, at Northpoint Parkway
          ‚Ä¢   Piner Road, at Marlow Road
          ‚Ä¢   Petaluma Hill Road, at Yolanda Avenue
LUL-G-2   Require design of mixed use projects to focus residential uses in the upper
          stories or toward the back of parcels, with retail and office activities fronting the
          regional/arterial street.
          Site design with residential uses at the rear is intended to reduce potential for housing
          units to exceed maximum noise levels along a regional/arterial street.
LUL-G-3   Prepare and implement mixed-use zoning district(s) that provide development
          standards for mixed use sites and centers. District regulations should address:
          ‚Ä¢   Minimum density and intensity requirements;
          ‚Ä¢   Allowable uses;
          ‚Ä¢   Building heights;
          ‚Ä¢   Shared parking standards; and
          ‚Ä¢   Prohibition of new auto-oriented
              and drive-through establishments.
LUL-H     Foster development of the South

LUL-H-1         Work with Sonoma County on appropriate zoning for sites in this
                unincorporated stretch of Santa Rosa Avenue that would limit expansion of
                existing single-use, auto-oriented commercial establishments.
LUL-H-2         Require that development and/or redevelopment in this street corridor triggers
                installation of landscaping, medians, trees, sidewalks, and bike and pedestrian
                facilities designed to city standards.
LUL-H-3         The Montecito Center mixed use site shall be developed with a minimum of
                180 residential units. The residential units may be distributed throughout the
                approximately 18-acre site, as determined through the development review
                process.
COMMERCIAL, OFFICE, AND INDUSTRIAL
LUL-I           Maintain vibrant, convenient, and attractive commercial centers.
LUL-I-1         Provide a range of commercial services that are easily accessible and attractive,
                that satisfies the needs of people who live and work in Santa Rosa and that also
                attracts a regional clientele.
LUL-I-2         Encourage region-serving, high volume retail outlets to locate near freeway
                access (generally within one-half mile of Highway 101) to minimize traffic on
                city streets. Do not allow regional-serving uses in residential neighborhoods.
LUL-I-3         Allow neighborhood centers that include small grocery stores, cleaners, and
                similar establishments, where they can be supported, within walking distance of
                residential uses. Ensure that neighborhood centers do not create unacceptable
                traffic or nuisances for residents due to the hours and nature of their operation,
                and are designed to facilitate walking and bicycling.
                Residential developments which are not within walking distance of convenience
                shopping are encouraged to provide small centers envisioned by this policy.
LUL-I-4         Distribute new Community Shopping Centers so that new centers containing a
                large grocery store are located at least one mile away from existing Community
                Shopping Centers.
LUL-I-5         Allow large grocery stores on sites that are not designated as a Community
                Shopping Center provided that it is demonstrated that the proposed large
                grocery store will not impact the viability of similar uses at existing and planned
                Community Shopping Center sites.

DOWNTOWN STATION AREA SPECIFIC PLAN
LUL-L           Ensure land uses that promote use of transit.
LUL-L-1         Establish land use designations and development standards which will result
                in a substantial number of new housing units within walking distance of the
                downtown SMART station site.
LUL-L-2         Improve pedestrian, bicycle, and bus transit connections from surrounding
                areas to the downtown SMART station site as well as between neighborhoods
                surrounding the SMART station site.
 LUL-L-3        Create pedestrian friendly environments and provide convenient connections to
                the transit facility for all modes of transportation.
LUL-M           Ensure new development and streetscape projects provide pedestrian and
                bicycle circulation improvements.
LUL-M-1         Coordinate with SMART to implement the regional pedestrian/bicycle pathway
                along the rail right-of-way.
LUL-M-2         Require dedication of right-of-way for improvement and/or expansion of
                pedestrian and bicycle facilities where insufficient right-of-way currently exists.
LUL-M-3         Within the specific plan area, give priority to pedestrian and bicycle
                improvements in the Railroad Square and Railroad Corridor Sub-Areas to
                promote use of these travel modes by those living or working in closest
                proximity to the station site.

LUL-N-1  Ensure private development provides its fair share of funding for necessary
         improvements to public services and utilities in the plan area.
LUL-N-2  At such time as a citywide Community Facilities District is created and a
         requirement that all new development annex to that district, apply a similar
         requirement in the specific plan area.
LUL-O    Provide recreational and cultural facilities for visitors and residents of the
         specific plan area.
LUL-O-1  Allow park fees paid on new residential units within the specific plan area to be
         used for development and improvement of cultural facilities in the downtown
         area.
NORTHERN DOWNTOWN PEDESTRIAN LINKAGES STUDY
LUL-P    Enhance the Sixth/Seventh Street corridor in the northern downtown area.
LUL-P-1  Work with the adjacent property owners to improve the Sixth/Seventh Street
         corridor between Morgan Street and B Street. Improvement efforts should
         focus on:
         ‚Ä¢   Development of activity-generating land uses along the corridor;
         ‚Ä¢   Installation of roundabouts on A Street;
         ‚Ä¢   Re-alignment of Seventh Street between A and B Streets; and
         ‚Ä¢   Creation of a public plaza area on the north side of Seventh Street between A
             and B Streets.
LUL-P-2  Pursue development of a park and/or amphitheater on the vacant land
         immediately west of the 2007 Sixth Street Playhouse.
LUL-P-3  Develop designs and locational criteria for installation of features that identify
         gateway areas and historic districts within the downtown area.
LUL-P-4  Use techniques such as special lighting, public art, and widened sidewalks to
         make the Sixth Street highway underpass area more attractive and comfortable
         for the pedestrian to use.
LUL-Q    Accommodate all modes of transportation along the Sixth/Seventh Street
         corridor (pedestrian, bicycle, automobile, and bus).
                                                                                            2-25

LUL-Q-1         Install Class II bicycle lanes from Humboldt Street to Davis Street at the time
                the Sixth Street underpass at Highway 101 is opened to vehicular traffic.
LUL-Q-2         Ensure modifications and/or improvements to the public right-of-way between
                Adams Street and B Street are designed to accommodate bus circulation.
LUL-Q-3         Require new development along the south side of West Sixth Street to dedicate
                sufficient right-of-way for installation of angled parking spaces to offset parking
                impacts resulting from the installation of Class II bicycle lanes along the
                corridor.
LUL-Q-4         Allow implementation of alternative approaches for accommodating pedestrian,
                bicycle and vehicle travel where right-of-way constraints exist and/or where
                widening of the right-of-way may compromise historic structures, scale or
                character.
SOUTHWEST AREA PLAN
LUL-R           Establish rational patterns of population densities, transportation, and
                services

                and neighborhood serving facilities which support one another. Regional
                serving uses are not permitted within residential neighborhoods.
LUL-S           Develop an attractive, safe, and extensive network for pedestrian and
                bicyclist movements.
LUL-S-1         Use special pavement treatments to minimize long term maintenance costs, and

                these travel modes by those living and/or working in proximity to
                the SMART station.
LUL-AA-3        Improve connectivity throughout the project area by creating new public or
                private streets that follow a grid pattern and by establishing maximum
                block lengths of no more than 500 feet, where feasible.

          garages developed on the site.
LUL-DD-2  Provide pedestrian amenities, such as lighting, benches and canopy trees, with
          a consistent visual appearance throughout the project area to encourage walking,
          identify pathways, and make the station area a comfortable and easy place to pass
          through or visit.
LUL-EE    Support anticipated level of development intensity in project area with
          adequate infrastructure.
LUL-EE-1  Provide utility upgrades as needed to support increased density and intensity in
          the area.

LUL-FF-1  Ensure that private development provides its fair share of funding for necessary
          improvements to public services and utilities in the Plan Area.
         Please note: Streetscape and design issues are addressed in the Urban Design Element
         (Chapter 3). Policies addressing open space designations are located within the Open
         Space and Conservation Element (Chapter 7). Parks and recreation uses are located
         within the Public Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 6). Flooding is addressed in
         the Noise and Safety Element (Chapter 12).

3                            URBAN DESIGN
  This element addresses the visual quality and character of the built environment
  of Santa Rosa as well as ways of making the city more comfortable and usable for
  residents. An important role of the Urban Design Element is to identify those
  qualities that make Santa Rosa a special place. The major topics addressed by
  urban design policies include downtown, major city entries, neighborhood design,
  and hillside development. ‚ÄúLivable streets,‚Äù which is also an important aspect of
  urban design (design and integration of alternative modes), are addressed in the
  Transportation Element.
  Established in 1973, the Design Review Board is responsible for review of public and
  private development proposals, with an emphasis on the architectural, aesthetic,
  and site planning features of changes to the built environment. The Design
  Review Board uses the Design Guidelines: City of Santa Rosa 2002 to review site and
  building design in commercial and residential projects. Those, together with the
  development standards in the Zoning Code, should be consulted prior to project
  design.
  3-1     VISION
  Santa Rosa‚Äôs downtown is the heart of the city in 2035. The scale of downtown
  relates to the pedestrian through ground-floor commercial uses, wide sidewalks,
  benches, street trees, and trash and recycling bins. Entertainment uses, offices,
  and restaurants provide a vibrant economic base for the downtown, which draws
  residents and visitors both in the daytime and in the evening.
  The city also features safe, livable neighborhoods. Residents are able to walk and
  bike comfortably from their homes to local markets and convenience services.
  Neighborhood parks provide youth and adults with varied recreational options. The
  physical form of a neighborhood ‚Äì the character and pattern of streets, the land use
  pattern, the quality of public spaces, the landscape and natural features, and the
  massing of materials of its built form ‚Äì contributes significantly to its livability and
  long term success as a neighborhood.

URBAN DESIGN
Santa Rosa also features districts that build on their unique natural and historical features to
achieve identity. Newer neighborhoods feature distinct architectural identities, while street
and path connections provide linkages between different areas. New development respects the
city‚Äôs natural setting, located between the Sonoma Mountains and Laguna de Santa Rosa, and
builds on its landscape qualities.
3-2     DOWNTOWN
Downtown Santa Rosa is generally bound by College
Avenue on the north, Brookwood Avenue on the east,
Santa Rosa Creek/Sonoma Avenue on the south,
and the North Western Pacific Rail Road (NWPRR)
tracks on the west. Mixed office and retail uses are
focused within the downtown core, surrounding Old
Courthouse Square, and extending both east and west
along Third and Fourth Streets. Santa Rosa Plaza, an
indoor mall, is located between Old Courthouse Square      Wide sidewalks and other amenities promote
                                                           pedestrian activity along Fourth Street in
and Highway 101. Railroad Square, west of Highway          downtown Santa Rosa.
101, features retail, services, and hotel uses.
3-3     CITY ENTRIES AND CORRIDORS
Major highway and regional/arterial entries into the city are visually strengthened to announce
entry into Santa Rosa. Major corridors connecting various parts of the city to downtown
are also emphasized to clarify the structure of the city and to provide a more pleasing visual
experience while moving through the community. The following list summarizes each of Santa
Rosa‚Äôs city entries:
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Highway 101. The major north-south highway through Santa Rosa, carrying local and
        regional traffic throughout the northern Bay Area. City entries occur at the northern
        (i.e. Old Redwood Highway) and southern (i.e. Santa Rosa Avenue interchange) edges of
        the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB).
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Highway 12. An east-west highway through western Santa Rosa, Highway 12 is also
        known as Sonoma Highway (a regional/arterial street) east of Farmers Lane. City
        entries occur at the UGB in the east (i.e. North Melita Road intersection) and west (i.e.
        Fulton Road).
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Mendocino Avenue/Old Redwood Highway-Fulton Road-Calistoga Road. Regional/arterial
        streets that carry traffic from the northern edge of the UGB into the city. City entries
        occur at the UGB, generally north of Hopper Avenue for Old Redwood Highway and
        Fulton Road.

                                                                  S A N TA R O S A G E N E R A L P L A N
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Guerneville Road-Piner Road-Hall Road/West Third Street. Regional/arterial streets that
         carry regional traffic into Santa Rosa from the west. City entries along these roadways
         occur at the UGB, which is generally located at Fulton Road.
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Santa Rosa Avenue-Stony Point Road-Petaluma Hill Road. Regional/arterial streets that
         mark the southern entries into Santa Rosa. City entries occur at the UGB: Highway 101
         for Santa Rosa Avenue; Bellevue Avenue for Stony Point Road; and Yolanda Avenue for
         Petaluma Hill Road.
    ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Bennett Valley Road. A rural regional/arterial street that carries traffic between Taylor
         and Bennett Mountains into Santa Rosa from the southeast.
3-4      PUBLIC SPACES
Santa Rosa has many fine public open spaces that vary in scale and type, from the formal Old
Courthouse Square, to natural spaces such as the network of creeks and large regional parks.
Policies seek to improve the distribution and variety of public open spaces so that all districts
of the city are well served. Creek corridors will be expanded throughout the city and small
public plazas and gathering places of diverse character created. Policies also promote access to
open spaces by integrating all parks and creek corridors into a citywide network of pedestrian
and bicycle paths.
OLD COURTHOUSE SQUARE
Courthouse Square is the ‚Äútown center‚Äù of Santa Rosa and is the focal point of downtown.
Its landscaped spaces and plaza areas provide for a range of activities, performances, and
entertainment right in the heart of downtown. It attracts business activity and patrons, retail
facilities and shoppers, and performers and audiences. It is a distinctive place that residents
can take pride in identifying as the center of their hometown.
3-5      NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
Santa Rosa‚Äôs diverse neighborhoods offer an array
of housing choices. Historic neighborhoods of Vic-
torian cottages and California bungalows contrast
dramatically with recent large-scale master planned
developments. Some of the most fragile neighborhoods
are the rural enclaves with farmhouses, fields, barns,
and outbuildings. Urban Design policies attempt to
preserve the special character of older neighborhoods
                                                              Narrow tree-lined streets, such as Beaver
while ensuring that new development establishes a             Street, create a distinct neighborhood
sense of neighborhood.                                        environment.
                                                                                                     3-3

URBAN DESIGN
General Plan policies also ensure that neighborhoods are well-connected by streets and
pathways to local shops and services, schools, and cultural and recreational activities. Land use
patterns and development guidelines support local centers and assure their contribution to the
local neighborhood environment. Neighborhood and site design policies promote walkability
and use of the local street as part of the living environment.
3-6     HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
Santa Rosa is framed by the Sonoma Mountain foothills
that are prominently visible from many locations in
the flatland areas of the city. Such views need to be
retained and the natural character of the unbuilt hills
protected by regulating development that might occur
on them. Due to potential visual impacts of hillside
development, General Plan policies seek to preserve
remaining public views.
                                                             Views of Santa Rosa‚Äôs hillsides should be
                                                             preserved.
3-7     GOALS AND POLICIES
IMAGE AND CHARACTER
UD-A           Preserve and enhance Santa Rosa‚Äôs scenic character, including its natural
               waterways, hillsides, and distinctive districts.
UD-A-1         Maintain view corridors to natural ridgelines and landmarks, such as Taylor
               Mountain and Bennett Mountain.
UD-A-2         Strengthen and emphasize community focal points, visual landmarks, and
               features that contribute to the identity of Santa Rosa using design concepts
               and standards implemented through the Zoning Code, Design Guidelines,
               Preservation District Plans, Scenic Roads policies, the Downtown Station Area
               Specific Plan, and the Citywide Creek Master Plan.
               Examples of landmarks and community focal points are Old Courthouse Square, De
               Turk Round Barn, Railroad Square water tower, St. Rose School, Hotel La Rose, Santa
               Rosa Creek, Luther Burbank Home and Gardens, and views to the hills.
UD-A-3         Use changes in tree species, scale, color and spacing to define neighborhoods
               and to differentiate street types. Update the Master Street Tree Planting Plan to
               accomplish this.

        Street trees should relate to scale, function, and visual importance of the street, as well
        as the character of the neighborhood or district in which they are located.
UD-A-4  In new developments, minimize overall grading by limiting site grading to the
        minimum necessary for driveways, parking areas, and understructure areas.
UD-A-5  Require superior site and architectural design of new development projects to
        improve visual quality in the city.
UD-A-6  Review and revise the Master Street Tree Planting Plan to enhance the city‚Äôs
        streets in accordance with the goals and policies in this General Plan.
UD-A-7  Continue the city‚Äôs program of utility undergrounding.
UD-A-8  Maintain hillsides in the city as a scenic
        backdrop to urban development.
UD-A-9  Prohibit development on hillsides and
        ridgelines where structures would
        interrupt the skyline.
UD-A-10 Relate landscape design to the natural
        setting. Require that graded areas within
        new development be revegetated.                    DeTurk Round Barn serves as a distinct
                                                           landmark, representing Santa Rosa‚Äôs history.
UD-A-11 Require structures within new develop-
        ments to step with the slope of the site. Absorb site topography through use of
        split-level designs.
UD-A-12 Promote green building design and low impact development projects.
UD-A-13 Review guidelines for parking lots trees to ensure adequate summertime shading.
DOWNTOWN
UD-B    Preserve and strengthen downtown as a vital and attractive place.
UD-B-1  Maintain and enhance downtown‚Äôs position as the main civic, entertainment,
        commercial, and office hub of Santa Rosa and the region.
                                                                                                     3-5

URBAN DESIGN
UD-B-2    Encourage, promote, and assist in the
          development of housing units within
          downtown for a mix of income levels
          and housing types, including integrating
          housing into existing buildings as mixed
          use.
UD-B-3    Maintain Old Courthouse Square as
          the major downtown focal point and
          gathering place by not creating other
          large new public spaces that would Sidewalk caf√©s within downtown enhance the
          detract from it, and by programming it pedestrian environment.
          with public activities throughout the year.
UD-B-4    Respect and relate the scale and character of development at the edges of
          downtown to the surrounding Preservation Districts.
UD-B-5    Promote street life in the downtown through attractive building designs with
          street level activity and fa√ßade windows, public art, trees, fountains, and other
          landscaping elements that are pedestrian friendly. Discourage blank parking
          garage or office block frontage. Implement this policy through development
          review and the city‚Äôs Capital Improvement and Downtown Programs.
UD-B-6    Require design review for all new structures and alterations to existing structures
          within downtown.
UD-B-7    Strengthen and enhance transportation linkages in downtown, particularly the
          Fourth Street link reestablishing the connection between Old Courthouse Square
          and Railroad Square.
UD-B-8    Orient buildings along Santa Rosa Creek within downtown toward the creek to
          enhance pedestrian and bicycle activity.
UD-B-9    Seek opportunities to develop small public spaces throughout downtown that
          will provide for the comfort of pedestrians, enhance street life, and provide
          protection from sun and rain.
          Small left over spaces between buildings, at street corners, at the edges of parking lots,
          or along the edges of sidewalks can become attractive and lively additions to the street
          scene.

CITY ENTRIES AND CORRIDORS
UD-C       Enhance and strengthen the visual quality of major entry routes into the
           city, as well as major corridors that link neighborhoods with downtown.
UD-C-1     Enhance the appearance of the city‚Äôs major entries through special design criteria
           and streetscape improvements. City entries, which occur at the Urban Growth
           Boundary, are shown in Figure 3-1: City Entries and Corridors:
           ‚Ä¢   Highway 101;
           ‚Ä¢   Highway 12;
           ‚Ä¢   Mendocino Avenue/Old Redwood Highway;

           ‚Ä¢   Stony Point Road;
           ‚Ä¢   Petaluma Hill Road; and
           ‚Ä¢   Bennett Valley Road.
           Major corridors can be improved as entries to the city through unified planting of
           street trees, appropriately scaled lighting, public art, framing of landmarks, sign
           controls, and pedestrian and bicycle amenities. Additional policy recommendations
           include:
           ‚Ä¢   Landscaping to provide continuity, focal elements, and to screen unsightly
               development;
           ‚Ä¢   Clear expression of the community separators as natural open space at the north,
               south, west, and east entries; and
           ‚Ä¢   Framing of key views of downtown and landmarks along the routes.
UD-C-2     Pursue permanent preservation of Community Separator open space areas
           adjacent to city entries, as shown on Figure 7-1: Open Space and Community
           Separators.
                                                                                                    3-7

URBAN DESIGN
UD-C-3    Screen views of development from Highway 101, south of Hearn Avenue, with
          dense landscape treatments, allowing only glimpses or short breaks to points
          of interest. North of Hearn Avenue along Highway 101, allow openings in the
          buffer to views of downtown.
UD-C-4    Work with CalTrans to beautify
          Highway 101 and Highway 12.
          Encourage CalTrans to incorporate
          more landscaping, planting of trees,
          and soundwall mitigation into any im-
          provements planned for these highways.
          Lessen the impact of new soundwalls
          through the use of vegetation.
          Specific to Highway 12 (west of Highway
                                                         Fulton Road, which serves as a major city entry

UD-C-5    Work with the County of Sonoma to retain and improve the scenic qualities of
          Highway 101 and Highway 12, including the planting of trees in the back of
          developments and along the edge of the CalTrans rights-of-way.
UD-C-6    Require that buildings, sound walls, and other structures highly visible from
          Highway 101 or Highway 12 and adjoining neighborhoods be designed to
          enhance and improve scenic character.
UD-C-7    Install planted medians on wide regional/arterial streets to make them more
          pedestrian friendly. Regional/arterial streets requiring landscaped medians
          include:
          ‚Ä¢   Corporate Center Parkway;
          ‚Ä¢   Fulton Road;

       Residential, office, or institutional uses that generate less traffic should be
       located between the nodes.
UD-D-2 Maintain a uniform setback of structures from the street. Require parking areas
       to be placed to the side or rear of structures, not in front.
UD-D-3 Minimize curb cuts through shared access and width reduction.
       Excessive curb cuts reduce or completely eliminate pedestrian space and the possibility
       of curbside parking.
UD-D-4 Provide continuous sidewalks and bicycle lanes on both sides of major regional/

URBAN DESIGN
PUBLIC SPACES
UD-E      Create a framework of public spaces at
          the neighborhood, city, and regional
          scale.
UD-E-1    Provide for new open space opportunities
          throughout the city, especially in
          neighborhoods that have less access to
          open spaces.

          corridors, bicycle and pedestrian ways, as
          well as new public plazas, gathering places, and conservation areas.
UD-E-2    Provide an open space network that is linked by pedestrian and bicycle paths,
          and that preserves and enhances Santa Rosa‚Äôs significant visual and natural
          resources.
UD-E-3    Restore Santa Rosa Creek as a linear park throughout the city for pedestrians
          and cyclists.
UD-E-4    Enhance pedestrian activity and safety by designing streets, buildings, pathways,
          and trails to provide a visual connection with public spaces such as parks
          and Santa Rosa Creek. Review and revise the Zoning Code and Subdivision
          Guidelines to support this policy.
NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN
UD-F      Maintain and enhance the diverse character of Santa Rosa‚Äôs neighborhoods.
          Promote the creation of neighborhoods ‚Äì not subdivisions ‚Äì in areas of new
          development.
UD-F-1    Encourage the sensitive rehabilitation of older structures in neighborhoods to
          preserve the city‚Äôs history, improve energy efficiency with consideration to the
          principles of life cycle costs, and to allow for diversity of architectural styles.
UD-F-2    Protect natural topographic features such as hillsides, ridgelines and mature trees
          and stands of trees. Minimize grading of natural contours in new development.
UD-F-3    Encourage creative subdivision design that avoids walling off neighborhoods
          abutting regional/arterial streets with long monotonous stretches of fencing or
          walls.

       Streets along edges of new residential neighborhoods should have active fronting uses
       such as multifamily housing, local commercial uses, institutional uses, or parks.
UD-F-4 Provide visual interest in building, site, and landscape design that avoids the
       sense of a monotonous tract development.
       Visual interest can be created in many
       ways: varied massing and roof types,
       floor plans, detailed planting design, or
       color and materials. Overall harmony
       should be maintained while providing
       smaller scale variety.
UD-G   Design residential neighborhoods

                                                    showcase natural amenities.
UD-G-1 Establish a defined center ‚Äì such as
       a park, school, neighborhood shopping center, or a transit stop ‚Äì at the core of
       large residential projects.
UD-G-2 Locate higher density residential uses adjacent to transit facilities, shopping, and
       employment centers, and link these areas with bicycle and pedestrian paths.
UD-G-3 Design new residential streets to be in scale with the adjacent structures and
       uses, and appropriate to their intended purpose. Neighborhood streets should
       be scaled for slow moving traffic, pedestrian and bicycle access, and children‚Äôs
       play.
       Pedestrian and bicyclist needs should receive as much design attention as the
       automobile. Residential neighborhoods that have been successful for decades such as
       the ‚Äústreetcar suburbs‚Äù of many cities typically have streets that are relatively narrow
       and are no wider than needed for the type of use.
UD-G-4 Provide through-connections for pedestrians and bicyclists in new developments.
       Avoid cul-de-sac streets, unless public pedestrian/bikeways interconnect them.
UD-G-5 To promote walkability and connectivity, limit the perimeter length of new
       residential blocks to no more than 1,600 feet. Very Low Density Residential
       development is excepted.
                                                                                              3-13

URBAN DESIGN
UD-G-6     To promote social interaction, houses
           in new developments should contain
           porches, front gardens, and windows
           overlooking front yards and sidewalks.
UD-G-7     Ensure that garages do not dominate
           streetscapes by setting them back from
           the front of houses, locating them at the
           rear of the site, accessed by an alleyway,
           or clustering them on shared driveways.
                                                            Residential uses along Brown Street provide

           design, particularly in multifamily
           development, by locating windows and walkways to assure visual access to
           common areas. Locate children‚Äôs play space within view of the nearest units, and
           discourage designs with unutilized open space.
UD-G-9     Encourage pedestrian-oriented village character, rather than strip malls, in
           neighborhood centers for local shops and services. Shops should front on streets
           rather than parking lots. Parking areas should be located in less visible locations
           behind buildings and away from the street edge.
HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
UD-H       Design hillside development to be sensitive to existing terrain, views, and
           significant natural landforms or features.
UD-H-1     Minimize the visual prominence of hillside development by taking advantage
           of existing site features for screening, such as tree clusters, depressions in
           topography, setback hillside plateau areas, and other natural features.
UD-H-2     Align and construct streets along natural grades. Minimize visibility of streets
           from other areas within the city.
UD-H-3     Prohibit grading of slopes that are greater than 25 percent. During review of
           development plans, ensure that necessary grading respects significant natural
           features and visually blends with adjacent properties.
           Extensive grading of hillsides has the potential to destroy their irregular character and
           increase risk of geologic and landslide hazards. Encourage developers to grade only
           building pads, and to blend the graded area with adjacent hillside properties.

UD-H-4 Avoid large areas of flat pads in hillside areas. Instead, building forms should be
       ‚Äústepped‚Äù to conform to site topography.
UD-H-5 Allow creative lot layouts such as clustering, flexible setbacks, or flag lots if such
       approaches help to preserve contours and other natural features.
UD-H-6 Minimize vegetation removal in hillside areas, and preserve large trees that
       partially screen development or help blend new development into views.
UD-I   Respect natural features in the design and construction of hillside
       development.
UD-I-1 Require mapping of all natural features as part of development applications,
       including landforms, mature tree stands, rock outcroppings, creek ways, and
       ridgelines. During development review, ensure that site layout is sensitive to
       such mapped features.
UD-I-2 Encourage architectural design that reflects the undulating forms of the hillside
       setting, such as breaking building masses and rooflines into several smaller
       components.
UD-I-3 Reflect the predominant colors and
       textures within the surrounding landscape
       in selection of building materials for
       hillside development. Roof colors should
       tend toward earth tones, so that they
       are less visible from adjacent or upslope
       properties. Allow darker roofs when they
       meet cool roof standards.
UD-I-4 Use irregular planting on graded slopes to Allow creative lot layouts, such as flexible

This element presents a summary of the demographic and housing characteristics of Santa Rosa,
an overview of available resources and potential constraints to housing development, a review of
housing accomplishments (housing programs implemented since the adoption of the last Housing
Element), and housing goals and policies for the current planning period (2015 to 2023).
This Housing Element is primarily a technical update to the 2009 Housing Element, which was
prepared as part of a focused update to the General Plan. This Housing Element is internally
consistent with the rest of the plan, and any amendment proposed to the General Plan during the
Housing Element period will be reviewed to ensure it does not compromise the plan‚Äôs internal
consistency.

HOUSING
4-2             HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSIS
This section evaluates existing and future housing needs in Santa Rosa, including special
housing needs that exist for segments of the city‚Äôs population. The purpose of this assessment is
to evaluate demographic and housing trends to provide general direction and focus for future
housing initiatives.
POPULATION
The City of Santa Rosa experienced population growth from 2000 to 2010. As illustrated in
Table 4-1, the city‚Äôs population grew from 147,595 in 2000 to 167,815 in 2010, an increase of
approximately 14 percent. This represents an annual average growth rate of approximately 1
percent over the decade. By comparison, the City of Petaluma, the Town of Windsor, and
Sonoma County grew 6, 18, and 6 percent, respectively, between 2000 and 2010, according to
the US Census. The population of the nearby City of Rohnert Park decreased approximately 3
percent for the same period. The California Department of Finance estimated Santa Rosa‚Äôs 2013
population at 170,093.
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects that the Santa Rosa population will
continue to grow through 2040, although at a slower pace than in previous decades, as shown in
Table 4-2. The ABAG projections, prepared in 2013, call for population increases of 10 percent
for the next three decades, bringing the city‚Äôs population to 221,800 by 2040.

As shown in Table 4-1, the age makeup of the Santa Rosa population generally remained stable
from 2000 to 2010. The median age increased slightly from 36.2 to 36.7. The median age in
Sonoma County increased from 37.5 to 39.9 for the same period. Approximately 54 percent of
Santa Rosans were between the ages of 25 and 64 in 2010, an increase from 52 percent in 2000.
Children and youth up to 24 years of age constituted 33 percent of Santa Rosa‚Äôs population,
while seniors age 65 and greater made up 14 percent of the population.
The racial diversity of Santa Rosa‚Äôs population is representative of the wider Sonoma County
population. According to the 2010 Census, 71 percent of Santa Rosans were White, 5 percent
were Asian or Pacific Islander, 5 percent were two or more races, 2 percent were Black or
African American, and 2 percent were American Indian or Alaska Native. Additionally, 29
percent of Santa Rosa‚Äôs population was Hispanic or Latino.
Households
Table 4-3 illustrates household growth trends and projections from 2000 to 2040. The number of
households increased approximately 13 percent from 2000 to 2010 and is expected to grow
steadily by just under 10 percent per decade through 2040. The average household size increased
during the decade from 2.56 to 2.59 persons per household. ABAG projects a continued increase
in household size through 2040, when the average is expected to be 2.69 persons per household.
The increase may be attributed to an increase in the number of children or additional
multigenerational households.

According to the 2007‚Äì2011 American Community Survey (ACS), the largest percentage of
households in Santa Rosa were families, approximately 62 percent. Among family households, a
little over half were families with children. For purposes of the US Census and ACS, a family is
defined as a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption residing
together. As shown in Table 4-4, approximately 29 percent of households were single persons
who lived alone and the remaining 9 percent were multi-person non-family households.

Table 4-5 shows the rate of homeownership in Santa Rosa (referred to as housing tenure).
According to the 2010 Census, approximately 54 percent of households were homeowners, while
46 percent rented their homes. While the number of homeowner households increased from 2000
to 2010, the percentage of Santa Rosa households that own their home decreased from 59 to 54
percent. The number of renter households increased to a greater rate, approximately 25 percent.
This increase in renter households has contributed to low rental vacancy rates and increased
rental prices in the city. Refer to the Income and Housing Costs subsection for further discussion
and analysis regarding rental availability and affordability in Santa Rosa.

 EMPLOYMENT
 ABAG estimated that Santa Rosa had 75,460 jobs in 2010. The city continues to be the
 employment center for Sonoma County and ranks first among all North Bay cities in the total
 number of jobs. As the seat of Sonoma County government and a center of commerce, Santa Rosa
 will continue to be the hub of medical, government, banking, and other services for the county.
 Table 4-6 illustrates the employed residents by industry in Santa Rosa according to the 2000
 Census and 2007‚Äì2011 ACS (this information was not collected in the 2010 Census). While
 some changes from 2000 to 2011 may be attributable to the change in data sources (the ACS has
 a high margin of error), data shows growth in several industries including agriculture, forestry,
 fishing and hunting, and arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services.
 There were reductions in the number of Santa Rosa residents employed in the transportation and
 warehousing and utilities industry and the manufacturing industry. Major employers in Santa
 Rosa include Agilent Technologies, Amy‚Äôs Kitchen, the City of Santa Rosa, the County of
 Sonoma, Kaiser Permanente, Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa City Schools, Santa Rosa
 Junior College, St. Joseph Health System, and Sutter Medical Center (according to the North
 Bay Business Journal Book of Lists 2009 via the City of Santa Rosa Economic Profile).

 Employment trends indicate a need for a range of housing types to support Santa Rosa residents
 who are employed in a wide range of industries. A particular need for moderate- and lower-
 income housing units exists to support workers in retail and manufacturing trades since these
 jobs often do not provide the income needed to acquire safe and adequate housing.

Table 4-7 shows job and employment projections for Santa Rosa through 2040. Projections
indicate that Santa Rosa will add 28,480 jobs between 2010 and 2040. This is a significant
increase given that economic growth has been tempered over the last few years by the
nationwide economic downturn that began in 2007.

Jobs/Employed Residents Ratio
The jobs/employed residents ratio compares the number of jobs available in the city to the total
number of employed residents. As shown in Table 4-7, Santa Rosa has more jobs than employed
residents and experiences net in-commuting. Projections indicate that this will not change over the
next three decades. Santa Rosa‚Äôs jobs/employed residents ratio is projected to be 1.07 in 2040.
INCOME AND HOUSING COSTS
According to the 2007‚Äì2011 ACS, the median household income in Santa Rosa was $60,850.
While this is a numeric increase from the 2000 median of $50,931 (US Census), when the 2000
median is adjusted to 2011 dollars to account for inflation, resulting in an adjusted median of
$68,757, the median was actually less in 2011 than in 2000.
Table 4-8 shows the number and percentage of Santa Rosa households by annual income. Please
note that 2000 figures in this table have not been adjusted to account for inflation. In both 2000
and 2011, approximately 29 percent of households had an annual income of $75,000 or more.
The percentage of households earning $100,000 or more increased from 16 percent to 25 percent.
The percentage of households earning less than $50,000 decreased from approximately 48
percent in 2000 to 41 percent in 2011.
In 2000, the poverty rate in Santa Rosa was approximately 9 percent. The poverty rate increased
to 13 percent in 2011. The poverty rate in Santa Rosa is slightly higher than that of Sonoma
County as a whole, which had poverty rates of approximately 8 percent in 2000 and 11 percent
in 2011.

Housing Affordability
Household incomes have not kept pace with the escalating costs of housing. Federal regulations
and guidelines define the maximum annual amount that each household can feasibly spend on
housing costs (e.g., mortgage, rent, utilities) as 30 percent of gross household annual income.
The income categories, as defined by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development for a four-person household pursuant to the Health and Safety Code, are as
follows:
ÔÇ∑   Extremely low ‚Äì households with income less than 30 percent of the county‚Äôs area median
    income
ÔÇ∑   Very low ‚Äì households with income between 30 and 50 percent of the county‚Äôs area median
    income
ÔÇ∑   Low ‚Äì households with income between 51 and 80 percent of the county‚Äôs area median
    income
ÔÇ∑   Moderate ‚Äì households with income between 81 and 120 percent of the county‚Äôs area median
    income
ÔÇ∑   Above moderate ‚Äì households with income above 120 percent of the county‚Äôs area median
    income
Table 4-9 provides an estimate of the number and percentage of Santa Rosa households
according to these income categories. Note that data is not provided specifically for the
extremely low-income category in this set. For analysis of households in this income category,
please see the Extremely Low-Income Households subsection below. In this analysis, households
at the extremely low-income level are included in the very low-income figures. Among all
households, approximately 25 percent were considered very low income, 18 percent low income,
20 percent moderate income, and 37 percent above moderate income. The difference between the

percentage of households in the various income categories is most pronounced in the very low-
income and above moderate-income categories. Significantly more renters have incomes that are
considered very low, and significantly more homeowner households have incomes in the above
moderate category.

Using the affordability benchmark of spending no more than 30 percent of household income on
housing costs, Table 4-10 shows the maximum affordable monthly rent and maximum home
purchase price by income category for Sonoma County. According to the California Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the median household income in Sonoma
County for a family of four was $82,600 in 2013. The maximum affordable monthly rent for a
moderate-income household is $2,065. Low-income households, earning between $41,301 and
$65,000 annually, can afford to spend up to $1,625 per month for housing.

Table 4-11 illustrates these households by tenure. The majority, approximately 74 percent of
extremely-low income households, were renters. Extremely low-income renter households
represented approximately 10 percent of the total household population, and extremely low-
income homeowner households made up approximately 3 percent of all Santa Rosa households.
Extremely low-income households often have a variety of housing issues and needs. For
example, most families and individuals receiving public assistance, such as social security
insurance or disability insurance, are considered extremely low-income households. Many
minimum wage workers would also be considered extremely low-income households. As shown
in Table 4-11, many extremely low-income households pay a large percentage of their income
toward housing costs. Approximately 77 percent of extremely low-income households overpaid
for housing (paying more than 30 percent of their total income toward housing costs) and
approximately 71 percent severely overpaid (paying more than 50 percent of their total income
toward housing costs).
The City has a single-room occupancy ordinance, the implementation of which would provide
housing opportunities for residents with extremely low incomes. The Zoning Code also includes
provisions for boardinghouses, an option for lower-income households. Transitional or
supportive housing with services can assist extremely low-income residents with special needs.
                                                                                                                       4-9

HOUSING
The City has made significant efforts in
addressing the need for housing for residents
with extremely low incomes in supported new
developments, having helped subsidize the
development of approximately 131 units from
2007 to 2012. Policies H-C-8 and H-C-12
commit the City to continuing to support and
fund the development of units affordable to
extremely low-income households. In
addition, the City will continue to encourage      Attached single-family housing can provide a more affordable

Housing Costs
According to DataQuick (www.DQNews.com), the median home sales price in Santa Rosa was
$366,500 in 2013. As shown in Chart 4-1, median home prices in Santa Rosa followed
countywide trends, decreasing from 2010 to 2011, increasing from 2011 to 2012, and rising
dramatically from 2012 to 2013. The Santa Rosa median sales price increased approximately 24
percent from 2012 to 2013. The countywide median increased approximately 23 percent for the
same period, and the cities of Sebastopol, Rohnert Park, and Petaluma saw increases of 26, 31,
and 20 percent, respectively. The rise in sales prices is a result of growing demand based on
consumer confidence and the improving economy, historically low interest rates, a low vacancy
rate, and a limited supply of new housing on the market. While there has been an uptick in
building permit activity in the city, market conditions in the short term may continue to result in
increasing sales prices.
The median sales price in Santa Rosa varied greatly by area (reported by zip code), with 2013
medians ranging from $290,000 in southwest Santa Rosa (95407) to $440,000 in the northeast
area of the city (95404). Based on the 2013 median income, only households in the above
moderate-income category, making more than $99,100 annually, could afford a home at the
citywide median price in Santa Rosa (assuming no more than 30 percent of monthly income is
spent on housing). Additional income is needed for homeowner costs such as utilities and
maintenance. A moderate-income household could afford a median-priced home in some areas
of the city; however, securing a down payment may be difficult. Financing may also be difficult
given the tightening of the lending market with the economic downturn which began in 2007.

According to the fall 2013 Sonoma County Rental Survey conducted by Cassidy Turley North
Bay, Santa Rosa offers a wide range of rental opportunities and prices. Studio apartments
average $803 per month, one-bedroom units average $1,038 per month, two-bedroom one-bath
units average $1,200 per month, two-bedroom two-bath units average $1,682 per month, and
three-bedroom two-bath units average $1,795 per month. A review of rental advertisements on
Craigslist in October 2013 found one-bedroom units ranging from $875 to $2,012 per month,
two-bedroom units ranging from $975 to $2,700 per month, and three-bedroom units ranging
from $1,350 to $3,800 per month. Santa Rosa‚Äôs rental rates are generally consistent with or
lower than comparable rental units located in other communities in Sonoma County.
Based on these rents, some affordable options may be available for very low- and low-income
renters, and the rental market is generally affordable for households earning moderate incomes.
However, lower-income families may be limited to smaller units that result in overcrowded
living conditions.
At public outreach events, in direct correspondence with the City, and through an online survey
(refer to the Public Participation section for more information on the survey), members of the
Santa Rosa community cited difficulties in finding affordable housing in the current market,
particularly rental housing. They expressed concerns that working families are being forced out
of the city. Organizations that assist persons with special needs are unable to locate affordable
rental opportunities for their clients in this market. As described in the constraints analysis, the
City is offering deferred payment of development fees in an attempt to spark new housing starts.
Additionally, the City has committed to Policies H-A-1 and H-A-2 to ensure that adequate sites
are available for housing at a wide range of densities.
                                                                                                 4-11

HOUSING
Overpayment
Overpayment is defined as paying more than 30 percent of monthly household income for
housing costs. Severe overpayment is defined as paying more than 50 percent of monthly
household income for housing costs. CHAS (based on 2006‚Äì2010 ACS data) estimated that
28,140 Santa Rosa households, or 45 percent of all households, overpaid for housing. The
percentage of overpaying households was split almost equally between homeowners (51 percent
of overpaying households) and renters (49 percent).
Table 4-12 illustrates households paying 30 to 50 percent and more than 50 percent of monthly
household income for housing. Lower-income renter households pay a greater percentage of
monthly income for housing, while higher-income owner-occupied households are more cost
burdened than lower-income owner-occupied households. Among renters, the percentage of
households overpaying for housing generally increases as household incomes decrease.
Approximately 88 percent of renter households overpaying for housing had incomes in the very
low- and low-income categories. Among owner-occupied households, more moderate- and above
moderate-income households overpaid for housing, approximately 55 percent. However, a larger
share of owner-occupied households that severely overpaid for housing were very low- and low-
income households.

LOCAL HOUSING SUPPLY
Santa Rosa‚Äôs housing supply increased by approximately 18 percent (more than 10,000 units)
from 2000 to 2013, according to the US Census and the California Department of Finance. As
discussed in the households analysis and shown in Table 4-5, the percentage of owner-occupied
units decreased over the decade, from 59 percent in 2000 to 54 percent in 2010. Santa Rosa‚Äôs
overall housing vacancy rate was 5.6 percent in 2013, according to the California Department of
Finance.

Age and Condition
While the majority of Santa Rosa‚Äôs housing units were built since 1970, nearly 21,000, or 31
percent, were built in 1969 or before. Over 7,500 units (11 percent of Santa Rosa‚Äôs housing
stock) were built prior to 1950. Older units are generally in greater need of repair than newer
housing stock. Additionally, many of these units could benefit from energy efficiency
improvements to reduce energy usage and related greenhouse gas emissions.
Another measure of substandard housing conditions is the presence of kitchen and plumbing
facilities. The 2007‚Äì2011 ACS estimated that 969 of Santa Rosa‚Äôs dwelling units lack complete
plumbing facilities and 1,168 lack complete kitchen facilities. These numbers represent
approximately 1 and 2 percent, respectively, of Santa Rosa‚Äôs total housing stock.
The City inspects approximately 2,000 units per year as part of the City‚Äôs Neighborhood
Revitalization Program. Among units inspected, approximately 20 percent are in need of
rehabilitation and, among those, 1 to 2 percent are severely deteriorated.
Policy H-B-1 directs the City to continue efforts to improve living conditions and quality of life
in deteriorating neighborhoods though the Neighborhood Revitalization Program and the
Housing Quality Standard Code Compliance Program of the Section 8 Rental Assistance
Program. Through the Neighborhood Revitalization Program, units in need of improvements are
assisted through correction of code enforcement issues and rehabilitation loans. More
information on the Neighborhood Revitalization Program is provided in the Affordable Housing
Programs section of this element.
Unit Type
Table 4-13 shows the distribution of housing units by type of structure in Santa Rosa in 2000 and
2013. In both 2000 and 2013, a majority of all housing units were single-family detached
structures (approximately 69 percent). Single-family attached structures constituted 9 percent of
the housing stock. As of 2013, multifamily structures (two or more units per structure) made up
27 percent of Santa Rosa‚Äôs housing units. Approximately 4 percent of the housing units in Santa
Rosa were mobile homes, RVs, or other housing types.

HOUSING
Overcrowding
Overcrowding reflects the inability of families to afford homes that are large enough to
accommodate the size of their household. Overcrowding is defined as more than one person per
room, while severe overcrowding is defined as more than 1.5 persons per room. According to the
2006‚Äì2010 American Community Survey, approximately 4 percent of Santa Rosa housing units
were overcrowded. As shown in Table 4-14, while the number of overcrowded units increased
from 2000 to 2010, the percentage of the housing stock remained steady. Approximately 1
percent of housing units were severely overcrowded, down from an estimated 4 percent in 2000.
Overcrowding is most common among renter households. Approximately 78 percent of
households in overcrowded units were renters and 76 percent of households in severely
overcrowded households were renters.

The City recognizes that lower-income large families need rentals with a greater number of
bedrooms. The City assisted with the development of 126 affordable units with three or more
bedrooms in four affordable family projects during the 2007 to 2014 planning period.
Vacancy Rates
The 2010 US Census estimated that approximately 6 percent of Santa Rosa housing units were
vacant in 2010. Of these vacant units, many were for rent or for sale (60 percent), used as a
vacation or seasonal home (11 percent), or classified as ‚Äúother vacant‚Äù (21 percent).

January 2013 data from the California Department of Finance showed Santa Rosa‚Äôs vacancy rate
at 5.6 percent for all unit types. According to Cassidy Turley North Bay‚Äôs Sonoma County
Apartment Market Rent Survey, Santa Rosa‚Äôs multifamily vacancy rate was 1.3 percent in fall
2013. A lower vacancy rate indicates high demand with a limited supply and can result in
increased rent and sales prices.
SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
To provide adequate housing for all people, the City must consider the housing needs of disabled
persons, developmentally disabled persons, female-headed households, large families, elderly
persons, the homeless, and farmworkers. The shelter requirements for these special needs groups
may point to the need for accessible, larger or smaller, secure, and/or affordable housing. High
housing costs and low vacancy rates (as described in the Housing Costs subsection) are
especially problematic for those with special needs. Members of the Santa Rosa community,
including housing and service providers, cited numerous examples in which persons with
unusual or special circumstances were passed over by landlords and property managers in
applying for rental housing in favor of those with more traditional income sources, credit
histories, and references/rental histories.
Persons with Disabilities
Disabilities vary in type and severity and can have a significant impact on a household‚Äôs housing
needs and ability to pay for appropriate housing. Persons with disabilities may have difficulty
caring for themselves, going outside the home, or working. Disabilities can be permanent, such
as blindness, or may be temporary due to injury or illness.
The ACS surveys the following disability types (definitions from ACS):

Many disabled persons in Santa Rosa live in community care facilities or group homes, occupied
by a small number of residents who live together and receive care from a live-in caretaker.
Group homes are designed to accommodate a particular group such as the elderly, mentally ill,
physically disabled persons, or alcohol- or drug-addicted persons. Room and board may include
assistance with the activities of daily living, nursing services, and/or counseling, depending on
the general nature of the residence.
Policies H-D-1 through H-D-4 describe efforts the City will take to address the housing needs of
persons and households with disabilities. The City will continue to provide funding and support
for developments and services that serve disabled households (Policy H-D-1), evaluate issues of
‚Äúvisitability‚Äù (Policy H-D-3), and consider the incorporation of universal design features in
residential design (Policy H-D-4).

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires that the City include an analysis of the special housing needs of
persons with a developmental disability within the community. According to Section 4512 of the
Welfare and Institutions Code, ‚Äúdevelopmental disability‚Äù means a disability that originates
before an individual attains age 18 years, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely,
and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual, which includes mental retardation,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be
closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for
individuals with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are
solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person‚Äôs living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The North Bay Regional Center (NBRC) is one of 21 regional
centers in California that provide a point of entry to services for people with developmental
disabilities. The NBRC has a field office in Santa Rosa, which provides services to all of
Sonoma County. The center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with local
businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and
their families.
According to the NBRC, in 2013, the Santa Rosa field office served 1,685 developmentally
disabled residents in the City of Santa Rosa. Table 4-17 provides an estimate of the number of
developmentally disabled residents by age and zip code in Santa Rosa (includes only those
served by the NBRC). Approximately 52 percent of NBRC clients are aged 22 years or younger.

A variety of housing types are appropriate for people living with a developmental disability:
rent-subsidized homes, supportive homes, Section 8 vouchers, homes purchased through
assistance programs, HUD housing, and community care facilities. The design of housing-
accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group
living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving
this special needs group. Special consideration should be given to the affordability of housing, as
people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income. Incorporating barrier-free design in all
new multifamily housing (as required by California and federal fair housing laws) is especially
important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents.
To improve access to housing for those with developmental disabilities, this Housing Element
includes Policies H-D-3 and H-D-4, which direct the City to evaluate and address issues of
‚Äúvisitability‚Äù and universal design in residential building design. As stated in Policies H-C-4 and
H-D-1, the City will support and fund (when funds are available) services and developments
targeted for developmentally disabled persons and households.
While the NBRC and its service partners typically promote and work toward a scattered-site
housing model in which persons with developmental disabilities reside in housing units that are
incorporated into the community, group facilities remain an option for some clients with more
severe medical needs. Sonoma County is home to the Sonoma Developmental Center, one of
four remaining large group care facilities in California. The center is home to over 400 persons
with developmental disabilities.
While plans and a specific time frame have not yet been finalized, the State is slated to close the
Sonoma Developmental Center. The closure will result in a need for new housing sites for center
residents. Policy H-D-13 directs the City to monitor the potential closing of the Sonoma
Developmental Center and work with the NBRC, relevant agencies, other local jurisdictions, and
housing and service providers to provide support and assistance, as appropriate.

Female-Headed Households
According to the 2010 US Census, approximately 20 percent of Santa Rosa families were headed
by female householders, up slightly from 18 percent in 2000. Table 4-18 illustrates that the
percentage of female-headed households with children has remained relatively stable since 2000.
Female-headed households are considered a special needs group because of the higher incidence
of poverty in these households compared with that in all families.
This is evidenced by the large percentage of female-headed households in poverty in Santa Rosa.
According to the 2007‚Äì2011 ACS, approximately 23 percent of female-headed households were
below the poverty level and 26 percent of female-headed households with children under 18
were living below the poverty level.
Homeownership is unlikely for most female-headed households, especially those in poverty.
Female-headed households are likely to seek housing affordable to lower-income households,
particularly affordable rental units. Access to transit, schools, child care, parks, and daily
services is important for these families. At public outreach events, representatives of local
service organizations noted that young single mothers and young women coming out of the
foster system experience particular difficulties in finding appropriate and affordable housing in
the city.
To support housing opportunities for these households, the City will encourage the provision of
affordable housing for former foster youth and young mothers (Policy H-D-12), continue
existing programs for persons with special needs, including single-parent households (Policy
H-D-1), encourage new affordable housing developments to include amenities such as day care
and after-school care (Policy H-C-15), and promote higher-density development in sites located
near transit and services (Policy H-C-6).

Large Families
Large family households, or those with five or more persons, made up 11 percent of all Santa
Rosa families in 2012. Of these households, 44 percent lived in owner-occupied units, while 56
percent lived in renter-occupied units. By comparison, 55 percent of smaller households owned
their homes. Table 4-19 provides more detail and offers a comparison to 2000. According to the
2012 American Community Survey, 4 percent of households were large and were considered
extremely low, very low, or low income.
Finding rental housing with a higher than average number of bedrooms is a typical problem for
large families, particularly those with lower income levels. In Santa Rosa, fewer than 4 percent
of rental units had four or more bedrooms. Census data does not differentiate whether these units
are multifamily or single-family units. Approximately 23 percent of owner-occupied units had
four or more bedrooms. While there are more large units available than large households, not all
large households live in such units. Larger units are more expensive to buy or rent; therefore,
some larger family households, particularly those of lower incomes, live in overcrowded housing
situations. To address this issue, Policy H-C-13 directs the City to encourage the development of
units with three or more bedrooms in affordable housing projects.

Elderly
According to the 2010 US Census, 14 percent of Santa Rosa‚Äôs population was age 65 or older,
which is unchanged from the percentage in 2000. Seniors often live on a limited fixed income
and suffer disproportionately from poverty. Seniors may also have special needs relating to
accessibility.
As shown in Table 4-20, the 2012 American Community Survey estimated that approximately
23 percent of all households in Santa Rosa were headed by a senior. Seventy-three percent of
these senior households owned homes and 27 percent rented. In comparison, a much greater
proportion of non-senior households rented their homes. However, low-income, fixed-income
seniors are severely affected by the shortage of affordable rentals, both subsidized and open

by steep increases in mobile home lot rents.
In 2010, there were 9,040 households with
one or more persons over the age of 62
considered to be extremely low, very low, or

constituted 32 percent of all households

There are over 1,000 units in affordable senior complexes in Santa Rosa. Many of Santa Rosa‚Äôs
senior housing units are in mobile home parks, which are protected by the Mobilehome Rent
Control Program.
The Council on Aging, a local nonprofit, provides services to support the independence and
well-being of older residents. It provides services such as financial counselors, meals on wheels,
legal assistance, and senior day activities, among others. The City of Santa Rosa offers classes
and daily events at the Bennett Valley Senior Center and the recently completed Person Senior
Wing of the Finley Community Center (opened in 2012). The Redwood Empire Food Bank
provides supplemental groceries to maintain seniors‚Äô health and independence.
The City will continue to support services that encourage the development of affordable housing
for the elderly, particularly for those in need of assisted housing and skilled care (Policies H-D-1
and H-D-11). Additionally, the City will promote the incorporation of universal design features
in new residential development to improve access for the elderly (Policy H-D-4).

Homeless
The very nature of homelessness makes it difficult to count persons with no permanent shelter.
The Sonoma County Continuum of Care Planning Group oversees the county‚Äôs assessment of
homeless persons and conducts point-in-time homeless counts as required by the US Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The 2013 point-in-time count, conducted in January
2013, found 4,280 homeless persons countywide, 77 percent of whom were unsheltered. More
than half of persons counted were located in the Santa Rosa area, with 2,309 in central Santa
Rosa. Table 4-21 provides detail about the homeless population in Santa Rosa and Sonoma
County.

Countywide, 36 percent of homeless persons counted had a substance abuse disorder (alcohol or
drug), 30 percent suffered from chronic depression, 21 percent had post-traumatic stress
disorder, 18 percent had a chronic physical illness, and 18 percent had a mental illness. Based on
individuals‚Äô and families‚Äô circumstances, some need emergency or short-term assistance, some
require transitional housing in a sober living environment, some need permanent, supportive
housing, and others need a very low-income dwelling unit.
Homeless persons most frequently cited a lack of income or a job as an obstacle to securing
permanent housing (61 percent). Additional obstacles included an inability to afford rent (53
percent), no money for moving costs (32 percent), lack of housing availability (21 percent), and
bad credit (18 percent). The top causes of becoming homeless (during the current episode) were
a lost job (32 percent), argument with family or friend who asked the person to leave (19
percent), alcohol or drug use (16 percent), eviction (9 percent), divorce/separation/break-up (6
percent), and incarceration (6 percent).
As shown in Table 4-22, there were over 500 year-round beds in emergency shelters in Santa
Rosa as of January 2014. The point-in-time count, by its nature, does not include information
regarding seasonal fluctuations in the number of homeless persons in Santa Rosa. No seasonal
counts or estimates are known to exist. Information from homeless service providers suggests
there is some variation during winter when the weather turns cold and wet or when there is a
severe weather event, such as flooding. Homeless persons who live outside or camp will often
seek emergency shelter during the rainy season. For this reason, additional capacity is available
at the Samuel Jones shelter from October through April. The local focus has traditionally been
on developing year-round shelter to better provide an opportunity for homeless persons to
connect with service providers who can assist in the goal of ending long-term homelessness.

                                                               SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
Homeless outreach activities are provided by Catholic Charities, the InterFaith Shelter Network,
Redwood Gospel Mission, Sonoma County Health Services, Mental Health Division,
Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County, Community Support Network, and other
service-providing agencies.
As of January 2014, two new projects to assist with homeless needs are planned. On January 28,
2014, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors approved a temporary plan for a safe vehicle
parking program that will allow homeless people to sleep overnight in their cars in a parking lot
at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa between February 1 and April 30, 2014. Up to
50 vehicles will be allowed to park on the site from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. The program will be
operated by Catholic Charities and will include private security, a morning meal, shower and
sanitation facilities, and propane heaters.
In addition, Social Advocates for Youth is developing a transitional housing and emergency
shelter project that would serve up to 63 young adults (ages 18 to 24). The project was approved
by the City Council in March 2014.
Emergency shelters are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit in every Santa Rosa zoning
district and are, as of January 2011, allowed by right (without a discretionary permit) in the
General Commercial (CG) district. New emergency shelters are subject to the same district
requirements as other development projects in the same zone.
It was determined that the General Commercial zone would be the most conducive to provision
of an emergency homeless shelter by right. Since many homeless persons do not own cars, it
would be advantageous to locate new emergency shelters in areas with services and transit
nearby. Areas designated Retail Business Service and zoned General Commercial (CG) are the
most likely to offer convenience services such as groceries, pharmacies, and shops. In addition,
transit service is most accessible in these areas since the majority of Retail and CG designations
are located along arterial streets where buses run. There are approximately 34 acres of vacant
land zoned General Commercial in the city, comprising 26 sites ranging in size from 0.50 to 3.78
acres.
In January 2011, the City‚Äôs Zoning Code was amended to specify that transitional and supportive
housing facilities are treated as residential uses, subject only to the same regulations as other
residential uses of the same type in the same district.
In addition to continuing to implement these zoning regulations, the City will continue to provide
funding and support to groups providing shelter and services to the homeless (Policies H-D-1,
H-D-8, and H-D-9) and explore new models for providing temporary housing solutions (Policy
H-D-10).
                                                                                               4-25

HOUSING
Farmworkers
Sonoma County is an agricultural county, with a need for housing for agricultural workers.
According to the Sonoma County Agricultural Commissioner, the county‚Äôs value of agricultural
production was more than $821 million in 2012. The top five crops, by value, include wine
grapes, milk, livestock and poultry, cattle and calves, and nursery ornamentals. While the
majority of farmworker employment is in unincorporated Sonoma County, some workers in
agricultural jobs will seek housing in Santa Rosa.
According to the 2007 Census conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, there
were 13,799 farmworkers in Sonoma County. Of these, 5,458 were permanent, year-round
employees, while 8,341 were seasonal workers, working less than 150 days per year. Table 4-23
presents this data. The total number of farmworkers has declined in Sonoma County, with the
Department of Agriculture reporting 15,476 workers in 2002 and 15,995 in 1997.

             * Less than 150 days per year
The agricultural census does not provide estimates of farmworkers living or seeking housing in
Santa Rosa. There is not a definitive source to determine how many of Sonoma County's
farmworkers live or seek housing in Santa Rosa. The ACS (2007‚Äì2011 estimate) indicates that
1,478 persons in Santa Rosa were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting
industries as of 2011. It can be reasonably assumed that at least this number of persons may seek
housing in Santa Rosa. The ACS total does not indicate whether employees in this industry are
seasonal or year-round residents.
According to estimates from the Santa Rosa Regional Office of the Butte County Office of
Education, which administers the Migrant Education Program, there were 1,266 students from
migrant families enrolled in schools located within Santa Rosa or schools that feed in to Santa
Rosa schools as of the 2012-2013 school year. The count includes students enrolled in pre-school
through 12th grade. Migrant children are defined as those who have moved in the preceding 3
years to accompany a family member or guardian in order to obtain temporary or seasonal
employment in agricultural, fishing, or logging (except lumber mills) work. The Migrant
Education program addresses the special needs of migrant children whose learning is impacted
by frequent mobility, poverty, and limited English skills.

                                                              SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
Because migrant families may have one child, multiple children or no children, this data can not
be used to determine thee number of farmworker households in Santa Rosa, however, this data,
along with the estimates from the Agricultural Census and ACS confirm the need for farmworker
housing and resources in Santa Rosa. Specifically, this data confirms the need for affordable
family housing.
Many farmworkers do not have access to decent, safe, and affordable housing. Many may live in
overcrowded or substandard units or may be homeless. Farmworkers seeking housing in Santa
Rosa need housing that is affordable to lower-income households, such as a subsidized
apartment or single-family unit.
Seasonal and year-round opportunities are needed for farmworkers in the Santa Rosa area. Most
farmworkers seek and find housing situations that are not specifically for farmworkers. In Santa
Rosa, permanent rental housing is the most likely housing option for farmworkers. Locations
identified for multifamily residential would provide sites for this group. California Human
Development, a nonprofit organization that serves farmworkers and immigrant and low-income
households, emphasized the importance of providing a continuum of housing resources, from
options for homeless, unaccompanied workers during peak harvest season, to home ownership.
Housing specifically for farmworkers is allowed in Santa Rosa, consistent with a site‚Äôs General
Plan land use designation and policy direction. The City amended the Zoning Code in January
2011 to allow agricultural employee housing for six or fewer residents as a permitted use in
residential zoning districts. Additionally, all residential zoning districts in Santa Rosa allow
boardinghouses as a permitted use. Boardinghouses are a housing alternative that could offer
reasonably priced lodging for farmworkers.
To further facilitate the provision of housing for farmworkers, the City will continue to
coordinate with Sonoma County to identify opportunities and issues (Policy H-A-4), provide
support and funding for existing programs (Policy H-D-1), and support the development of rental
housing for seasonal and permanent farmworkers (Policy H-D-7).
Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities
Senate Bill 244 (2012) requires that jurisdictions identify and analyze the housing and
infrastructure needs of disadvantaged unincorporated communities, which are inhabited areas of
10 or more dwellings located adjacent to or in close proximity to one another in which the
median household income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median income ($49,306
according to the 2010 American Community Survey). The Sonoma County Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO) identified seven disadvantaged communities in Sonoma
County, none of which are located within or adjacent to the Santa Rosa sphere of influence.
                                                                                             4-27

HOUSING
ENERGY CONSERVATION
In Santa Rosa, electricity and natural gas are used to light, heat, and cool structures, public
buildings, and home appliances. Fossil fuels are used to move people and products along the
city‚Äôs transportation corridors. Most of the energy consumed in Santa Rosa is produced from
traditional sources and delivered to the city through established distribution networks. Pacific
Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electrical services and natural gas within the Urban
Growth Boundary, and gasoline and other petroleum products are sold through private retailers
throughout the city.
The City has made strides in reducing greenhouse gases and utilizing green energy sources. In
2003, the Geysers Recharge Project became operational. This project pumps 11 million gallons
of treated wastewater from Santa Rosa‚Äôs Laguna Treatment Plant, through 41 miles of pipeline,
to the Geysers steamfield. There, it is used to generate electricity for 85,000 households in
Sonoma County and the North Bay area.
In 2004, the City of Santa Rosa adopted a voluntary green building program, Santa Rosa-Build It
Green (SR-BIG), which promotes building and remodeling homes in a way that reduces energy
demands, releases fewer pollutants into the atmosphere, conserves water, and reduces
construction waste. The City also committed to utilizing guidelines set by Build It Green when
constructing or renovating municipal buildings.
In August 2005, the City Council adopted a resolution establishing greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions reduction targets for Santa Rosa City operations of 20 percent below 2000 levels by
2010 and resolved to help with a community-wide emissions reduction of 25 percent below 1990
levels by 2015. The City has been implementing this objective by utilizing solar, biomass, wind,
and alternative fuels into everyday City operations.
The City has installed photovoltaic systems on some of its facilities to produce electricity. In
addition, cogeneration is planned at some City facilities. Algae ponds have been constructed at
the Laguna Treatment Plant to potentially produce renewable energy and remove nutrients from
wastewater.
In 2009, Sonoma County launched the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program (SCEIP)
to provide information, financing options, and incentives for energy efficiency, water
conservation, and renewable energy projects for county residents and businesses. Since the 2009
launch, the Economic Development Board of Sonoma County estimates that the SCEIP program
has financed nearly $52.7 million in projects for local contractors, resulting in more than 2,500
completed projects countywide. The SCEIP program not only serves as an important economic
driver of the local economy but also aims to reduce energy and utility costs for households.

In 2010, the City adopted CALGreen Tier 1 standards, which exceed the basic level of
requirements of the CALGreen Building Code. This program supports the City‚Äôs efforts to
reduce greenhouse gases to reach the local, regional, and state targets outlined in the City‚Äôs
Climate Action Plan.
The City adopted a Community Climate Action Plan (CCAP) in 2012 and a Municipal Climate
Action Plan (MCAP) in 2013. The CCAP examines community-wide sources of GHG emissions
and outlines strategies for reducing these emissions. The MCAP addresses greenhouse gas
emissions from the City‚Äôs municipal operations.
The opportunity to utilize solar energy to heat water and generate power is great. Santa Rosa has
an average of over 200 days of sunshine per year and has a favorable climate for photovoltaic
and thermal generation. The City will continue to work toward greater energy efficiency,
reduced water usage, and more sustainable building practices in residential development.
Policies H-G-1 through H-G-8 describe these specific efforts.
                                                                                             4-29

HOUSING
4-3         CONSTRAINTS AND RESOURCES
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental regulations can act to constrain housing production if the regulations increase
costs or limit opportunities for housing development. Potential constraints to housing
development in Santa Rosa vary by area, but generally may include infrastructure, residential
development fees, land use controls, development standards, development and building permit
application processing times, and resource preservation.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Wastewater treatment, reuse, and disposal capacity are not expected to constrain housing
development during the Housing Element planning period. Wastewater collection capacity
throughout the city is generally sufficient to meet anticipated housing development levels
through the planning period. Wastewater from Santa Rosa is treated at the Laguna Subregional
Wastewater Treatment Plant (LTP) and is reclaimed in the Santa Rosa Subregional Water
Reclamation System. The City‚Äôs adopted Capital Improvement Program calls for various
improvements to the LTP and reclamation system in order to maintain adequate capacity to treat
and reclaim wastewater volumes anticipated by the General Plan. The current system‚Äôs rated
capacity is 21.34 million gallons per day, which is adequate to service expected growth through
2035. Planning and environmental work has been completed for improvement projects that will
be implemented as growth occurs. The planned improvements would expand the system to 25.9
million gallons per day, which will meet the General Plan projections of Santa Rosa and other
subregional partners.
Water supply is not expected to constrain housing development during the Housing Element
planning period. The City is currently under contract with the Sonoma County Water Agency for
the delivery of up to 56.6 million gallons of water per day on average and up to 29,100 acre-feet
of water annually. The City has two active groundwater wells that can produce up to 2,300 acre-
feet per year, and the City is the owner and operator of the Subregional Water Reclamation
System, which produces approximately 410 acre-feet per year of recycled water for irrigation
and other approved uses within the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB).
The City of Santa Rosa implements an aggressive water conservation program that save an
additional 4,500 acre-feet per year. The total existing water supply available to the City is
approximately 31,810 acre-feet per year. Santa Rosa‚Äôs highest water use to date was in 2001
when 24,300 acre-feet were used.
The availability of urban facilities and services will not be a long-term constraint to residential
development, but the phasing of infrastructure expansion to meet the requirements of new
growth will require continued planning efforts. The City has adopted policies to ensure that
projects with affordable housing units will receive priority sewer and water service should
capacity be limited.

DEVELOPMENT FEES
Payment of development fees is typically a requirement of development approvals. Fees are also
charged to process development applications. Fees are tied to the City service provided, such as
application processing and plan checking, and are based on the average time to complete the
service. Table 4-24 outlines planning fees for a subdivision and an annexation.
In 2013, the City conducted a detailed study to examine fees and develop a new planning and
building fee schedule that would allow the City to recoup a larger portion of actual costs
expended in the processing of development applications. After consultations with building
industry representatives and feedback from the public at hearings, the City Council adopted the
new fee schedule in January 2014. The new fees will be implemented over the course of five
years. The updated fees are considered reasonable since they cover a portion of the City‚Äôs costs
to process these development applications. Santa Rosa‚Äôs planning fees for a single-family
dwelling unit in a small subdivision range from $4,361 to $5,715 per unit.

The development impact fees were adopted following nexus studies completed in accordance
with state law. These fees are indexed annually and can increase or decrease based on
construction cost indices. Impact fees are collected at the time of building permit issuance,
unless fees are deferred by the City Council.
The development fees for single-family units amount to 13 to 16 percent of total construction
costs (not including land) as outlined in the Land Costs, Construction, and Financing section of
this element. If land costs are included, the percentage of cost attributable to fees decreases.
                                                                                                                                                   4-33

HOUSING
Development fees for multifamily units account for 12 to 15 percent of construction costs based
on the construction cost estimated in the Land Costs, Construction, and Financing section.
While fees represent a significant portion of residential construction costs, the City finds that
these fees are necessary to provide adequate public facilities. Additionally, Santa Rosa‚Äôs fees are
generally comparable to the fees of other Sonoma County communities.
The City Council recognizes that fees can affect the cost of construction and of affordable
housing in the community. The City has long offered fee deferrals for affordable housing
projects, and the Council recently instituted a program to also offer deferred fee payments for
market-rate residential projects to incentivize development in a difficult economic climate. The
Housing Authority of the City of Santa Rosa also has provided assistance with development fees
for affordable projects.
Processing
The City is committed to efficient development application processing, and it has an adopted
policy related to application review and processing. The development review process has been
streamlined in accordance with the Council-adopted Development Process Review report (1993),
which set forth processing time objectives. These include limiting processing time to no more
than 120 days from the date of application submittal to the first action by a decision-making
body, with 30 days between sequential actions, 42 days for the first plan check, and 15 days for
each subsequent check. The City Council has also initiated implementation of a Two Plan Check
Process for engineering plans and requirements for neighborhood meetings prior to formal
application submittal to streamline the development review process.
Two recently constructed projects, Amorosa Village and Humboldt Street Apartments, illustrate
the City‚Äôs commitment to expediting the permitting process. The Amorosa Village project
included a Tentative Map, Conditional Use Permit, and Design Review. In 2008, the project
requested and received fast track processing. The project was approved 83 days after its
development application was submitted. While this project was appealed, its approval was
upheld 130 days after application submittal. The Humboldt Street Apartments project, which
involved Design Review and a Minor Conditional Use Permit, was filed in late 2009 and
received all entitlements 59 days after application submittal. The project has been completed and
provides 52 units including 8 for very low-income households, 43 for low-income households,
and 1 manager‚Äôs unit.
LAND USE CONTROLS
Residential land use control mechanisms used by the City of Santa Rosa include the General
Plan, Zoning Code, Design Review, Building Code, Growth Management Program, and Housing
Allocation Plan.

Zoning Code
The Santa Rosa Zoning Code implements the General Plan. It describes the type of residential
uses allowed in each zoning district as well as the building standards such as required setbacks,
maximum height, and parking requirements. The code includes no unusual or onerous provisions
that impede the production of housing, either as a whole or for any particular population group,
as proven by the consistent production of new housing in the community.

 * Single-family dwellings allowed only as attached units.
 ** A Minor Use Permit is required for the construction of new multifamily supportive and transitional housing units in an RR or R-1-6 zoning
 district, similar to construction of a new traditional multifamily unit in an RR or R-1-6 zone. A new supportive or transitional housing use
 occupying an existing multifamily residence in an RR or R-1-6 zoning district is a permitted use requiring only a Zoning Clearance.
Single-family and multifamily developments are permitted by right (without discretionary
approval) in several zones, consistent with General Plan policies and density ranges. Single-
family uses are allowed by right in the Rural Residential (RR) and Single-Family Residential
(R-1) districts. Multifamily and single-family attached uses are allowed by right in the Medium
Density Multi-Family (R-2), Multi-Family (R-3), and Transit Village-Residential (TV-R)
districts, subject to Design Review only.
Second dwelling units are allowed on any parcel which allows a single-family dwelling. An
application for a second dwelling unit must accompany a building permit, which is issued
without a public hearing if the proposed unit meets development standards outlined in the
Zoning Code.
Larger community care facilities, multifamily units in single-family zones, and the residential
component of mixed-use projects generally require a Minor Use Permit. These permits are
decided by the City‚Äôs Zoning Administrator, and a public hearing is held only if requested by a
member of the public.
                                                                                                                                                4-37

HOUSING
In 2011, the City amended the Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters with 50 beds or less by
right (without a use permit) in the General Commercial (CG) district. In all other zones,
emergency shelters require Conditional Use Permits. Requests for such permits are noticed and
considered by the Planning Commission at a public hearing. Transitional and supportive housing
requires a Minor Use Permit in the RR and R-1 zones (a Minor Use Permit is also required for
traditional multifamily developments in these zones) and is permitted by right in the R-2, R-3,
Mobile Home Park (MH), and TV-R zones.
The City allows single-room occupancy facilities in the Downtown Commercial, General
Commercial, and Community Shopping Center zoning districts. Single-room occupancy
facilities can assist extremely low-income persons and farmworkers. Housing for farmworkers
could also include multifamily rentals as described above and boardinghouses, which are
allowed by right in all residential zoning districts.
The Zoning Code includes a provision allowing agricultural employee housing for six or fewer
residents as a permitted residential use in all residential zoning districts to make it easier to
provide farmworker housing. This provision is similar to that of community care facilities in
Santa Rosa, which, with six or fewer residents, are permitted by right in all residential districts.
The Zoning Code allows manufactured housing in all residential zoning districts by right, subject
to the same development standards as on-site construction. The City has established design
criteria for manufactured housing consistent with state law.
Development Standards
Zoning regulations for residential zones are shown in Table 4-29. Standard zoning requires
varying setback and building height requirements, depending on the zone. Multifamily zones,
particularly the TV-R zone, allow limited setbacks and building heights of 45 feet or four stories
to accommodate high-density residential projects. For affordable housing projects, the City may
waive certain zoning standards to improve the feasibility of the project.

The City has found these requirements to be sufficient but not excessive. Parking reductions of
up to 25 percent may be granted if the review authority finds that special circumstances exist and
that the proposed number of spaces is sufficient for the safe, convenient, and efficient operation
of the use. Parking requirements are further reduced within each of Santa Rosa‚Äôs Station Area
Plan boundaries (Downtown Station Area and North Santa Rosa Station Area).
Street widths are not viewed as a constraint to housing development. Minor streets, which
typically serve single-family and duplex development, may vary from 24 feet (no parking) to 30
feet (parking on one side) to 36 feet (parking on both sides). Avenues range from 24 feet (no
parking) to 36 feet (parking on both sides). Regional boulevards range from 48 feet (no parking)
to 64 feet (parking on both sides). Variations are allowed for each street type.
City landscape requirements, with an emphasis on drought-tolerant plants, are designed to ensure
residential developments are pleasant, livable, and attractive. All site development is required to
include landscaping. Foreground landscaping, street trees, and parking area landscaping are
required for all development projects.
Requirements of on- and off-site improvements vary with the project and the site. On-site
improvements typically include grading, storm drainage, curb, gutter, and sidewalk. Off-site
improvements can include street widening or construction or traffic light installation.
                                                                                                                            4-41

Design Review
General Plan policy requires that all new architectural and site design be of superior quality to
improve and add to Santa Rosa‚Äôs attractiveness. Santa Rosa has design guidelines that implement
the design objectives of the General Plan.
Design review guidelines were first adopted in 1973, and revised guidelines were most recently
adopted in 2012. The City requires project consistency with adopted design policies. General
design policies require proposals to be compatible and sensitive to surrounding land uses, offer a
complete design concept where architecture, materials, and landscaping are of an appropriate
scale, and provide human interest. New proposals are not subject to unusual or especially
restrictive conditions.
Amorosa Village, a 150-unit affordable housing project, and Humboldt Street Apartments, a 52-
unit affordable housing project, both underwent Design Review. The Design Review process did
not delay approval for either project‚ÄîAmorosa Village was entitled 83 days after application
submittal and the Humboldt Street Apartments project was entitled in 59 days.
Building Codes
Santa Rosa uses the California Building Code, which is based on the International Building
Code. This code is used statewide and does not impose any unusual or unique constraints on
housing. Santa Rosa requires that all new buildings comply with the Tier 1 standards of the
California Green Building Code to minimize the use of energy and water resources. Sonoma
County and most nearby jurisdictions, including the Cities of Rohnert Park and Petaluma, also
require Tier 1 compliance. The enforcement of Tier 1 standards is not unusual for the area and is
unlikely to deter residential development in Santa Rosa.
The City operates the Neighborhood Revitalization Program to improve building safety and
appearance in targeted areas. The City is currently focusing on five neighborhoods, which are
benefiting from proactive code enforcement, and enhancing the safety of local dwellings.
The City provides general code compliance citywide. This program is complaint-based; staff
does not actively seek code violations. Staff contacts the person against whom a complaint was
filed to request an inspection to assess whether a code violation does exist. City staff works with
individuals to correct violations, with corrections including improvement of substandard housing
conditions and blight as well as neighborhood safety. The code compliance program does not
impose unusual constraints on housing.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
In Santa Rosa, community care facilities are allowed in all residential and commercial land use
designations and zoning districts, with the exception of the Motor Vehicle Sales District.

                                                               SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
Facilities of six or fewer persons are allowed by right since they are considered a single-family
use. Facilities of seven or more require review of a Minor Use Permit by the City.
The City adopted a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance in 2002, providing persons with
disabilities a procedure to seek equal access to housing under the federal Fair Housing Act and
the California Fair Employment and Housing Act in the application of zoning laws and other
land use regulations. The procedures are included in the Zoning Code, and they allow for
modification or exception to the standards for siting, development, and use of housing which
would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide disabled persons with equal housing
opportunities.
The City follows state and federal regulations that require that any new residential construction
of three or more apartments or four or more condominium units be accessible and/or adaptable to
disabled persons. The City applies standard conditions of approval to residential development
projects reflecting this mandate. The North Santa Rosa Station Area Specific Plan, adopted in
2012, builds on this standard and requires that a minimum of 10 percent of new units in
townhome projects be designed to be habitable by persons with disabilities (Specific Plan Policy
AH-3.2).
The City has adopted the California Building Code. Amendments made to the code have not
diminished the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities. The City has not adopted
universal design elements as of 2013, but a program to adopt such an ordinance is included as a
policy in this Housing Element (Policy H-D-4).
Lastly, the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan and this Housing Element include policies that
call for development of a program which would evaluate issues of ‚Äúvisitability‚Äù in residential
building design (Policy H-D-3). Visitability is an inclusive design approach that integrates basic
accessibility features into newly constructed residential units. Such a program would help make
more structures accessible to disabled persons who are not necessarily residents of the structures.
Growth Management
The City‚Äôs Growth Management Program places a limit on the number of allotments that can be
granted annually. The allotment allows the issuance of a building permit. For the period 2014 to
2020, 850 allotments are available annually. From 2021 to 2022, 800 allotments are available
annually. The annual allotments exceed the City‚Äôs average annual Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) of 548 units per year from 2014 to 2022.
The allotments are split evenly into two types: Reserve A and Reserve B. Reserve A allotments
are reserved for small units on small lots, multifamily units, for-sale single-family attached units
in projects of 10 units per acre or more, units in mixed-use projects, and affordable units.
Reserve A was established to promote housing affordability and variety through the Growth
Management Program. Reserve B allotments are for most other units, typically unrestricted
single-family units.
                                                                                                4-43

HOUSING
To give priority to Reserve A type units, the Growth Management Ordinance allows unused
Reserve A allotments to be added to the following year‚Äôs allotments. Unused Reserve B
allotments are added to a bank of allotments that are used for projects meeting City objectives. In
2012, 238 residential building permits were issued‚Äî66 were Reserve A, 92 were Reserve B‚Äî
and 80 were exempt from the Growth Management Ordinance.
Growth management allotments are granted by the Director of Community Development at the
time of a project‚Äôs final discretionary approval. The allotments are granted in the year requested
by the project developer if they are available. If no allotments are available, the allotments are
issued in the next year they are available, and the developer receives allotments in the desired
year when they become available. To ensure allotments for many projects, single-family projects
may receive no more than 75 allotments per year; the multifamily maximum is 200 per year.
Santa Rosa‚Äôs Growth Management Program has not prevented a developer from building a
project in the desired year. Given the above-noted number of allotments available, it is clear that
the housing need can be accommodated with the Growth Management Program in effect. A
slowing in the number of new units built annually as a result of market conditions may be a
greater factor in meeting housing needs.
Santa Rosa has an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), which is in effect through 2035. The City‚Äôs
first voter-approved UGB, a five-year boundary, was ratified in 1990. A 20-year boundary was
effected by Santa Rosa voters in 1996 and extended in 2012.
It does not appear that growth management or a fixed UGB has significantly affected housing
prices in Santa Rosa. In 1989, the average home price in Santa Rosa was $180,000. In 1991,
when the General Plan Growth Management Element was adopted, the average housing price in
Santa Rosa was $174,250. In 1995, the average housing price was $187,900. In the early 1990s,
development slowed due to an economic downturn, and housing prices fell. In the later 1990s,
housing prices increased significantly, mirroring regional housing increases. In 2007, housing
prices leveled and dropped for the first time since the early 1990s, with the median housing price
at around $485,000. In 2013, the median home price in Santa Rosa was $366,500. Home prices
in Santa Rosa tend to be lower than countywide prices (refer to the home sales price analysis in
the Needs Assessment) and follow trends comparable to nearby communities and the Bay Area
as a whole. Housing price changes in Santa Rosa cannot be attributed to the City‚Äôs Growth
Management Program or UGB.
Housing Allocation Plan
The Housing Allocation Plan (HAP) was adopted by the City Council in 1992 to promote the
development of affordable housing in Santa Rosa. The HAP applies to all residential
development in the city. As directed by Policy H-C-1 of the 2009 Housing Element, the HAP
was amended in 2012. Fee payment to support the development of affordable housing is now the
primary method of compliance. Applicants may choose to provide on-site affordable rental units.

                                                              SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
Applicants proposing projects of 70 units or more are required to discuss the on-site option with
staff.
While the housing impact fee or provision of on-site units does add to the cost of new
development, the fees are essential to the provision and funding of affordable housing in the city.
NATURAL RESOURCES
Natural resources, such as rare and endangered plant and animal species and habitats, coincide
geographically with areas that are designated for housing development, particularly in the
northwest and southwest areas of Santa Rosa. Most of these areas are designated for lower
densities or low density/open space, recognizing the location of natural resources. These land use
designations do not typically accommodate affordable housing projects.
To balance the preservation of natural resources while allowing urban growth, a Vernal Pool
Task Force was formed in the early 1990s to bring together government agencies, landowners,
and local land use interests. The task force developed the Santa Rosa Plain Vernal Pool
Ecosystem Preservation Plan, which identified goals and objectives for preserving natural
resources, incentives for mitigation banks and conservation easements, and outlined a
streamlined regulatory process to speed authorization for filling low quality wetlands. Criteria
were developed for mitigation banking, and this process is common to the development review
process in Santa Rosa today.
The California tiger salamander (CTS) and its habitat were listed as endangered in 2003. This
habitat generally corresponds to the location of vernal pools and wetlands in northwest and
southwest Santa Rosa. Since the listing, the City has sought ways to preserve the salamander and
its habitat while allowing development to occur. The Santa Rosa Plain Conservation Strategy
Team, comprising state and federal agencies, the environmental and development communities,
and city and county representatives, published the Santa Rosa Plain Conservation Strategy to
address this issue. The strategy, adopted in December 2005, provides the biological framework
for conservation of the endangered California tiger salamander and four rare plant species found
in conjunction with wetland habitat on the Santa Rosa Plain. It identifies conservation areas and
mitigation requirements for development projects that will impact the habitat of these protected
species. In fall 2007, the County of Sonoma, the Cities of Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, and Cotati,
and the Town of Windsor adopted the Santa Rosa Plain Conservation Strategy Planning
Agreement, which supports the conservation approach set forth in the strategy. The main purpose
of the planning agreement is to establish a process and timeline for the local jurisdictions to
finalize and develop an implementation program for the conservation strategy. This included the
creation of the Santa Rosa Plain Conservation Strategy Implementation Committee to guide this
effort. Funding has not yet been identified for environmental work. As illustrated, the City of
Santa Rosa is working to address this development constraint.
Higher elevations and steeper slopes are located in the foothills in northeast Santa Rosa. Such
areas have higher potential for landslide and soil slump hazards. The Noise and Safety Element

discusses and illustrates those lands subject to geologic hazards, such as ground shaking
amplification and liquefaction.
LAND AVAILABILITY
Land availability will not prevent the City from meeting its housing needs. The city limits
contain sufficient land for future housing development.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Housing purchase prices, financing costs, cost of land and improvements, construction costs,
property taxes, profit, and rent rates continue to be the biggest constraints to housing access for
households with lower and moderate incomes. Housing costs will continue to be a factor in
accessibility to housing, especially for people in the extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
groups. As recommended in the policies of this Housing Element, the City of Santa Rosa will
continue all possible efforts to conserve existing affordable housing stock and to increase the
number of affordable units. The larger factors of construction and financing are beyond the
City‚Äôs direct influence.

Land, construction, and financing costs represent a significant constraint to residential
development. Land costs are high and construction costs have increased, with the cost of
materials growing.
Land value for vacant residential parcels is largely dependent on the number and type of units
(single-family, townhomes, condominiums, or apartments) that can be constructed. Based on
November 2013 information from the Multiple Listing Service (greathomes.org), 90 total parcels
were for sale, with current prices for vacant land in Santa Rosa as follows:
ÔÇ∑    Median price for parcels of less than 1 acre was $234,000 (sample of 13) and ranged from
     $99,000 to $675,000.
ÔÇ∑    Median price for parcels between 1 and 3 acres was $449,000 (sample of 29) and ranged
     from $150,000 to $1,950,000.
The construction cost (not including land) of a typical 1,800-square-foot single-family home in
Santa Rosa is approximately $352,500 (buildingcost.net). This estimate includes construction
costs for off-site and site work, soft costs such as architecture and engineering, other costs
including fees, marketing, insurance, contingency, and profit.
Cost for construction of new multifamily units ranges from $320,000 to $350,000 based on an
estimate provided by Burbank Housing Development Corporation, a local developer that has
constructed many multifamily projects in the city.

Financing new residential development can be a significant cost. Residential financing for both
single-family and multiple-family housing is generally available. Developers of single-family
projects often secure loans for land acquisition, installation of improvements, and lastly,
construction. Land acquisition and development loan rates are typically the prime rate plus 0.5 to
2 percent, which was 3.6 to 4.5 percent in fall 2013. Apartment loan rates are generally slightly
lower.
Developers of affordable housing face challenges in securing financing. Due to the limited
possible return from rents or sales prices of affordable units, many private lenders are concerned
with the financial returns for these types of projects. Additional financing and subsidy for
affordable projects is necessary and is generally available from local sources such as the Housing
Allocation Plan in-lieu fee, as well as state and federal programs such as HOME and the
Community Development Block Grant.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS
The City of Santa Rosa operates numerous programs aimed at maintaining and expanding
housing opportunities in the community. The City‚Äôs Housing Authority was established in 1971
with a goal to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing in Santa Rosa. The Housing Authority
has four basic approaches to meeting this goal:
ÔÇ∑   Development of new units
ÔÇ∑   Rehabilitation of existing units
ÔÇ∑   Rental assistance
ÔÇ∑   Special housing projects
In the area of new affordable housing, the City concentrates primarily on the development of
rental units. This is because the need for housing is greatest for very low- and low-income
households, and many families cannot afford a down payment, even at an affordable sales price.
The City participates in new affordable housing developments typically by providing funds to
affordable housing developers which then leverage that funding to secure other funding and
financing to develop affordable housing projects.
At an outreach event for this Housing Element, it was suggested that the City revisit its funding
strategy in light of the loss of Redevelopment Agency funds to support affordable housing
development and changes to eligibility criteria for Low Income Housing Tax Credits. As of this
writing, staff from the Department of Economic Development and Housing is working with the
Housing Authority to review and revise, as appropriate, the Authority‚Äôs approach to providing
funding assistance for affordable projects. For example, rather than providing funds to several
proposed projects, the Authority may shift its approach to channel funds to fewer projects to
ensure the amount provided will serve as adequate leverage in pursuing other funding sources.
                                                                                               4-47

HOUSING
While the Housing Authority committed no funding for affordable projects in 2012, it authorized
approximately $3.3 million in 2011 to support three projects that will contain 110 units. Funding
sources for these projects include Housing Allocation Plan Fee revenues, HOME funds,
Community Development Block Grant funds, and the City‚Äôs General Fund.
Santa Rosa Housing Trust
In 2002, the Housing Authority of the City of Santa Rosa created the Santa Rosa Housing Trust
to assist in the development of new affordable housing and the acquisition and rehabilitation of
housing for low-income households. The trust is an umbrella for housing funding, and it works
to maximize and leverage available federal, state, and local funding. Funding for the trust is
provided from Community Development Block Grant funds, HOME funds, a portion of the real
property transfer tax, the Housing Allocation Plan impact fee, fund repayment from a variety of
sources, and other sources of income.
Rehabilitation Loan Program
The City‚Äôs Rehabilitation Loan Program is currently suspended due to a lack of funding. When
funds are available, loans are made to low-income owner occupant households, mobile home
owners, and landlords who rent to low-income tenants. The City will consider reinstating the
program (Policy H-B-1) if funding becomes available.
Housing Allocation Plan
Housing development in Santa Rosa is subject to the Housing Allocation Plan, the purpose of
which is to increase the number of affordable housing units in the community. While developers
have the option to provide low-income units on-site, the majority of housing projects in Santa
Rosa are subject to the Housing Allocation Plan‚Äôs housing impact fee. In 2012, $620,180 was
collected in housing fees and added to the Housing Allocation Plan fund. In 2013, $357,755 was
collected and added to the fund. The amount of Housing Allocation Plan fees collected since the
ordinance‚Äôs adoption in 1992 is more than $25 million, including loan repayment and interest.
Since the inception of the Housing Allocation Plan in 1992, 1,633 units have been assisted,
approved, or developed with the assistance of in-lieu fees. Of these units, 1,024 are affordable to
very low-income households and 603 are affordable to low-income households. Projects
providing affordable units on-site have developed 15 very low-income units and 93 low-income
units since 1992.
Community Development Block Grant and HOME Funds
The City receives Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds from the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a majority of which are allocated for
new development and rehabilitation. Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME) funds are
federal funds generally available for acquisition, new development, and homebuyer down

payment assistance. CDBG funds fluctuate annually, but are anticipated to be approximately
$1.2 million per year. The City‚Äôs allocation of HOME funds is expected to be approximately
$550,000 annually.
Portion of Real Property Transfer Tax
The City of Santa Rosa collects a tax when real property is sold. The tax is collected by the
County Recorder at the time of recording and is based on the amount paid for the property at a
rate of $2.00 per $1,000 of value (as of February 2014). The City designates 20 percent of
income from this tax to support affordable housing and homeless services. Policy H-B-7 directs
the City to continue to designate a portion of this tax for housing programs and consider
increasing the allocation to assist with the development of affordable units.
Other Sources of Revenue
Other sources of revenue for development and/or rehabilitation of the city‚Äôs affordable housing
supply include:
ÔÇ∑   Tax credits (federal and state programs)
ÔÇ∑   Tax Exempt Multifamily Bonds
ÔÇ∑   Mortgage Credit Certificates (federal program)
ÔÇ∑   Multifamily Housing Program (state program)
ÔÇ∑   Cal HFA (state program)
ÔÇ∑   Joe Serna Farmworker Housing (state program)
ÔÇ∑   Residential Development Loan Program (state program)
ÔÇ∑   BEGIN (state program)
ÔÇ∑   CalHome (state program)
ÔÇ∑   Continuum of Care (for homeless programs)
ÔÇ∑   Private resources such as the local Loan Consortium, Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable
    Housing Programs, and Sonoma County Community Foundation
ÔÇ∑   Loan repayment from a variety of sources
                                                                                           4-49

HOUSING
Density Bonus and Infill Programs
The Density Bonus Program allows projects to develop at densities higher than allowed by the
General Plan in return for affordable housing, senior housing, donations of land for affordable
housing, condominium conversions that include affordable housing, and child-care facilities.
Fast Track Policy
The Fast Track Policy is a City policy that allows quicker processing of development projects in
return for affordable units. This provision has not been greatly utilized in the last few years due
to reduced development permitting activity and because the City‚Äôs policy is to process
development projects within 90 to 120 days. In 2008, the Amorosa Village affordable housing
project requested and received fast track processing. The project was approved 83 days after its
development application was submitted. While this project was appealed, its approval was
upheld 130 days after application submittal.
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Rental Assistance
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program assists very low-income rental households,
including families, seniors, and disabled persons. Funding for the program is from HUD. Tenants
pay from 30 to 40 percent of monthly income toward rent, and the Section 8 subsidy pays the
remainder to the property owner.
The Housing Authority administers the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which in 2012 served
1,482 rental households in Santa Rosa. In addition, the Housing Authority administered 268
county vouchers being used in the city as of 2012.
The Housing Authority also administers the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH)
program. The VASH program combines Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance with case
management and clinical services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist
homeless veterans. As of 2014, the program served over 100 veterans in Santa Rosa.
Neighborhood Revitalization Program
The purpose of the Neighborhood Revitalization Program is to improve living conditions and
quality of life in deteriorating neighborhoods. An interdepartmental City task force works to
achieve this goal.
The Economic Development and Housing Department coordinates the program, which also
includes staff from Community Development, Fire, Police, Recreation and Parks, and the City
Attorney‚Äôs Office. Building and fire inspections are conducted to ensure decent, safe, and clean
housing. A Youth Coordinator and a Community Outreach Specialist work with the community
and schools to coordinate youth activities, referrals for job training, and social, educational, and
cultural programs for adults. A police officer is part of the team to provide a presence and
improve the overall neighborhood feeling of safety, and the City Attorney works with the

owners, residents, and neighborhood associations to gain compliance with local and state law. In
addition, low interest rehabilitation loans are available from the City‚Äôs Economic Development
and Housing Department.
The Neighborhood Revitalization Program considers neighborhood characteristics in
determining a course of action for improvements. It has registered many successes, including
neighborhood cleanup days, new playground equipment, paving, landscaping, and rehabilitation
of numerous housing units. The program has five focus neighborhoods: Apple Valley/Papago,
Aston, Corby/Olive, South Park, and Sunset/Delport.
Mobile Home Rent Control
The City implemented rent control for mobile home spaces in 1993 in order to ensure
affordability for homeowners, most of whom are on fixed incomes. At the same time, rent
stabilization is intended to allow mobile home park owners to maintain a fair and reasonable
return.
Rent control applies to spaces that have a rental agreement term of 12 months or less. Annual
rent increases are limited to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, but any increase
is limited to a maximum of 6 percent.
The majority of mobile home parks, which include over 2,000 spaces, in Santa Rosa are subject
to rent control.
Preservation of Affordable Units
For at least 30 years, a variety of programs have provided incentives for the development of
affordable rental housing in Santa Rosa. These programs are administered by HUD, insured by
the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), financed by Multifamily Revenue Bond issuance or
tax credits, and governed by a Density Increase Program or Housing Allocation Plan contract. In
return for certain considerations, developers sign contracts to provide units at affordable rents
from 10 to 55 years. Once the term of the contract is up, the owner of the rental units can raise
the rents to market rate. This can have the effect of displacing the low- and very low-income
tenants who cannot afford increased rents.
As illustrated in Table 4-31, a total of 873 units are at risk of converting to market rate between
2015 and 2025. Many of these housing units are owned by nonprofit housing organizations and
are at low risk of converting to market-rate rentals.
The City is engaged in ongoing communications with the management or owners of the listed at-
risk properties. The management of Chelsea Gardens, Jennings Court, Silvercrest, Valley Oak
Park, and Woodcreek Village have indicated their intent to renew HUD contracts and maintain
affordability. The City is committed to working proactively to retaining these units (Policy H-B-3).
                                                                                                4-51

HOUSING
In 2012, the City was successful in preserving 200 existing affordable housing units at risk of
converting to market rate, including 46 very low-income and 154 low-income units, through
consolidation of prior loans and negotiation with property owners to extend the affordability of
the Sonoma Creekside and Bethlehem Towers projects by 55 years. However, in the same year
11 (one very low-income, nine low-income, and one moderate-income) units were converted to
market rate.
At an estimated cost of $320,000 to construct new affordable units (based on an estimate from
Burbank Housing), it would cost $279.4 million to replace the 873 units at risk from 2015 to
2025. Preserving the units would be considerably less expensive than building new units. At an
estimated cost of $200,000 per unit, it would cost $17.6 million to preserve the units. Funds that
could be available to preserve at-risk units include Community Development Block Grant funds.
Affordable housing developers with the legal and managerial capacity to acquire, build, and
manage affordable housing developments in Santa Rosa include Burbank Housing Development
Corporation, Bridge Housing Corporation, Urban Housing Communities, USA Properties,
Ecumenical Affordable Housing, Petaluma Ecumenical Properties, and Episcopal Homes.

4-4               REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
State law establishes that regional councils of government, in Santa Rosa‚Äôs case the Association
of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), shall identify for each city and county its ‚Äúfair share
allocation‚Äù of its most recent Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). Adopted in July
2013, the RHNA considers several factors in determining the allocation, including household
growth, employment growth, existing employment, and household and employment growth near
transit. Needs are assessed for the period from January 2014 to October 2022 (note that this
varies from the Housing Element planning period of 2015-2023). Cities and counties must
address these local shares of regional housing in each jurisdiction‚Äôs Housing Element.
State law also requires that the RHNA consider the need for housing at all income levels. ABAG
bases the total number of units by income category on the regional average distribution of
households across the various income categories. Table 4-32 shows the distribution of housing
needs by income category for Santa Rosa as assigned by ABAG. The income categories are
described in the preceding Housing Affordability section.

The following provides additional objectives and annual figures to explain the 8.5-year program
figures in the table above.
    1) Help facilitate the development of 56 extremely low-income, 56 very low-income, and 68
        low-income units annually to meet the ABAG Regional Housing Needs Allocation
        (supported by multiple policies, including Policies H-A-1, H-A-2, H-C-1, H-C-2, H-C-4,
        H-C-5, H-C-6, H-C-8, H-C-9, H-C-10, H-C-12, H-F-2, and H-F-3).
    2) Assist in the improvement and rehabilitation of 500 units annually (extremely low-, very
        low-, and low-income housing units) (supported by Policies H-B-1 and H-B-4).
    3) Promote development of 30 second units annually (supported by Policy H-C-7).
    4) Preserve the existing emergency shelter beds and units of transitional and supportive
        housing (supported by Policies H-D-1, H-D-8, and H-D-9). This includes 504 beds in
        emergency shelters, 351 units of transitional housing, and 385 units of permanent,
        supportive housing.
    5) Preserve the existing inventory of federally and locally funded affordable units including
        the 873 units with the potential to lose affordability from 2015 to 2025 (supported by
        Policy H-B-3).
    6) Preserve the 2,000 existing mobile homes, which are largely occupied by lower-income
        seniors (supported by Policy H-B-2).
                                                                                              4-55

4-5          SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
State law requires that Housing Elements include a parcel-specific inventory of sites that are
appropriately zoned, available, and suitable to provide opportunities for the provision of housing
for all segments of the community. As demonstrated in this section, there is sufficient land in the
city limits to meet identified housing needs.
Santa Rosa‚Äôs inventory of adequate sites lists individual sites by General Plan designation and
separates the sites which are currently zoned consistently with the General Plan and those which
are not zoned consistently. Each record also includes the site‚Äôs zoning, size, unit capacity, and
whether it is currently served with water and sewer service and located near transit.
The City‚Äôs land inventory was developed utilizing the City‚Äôs GIS land use database, which is
based on assessor‚Äôs data and field surveys. The database was updated in 2013. Land is available
throughout the city as well as in the Urban Growth Boundary and includes small and large sites.
This section includes tables that detail approved projects (Table 4-35), summarize land available
for residential development (Table 4-36), summarize land in the Urban Growth Boundary
available for development (Table 4-37), list sites relied upon to meet the extremely low-, very
low-, and low-income RHNA (sites zoned to allow 30 units per acre or more) (Table 4-38), and
summarize potential residential development opportunities on underutilized sites. Tables that list
parcels available for development in low- and medium-density land use categories are available
in the appendix to this element, in Tables 4-40 through 4-52.
CAPACITY TO MEET THE 2014‚Äì2022 RHNA
Table 4-34 illustrates the City‚Äôs capacity to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) for the 2014 to 2022 planning period. Approved multifamily projects will provide 464
units, 138 of which will be deed restricted for affordability. Land available for residential
development can accommodate over 13,000 units. As shown in the table and further described in
this section, Santa Rosa has available land to accommodate housing well in excess of the RHNA.

1 .The 196 units in approved multifamily projects are units that are planned within affordable projects with income restrictions. These projects are
Catalina Townhomes, Lantana Place, and Tierra Springs Family Apartments.
2. For purposes of this analysis, sites in the MHD, TVM, and TVMX land use categories are assumed to be appropriate for lower-income development
and capacity on all other sites is assumed to be appropriate for moderate- or above moderate-income housing. Affordable development is allowed
and encouraged on sites in all land use categories.
3. Identified underutilized sites allow densities of 30 to 40 units per acre. Based on allowed/anticipated densities, these sites are considered to be
appropriate for the development of lower-income housing for purposes of this analysis.
Approved Projects
Table 4-35 shows units in approved multifamily projects that are likely to be constructed early in
the planning period. Catalina Townhomes will offer affordable self-help homeownership
opportunities. Lantana Place and Tierra Springs are planned for affordable family housing, and
The Cannery and Tierra Springs are market-rate projects.

HOUSING
Sites designated Medium High Density, Transit Village Medium, and Transit Village Mixed Use
are viewed as the most likely locations for new affordable housing development in Santa Rosa
since these sites accommodate residential densities of 30 to 40 units per acre, with no upper limit
in the Transit Village Mixed Use designation. While the Medium Density land use category
includes a maximum density of 18 units per acre, lands with this designation have yielded most
of the affordable housing projects in Santa Rosa since 2000.
Zoning to implement the Medium High Density, Transit Village Medium, and Transit Village
Mixed Use land use designations include the R-3-30 and R-3-HD Multifamily Residential
zoning districts for Medium High, the Transit Village-Residential zoning district for Transit
Village Medium, and the Transit Village-Mixed zoning district for Transit Village Mixed Use.
As discussed in the constraints analysis, the development standards are designed to facilitate
high-density development.
In addition to sites with higher-density land use designations, there are 210 acres of undeveloped
land designated Medium Density and 80 acres of undeveloped land designated Mixed Use
(Retail & Business Services/Medium Density) in the city limits. Of this, 170 acres of Medium
Density land and 35 acres of Retail & Business Services/Medium Density land are zoned
consistently with the General Plan. The Medium Density range is 8 to 18 units per acre. These
zoned sites are expected to yield 3,008 units. The City expects affordable housing to be
developed on Medium Density sites consistent with past development activity but is not relying
on these sites to meet the RHNA. Tables 4-40 through 4-52 in the appendix provide detail
regarding these sites.
As illustrated in Table 4-36, lower-density sites in the city zoned consistently with the General
Plan can accommodate 5,664 units on 1,405 acres. The lands designated Very Low Density, Low
Density, Low Density/Open Space, and Medium Low Density can accommodate the moderate-
and above moderate-income need of 3,134 units identified for Santa Rosa. Additionally, 866
acres in these land use categories are not currently zoned consistently with the General Plan,
which could accommodate 1,968 units.

REALISTIC DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY
The City considered land use policies and recent development trends to determine realistic
development capacity. The Transit Village Mixed Use designation conservatively utilizes the
designation‚Äôs minimum density of 40 units per acre to determine a site‚Äôs unit capacity, although
it is expected that many sites will develop at higher densities due to their proximity to future rail
stations. The midpoint of 24 units per acre was used to estimate unit yields of vacant Medium
High Density sites, consistent with General Plan Policy LUL-F-2 that requires development in
this designation to build at this level of density or higher.
Considering recent development trends, the average density for Low Density developments is
6.7 units per acre and the average for Medium Low Density is 10 units per acre. The average
density in Medium Density developments is 14.6. These densities were utilized to determine the
realistic capacity of sites in those designations. The City assumed 1 unit per acre for Very Low
Density sites and 4 units per acre for Low Density/Open Space sites.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Potential Density Increases
The General Plan contains a policy that allows increases in density in some circumstances.
Medium Density sites can be developed at up to 30 units per acre if at least 20 percent of units
are affordable if the following criteria are met: (1) at least half the site is within one-quarter mile
of a potential rail transit station, transit mall or transfer station, or community shopping center;
(2) direct pedestrian access, to the extent feasible, from the development to the transit facility or
community shopping center is provided; (3) development is not fenced or walled off from the
surroundings; and (4) a high level of pedestrian and bicycle orientation, evidenced through
Design Review, is provided. The 128-unit Olive Grove Apartment project took advantage of this
policy to develop 76 very low-income, 50 low-income, and 2 unrestricted units at 28.4 units per
acre. This policy is available to Medium Density sites meeting the above-noted criteria.
Collaborative Development
A unique affordable housing project has been approved in unincorporated Sonoma County. The
Crossroads is located in Sonoma County‚Äôs jurisdiction but within Santa Rosa‚Äôs Urban Growth
Boundary and will require City utilities. Both Sonoma County and the City of Santa Rosa
committed funding to the project and intend to share, 50-50, credit toward each jurisdiction‚Äôs
Regional Housing Needs Allocation when the project is issued building permits. This example of
a city-county-affordable housing developer partnership benefits the community and will provide
an additional 39 units outside those included in Santa Rosa‚Äôs adequate sites analysis.

Priority Development Areas
The Priority Development Area (PDA) designation is available to jurisdictions that are planning
increased residential development around existing or planned transit. The Downtown Station
Area, the Roseland Area (located southwest of downtown), and the North Station Plan Area were
designated PDAs in 2007, 2011, and 2012, respectively. In addition, two Santa Rosa
transportation corridors are Priority Development Areas: Sebastopol Road and Mendocino/Santa
Rosa Avenue. New development with increased densities around these corridors will support use
of bus transit. PDA designation enhances the City‚Äôs eligibility for funding to implement the
plans.
POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS
Water and Sewer Service
Sewer and water service are not considered constraints to housing development during the
period, as outlined in the Constraints section of this element. All identified Medium High
Density sites are within 300 feet of existing sewer and water lines and are therefore considered
‚Äúserved‚Äù in this analysis. The majority of sites designated Very Low Density, Low Density, and
Medium Low Density are also considered served. The distance at which connection to the public
sewer and water system can be required is 300 feet.
Proximity to Transit
Distance from transit service is not considered a constraint. All of the higher-density sites are
within one-half mile of a CityBus transit stop. The majority of the lower-density sites are also
proximate to transit with the exception of Very Low Density sites, which are often in hillside and
more remote locations of the city, and Low Density/Open Space areas, which are located
generally near the edge of the city where less development has occurred due to the presence of
wetlands and natural resources.
Endangered Species
As discussed in the Natural Resources section, a majority of sites in the inventory are shown to
be within the range of the California tiger salamander (CTS), an endangered species. When the
listing of the salamander and its habitat were first made in 2003, a wide area including large parts
of southwest, northwest, and southeast Santa Rosa was identified. Since the listing, there has
been study and refinement of the CTS range, but no official mapping of the smaller area has been
completed. The exact number of sites that might be affected by the salamander is unknown at
this writing.
However, local agencies continue to address this issue and have developed the Santa Rosa Plain
Conservation Strategy, more fully described in the Constraints section of this element. The
strategy provides the biological framework for conservation of the endangered California tiger

salamander and four rare plant species found in conjunction with wetland habitat on the Santa
Rosa Plain. It identifies conservation areas and mitigation requirements for development projects
that will impact the habitat of these protected species. A series of mitigation banks have been
established that have allowed development to continue in affected areas. Mitigation at ratios of
1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 are required based on the project‚Äôs distance from the protected resources.
Underutilized or Developed Sites
To supplement the sites identified above, underutilized and developed sites that can develop at
30 units per acre or above are identified in Table 4-52 in the appendix. Four sites developed with
single-family units are identified in Table 4-38 since they are designated Medium High Density.
Development of these sites is discussed below.
Downtown Station Area Specific Plan Sites. The Downtown Station Area Specific Plan was
adopted in October 2007. The intent of the plan is to provide transit-supportive development by
intensifying uses within walking distance of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART)
station. Approximately 2,300 new units are assumed.
Within the Station Area Specific Plan boundary, 284 units are anticipated on vacant land and 562
units on underutilized land during the period. Interest has been expressed in development of four
of these mostly developed sites, supporting their potential to develop within the Housing
Element period. These potential projects also illustrate the City‚Äôs support of adaptive reuse of
buildings, particularly historic buildings, and the recent trend toward development of
underutilized or developed sites.
Four additional sites within the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan boundary, near the rail
corridor, have been identified. Interest in development was expressed on two of these parcels in
2008. Three are on Sebastopol Road and are generally low-intensity uses including warehousing
and auto storage (Sites 29 and 32). The sites identified are adjacent parcels totaling 4.7 acres.
They are large enough to be developed independently. The other site (Site 26) is on West Ninth
Street and includes 3.22 acres with a tilt-up building, a shed, and storage for large trucks.
All these sites are designated Transit Village Medium, which allow densities of 25 to 40 units
per acre. The four sites could contain between 198 and 316 units.
All of these sites are underutilized with low-intensity uses. The Sebastopol Road sites‚Äô
development is generally older warehouses, and on one site, an old mill exists. This building is in
disrepair and according to the Santa Rosa Fire Department, should be removed due to safety
issues.
Interest has been expressed in developing two of the Station Area sites: 1 Sebastopol Avenue
(Site 29) and 5 West Ninth Street (site 26). A concept for a residential project at about 40 units
per acre was prepared for the Sebastopol Avenue site. This interest, and the 2010 rezoning of
                                                                                               4-65

Station Area sites discussed below, makes these sites good candidates for development within
the planning period and catalysts for additional residential development.
Other Sites. The Sonoma County Water Agency moved its offices from its former site on West
College Avenue and is pursuing redevelopment of the site for workforce housing, including
some affordable housing units. This 7.46-acre site (Site 30), designated Medium High Density,
could accommodate from 134 to 223 units. The Water Agency intends to redevelop this site
within the planning period.
Three small sites, including four single-family dwellings, are included in the analysis since they
are adjacent to two larger, mostly vacant parcels (one parcel has three single-family dwellings)
designated Medium High Density (Site 8 ‚Äì five parcels). All five parcels are owned by the same
owner and total about 4.86 acres. In spring 2009, City staff met with an affordable housing
developer that is anticipating acquiring the site, removing all the existing structures, and
developing between 110 and 120 units. The single owner, the size of the site when including all
the parcels, its location near shopping and transit, and the City‚Äôs rezoning of the site make it a
good candidate for development in the planning period.
Potential Constraints
Downtown Station Area Specific Plan Sites. The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the
Downtown Station Area Specific Plan provides the most recent information regarding potential
development constraints in this area. Station area sites are served with water and sewer service,
though some water main resizing may need to occur to ensure adequate fire flow. In the
Sebastopol Road area, existing mains will likely need to be resized to accommodate new
development. Most existing sewer pipe is anticipated to contain higher flows associated with
new development.
The above analysis in the Constraints section regarding transit service and the California tiger
salamander also applies to the sites in the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan and the other
underutilized/developed sites.
The site at 1 Sebastopol Avenue is identified in the Downtown Station Area Specific Plan EIR as
a site containing hazardous materials. Leaking underground tanks have been removed from the
site and cleanup is ongoing for soil and water contamination. Other sites in the Downtown
Station Plan area are not identified as having hazardous materials.

4-6        PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
This Housing Element was prepared with public outreach and participation. The City held three
community workshops and a housing and service provider roundtable discussion to seek housing
solutions and solicit comments and recommendations regarding housing in Santa Rosa. The City
also sought feedback through an online survey, attended two meetings of the North Bay
Association of Realtors, and conducted consultations with Burbank Housing and the North Bay
Regional Center.
In addition, the City held public hearings following HCD‚Äôs review of the draft Housing Element.
The Housing Element was recommended for adoption by the Planning Commission on June 12,
2014 and adopted by the City Council on July 29, 2014.
COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS
The City held three workshops to obtain input from the community regarding housing needs,
existing policies, and potential updates to the housing program for the new planning period. All
of the workshops were held in the evening at Finley Community Center. Notices for the
meetings were sent to stakeholder groups by e-mail and standard mail. In addition, notices were
posted at City Hall and on the City‚Äôs website. The meeting location was ADA accessible and
served by public transit. Presentation materials were posted promptly to the City‚Äôs website
alongside contact information for City staff. Table 4-39 provides a partial list of groups notified
of input opportunities and meetings.

Workshop 1: October 23, 2013
City staff and consultants presented an overview of the Housing Element update, initial
demographic and housing market data, and the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA).
Following the presentation, attendees were invited to participate in an open house‚Äìstyle activity
designed to gather feedback on housing needs, programs, and services in Santa Rosa. The
activity also encouraged attendees to provide additional comments and ideas regarding the
Housing Element update. Meeting participants had opportunities to share suggestions and ask
questions directly of the project team and City staff during this activity. Following is a summary
of community input from this workshop.
Important housing-related services and services the City should support:
ÔÇ∑   Energy efficiency resources
ÔÇ∑   Farmworker housing
ÔÇ∑   Fair housing assistance
ÔÇ∑   Services for persons with physical or developmental disabilities
Barriers to a new or improved home:
ÔÇ∑   Affordability
ÔÇ∑   Investors driving up prices
ÔÇ∑   Price jump in the past year
ÔÇ∑   Homeowner/new buyer education
ÔÇ∑   Limits to energy efficiency improvements for historic properties
ÔÇ∑   Housing opportunities for the developmentally disabled
Other input and ideas:
ÔÇ∑   Transit-oriented development near SMART stations with affordable, mixed-use housing with
    child care facilities
ÔÇ∑   First-time homebuyer incentives
ÔÇ∑   Utilize vacant land slated for the Highway 12 extension for housing and bike paths/green
    space
                                                                                               4-69

HOUSING
Workshop 2: December 4, 2013
City staff and consultants presented an overview of Housing Element components and the update
process, findings from the first workshop and the service provider roundtable, and an overview
of actions taken to implement policies from the 2009 Housing Element. Attendees were provided
with worksheets to note their perspective on progress in meeting the Housing Element goals and
were engaged in a group discussion regarding the effectiveness of existing policies and their
appropriateness for the new planning period. Following is a summary of input:
Housing needs:
ÔÇ∑    Intergenerational housing, particularly for immigrant families
ÔÇ∑    Services and housing for domestic violence victims and families considered high risk by
     Child Protective Services
ÔÇ∑    Section 8 opportunities ‚Äì more landlords willing to accept tenants using vouchers
ÔÇ∑    Housing appropriate for families with children, including safe paths to schools and outdoor
     play spaces
ÔÇ∑    Micro-units and single-room occupancy units
ÔÇ∑    More opportunities for high-density housing
Potential constraints:
ÔÇ∑    The loss of redevelopment funds will have a big impact on the City‚Äôs ability to provide
     financial support; additional support will be needed from the business community,
     community services, and schools
Workshop 3: January 29, 2014
City staff and consultants presented a summary of the draft Housing Element, including public
outreach efforts, findings from the needs assessment, key implementation outcomes from the
2009 Housing Element, policies to eliminate and carry forward from the 2009 Housing Element,
and proposed new policies. Between presentation sessions, attendees were engaged in guided
discussions regarding housing needs, successful existing programs and resources, and ideas and
vision for future housing opportunities. Following is a summary of input:
Which members of the population are most in need of housing and services?
ÔÇ∑    Very low- and low-income households, particularly teens, persons with special needs,
     families, single persons, and seniors
4-70

                                                             SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
ÔÇ∑ Rental housing for many segments of the population, including young adults who are just
  starting life on their own
ÔÇ∑ Persons with special needs including the homeless, mentally ill, developmentally disabled,
  and former foster youth
ÔÇ∑ Affordable options for families such as workforce housing for the ‚Äúlower middle class‚Äù
What housing solutions are working well (programs, developments, services)?
ÔÇ∑ Fee deferral assistance for affordable and market-rate housing developments
ÔÇ∑ Burbank Housing (although having difficulties now due to economic downturn and funding
  cutbacks)
What is your vision for housing in the city?
ÔÇ∑ Fee reductions for market-rate and affordable projects
ÔÇ∑ Get appropriate zoning in place in advance; ensure that zoning is realistic and in keeping
  with the character of the existing neighborhood (density is not too high or too low)
ÔÇ∑ Make it profitable for developers to create projects of any type
ÔÇ∑ Improved services for persons with special needs
ÔÇ∑ New and improved parks
ÔÇ∑ Temporary container housing on vacant lots with off-grid utilities
ÔÇ∑ Housing with better access to transit, focus on creating high-quality village areas around
  SMART stations including rental opportunities
ÔÇ∑ Improved walkability
ÔÇ∑ Higher-density downtown with commensurate green areas
ÔÇ∑ Revamp the City‚Äôs policies regarding financial assistance for affordable housing
  developments; allocate enough money for a single project to make the development feasible
  and allow developers to leverage funds, rather than offering lesser amounts each year to
  support multiple projects
ÔÇ∑ De-emphasize housing for moderate- and above moderate-income households (the market
  will take care of this)
ÔÇ∑ Address the need for market-rate housing
                                                                                         4-71

HOUSING
ÔÇ∑    Scattered site, mixed-income housing developments
ÔÇ∑    Ensure that affordable projects are built in all areas of the city, rather than concentrating them
     in one quadrant (would like to see more built on the east side)
ÔÇ∑    Infill housing with reduced parking requirements
ÔÇ∑    More single-room occupancy ‚Äúhotels‚Äù
ÔÇ∑    Increase the amount of the Real Property Transfer Tax allocated to affordable housing
SERVICE PROVIDER ROUNDTABLE
The City hosted a roundtable discussion for housing and housing-related service providers on
November 6, 2013. The discussion was intended to provide an opportunity for housing and
service professionals to engage with City staff during work hours and provide specific and
technical information regarding their recent experiences and challenges.
The discussion was attended by representatives from Redwood Gospel Mission, Catholic
Charities, TLC Child and Family Services, Buckelew Programs, Housing Land Trust of Sonoma
County, Face 2 Face, and Sonoma County Continuum of Care.
The facilitated discussion focused on strengths, weaknesses/needs, opportunities, and threats.
The group identified the following:
ÔÇ∑    Strengths. A number of highly regarded organizations currently offer housing and housing-
     related service in Santa Rosa and in other nearby communities. These organizations include
     Burbank Housing, Catholic Charities, and Buckelew Programs. Because Burbank Housing
     was mentioned by many attendees and a representative from Burbank was not able to attend
     the roundtable, the City engaged Burbank in an individual consultation to learn more about
     the organization‚Äôs current plans, issues, and ideas.
     The group identified the Rosenberg and Tamayo Village facilities as examples of facilities
     that are working well. In addition, they noted rapid re-housing, Veterans Affairs Supportive
     Housing (VASH), THP Plus, and land trust homeownership as successful means of providing
     housing.
ÔÇ∑    Weaknesses/Needs. The group expressed that there is a strong need for affordable housing
     opportunities across a wide range of the population. They identified those with limited
     incomes including poor seniors, pre-elderly persons, underemployed persons, single persons,
     very low-income individuals and families, and teens and young moms. There is a continued
     need for homeless services, particularly for homeless young adults and those that are
     disabled, and a need for housing solutions that cater to the mentally ill, former foster youth,
     the post-prison population, and autistic girls.
4-72

                                                               SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
ÔÇ∑    Opportunities. Potential opportunities and solutions to assist in meeting the identified needs
     include specific housing types such as permanent supportive housing, workforce housing,
     housing with targeted on-site support, housing located in proximity to transit, and housing
     developments that offer large family units; collaboration between organizations, the City, and
     other jurisdictions; increased funding support through fees generated from landlords and/or
     investors coupled with City fee reductions and assistance for special needs housing;
     identification of incentives to encourage landlords to accept tenants who receive HUD
     assistance; and potential funding and support that may result from the Affordable Care Act
     and Jobs and Housing Act.
ÔÇ∑    Threats/Barriers. There are a number of barriers to capitalizing on the opportunities and
     meeting the needs listed above. The current housing market is particularly challenging in that
     prices are high and vacancies are low. Housing and service providers lack adequate facilities
     to serve larger numbers of people, and opportunities to acquire new sites are limited due to
     high costs and a lack of funding.
OTHER MEETINGS AND CONSULTATIONS
North Bay Association of Realtors Presentations: December 6 and 10, 2013
City staff provided two presentations to members of the North Bay Association of Realtors, the
first for a small group of 7 members on December 6 and the second at a member meeting
attended by approximately 150 local Realtors on December 10. Staff provided an overview of
the Housing Element and the update process, described findings from the needs assessments,
reviewed policy implementation actions from the 2009 Housing Element, and encouraged
attendees to participate in the online survey and attend the January workshop. Attendees
suggested that impact fees may be a barrier to housing development in Santa Rosa.
Burbank Housing Consultation: December 4, 2013
City staff and consultants met in person with Pascal Sisich, Director of Housing Development
for Burbank Housing. Burbank has worked closely with the City to develop numerous affordable
housing projects in Santa Rosa and has several projects pending. The purpose of the meeting was
to discuss Burbank‚Äôs perception of housing needs and opportunities in the community, identify
successes and strengths in Burbank‚Äôs working relationship with the City, and discuss any
constraints that may be inhibiting potential new projects.
Mr. Sisich noted that there continues to be a high demand for affordable housing in Santa Rosa.
The wait-list for Burbank Housing units in Santa Rosa contains over 1,600 households. Burbank
is generally focused on providing family rental housing, but sees a continued need for housing
for farmworkers, seniors, and veterans, and will often incorporate units to accommodate specific
household types into larger family projects.
                                                                                                4-73

HOUSING
The type of units developed is largely driven by the availability of financing. Funding new
projects has become extremely difficult in recent years, and affordable developers are
increasingly dependent on local subsidies.
Burbank has a positive relationship with the City and has not had any issues related to planning
or land use policies. Zoning standards such as open space and parking have worked well for
Burbank projects. The option to defer fees has been very helpful, as has permit fast-tracking. The
fast-track process allowed Burbank to meet a series of potentially difficult funding deadlines for
the recent Amorosa and Monte Vista projects. While current policies and standards do not inhibit
new housing, Burbank would support any policy to reduce costs (such as a reduction of fees for
affordable projects) and increase funding.
The ideal density range for garden-style apartments is 18 to 20 units per acre. Higher-density
apartments are generally most feasible at 28 to 30 units per acre. Larger projects are generally
better, allowing Burbank to spread costs across more units and provide on-site management and
services. The ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù is 60 to 100 units in a single development.
North Bay Regional Center Consultation: December 31, 2013
City staff and the consultant met in person with representatives from the North Bay Regional
Center to learn more about the center‚Äôs offerings and better understand the special housing needs
of persons with developmental disabilities in the community. The center serves approximately
8,500 clients in the counties of Sonoma, Napa, and Solano. It offers a voluntary service to clients
who become disabled before age 18 throughout their life span.
Representatives noted that children with developmental disabilities typically live at home
(although group homes serve those with more severe needs) and many of their needs are met
through school system programs. Adults have a greater need for assistance, and support provided
may include housing, work programs, and day programs.
The center works with housing assistance providers such as the North Bay Housing Coalition
and West Bay Housing Coalition, who interface directly with clients and families to identify
appropriate housing. Finding homes can be very difficult and affordability is a major issue, as
most clients have very limited incomes. The center and housing providers generally prefer
smaller-scale, scattered site housing solutions in which clients can be a part of an existing
neighborhood and community. Most housing is rental units and finding landlords who are
willing to work with the center‚Äôs housing providers is problematic, particularly in the current
housing market.
To facilitate housing opportunities for persons with developmental disabilities, cities can
encourage greater accessibility to units (the center is supportive of universal design) and
encourage greater housing opportunities in proximity to public transportation and services and
amenities.

ONLINE SURVEY
An online survey was available to the public via the City‚Äôs website for approximately six weeks
from November 20, 2013, to January 3, 2014. The City advertised the availability of the survey
via Facebook, e-mail, and announcements at workshops, the service provider roundtable,
consultations, and at the North Bay Association of Realtors presentation.
There were 65 survey responses. Among respondents, approximately 66 percent work in Santa
Rosa, 17 percent were local business owners, 31 percent represented local community
organizations, and 3 percent were developers. Approximately 75 percent of respondents
currently live in a single-family home, and 80 percent selected single-family as the type of home
they would like to live in. Approximately 16 percent currently live in an apartment or townhome,
and 23 percent selected apartment or townhome as the housing type they would like to live in.
Approximately 32 percent of respondents currently live in a home located within walking
distance to services and amenities, and approximately 55 percent chose this as a desirable
feature.
When asked what, if anything, stands between the respondent and a new or renovated home, the
majority (approximately 56 percent) cited issues related to money, including the high cost of
housing and the lack of affordable housing options.
Most respondents noted energy efficiency resources, age-in-place resources, and services for the
disabled as those that were most important to them or their friends and family. Respondents most
frequently selected emergency shelters/homeless services, energy efficiency resources, and
services for the disabled as services that the City should support.
Additional comments:
ÔÇ∑   Santa Rosa needs affordable housing integrated with market-rate housing; avoid
    concentrating affordable housing and services in certain areas, particularly the downtown
ÔÇ∑   The rental market is particularly difficult right now‚Äîlow vacancies and high costs; there is a
    need for more rental units; consider rent controls/caps on increases
ÔÇ∑   Encourage unique housing types such as eco-villages, co-housing, and live/work spaces for
    artists
ÔÇ∑   Middle-income families are being forced out of the city due to the lack of affordability
ÔÇ∑   Focus on rehabilitating and maintaining the existing housing stock; increase code
    enforcement and encourage energy efficiency improvements, particularly in multifamily
    developments
ÔÇ∑   Provide more homeownership assistance programs
                                                                                              4-75

HOUSING
ÔÇ∑    Need additional support and assistance for the homeless, particularly a temporary winter
     shelter; focus on providing permanent homes for the homeless, rather than temporary shelters
ÔÇ∑    There is a need for additional single-room occupancy units or one-bedroom units for disabled
     persons and single persons on fixed incomes
ÔÇ∑    Support mixed-use, live/work high-density development near the SMART rail station areas
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Following receipt of a letter of conditional compliance from HCD, the City held public hearings
to present the draft as well as recommended revisions to the Planning Commission and City
Council for review and adoption. Hearings were advertised in the newspaper and on the City‚Äôs
website. In addition, City staff notified all parties that had expressed interest in the Housing
Element update and/or participated in any previous event.
The Planning Commission unanimously recommended the draft Housing Element (as well as
drafted revisions) for adoption at a public hearing on June 12, 2014. The City Council
unanimously adopted the Housing Element, with revisions as presented, at a public hearing on
July 29, 2014.

4-7         HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Table 4-53, in the appendix to this element,
outlines the City‚Äôs accomplishments in
implementing Housing Element programs
since 2007. Accomplishments are quantified
where appropriate.
As illustrated by this table, the City of Santa
Rosa has made a diligent, consistent effort to
implement Housing Element policies.
Significant progress has been made in Amorosa Village, completed in 2010, provides 150 affordable homes
implementing housing policies and in for individuals and families.
providing assistance for the preservation,
rehabilitation, and development of affordable housing for lower-income and/or special needs
households. Because of their effectiveness, many of these policies remain in this Housing
Element.
For analysis of the effectiveness and appropriateness of these policies, the main goal is reviewed.
Quantification of each policy implementing the goal is included in Table 4-53.
Goal H-A: Meet the housing needs of all Santa Rosa residents.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective in that the Zoning Code was revised
following adoption of the General Plan to implement its policies, additional higher-density land
was designated through General Plan amendments approved during the Housing Element period,
and conservation and rehabilitation of the city‚Äôs housing stock has continued. The City
maintained adequate sites to accommodate housing development at a wide range of densities and
rezoned additional sites zoned for higher-density housing. The Downtown Station Area Specific
Plan and the North Santa Rosa Station Area Specific Plan, both adopted during the planning
period, provide land use and policy direction for higher-density, transit-oriented development
near the planned Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) stations. This goal has been
retained in the element, and most of these policies are deemed appropriate and have been revised
and included as well.
Goal H-B: Maintain and rehabilitate, as needed, the existing affordable housing supply within Santa Rosa.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective in that numerous units have been
rehabilitated during the planning period. The City worked proactively to promote and assist with
the maintenance and preservation of existing housing units through programs such as the
Neighborhood Revitalization Program, Housing Quality Standard Code compliance through the
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, and redevelopment tax increment funds (prior to the
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency) and mortgage revenue bonds. In addition, the City
monitored and worked to preserve units at risk of converting to market-rate rents in three
                                                                                                       4-77

HOUSING
affordable housing developments. The goal has been retained, as are a number of the policies.
However, some policies have been removed or revised to reflect the lack of funding available to
support the Mobile Home Repair Loan Program and Housing Rehabilitation Conservation
Program.
Goal H-C: Expand the supply of housing available to lower-income households.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective. Through the Housing Allocation Plan
(HAP), Santa Rosa Housing Trust, long-range planning, and collaboration with affordable
housing developers, the City issued permits for 706 lower-income residences from 2007 to 2012.
This figure includes both units that are deed restricted for affordability to households within a
certain income category, and unrestricted units that were determined to be affordable based on a
review of rents and sales prices in comparison to affordability. Among these units, 456 were
deed-restricted for long-term affordability. Restricted units were provided on-site under HAP
requirements, and the City provided funding assistance through HAP fees, CDBG and HOME
funds, redevelopment low/moderate funds (prior to the dissolution of the Redevelopment
Agency), and real property transfer taxes. A commercial linkage fee was not adopted because the
City Council did not find that it was the best direction for the community at that time. Goal H-C-
1 remains appropriate and has been retained in this element, as have several of the policies.
Goal H-D: Provide housing for households with special needs.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective in that the City adopted several Zoning
Code amendments to better facilitate the development of housing appropriate for persons with
special needs. The code was amended to allow emergency shelters by right (without a
discretionary use permit) in the General Commercial zone, allow supportive and transitional
housing as residential uses, and update the density bonus ordinance. In addition, the City
continued to fund and support services and facilities to serve the homeless population. Goal
H-D-1 remains appropriate and has been retained in this element, as have many of the policies.
Goal H-E: Promote equal access to housing.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective in that the City continued to fund Fair
Housing of Sonoma County and Petaluma People Services Center to ensure equal access to
housing. Petaluma People Services Center has been proactive in providing information,
assistance, and referral services. Goal H-E-1 and the policies supporting equal access to housing
are appropriate and retained in this element.
Goal H-F: Remove constraints to very low- and low-income housing production.
The policies to implement this goal have been effective. Whenever appropriate and feasible, the
City implemented policies to mitigate potential governmental constraints to housing
development and facilitate the construction of new affordable housing units. The City provided
expedited review and processing for affordable housing development projects, including fast-

                                                                     SANTA ROSA GENERAL PLAN
tracked application processing and deferred development fees. Goal H-F-1 remains relevant and
has been retained in this Housing Element, as have most of the supporting policies.
Goal H-G: Develop and rehabilitate energy-efficient residential units.
The City took significant steps to improve energy efficiency in new and existing residential units
through the adoption of CALGreen Tier 1 standards and a Climate Action Plan. CALGreen
standards apply to all new residential (and nonresidential) buildings. The standards call for
efficient building design and the use of conservation technologies. The Climate Action Plan
identifies methods to retrofit existing buildings to improve energy efficiency. The existing
policies are appropriate and are retained in this element.
                                                                                              4-79

4-8         GOALS AND POLICIES
The following goals and policies represent the City‚Äôs housing program for the 2015 to 2023
period. The program includes goals, which are guides to specific actions. Policies are the specific
actions, and following each is a target date for completing the action along with the entity
responsible. Where applicable, funding sources are identified. The Departments of Community
Development and Economic Development and Housing are primarily responsible for
implementing the housing program. In the case of ordinance amendments, stakeholder
participation will be sought in the process to ensure public input.
H-A         Meet the housing needs of all Santa Rosa residents.
H-A-1       Ensure adequate sites are available for development of a variety of housing types for
            all income levels, throughout the City, such as single- and multifamily units, mobile
            homes, transitional housing, and homeless shelters.
            Time Frame: Ongoing, review annually
            Entity: Department of Community Development
H-A-2       Pursue the goal of meeting Santa Rosa‚Äôs housing needs through increased densities,
            when compatible with existing neighborhoods. Development of existing and new
            higher-density sites must be designed in context with existing, surrounding
            neighborhoods. The number of affordable units permitted each year and the adequacy
            of higher-density sites shall be reported as part of the General Plan Annual Review
            report.
            Time Frame: Ongoing
            Entity: Department of Community Development
H-A-3       Promote conservation and rehabilitation of the existing housing stock and discourage
            intrusion of incompatible uses into residential neighborhoods which would erode the
            character of established neighborhoods or lead to use conflicts.
            Time Frame: Ongoing
            Entity: Department of Community Development
H-A-4       Meet and confer with Sonoma County Planning staff on a regular basis to address
            housing needs of lower-income and special needs groups and to coordinate regarding
            issues including infrastructure, zoning and land use, annexations, community
            acceptance strategies, homeless shelters, farmworkers, persons with disabilities,
            environmental issues, funding, and impact fees.

  This element contains goals and policies related to the transportation system in
  Santa Rosa, including streets and highways, the public transit network, bicycle
  routes, pedestrian connections, and a commuter rail line. Goals and policies are
  identified, addressing each of the alternative modes with the objective of creating a
  safe, efficient, and convenient transportation system.
  5-1      VISION
  In 2035, cars, buses, trains, bicycles, and walking are all options for moving
  around Santa Rosa. Transportation management programs and bicycle/pedestrian
  improvements have reduced the number of single-occupancy cars on regional/
  arterial streets. New development projects provide funding for roadway, transit,
  bicycle, and pedestrian improvements, in addition to the city‚Äôs Capital Improvement
  Program. Complete streets provide safe access for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists,
  and transit users of all ages and abilities. Many regional/arterial streets feature
  landscaped medians and other streetscape amenities. Roadways located at the
  edges of the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) feature distinct landscaping and signs
  announcing entry into Santa Rosa.
  Natural features and vistas have been preserved along scenic roadways within
  Santa Rosa. Natural topography, landscape forms (e.g., rock outcroppings), tree
  stands, and vegetation provide a pleasant driving experience through the city.
  Traffic calming techniques have been implemented within neighborhoods to
  ensure safe streets and sidewalks. Bicycle and pedestrian improvements include
  better connections between neighborhoods and access to shopping, schools, and
  recreational facilities. Multi-use paths are developed along local creeks, providing
  off-street linkages for Santa Rosans.
  Transit stops and shelters are provided within new residential neighborhoods,
  and more convenient locations adjacent to shopping and employment centers.
  Frequent, convenient transit service allows local residents to use transit as an
  alternative to driving. Many regional and local transit routes stop at the Downtown
  Transit Mall, thereby allowing transit users access to the region. Connections
  between transit hubs and rail stations are seamless.

5-2      ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
This General Plan classification system for streets represents a major departure from the
conventional approach to street design, which is based upon a hierarchal system that focuses
on concentrating automobile traffic onto a limited number of major streets. Under the
classification system, the functional emphasis will shift from concentration to dispersal. A
greater concern for providing equality among all modes of transportation ‚Äì particularly
pedestrians and bicyclists ‚Äì is reflected in the classification system as well as the importance
of the streetscape to the character and quality of the public realm that leads to Complete
Streets. Complete Streets provide a safe network of transportation options. Complete Streets
are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists,
and transit riders of all ages and abilities are able to safely move along and across a complete
street. These multimodal transportation options are examples of how the city is addressing
GHG emissions.
The classification system, street categories, and definitions are described below. Figure 5-1
illustrates the city‚Äôs existing and proposed roadway network.
         ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Highways. Highways supplement the city‚Äôs local roadway system by carrying long-
              distance traffic at relatively high speeds to and through Santa Rosa. Highway 101
              is the major north-south route of the North San Francisco Bay Area, and Highway
              12 is a major east-west route in Sonoma County. These highways serve cross-town
              and intra-county trips, and provide regional linkages to the Bay Area, the coast, and
              northern California. Highways are the responsibility of the State Department of
              Transportation (CalTrans), not the City of Santa Rosa.
         ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Regional Streets. Boulevards and parkways connect town centers to the greater
              region. Boulevards and parkways are essential for combining motorized and non-
              motorized traffic in safe, efficient, welcoming environments. Since the success of
              commerce and traffic circulation depends
              on effective street design, much attention
              has to be paid to the orderly and balanced
              movement of all transportation modes on
              boulevards and parkways. On these streets,
              car traffic, delivery trucks, emergency
              responders, and transit must operate with
              high levels of efficiency. Pedestrians and
              bicyclists must also be welcomed and are
              in greater need of support, due to higher
              vehicle speeds and amounts of traffic. The Fountaingrove Parkway serves as a major
              Regional Streets category includes the arterial street in northeastern Santa Rosa.

   ¬ª   Boulevards. Boulevards provide multi-lane access to commercial and mixed use
       buildings and they carry regional traffic. For these reasons, speeds on these
       streets are higher (30-35 mph). Boulevards have medians, bike lanes and they
       may have sections with parking to support adjacent commerce, parks, schools,
       and other attractions along their route.
   ¬ª   Parkways. Parkways bring people into town, or they carry traffic through natural
       areas. Parkways are not designed to accommodate adjoining development.
       Roadway speeds may be 45 mph or higher. When parkways enter town, they
       become boulevards, and speeds are reduced to 30 to 35 mph. Bike lanes are
       typically included in Parkways, although it may also be separated.
ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Transitional Streets. Transitional streets connect residential neighborhoods to
   commercial centers and service commercial districts. Avenues and Main Streets are
   transitional roadways. In addition to providing access, they carry large and more
   diverse amounts of traffic. Avenues and main streets host deliveries and efficient
   emergency responses. They anchor neighborhood commerce, serve bicyclists and
   pedestrians, and improve transit operations. Transitional streets must operate at
   low to moderate speeds, since many people live, work, shop, and play within these
   street environments. Parking is found on many, but not all avenues and main
   streets. The Transitional Streets category includes the following street types:
   ¬ª   Avenues. Avenues connect neighborhoods to town centers, commercial centers,
       and other neighborhoods. A raised center median is preferred allowing for
       a triple canopy of street trees. Avenues are richly landscaped, since they are
       civic spaces that serve as gateways to town centers. Since avenues serve as the
       transitions between neighborhoods and commercial districts, speeds should be
       kept low, typically 35 mph. Avenues also serve as major transit routes. Avenues
       may circulate around a square or neighborhood park.
   ¬ª   Main Streets. Main streets provide access to neighborhood commercial and
       mixed use buildings and districts. On-street parking is very desirable and
       recommended. Low speeds (25-30 mph) are desirable to protect pedestrians
       and enhance commercial activity. To help pedestrians safely cross streets and
       to calm traffic, bulbouts (wider sidewalks that extend into the parking lane) or
       raised pavement should be provided at intersections and if blocks are long, at
       mid-block crossings.
ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Local Streets. Local streets, which form the heart of quiet neighborhoods, function
   primarily to provide access to neighborhood destinations and make numerous
   connections within neighborhoods. All of these streets provide vehicle, pedestrian,
                                                                                          5-3

              and utility access. Traffic speed of not more than 15-25 mph is appropriate for
              such streets. A measure of how successful a local street is performing its intended
              function is how well it adds to the quality of the neighborhood by offering access,
              parking, tranquility, and safety. Local streets should provide indirect connection
              between Transitional or Regional Streets. Long straight connections will encourage
              ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù traffic through neighborhoods. The Local Streets category includes the
              following street types:
              ¬ª   Trails. Trails are pedestrian path connectors through neighborhoods or along
                  creeks not intended for motorized vehicles. They often follow their own
                  independent rights-of-way or utility corridors. Serving as an alternative
                  transportation system, trails connect many homes to parks, schools, transit
                  stops, join cul-de-sacs, provide access to transitional streets, and other common
                  destinations. Trails can provide access into commercial districts, for added access
                  to more distant commercial districts, employment centers and major transit
                  hubs. Neighborhood trails also make connection to natural areas and parks,
                  and should provide access to regional greenways and open spaces. In healthy
                  neighborhoods, trails may comprise 20-40 percent of the total residential
                  connectors. Trails should provide pedestrian amenities at intervals such as
                  shade, benches, water fountains, and restrooms. Sitting areas with benches at
                  vista points and along creeks should be included.
              ¬ª   Alleys. Alleys are slow speed (10 mph) secondary access ways running behind
                  and sometimes between rows of houses, or commercial buildings. Alleys can
                  provide service workers easy access to utilities and sanitation and give residents
                  easy access to garages, backyards, and any accessory units.
              ¬ª   Lanes. These narrow roads (typically 16-20 feet wide) are useful in accessing
                  small numbers of homes (up to approximately 12 homes). Parking, when
                  needed, can be placed on one side or in parking bays. One-way lanes can operate
                  around parks or nature preserves. They also work well as two-way facilities in
                  many other contexts. Landscaping and sidewalks fill the remainder of the
                  available public right-of-way.
              ¬ª   Neighborhood Streets. Neighborhood streets are the most common type of access
                  road in healthy neighborhoods. This is the preferred street to service residential
                  areas when the street does not exceed 100 homes or 1,000 average daily trips
                  (ADT). Streets are short, terminating in two to six blocks. These streets can also
                  encircle a square or other public space. On-street parking is encouraged as it
                  helps to provide needed parking and slows traffic.

            ¬ª   Minor Streets. Minor streets are utilized when the traffic volume exceeds 1,000
                average daily trips. Although efforts should be made to create interconnected
                street layouts which disperse traffic, in many cases a concentration of traffic is
                unavoidable.
Additional detail on street categories and street types can be found in the city‚Äôs Design
Guidelines.
A variety of transportation improvements to the city‚Äôs roadway system are planned. The
appendix following this element includes a list of planned regional/arterial streets in
2035. These represent a compilation of improvements from various specific plans, long
range transportation plans, and other documents. Proposed roadway and/or intersection
improvements include, but are not limited to:
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Widening of Highway 101 to six lanes and improvements to the Bellevue Avenue
            and Todd Road interchanges;
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Expansion of Highway 12 interchanges at Hoen Avenue, Fulton/South Wright Road
            interchanges;
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Extension of Farmers Lane and Northpoint Parkway; and
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Widening of Bellevue Avenue, Dutton Avenue, Petaluma Hill Road, Sebastopol Road,
            and Stony Point Road.
Despite proposed improvements, levels of service (LOS) on several of the city‚Äôs regional/
arterial streets and highways are projected to degrade in the long term. LOS measures
the relative ease or difficulty of traffic movement at designated points along a roadway.
General Plan policies support construction of roadway improvements to accommodate new
developments, and improve motor vehicle LOS on congested roadways. General Plan policies
also encourage alternative modes of transportation be incorporated into the city circulation
network which adhere to Complete Street objectives.
5-3     SCENIC ROADS
Several roads in Santa Rosa have unique scenic qualities because of their natural setting as well
as historical and cultural features. A scenic road is a highway, road, drive, or street that, in
addition to its transportation function, provides opportunities for the enjoyment of natural
and man-made scenic resources. Scenic roads direct views to areas of exceptional beauty,
natural resources or landmarks, or historic or cultural interest. The aesthetic values of scenic
routes can be protected and enhanced by regulations governing the development of property
and the placement of outdoor advertising.
                                                                                                  5-7

T R A N S P O R TAT I O N
The following lists Santa Rosa roadways which are designated as scenic roads by the General
Plan. These roads have the potential to remain scenic with appropriate and thoughtful urban
planning.
     1. Melita Road
     2. Los Alamos Road
     3. Calistoga Road (north of Badger Road)
     4. Highway 12 (from Highway 101 west to Fulton Road)

While scenic roads have traditionally run through natural open-space areas, they can also
include routes that pass through interesting, unique urban sites or neighborhood boundaries.
A scenic highway or road can also include related facilities within the scenic corridor, such as
bicycle and pedestrian pathways, trails, parks, and roadside stops. Preservation of the scenic
character, aesthetic value, and natural/cultural integrity of Santa Rosa‚Äôs roadways requires
special planning, as provided in General Plan policies.
5-4     COMMUTER RAIL
Development of commuter rail service along the
Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way could
partially reduce traffic congestion created by workers
traveling to Santa Rosa. In 1998, a commission made
up of local public officials was formed to evaluate
feasibility of commuter rail and develop plans for a
‚Äústart-up‚Äù level of rail service. Plans being considered
envision several rail stops in the Santa Rosa area, with
service available between the northern and southern
ends of the county. General Plan policies support Depot station is one of several potential rail
commuter rail service, including accommodating station stops in Santa Rosa.
bicycle and pedestrian pathways, by requiring the
establishment of transit supportive land uses in areas within close proximity to rail station
sites.
5-5     TRANSIT NETWORK
Santa Rosa CityBus is the principal transit service within Santa Rosa. Operated by the city,
CityBus provides regularly scheduled fixed route service to residential neighborhoods, major
activity centers, and facilities that serve transit-dependent populations (i.e., the elderly and
disabled). All regularly scheduled service vehicles are equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps
and are accessible to disabled persons. Other transit service providers that operate in the Santa
Rosa area include:
        ‚Ä¢   Golden Gate Transit
        ‚Ä¢   Sonoma County Transit
        ‚Ä¢   Mendocino Transit Authority
        ‚Ä¢   Napa Vine
                                                                                                  5-9

         ‚Ä¢    Greyhound Lines
         ‚Ä¢    Amtrak California
         ‚Ä¢    Private shuttles/charter buses (to airports/regional destinations, for trips)
In addition, the city contracts for paratransit services to provide curb-to-curb transportation
for eligible elderly and disabled persons who cannot use fixed route bus services.
Transit service is coordinated at four transit hubs within the city: the Downtown Transit Mall,
Southwest Community Park, Eastside Transfer Station (Montgomery Village) and Westside
Transfer Station. These facilities allow bus riders to make timely transfers between CityBus
routes or routes operated by other transit service providers. To increase and encourage
ridership in the future, General Plan policies ensure that transit routes and facilities are
conveniently located and easily accessible to all riders.
5-6      BICYCLE FACILITIES
Currently, there are approximately 174 miles of designated bikeways that provide intra-area
and cross-town connections to recreational facilities, employment areas, schools, and other
major activity centers. Bikeways, as illustrated in Figure 5-2, are classified by one of three
categories:
         ‚Ä¢    Class I Bikeways (bike path) provide for bicycle travel on a right-of-way completely
              separated from any street or highway.
         ‚Ä¢    Class II Bikeways (bike lane) provide a striped lane for one-way travel on a street or
              highway.
         ‚Ä¢    Class III Bikeways (bike route by sign) provide for shared use with pedestrian and auto
              traffic.
Of the city‚Äôs total bikeways, 47 miles are designated as Class III, 87 miles are designated as
Class II, 35 miles are designated as Class I, and 5.6 miles are designated as a bicycle boulevard.
The City of Santa Rosa‚Äôs Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan outlines future bikeway
improvements. The seven criteria used to prioritize pedestrian and bikeway projects include
traffic volume, collision history, current demand, community interest, closure of a gap/
increases connectivity, technical ease of implementation and land use. Implementation of
bicycle connections, both north-south and east-west, throughout the city will enable safer and
more efficient bicycle circulation for Santa Rosans in 2035.

5-7      PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Walking is the most basic and reliable form of transportation. The design of pedestrian-
friendly neighborhoods, with well-connected streets and sidewalks and nearby shopping,
encourages walking. The installation of sidewalks for pedestrian travel has long been a
requirement of new development in the city; therefore, most neighborhoods have sidewalks.
There are sidewalks in many of the older neighborhoods (pre-1950s) in and around downtown.
The exception is in some rural neighborhoods, which lack continuous pedestrian paths. Recent
city efforts have included provision of safe pedestrian crossings for school routes.
Provision of continuous sidewalks and off-street paths encourages walking to local recreation
facilities, schools, and shopping areas as an alternative to driving. Development of mixed use
neighborhood shopping centers also contributes to pedestrian travel to and within shared
destinations.
5-8      GOALS AND POLICIES
T-A             Provide a safe and sustainable transportation system.
T-A-1           Expand Transportation Systems Management (TSM) programs for employers,
                and reduce peak hour single-occupancy automobile trips through the following
                techniques.
                ‚Ä¢    Promotion of transit service;
                ‚Ä¢    Staggering of work shifts;
                ‚Ä¢    Flextime (e.g. 9/80 work schedule);
                ‚Ä¢    Telecommuting;
                ‚Ä¢    Carpool and vanpool incentives;
                ‚Ä¢    Provision of bicycle facilities;
                ‚Ä¢    Trip reduction incentive programs;
                ‚Ä¢    Parking disincentives for single-occupant vehicles; and
                ‚Ä¢    Car sharing programs.
T-A-2           Work with employers and business associations to meet employee trans-
                portation needs that will lead to reduction of the use of single occupant vehicles.
T-A-3           Evaluate corridor levels of service (LOS) and develop strategies to improve
                service levels.
                                                                                                   5-13

T R A N S P O R TAT I O N
T-A-4             Cooperate with CalTrans and public transit providers to establish park-and-ride
                  lots.
T-A-5             Pursue cooperation between local and regional transportation agencies to
                  coordinate multi-modal connections throughout the city.
                  Examples of multi-modal connections include timed transfers connecting different
                  transit routes and future rail service, bicycle parking and lockers at transit centers,
                  and transit stops at park-and-ride lots.
T-A-6             Support tourist rail excursions on the Northwestern Pacific Railroad as well as
                  rail service for commuting and other travel purposes.
T-A-7             Expand non-motorized and bus infrastructure throughout the city such that
                  greater amenities exist for cyclists, pedestrians and transit users in order to
                  promote a healthy, sustainable city and further reduce GHG emissions.

6      PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
  The purpose of this element is to plan for a variety of public service needs, including
  parks and recreation, public schools, police services, fire protection, water supply
  and conservation, sewer and solid waste, and stormwater management. The
  following sections discuss existing public services and facilities, their respective
  managing agencies, anticipated future demand on these services, and planned
  expansions or improvements.
  6-1     VISION
  In 2035, a high standard of public services is available to Santa Rosa residents.
  Infrastructure keeps pace with new development, without jeopardizing the level
  of service to existing residents. All residences are located within walking distance
  of neighborhood park facilities with playground equipment appropriate for tots
  and school age children, and picnic areas, while playing fields and clubhouses are
  featured at the larger community and citywide parks. Linear parks along Santa
  Rosa‚Äôs network of creeks connect regional open spaces such as the Laguna trail
  system and Taylor Mountain. School facilities are an integral part of neighborhoods,
  and offer superior educational opportunities, community gathering places and
  additional recreational areas.
  The city‚Äôs police and fire personnel ensure the safety of local residents.
  Improvements to the water and sewer systems accommodate new and infill
  development within the Urban Growth Boundary. Increased recycling efforts
  and water reclamation programs significantly improve the city‚Äôs sustainability,
  as fewer resources are consumed. Flooding hazards are minimal, as storm drain
  improvements are made to accommodate urban runoff. Together, the public
  services and facilities provided by the city enhance the quality of life of Santa Rosa‚Äôs
  residents and employees.
  6-2     PARKS AND RECREATION
  Public plazas and gathering places and neighborhood, community, citywide and
  special purpose parks and facilities are all important components of Santa Rosa in
  2035, both as recreational and as aesthetic resources that contribute to the city‚Äôs
  character. In addition to the established older parks in the east side of the city, new
  parks are being developed to meet the diverse needs of a growing community.

P U B L I C S E R V I C E S A N D FA C I L I T I E S
In 2008, the City of Santa Rosa had a total of approximately 531 acres of neighborhood and
community parks, 170 acres of undeveloped parkland, and 14 additional community and/or
recreational facilities. Table 6-1 presents existing (2008) parks facilities and acreages, while
Figure 6-1 illustrates them graphically. Table 6-2 lists undeveloped city-owned parkland. Two
additional parks-Spring Lake County Park (320 acres, including the 72-acre lake) and Annadel
State Park (5,000 acres)-are not operated by the City of Santa Rosa; however, they enhance and
complement recreational opportunities available to Santa Rosans.
Santa Rosa‚Äôs parkland is found mainly in neighborhood and community parks. Neighborhood
parks are located within about one-half mile of the residents they serve, and are between two
and ten acres in size. Facilities at neighborhood parks often include picnic areas and playground
equipment. At about 10 to 25 acres, community parks contain more specialized recreational
facilities such as ball fields and tennis courts. Community parks are sited so that most residents
will be no further than one mile from a community park facility. The City of Santa Rosa also has
several citywide parks (i.e. Howarth Park) and special purpose parks and facilities (i.e., Luther
Burbank Home and Gardens) which are enjoyed by residents throughout the city.
In addition to neighborhood, community, and citywide parks and special purpose parks and
facilities, the City of Santa Rosa supports the development of public plazas and gathering
places that are generally less that two acres in size; they contain vegetation (trees, grass, and
greenery) when possible and provide connectivity to pathways and trails or commercial centers.
They are generally developed in areas where adequate space is not available for a neighborhood
park. While public plazas and gathering places are not part of the park standard of 3.5 acres
per thousand residents, the city encourages the development of these spaces to provide access
to the wider network of parklands. The city supports the development of public plazas and
gathering places within one-quarter mile of the residents they serve.
Open space areas of different sizes are also integrated into many of the city‚Äôs parks. These areas
have minimal improvements such as benches or picnic tables but add to the variety of resources
and activities that can be enjoyed within the city‚Äôs park system.
The city maintains a park standard of six acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. Within
the standard, the ratio of city parks, school recreational land, and open space is determined
by City Council resolution. Currently, the city‚Äôs standard includes 3.5 acres of city parks,
(neighborhood, community, citywide and special purpose parks and facilities) per 1,000
residents, plus 1.4 acres of publicly accessible school recreational land and 1.1 acres of public-
serving open space.
Public plazas and gathering spaces are generally developed at the same time that land uses are
developed at an urban scale. They are generally privately owned, but are publicly accessible.

Larger open space areas in the city are generally developed in association with agencies such as
the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District and the Sonoma County
Water Agency under joint acquisition and maintenance agreements. Open space lands are set
aside for a variety of purposes such as watershed and resource protection. These areas have
few improvements but generally allow some public access, primarily for passive recreation such
as hiking and wildlife viewing. These areas are counted as part of the standard of 1.1 acres of
public-serving open space per 1,000 residents indicated above.

within the 25-year General Plan timeframe the
city‚Äôs parks and recreation facilities will total
approximately 864 acres (see Table 6-3). Based on a 2035 population of 233,520 the city parks
portion of the standard will be 3.7 acres of parks per 1,000 residents. The parks ratio exceeds
the city standard due to two large recreational amenities that are being expanded: Youth
Community Park and A Place to Play.

6-3     EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
The Santa Rosa public school system is comprised of a middle and high school district and nine
elementary districts. Santa Rosa City High School District is a 7-12 district, and the elementary
school districts serve grades K-6. The elementary districts include Bellevue, Bennett Valley,
Piner-Olivet, Rincon Valley, Roseland, Santa Rosa City, and Wright. Additionally, the boundaries
of Mark West and Kenwood Elementary School Districts overlap the Santa Rosa Urban Growth
Boundary (UGB). Students from the elementary school districts later attend Santa Rosa City
High School‚Äôs facilities.
Within the Santa Rosa UGB, there are a total of 33 elementary schools, five middle schools, five
comprehensive high schools, and one continuation high school. School locations are illustrated
in Figure 6-2. During the 2006-2007 school year, the Santa Rosa City School District served
an estimated 16,400 students from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Table 6-5 displays
enrollment numbers for the various school districts in the Santa Rosa UGB.

In response to projected demand for new middle and elementary schools during the next
25 years, the city has identified potential school facilities in Figure 6-2. Two middle school
sites and four elementary school sites are identified in the event that they are needed to
accommodate Santa Rosa‚Äôs student population. The proposed locations are not site specific,
they merely indicate a school is needed in the vicinity. General Plan policies seek to maximize
safe walking and bicycling routes to school sites, and provide a wide range of library facilities.

The Santa Rosa Fire Department is responsible for protecting life, property, and the
environment from fire, explosion, and hazardous materials incidents. The Fire Department
responds to calls including structure, wildland, and other fires; alarm responses; medical
emergencies; hazardous materials incidents; automobile accidents; and citizen calls for
assistance.
The city operates ten fire stations - including the Roseland contract station - which are
strategically located throughout the community to
provide timely response. In addition, the city has an
agreement with the Rincon Valley Fire District, which
integrates its station on Todd Road into the citywide
response matrix.

contractors, of whom Santa Rosa is the largest. Under its current agreement with the SCWA,
the city is entitled to receive 56.6 million gallons of water per day (average-day peak month) up
to an annual volume of 29,100 acre feet.
The short-term ability of the SCWA to deliver water at contractual levels has been impaired
due to a delay in construction of certain transmission system components required to meet
peak water demands. The delay is due to challenges to the environmental studies for the
transmission system project. To address what is considered to be a ‚Äútemporary impairment
condition,‚Äù the city and other water contractors agreed to accept an allocated portion of its
transmission system entitlement from 2001 through September 2008. The water contractors
are in discussion regarding further agreement to address this temporary condition. This
condition affects only transmission system capacity and does not modify annual volume
entitlement. Based on projected city transmission capacity needs, the past and potential future
limits due to the impairment condition are not anticipated to result in water supply shortages.
Long-term delivery of the city‚Äôs full entitlement (56.6 mgd) is contingent upon completion
of water transmission and delivery system improvements planned as part the SCWA‚Äôs Water
Supply, Transmission, and Reliability Project (Water Project). These improvements will increase
the capacity of the agency‚Äôs transmission and delivery system from 92 mgd to 149 mgd. The
project is currently under review by state agencies and the SCWA has submitted petitions to
the State Water Resources Control Board to increase its annual Russian River diversions from
75,000 acre-feet to 101,000 acre-feet per year. When this approval is secured, SCWA intends
to supply not less than 1,830 acre-feet per year of additional supply to Santa Rosa. Once all
necessary approvals have been obtained, the Water Project will be incrementally constructed
over the next 20 years.
In addition to SCWA supply, the city has two other sources of water supply. The city has two
active production wells which provide up to 2,300 acre-feet annually. The city is also the owner
and operator of the Subregional Water Reuse System, providing approximately 350 acre-feet
per year of recycled water for approved uses.
Population and employment increases anticipated during this planning period are projected
to result in an average-day water demand ranging between 29 and 33.4 mgd, with average-day
peak month demand reaching 50 mgd (West Yost & Associates, 2001). In the long-term, Santa
Rosa‚Äôs current water entitlement of 29,100 acre-feet from the SCWA, local supply of 2,300
acre feet annually, and recycled water supply of 350 acre-feet annually will not be sufficient to
meet projected demand. Additional sources of water supply will need to be developed, possibly
including utilization of the city‚Äôs groundwater resources, securing additional water supply from
the SCWA, and increased use of Santa Rosa‚Äôs own recycled water to offset current and future
water uses which are approved for recycled water use. Development of these additional sources

6-7       WASTEWATER
Sewage generated from residential, commercial and industrial uses within the city is collected
and transported to the Laguna Subregional Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) for treatment
and disposal. The Laguna WTP, managed by the City of Santa Rosa, also serves Rohnert Park,
Cotati, Sebastopol, and the South Park Sanitation District. Depending upon the amount of
rainfall received in any year, between 85 to 90 percent of the wastewater treated at the Laguna
WTP is recycled for urban and agricultural irrigation and the geysers steam fields to make
power. A second wastewater treatment plant serving the Oakmont community operates from
May to October. Treated wastewater from this plant is reused to irrigate the Oakmont Golf
Course.
The Laguna WTP is currently rated to treat up to 21.34 million gallons of wastewater per day.
The Incremental Recycled Water Program (IRWP) has been approved and will be implemented
as growth occurs, eventually increasing the plant‚Äôs capacity rating to 25.79 mgd ‚Äì 18.25 of
which will be allocated to Santa Rosa. This expanded capacity will be sufficient to meet the city‚Äôs
wastewater needs until 2025.
As the managing partner of the Subregional System, the city will need to work with other
system partners to develop and implement an expansion strategy that will ensure longer-term
wastewater services.
6-8       SOLID WASTE
The City of Santa Rosa, together with the other cities and unincorporated areas of Sonoma
County, disposes of solid waste to three county landfills within the Bay Area. As of 2005, solid
waste generated from the county‚Äôs waste system is delivered to the Redwood Landfill in Marin
County, Keller Canyon Landfill in Contra Costa County, or Potrero Hills Landfill in Solano
County. An estimated 39 percent (106,870 tons) of the total 2007 waste stream (274,093 tons)
is transported through the county waste system to these landfills.
The State of California has mandated a 50 percent waste diversion rate that must be met by
all counties. In 2006, Sonoma County had a waste diversion rate of 67 percent. This rate is
expected to rise due to continued waste reduction programs such as composting, special waste,
and household toxics. The Sonoma County Integrated Waste Management Plan (CoIWMP) has
a goal of achieving a 70 percent diversion rate by 2015.
Santa Rosa presently has several waste reduction and recycling programs in place to divert the
amount of waste that is transported to other landfills. Expansion of curb-side recycling efforts
in multi-family and commercial projects, as well as single family neighborhoods, will contribute
to increased waste diversion. Education and outreach programs will also assist in waste
reduction.

6-9     STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Stormwater runoff is collected and disposed of through an integrated system of curbside
gutters, underground pipelines, drainage ditches, and creeks. Santa Rosa‚Äôs stormwater system
incorporates detention facilities that minimize potential downstream impacts such as erosion
or flooding.
Stormwater generated in Santa Rosa drains through six drainage basins to the Laguna de Santa
Rosa. The city‚Äôs largest drainage basin includes Santa Rosa Creek, which drains the northern
Santa Rosa area by six major creeks and various tributaries. Four creeks (Brush, Austin, Spring,
and Matanzas) primarily drain the easterly portion, while Paulin and Piner Creeks drain the
westerly portion. Santa Rosa Creek also drains stormwater runoff generated downtown and in
surrounding neighborhoods. The number and location of creeks in northern Santa Rosa result
in adequate stormwater drainage capacity in the northern area. However, the southern area is
susceptible to flooding along Colgan and Roseland Creeks.
Stormwater discharge and maintenance activities are regulated and monitored under a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit. A Stormwater Management Program
identifying the activities to be undertaken to control
and/or eliminate stormwater pollution was developed
as part of the permit process. General Plan policies
support construction of storm drain improvements,
stormwater detention and infiltration areas, and
erosion reduction measures to preserve operational
drainage system capacity. Reduced discharge of non-
point source pollutants into the storm drain system is
essential to the city‚Äôs surface water quality.                  New development should incorporate natural
                                                                flood control channels, such as this one in

                    ‚Ä¢    1.1 acres of public serving open space.
                    This will require a total of 1,401 acres of city parks, publicly accessible school
                    recreation areas, and open space to be available in 2035.
PSF-A-3             Develop a balanced park system throughout the city by incorporating the
                    following parkland classification system into the 3.5 acres per thousand
                    residents of city park land.
                    ‚Ä¢    Neighborhood Parks: generally more than two acres but less than ten acres;
                         provide spaces for informal or casual play, family or small group activities
                         such as picnics, community gardens, children‚Äôs play areas, a special feature
                         such as a splash area, hard court or multiuse field space for fitness, and
                         passive natural areas. The city aims to provide access to neighborhood parks
                         within one-half mile of residential neighborhoods.
                    ‚Ä¢    Community Parks: generally 10 to 25 acres; provide spaces for organized
                         sports, larger group events, several unique features, pathways and natural
                         areas, community gardens, and recreational facilities such as community

        Public plazas and gathering places are generally less than two acres in size;
        they contain vegetation (trees, grass, and greenery) when possible and provide
        connectivity to pathways, trails, community gardens or commercial centers;
        they can take the form of a trailhead that is improved as a small plaza, a small
        area with amenities for relaxation or public art, or areas that are sometimes
        referred to as ‚Äúpocket‚Äù parks where benches are or a tot lot may be available.
        The city encourages the development of these spaces within one-quarter mile of
        residential neighborhoods.
        It should also be noted that open
        space areas generally used for passive
        recreation are integrated into many of
        the city‚Äôs neighborhood, community, and
        citywide parks. They contain just a few
        improvements such as a trail, bench or
        picnic table, but add to passive recreation
        opportunities such as walking, bicycling,
        wildlife viewing, and relaxing. They also
        contribute to connectivity with regional

WATER, WASTEWATER, AND SOLID WASTE
PSF-F               Ensure that an adequate supply of water is available to serve existing and
                    future needs of the city.
PSF-F-1             Utilize high quality water from the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA)
                    aqueduct system as the primary water supply.
PSF-F-2             Ensure that water supply capacity and infrastructure are in place prior to
                    occupancy of new development.
PSF-F-3             Develop available groundwater resources for the purpose of providing a
                    supplemental source of water in the event of an emergency.
PSF-F-4             Maintain existing levels of water service by preserving and improving
                    infrastructure, replacing water mains as necessary, and improving water
                    transmission lines.
PSF-F-5            Decline requests for extension of water beyond the Urban Growth Boundary,
                    except in cases of existing documented health hazards and in areas where the
                    city has agreements to provide services.
PSF-F-6            Evaluate the city‚Äôs long-term water supply strategies, including development
                    of new sources of water supply, improved water conservation and re-use, and
                    implementation of appropriate growth control measures if necessary.
PSF-G               Ensure that adequate sewer capacity is available to serve existing and
                    future needs of the city.
PSF-G-1            Continue to explore and develop new uses for treated wastewater, including
                    expanding existing programs such as urban and agricultural irrigation,
                    consistent with objectives adopted by the Board of Public Utilities and the City
                    Council. Examples of urban reuse include park and landscaping irrigation.
PSF-G-2             Maintain existing levels of wastewater service by preserving and improving
                    infrastructure, including replacing sewer mains as necessary.
PSF-G-3             Decline requests for extension of sewer services beyond the Urban Growth
                    Boundary, except in cases of existing documented health hazards and in areas
                    where the city has agreements to provide services.

PSF-H   Meet the city‚Äôs solid waste disposal needs, while maximizing opportunities
        for waste reduction and recycling.
PSF-H-1 Continue contracting for garbage and recycling collection services. Expand the
        single-stream recycling program (all recyclables in one container) to all users.
PSF-H-2 Work with Sonoma County to identify alternatives to meet the need for solid
        waste disposal.
PSF-H-3 Expand recycling efforts in multifamily residential and commercial projects, and
        continue to encourage recycling by all residents.
PSF-H-4 Require provision of attractive, convenient recycling bins and trash enclosures in
        residential and non-residential development.
PSF-H-5 Continue public education programs about waste reduction, including recycling,
        yard waste, wood waste, and household hazardous waste.
PSF-H-6 Consider development of a residential and commercial food waste composting
        program.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
PSF-I   Manage, maintain, and improve stormwater drainage and capacity.
PSF-I-1 Require dedication, improvement, and maintenance of stormwater flow and
        retention areas as a condition of approval.
PSF-I-2 Require developers to cover the costs of drainage facilities needed for surface
        runoff generated as a result of new development.
PSF-I-3 Require erosion and sedimentation control measures to maintain an operational
        drainage system, preserve drainage capacity, and protect water quality.
PSF-I-4 Require measures to maintain and improve the storm drainage system,
        consistent with goals of the Santa Rosa Citywide Creek Master Plan, to preserve
        natural conditions of waterways and minimize paving of creek channels.
PSF-I-5 Cooperate with the Sonoma County Water Agency and the Northern California
        Regional Water Quality Control Board to conduct regular assessment of
        stormwater drainage facilities, to ensure that adequate drainage capacity is
                                                                                          6-23

                    commercial development.
PSF-I-6             Require implementation of Best Management Practices to reduce drainage
                    system discharge of non-point source pollutants originating from streets,
                    parking lots, residential areas, businesses, industrial operations, and those open
                    space areas involved with pesticide application.
PSF-I-7             Prepare and distribute information to increase awareness of businesses and
                    residents about the need to reduce drainage system discharge of non-pollutants.
PSF-I-8             Implement the Standard Urban Storm Water Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) in order
                    to reduce pollutants and runoffs flows from new development and significant
                    redevelopment projects.
PSF-I-9             Consider installation of creekside pathways, consistent with the Citywide Creek
                    Master Plan and Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan, when possible as part of
                    stormwater improvement projects along the city‚Äôs creek corridors.

7    OPE N S PAC E AND CONSERVATI O N
  This element presents a discussion of open space and natural resource conservation
  efforts undertaken by the City of Santa Rosa. Preservation of open spaces,
  agricultural lands, biological resources and habitat, air quality, and energy are each
  discussed, and policies ensure continued conservation efforts.
  7-1     VISION
  In 2035, conservation of open spaces and natural resources within and near the city
  contribute to Santa Rosa‚Äôs enviable quality of life. Santa Rosa‚Äôs natural resources‚Äî
  including creeks, wetlands, mature trees, ridgelines, rock outcroppings, and open
  spaces‚Äîare conserved and incorporated into the design of new development. Multi-
  use trails provide access to community and regional open space areas, and views of
  open space areas are protected throughout the city.
  The Prince Memorial Greenway is completed and Santa Rosa Creek is restored,
  providing a riparian corridor amenity for residents and visitors. The natural features
  of several other waterways are restored and enhanced, with the addition of trails and
  passive recreational uses.
  Agricultural uses‚Äîincluding farms, co-ops, dairies, livestock ranches, and
  vineyards‚Äîsurround the city‚Äôs Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Air quality is high
  due to the use of cleaner fuels, reduced automobile dependence, and increased
  transit use.
  7-2     OPEN SPACE
  Open space provides a variety of benefits, including visual enjoyment, natural
  resource conservation (e.g., plant and wildlife habitats, creek corridors, hillsides,
  and soils), watershed protection, recreation use, and hazard reduction. Open space
  areas within the UGB generally include undeveloped lands containing significant
  wildlife habitat or natural resources. The city‚Äôs UGB encompasses 180 acres of
  land designated as open space. Open space lands outside the UGB include Taylor
  Mountain and other hillside and ridgeline areas. Figure 7-1 illustrates the open space
  lands designated within the Planning Area.

O P E N S PA C E A N D C O N S E R VAT I O N
Community separators are greenbelt areas designated by the Sonoma County General Plan to
ensure protection of open space, and prevent expansion of urban development between cities.
These separators are intended to preserve the county‚Äôs sense of rural character by preserving
open space corridors between existing communities. The community separators are also shown
on Figure 7-1.
The Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District (SCAPOSD) publication
Connecting Communities and the Land - A Long Range Acquisition Plan (2006) addresses
acquisition and preservation of open space resources in Sonoma County. Four types of open
space identified near Santa Rosa include agriculture, greenbelts (community separators),
natural resources, and recreation areas. Preservation of open space for each of these activities
is important to the quality of life and rural character valued by local residents. General Plan
policies address public access to such areas, as well as expansion of the regional open space
network. A continuous network of open space land can be more beneficial for plant and habitat
conservation than piecemeal open spaces.
AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
Agricultural resources within the Santa Rosa Planning Area provide residents with a sense
of rural character and access to fresh produce and agricultural goods. Agricultural resources
‚Äîincluding crop fields and vineyards, open rangeland, barns and other farm structures‚Äî
outside of the UGB but within the Planning Area include a total of 18,200 acres of farmland,
according the State Department of Conservation‚Äôs Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
Program.
Working with SCAPOSD to preserve lands outside of the city‚Äôs UGB that contain highly
productive soils for growing crops, and that are suitable for community agricultural
operations‚Äîsuch as farmers‚Äô markets, small family farms, and co-ops‚Äîwill sustain the sense
of rural character within the greater Santa Rosa area. Continued operation of active farms will
also contribute to the region‚Äôs economic vitality.
7-3     BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND WATERWAYS
Biological resources found within Santa Rosa include sensitive plants and animals, creeks, and
wetlands, including vernal pools. Figure 7-2 illustrates the areas with potential for sensitive
species identified by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) and major creeks
located within the Urban Growth Boundary.
Santa Rosa Creek, which originates in the headwaters of Mount Hood, runs from east to
west through the city, and into the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Other streams, including the lower
reaches of Matanzas Creek, run through or near the city on their way to joining Santa Rosa

Creek. Creek related policies from several previous planning documents including the Santa
Rosa Creek Master Plan (1993), and the Santa Rosa Waterways Plan (1996) were reorganized
into the Santa Rosa Citywide Creek Master Plan (CCMP) in 2007. The city recognizes the
importance of its waterway resources, and has established the CCMP as the leading document
that ensures creek conservation and restoration. The City recognizes that creeks and riparian
corridors provide groundwater recharge areas in addition to other biological functions.
Biological resources within the Santa Rosa area can be roughly divided between those found
on the Santa Rosa plain and those located in the uplands to the east, with connections formed
by creeks. Sensitive resources on the plain include numerous vernal pools and their associated
species and surrounding grasslands, while upland resources to the east include hillside open
spaces and woodlands.
CITYWIDE CREEK MASTER PLAN
The Citywide Creek Master Plan, updated in 2013, presents a range of goals and policies for
specific waterways in the City of Santa Rosa. The plan details the various creek environments
that exist in the city while also designating areas for enhancement or preservation.
Implementing the recommended improvements specific to
Santa Rosa‚Äôs local waterways will improve wildlife habitats,
increase recreational opportunities, drainage capacity, and
flood control.
Key creek related goals and policies have been extracted
from the Citywide Creek Master Plan. In order to review
all the graphics and tables that are available in the Citywide
Creek Master Plan, please refer to the full document.
VEGETATION
Santa Rosa‚Äôs UGB includes a variety of vegetation types,
including grasslands, woodlands, riparian areas, and vernal
pools. Some, like annual grasslands that now contain
                                                                Piner Creek, adjacent to Marlow Road,
primarily exotic annual grasses, have been altered from provides rich riparian habitat within the
their natural state. Others, including vernal pool areas, Urban Growth Boundary.
either remain in their natural state (in terms of species
composition and ecological function) or have been only slightly altered.
The smaller areas of discrete habitat, such as vernal pools, support their own distinctive species
associations. In these limited areas, the populations of individual species may be small and
sensitive to disturbance. In recognition of the ecological importance of vernal pools, the Santa
Rosa Plain Vernal Pool Ecosystem Preservation Plan was developed in 1995.

WILDLIFE
Diverse vegetation types within the UGB provide for a variety of wildlife habitats, and the
interspersion of different habitats is advantageous for species that use the ‚Äúedges‚Äù between
them. Open space areas support smaller species, including songbirds, rodents, and a variety
of invertebrates. They also provide habitat for a number of sensitive species, including nesting
raptors.
The streams flowing through the city provide both instream and riparian habitat. Riparian
habitat supports a distinct community of plants and animals, including amphibians, and
provides migration corridors that allow other wildlife to travel between suitable habitats that
are otherwise separated by development. Instream habitat is important for aquatic species such
as steelhead/rainbow trout which are found in Santa Rosa Creek and several of its tributaries.
Both of these habitats support a variety of animal species, from streambed invertebrates to
the larger fishes and animals such as herons and egrets that feed upon them. Preservation of
existing wildlife habitat and restoration of riparian corridors ensures that wildlife species are
protected, as well as provides tranquil open spaces within the city‚Äôs urban landscape.
7-4     AIR QUALITY
Reduction of air pollutants contributes to quality of life for Santa Rosans by improving
the health of residents and workers. The City of Santa Rosa participates with the Bay Area
Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) to address improvement of air quality. The
Pacific Ocean influences the moderate climate of Sonoma County. In summer, afternoon
northwesterly winds blow contaminants south toward San Francisco. In winter, periods of
stagnant air can occur, especially in periods between storms.
Santa Rosa currently has one monitoring station that measures criteria pollutants, including
ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, sulfates, and particulates 10 microns or
smaller (PM10). The air quality in Santa Rosa has generally improved, as motor vehicles have
become cleaner, agricultural and residential burning has been curtailed, and consumer products
have been reformulated or replaced. From 2003 to 2007, Santa Rosa exceeded state standards
only once, for ozone, in 2003. Carbon monoxide, a product of incomplete combustion, was
formerly a problem for the city; but with improved motor vehicles and fuels, Santa Rosa air
easily meets state and federal standards.
Maintaining and improving air quality will contribute to good health for all Santa Rosans.
Policies addressing land use patterns, connections between different land uses, use of energy
sources, alternative transportation modes, preservation of open spaces, and construction dust
abatement all contribute to the reduction of air pollutants within Santa Rosa.

7-5      ENERGY
The City of Santa Rosa depends on energy to maintain a vital economy and desirable lifestyle.
It uses electricity and natural gas to light, heat, and cool structures and to power its office
equipment, industrial machinery, public services, and home appliances. The city also uses
petroleum products to move people and products along its transportation corridors. Energy is
vital to the continued functioning of housing, employment, transportation, and public services
and facilities in Santa Rosa.
Reduced energy use in housing, commercial structures, public facilities, and transportation
helps maintain local economic vitality and reduces the need for new infrastructure to
deliver energy to the city. Better use of materials, insulation, and increased harnessing of
solar incidence in building design reduces demand on natural gas and heating products.
Transportation measures that facilitate pedestrian use and bicycling reduce dependence on
petroleum. Together, these steps will lead to a more reliable, sustainable, economic energy
future.
7-6      CLIMATE CHANGE
In 2005, the nine cities and Sonoma County set a mutual greenhouse gas target in partnership
with the Climate Protection Campaign (CPC) within its Community Climate Action Plan
(CCAP). On August 2, 2005 the City Council adopted Resolution 26341 which established
a municipal greenhouse gas reduction target of 20 percent from 2000 levels by 2010 and
facilitates the community-wide greenhouse gas reduction target of 25 percent from 1990 levels
by 2015 that was included in the CCAP.
The Santa Rosa Climate Action Plan (CAP) addresses emissions specific to the City‚Äôs Urban
Growth Boundary. The CAP provides a roadmap to achieving GHG emissions reduction and
attaining local emission reduction targets as well as those targets set at the regional and state
level. The CAP recognizes the reduction targets, forecasts the amount of reductions necessary
to meet those targets, indentifies specific measures that will reduce emissions, outlines
implementation of the measures and provides for the long term tracking of emissions.
The CAP and the General Plan work in conjunction to facilitate GHG emissions reductions.
This plan acknowledges the environmental leadership Santa Rosa has achieved and supports
the responsibility of continued greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Measures, policies
and projects that reduce community-wide GHGs presented in the Climate Action Plan are
aligned with the goals and policies in the General Plan. In addition, the General Plan provides
the basis for analyzing proposed development to determine consistency with the CAP goals
and measures. The measures presented in the Climate Action Plan are referenced generally
throughout the General Plan.

7-7     GOALS AND POLICIES
OPEN SPACE
OSC-A           Maximize the benefits of open space.
OSC-A-1         Cooperate with various public and private entities to create new public access
                trails to parks, open spaces, and drainage ways within the city, as well as to trail
                systems outside the UGB. Priorities for trail access outside of the UGB should
                include:
                ‚Ä¢   Joe Rodota Trail (from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol);
                ‚Ä¢   Bay Area Ridge Trail;
                ‚Ä¢   Santa Rosa Creek Trail;
                ‚Ä¢   Laguna Trail;
                ‚Ä¢   Roseland Creek Trail;
                ‚Ä¢   Colgan Creek Trail; and
                ‚Ä¢   Paulin Creek Trail.
OSC-A-2         Collaborate with other agencies and private development to link non-access
                open spaces, where such linking would benefit the protection of special
                environments and life systems such as wetlands, plant communities, and wildlife
                habitats and corridors.
OSC-A-3         Cooperate with the County of Sonoma in preserving and, where appropriate,
                acquiring open space outside the UGB, for both growth management and open
                space purposes.
OSC-A-4         Encourage the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District
                to appropriate funds for acquisition of open space within and surrounding Santa
                Rosa. Priorities for acquisition include:
                ‚Ä¢   Community Separator between Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park;
                ‚Ä¢   Taylor Mountain;
                ‚Ä¢   Areas west and north of the Urban Growth Boundary; and
                ‚Ä¢   Santa Rosa Creek corridor.
OSC-A-5         Monitor the progress of the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open
                Space District in acquiring Santa Rosa priority properties.

OSC-A-6         Protect the Annadel and Spring Lake regional parks from intrusion by
                inappropriate uses. Conserve the biotic systems in those parks.
OSC-A-7         Encourage preservation of open space in the Community Separators (see
                Figure 7-1: Open Space and Community Separators) between Santa Rosa and
                neighboring communities. Work with regional agencies to ensure maintenance
                of the separators as permanent open space.
OSC-A-8         Coordinate with public and private entities to link open spaces with a network
                of paths and trails, including Sonoma County Water Agency access roads and the
                Bay Area Ridge Trail.
OSC-B           Conserve the city‚Äôs open spaces and significant natural features.
OSC-B-1         Prohibit development on hillsides and ridgelines where structures would
                interrupt the skyline.
OSC-B-2         Minimize alteration of the topography, drainage patterns and vegetation of land
                with slopes of ten percent or more. Prohibit alteration of slopes greater than 25
                percent.
OSC-B-3         Require that new subdivisions, multifamily, and non-residential development
                abutting creek corridors are appropriately designed with respect to the creek.
                Development may orient toward the creek as an amenity, but adequate setbacks
                shall be used to ensure riparian habitat is protected.
OSC-B-4         Require that graded areas within new developments be revegetated.
OSC-B-5         Require a Hillside Development Permit as part of a proposed subdivision,
                proposed development or new land use on that portion of a site with a slope of
                10 percent or greater (see Figure 7-3: Slope and Ridgelines).

          preservation of unincorporated lands
          adjacent to and near the Santa Rosa Urban
          Growth Boundary as viable agricultural
          resources.
OSC-C-3   Preserve and enhance agriculture within
          the Planning Area as a component of the
          economy and as a part of Santa Rosa‚Äôs
          environmental quality.
OSC-C-4   Work with the County of Sonoma to
          encourage the conservation of mineral
          resources and the protection of access to
          those resources.                                Santa Rosa Creek provides biological
                                                          habitat, stormwater collection, and an
                                                          open space amenity for local residents.
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND WATERWAYS
OSC-D     Conserve wetlands, vernal pools, wildlife ecosystems, rare plant habitats,
          and waterways.
OSC-D-1   Utilize existing regulations and procedures, including Subdivision Guidelines,
          Zoning, Design Review, and environmental law, to conserve wetlands and
          rare plants. Comply with the federal policy of no net loss of wetlands using
          mitigation measures such as:
          ‚Ä¢   Avoidance of sensitive habitat;
          ‚Ä¢   Clustered development;
          ‚Ä¢   Transfer of development rights; and/or
          ‚Ä¢   Compensatory mitigation, such as restoration or creation.
OSC-D-2   Protect high quality wetlands and vernal pools from development or other
          activities as determined by the Vernal Pool Ecosystem Preservation Plan.
OSC-D-3   Preserve and restore the elements of wildlife habitats and corridors throughout
          the Planning Area.
OSC-D-4   Continue to consult with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
          to identify significant environments. Identify priorities for acquisition or
                                                                                                7-11

                maintenance of open space areas based on biological and environmental
                concerns, and develop an overall strategy for the maintenance of areas that
                will preserve the populations of plants and animals currently found within the
                Urban Growth Boundary.
OSC-D-5         Consult with North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board staff as part of
                the CEQA process for proposed developments to help them identify wetland and
                vernal pool habitat that has candidacy for restoration/protection based on actual
                and potential beneficial uses, and determine appropriate locations for mitigation
                banking.
OSC-D-6         Preserve waterways by informing residents of the environmental effects of
                dumping yard waste into creeks, or other wastes, such as motor oil, into storm
                drains that empty into creeks.
OSC-D-7         Rehabilitate existing channelized waterways, as feasible, to remove concrete
                linings and allow for a connection with the stream channel and the natural
                water table. Avoid creating additional channelized waterways, unless no other
                alternative is available to protect human health, safety, and welfare.
OSC-D-8         Restore channelized waterways to a more natural condition which allows for
                more natural hydraulic functioning, including development of meanders, pools,
                riffles, and other stream features. Restoration should also allow for growth
                of riparian vegetation which effectively stabilizes banks, screens pollutants
                from runoff entering the channel, enhances fisheries, and provides other
                opportunities for natural habitat restoration.
OSC-D-9         Ensure that construction adjacent to creek channels is sensitive to the natural
                environment. Ensure that natural topography and vegetation is preserved
                along the creek, and that construction activities do not disrupt or pollute the
                waterway.
OSC-D-10        Orient development and buildings toward creeks, while providing privacy,
                security, and an open transition between public and private open spaces.
OSC-D-11        New development along channelized waterways should allow for an ecological
                buffer zone between the waterway and development. This buffer zone should
                also provide opportunities for multi-use trails and recreation.

OSC-D-12  New development should maintain an adequate setback from channelized
          waterways to recognize the 100-year flood elevation, and allow for stream
          corridor restoration. Setbacks identified in the Zoning Code should serve
          as minimum setbacks. Larger setbacks are encouraged in accordance with
          Restoration Concept Plans to meet restoration and enhancement goals.

8                GROW TH MANAGEMENT
  Growth management was added to the Santa Rosa General Plan as a separate,
  optional element in 1991, in response to record growth in the mid-1980s and
  concern regarding the city‚Äôs ability to provide adequate services. The purpose of
  growth management is to balance new development with:
      1. The city‚Äôs ability to supply necessary public services and facilities;
      2. Protection of social and economic values in existing residential neighbor-
          hoods, commercial centers and industrial areas;
      3. Conservation of vital open spaces and natural resources;
      4. Achievement of decent housing for all income categories;
      5. Attainment of community goals for the overall size and character of Santa
          Rosa; and
      6. A stable, moderate growth rate sufficient to support a healthy business
          economy.
  This element presents an overview of the city‚Äôs Growth Management Program. The
  topics in this element include orderly and compact growth within the city‚Äôs Urban
  Growth Boundary (UGB), development intensity and the pace of population growth.
  8-1     VISION
  In 2035, Santa Rosa is a balanced community featuring a mix of residential,
  commercial, office, industrial, public, and recreational uses within the Urban
  Growth Boundary. Santa Rosa is a nearly built out city with defined edges,
  surrounded by open space and agriculture.
  Residential development has increased at a comfortable pace over the preceding
  two decades, both allowing construction of new housing units for Santa Rosans
  and maintaining a feeling of openness through scattered vacant parcels. The city‚Äôs

GROWTH MANAGEMENT
job supply has grown at a consistent pace, maintaining Santa Rosa‚Äôs position as the center of
government, business and commerce in Sonoma County. Public services and infrastructure are
available, and have been expanded to keep pace with new growth.
8-2     URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY
Santa Rosa voters approved a five-year Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in 1990, and a 20-
year UGB measure in 1996, assuring that the current UGB will not be significantly changed
at least until 2016. The UGB contains 29,140 acres, a little more than 45 square miles, and
encompasses all incorporated land as well as unincorporated land that will eventually be
annexed and served by the city. The city‚Äôs Planning Area extends outside of the UGB on all sides
of Santa Rosa, and includes the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport to the northwest
and Annadel State Park to the southeast. The Planning Area encompasses approximately
75,200 acres, or 118 square miles. These boundaries are shown in Figure 8-1.
The General Plan assumes all urban development through 2035 will be contained within the
city‚Äôs Urban Growth Boundary. All land use classifications outside the UGB on the General
Plan Land Use Diagram reflect Sonoma County General Plan designations ‚Äì primarily rural
residential and agricultural uses. Development outside the UGB is discouraged in order to
promote open areas around the city and to demarcate an obvious end to urban development.
8-3     GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Growth continues to be one of the most important issues to Santa Rosans. In 1992, the
Growth Management Ordinance was adopted to implement the policies of the Growth
Management Element. This ordinance, still in effect, limits the number of residential units
that can be approved each year. Upon city approval, a project receives an ‚Äúallotment‚Äù that can
later be used to receive a building permit. Because of carryovers from previous years allowed by
the ordinance, the number of permits issued in any one year can be higher than the maximum
allotment.
The Growth Management Element limits allotments through 2035. If all projected allotments
were used, a 2035 population of approximately 237,000 residents within the Urban Growth
Boundary would result.

GM-B-4 Direct growth to areas where services and infrastructure can be provided
       efficiently. Do not allow any development in the approximately 453 acre area
       generally east of Santa Rosa Avenue and north of Todd Road (as mapped in

       services, circulation, parks and open space, and the impact of this development
       on downtown. The plan shall also include design guidelines. Require project
       proponents to enter into a comprehensive development agreement that, at a
       minimum, addresses the financing of the Farmers Lane extension and the Todd

  The purpose of this element is to affirm that the health, safety, welfare and
  development of youth and families are a high priority for the City of Santa Rosa.
  Youth and family issues are included in the city‚Äôs policy framework so that these
  factors are considered when important decisions are made, including commitment
  of city resources. This element provides direction for youth-oriented programs, child
  care, and senior services.
  9-1      VISION
  In 2035, Santa Rosa‚Äôs high quality of life demonstrates the positive effects of city
  services and resources devoted to youth and families. A wide variety of facilities
  and programs aimed at satisfying diverse youth interests provide numerous
  opportunities for leisure-time activities. Through Measure ‚ÄúO‚Äù and other programs,
  the coordinated effort of the city and various organizations has lessened the
  detrimental effects of gang activities and youth drug and alcohol use.
  The child care needs of the city‚Äôs residents and workers are met with a network of
  facilities distributed throughout the city in close proximity to neighborhoods and
  employment centers. Overall, residents feel proud of the city‚Äôs efforts to provide a
  safe, secure, and positive family environment.
  9-2      AGE DISTRIBUTION
  According to the 2007 American Community Survey, Santa Rosa had a population
  of approximately 147,500 within the city limits. Of this population, 25 percent were
  children ages 19 or younger, while approximately 14 percent were seniors age 65 or
  older. Table 9-1 depicts the age distributions of Santa Rosa‚Äôs population.
  An estimated 36,740 children (ages 19 and under) lived in Santa Rosa in 2007
  according to the American Community Survey. The city‚Äôs youth population
  necessitates high quality services and facilities accessible to the city‚Äôs families and
  their children. Facilities envisioned by the General Plan include public and private
  schools, parks and playgrounds, safe walking and bicycling paths, recreational after-
  school programs, convenient transit routes, walkable shopping areas, and child care
  services.

 9-3     YOUTH PROGRAMS
Involvement in youth programs can increase students‚Äô success in school and increase
graduation rates. Programs may also help prevent Santa Rosa youth from becoming involved
in gangs, drugs and alcohol use and other youth crime. The Parks and Recreation section of
Chapter 6: Public Services and Facilities Element describes many of the recreational facilities
available to community members; this section highlights some of the programs that are most
tailored or attractive to Santa Rosa‚Äôs youth.
The Steele Lane Community Center and the Finley Community Center provide space for classes,
workshops, special events, meetings, and sports. These facilities also hold social events such as
dances and tiny tot programs. In addition to public swimming sessions, Santa Rosa‚Äôs aquatic
facilities feature swimming, scuba and kayaking classes. The city also offers many sports and
neighborhood recreation services, and sports fields are often reserved for softball, soccer, and
other team sports. Other examples of youth and teen programs include arts and crafts, boating
and sailing, drama, math and computers, cooking, rock climbing, and Spanish. Some Santa
Rosa schools offer after school programs such as theater arts; many of these programs are
operated by the Recreation and Parks Department. Many of the neighborhood parks provide
free summer playground programs for elementary school
aged children. Finally, youngsters may attend nine weeks
of activities at three summer day camps.
The Chop‚Äôs Teen Center, located on West Sixth Street in
the West End Neighborhood, provides many programs
and activities for youth between the ages of 13 and
19. Programming for the facility includes ongoing
communication with teens in order to assess which
activities are currently the most popular. Favorite
activities identified by teens include rock climbing and       Neighborhood parks and playgrounds serve
photography. General Plan policies support continued           the city‚Äôs children during after-school hours.
programming of recreational and cultural events and
classes for local youth.
9-4      CHILD CARE
There is a significant demand for private and public child care programs and services in Santa
Rosa. This is due to the growth of the city, as well as to demographic trends such as the increase
of two-income and single parent families. The City of Santa Rosa recognizes this demand and
the importance of available, affordable, quality child care for the health and well being of the
community.
                                                                                                           9-3

Y O U T H A N D FA M I LY
The need for child care in Santa Rosa depends upon
a variety of factors. The most prominent factor is
the employment of parents, including number of
hours, types of work shifts and job locations. Parental
preference and choice of child care, family income,
and child age also play a critical role in designing
appropriate child care options for the community.
According to the Community Child Care Council of
Sonoma County (4C‚Äôs), in 2008, there were 6,596
licensed child care spaces in Santa Rosa, of which 1,164
                                                            Child care services should be located in
are licensed Family Care spaces and 5,432 are licensed residential neighborhoods, employment centers,
Center Care spaces. The 4C‚Äôs records indicate that in and at school facilities.
2008 there are 2,371 children in Santa Rosa whose
families have applied for and are waiting for state-subsidized child care. This number is up 42
percent from 1,668 in 2006. These children meet the eligibility criteria (family income and
parent need), but there are no funds at the state or local level to provide them with subsidized
services.
Both infant/toddler and school-age child care capacity is needed. The 4C‚Äôs estimates that
45 percent of children under five years of age need out-of-home child care, and 30 percent
of school-age children need before or after-school care to fully cover parents‚Äô working and
commute hours. The 4C‚Äôs also indicate that Santa Rosa families are in need of late-night/
weekend and summer child care. Many parents, especially those in low-paying jobs, such as
retail and restaurant jobs, need evening and weekend care, times when most centers and family
care homes are closed. Most summer camps and other programs are only open six to seven
hours during the day, so parents must schedule additional morning and evening child care.
9-5      SENIORS
Senior citizens are valuable economic, social, and political contributors to our society, often
with a unique set of needs and perspectives. The community service needs of the senior citizen
population can be more substantial and specialized. The majority of senior citizens are retired
or semi-retired. While senior citizens may enjoy more leisure time, they may also be limited
by fixed incomes, less mobility, and health problems. It is important for the city to address
these needs which arise due to aging. They include affordable housing, health and day care,
transportation, recreation, and social services.

   in Santa Rosa.
   The objective of the Economic Vitality Element is to ensure that the General Plan
   and all related policies acknowledge and prioritize the importance of economic
   sustainability, ensuring the city maximizes its economic opportunities for the
   community.
   10-1 VISION
   Santa Rosa is an economically diverse city in 2035. A vibrant downtown ‚Äì
   featuring a mix of office, retail, services, and residential ‚Äì continues its role
   as the government, commerce, and entertainment center of Sonoma County
   while attracting residents, employees, and visitors to centralized service
   and entertainment opportunities. A positive economic climate supports
   environmentally friendly businesses, active shopping and service centers,
   professional offices, restaurant and entertainment uses. Community shopping
   centers dispersed throughout the city provide places for social interaction as well
   as daily and regional shopping opportunities in proximity to most residential areas.
   Smaller, convenient neighborhood shopping centers allow Santa Rosans to walk or
   bike to local grocery and service retailers.
   A number of business park complexes throughout the city contain light industrial,
   research and development, processing and manufacturing, and office uses. A
   diversity of jobs are provided in the city‚Äôs employment centers, while the Santa Rosa
   Junior College provides job training courses to match the skills of local residents to
   those needed by the local job market. New employers are drawn to the city because
   of the educated employee population, positive business climate, natural amenities,
   and quality of life.

10-2 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
REGIONAL SETTING
The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the most populous regions in the United States, with
nearly seven million residents. Climatologically, topographically, socially, and ethnically
diverse, the Bay Area is made up of nine counties, more than one hundred cities and three
and a half million jobs. The region totals 7,000 square miles, approximately 1,000 of which are
developed. Seventy percent of this developed land is in residential use.
The Bay Area‚Äôs economy has grown substantially in the last decade, and has prospered due to
diverse economic opportunities. High-technology manufacturing and growth in wholesale and
retail trade have been the region‚Äôs strongest growth sectors. This growth has been accompanied
by cost of living increases that surpass other areas. The cost of living increased 25 percent
between 2000 and 2008, with most of those gains in 2007 and 2008. As a result, economic
development is critical to maintain the city‚Äôs positive business climate through such actions as
business retention, attraction and expansion.
Santa Rosa is a member of the region‚Äôs council of governments, called the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG). ABAG was formed to plan for the future and promote cooperation
on area wide issues, and part of ABAG‚Äôs responsibility includes making economic projections.
North Bay Subregion
The City of Santa Rosa is included within the four-county North Bay economy, which includes
Napa, Marin, Solano, and Sonoma counties. Over the last decade, these counties experienced
high levels of growth; eleven percent in population and ten percent in jobs within the region.
The emergence of telecommunications companies, expansion of the region‚Äôs wine industry
and population growth have contributed to a dynamic regional economy. Job growth in the
North Bay area has been higher than the region as a whole as job growth has occurred outside
major urban centers (e.g. San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose). Santa Rosa had approximately the
same number of jobs in 2000 and 2006, 72,513 and 72,077 according to the U.S. Census and
American Community Survey, respectively. ABAG projects a 56 percent job growth rate and 18
percent population increase between 2005 and 2035 within Sonoma County.
The economic expansion of the 1996-2006 decade has been followed by a period of contraction.
Job creation has slowed and overall economic growth has been hampered by macro-level
economic factors such as a declining housing market, changes in the lending industry, energy
costs, and inflation. However, the Santa Rosa and Sonoma County economies remain relatively
strong and are expected to persevere fairly well during any period of economic downturn due
to strong local economies, a diverse production base, and skilled workforce. Because of recent
economic growth and its historical role, Santa Rosa continues to be a viable and major regional
center of trade for the North Bay.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN SANTA ROSA
Santa Rosa is Sonoma County‚Äôs seat of government and center of trade and commerce. It also
serves as the regional office location for several state and federal government offices, which
together with local government and educational institutions, account for the majority of public
sector employment in the city. As a major private sector employment center, Santa Rosa‚Äôs
economic base is dominated by services, including high-technology, research and development,
and retailing. Manufacturing products include electronic test equipment, medical devices,
optical products, and telecommunications. Growth during the 1990s has allowed Santa Rosa
to become a viable center for major regional services for the wholesale and industrial sectors as
well.
Santa Rosa recognizes the need to proactively facilitate job growth and retention in order
to sustain local economic interests. Programs which promote local spending and highlight
successful, locally produced goods and services not only benefit the city‚Äôs economic and
business interests but also are touted for their environmentally sound practice of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by limiting the energy needed to transport people, goods,
and services. The city‚Äôs economic strategy recommends attracting businesses to existing
employment centers through promotion or incentives, improving infrastructure, and
promoting an entrepreneurial image for the City of Santa Rosa as ways of creating jobs. The
strategy also recommends growing dollars spent in the community by promoting tourism and
attracting visitors to the city‚Äôs surrounding wine country and its downtown and entertainment
venues, along with promoting arts and cultural events and retail opportunities. All of these
actions combine to promote economic growth and sustainability by making Santa Rosa a
destination city for prospective residents, employers and tourists.
ABAG estimates that Santa Rosa contained approximately 93,500 jobs in 2005, which
comprises 42 percent of Sonoma County jobs and 16 percent of the jobs within the four county
North Bay region. The General Plan projects approximately 132,100 total jobs through year
2035.

REDEVELOPMENT
Redevelopment is an integral component of local economic activity in Santa Rosa. The
purpose of redevelopment is to revitalize physically and economically disadvantaged areas
of the city, provide affordable housing and home ownership opportunities, assist private
development projects and build needed capital improvements, such as roads, sewer and
water lines, sidewalks, greenways, parks, and libraries. Redevelopment activities have created
thousands of new jobs and have provided millions of dollars to construct and rehabilitate
vital civic improvements. Redevelopment is also beneficial because it helps communities to
grow with infill development, reduce crime and long commutes, reuse historic structures, and
preserve the environment. Within the Santa Rosa Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), the city‚Äôs
Redevelopment Agency has the following plans in place:
         ‚Ä¢   Southwest Redevelopment Plan. This project area encompasses approximately
             2,000 acres, addressing deteriorating and inadequate infrastructure, ground water
             contamination, and unsafe and deteriorating structures. The area is generally
             changing from an agricultural to a suburban character. Redevelopment financing
             is necessary to provide new infrastructure to the area; the project will use tax
             increment financing to attract financial investment. Resolution of health and safety
             concerns caused by hazardous materials contamination, a lack of public utilities, and
             circulation deficiencies are a priority for the southwest.
         ‚Ä¢   Santa Rosa Center Redevelopment Plan. This project area encompasses 84 acres of
             Santa Rosa‚Äôs downtown core and represents over 40 years of redevelopment history,
             helping to transform the central business district into the commercial, cultural,
             governmental and service center for the region. Approximately 70 buildings were
             constructed or substantially rehabilitated with the help of redevelopment programs.
             In addition, redevelopment in the project area created over 5,000 permanent jobs
             and 3,000 construction-related jobs; completed numerous public improvements,
             including Old Courthouse Square Plaza,
             Sonoma Avenue Park, the Fourth Street
             pedestrian mall, the Comstock pedestrian
             mall, various parking garages and parking
             lots, and infrastructure; and constructed or
             substantially rehabilitated more than 1,800
             affordable housing units citywide.
         ‚Ä¢   Grace Brothers Redevelopment Plan.
             The Grace Brothers Project is an eight acre       Preservation of historic structures, such as the
             site located adjacent to Historic Railroad        Western Hotel in Railroad Square, is important

          transformed a contaminated site into a hotel, conference center and restaurant with
          on-site parking. The project attracts local residents, tourists, and business visitors
          and it stimulates economic activity through enhanced activity as well as spin-off
          restaurant and retail sales in the community.
       ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Transit-Oriented Redevelopment Plan. The 11 acre project area, commonly
          known as ‚ÄúTORPA‚Äù is located within Historic Railroad Square adjacent to Santa Rosa
          Creek along the rail corridor. Major goals for the area include creating a destination;
          promoting downtown, and creating a pleasant space for social interaction,
          commerce and civic display; supporting rail and bus transit use; and integrating with
          adjacent properties through superior architectural design and circulation.
       ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Roseland Redevelopment Plan. The Roseland Redevelopment Project is a joint
          Santa Rosa and Sonoma County effort to revitalize the Sebastopol Road commercial
          corridor and to strengthen existing neighborhoods and expand the stock of
          affordable housing. The project area includes approximately 264 acres generally
          along Sebastopol Road east of Stony Point Road. This plan‚Äôs priorities are economic
          development, including infrastructure improvements, open space, public facilities,
          commercial revitalization, and affordable housing. The County of Sonoma currently
          administers this project area.
       ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† The Gateways Redevelopment Plan. The project area includes approximately
          1,100 acres, primarily along the central north-south axis of Santa Rosa, including
          many of the major corridors and adjacent areas that serve as ‚Äúgateways‚Äù to the civic
          heart of Santa Rosa, namely downtown and Historic Railroad Square. Some of these
          major corridor areas include Santa Rosa Avenue, Petaluma Hill Road, Steele Lane,
          Mendocino Avenue, Fourth Street, Brookwood Avenue, Wilson Street, Cleveland
          Avenue, Range Avenue, West Ninth Street, North Dutton Avenue, Jennings Avenue,
          and College Avenue. Infrastructure improvements, historic preservation, civic
          structures, commercial enhancements, and affordable housing are all recognized
          needs. Redevelopment activities in this project area are expected to commence in
          2009.

   This element presents an overview of the prehistory and history of Santa Rosa, and
   establishes goals and policies for identifying and preserving significant prehistoric
   and historic resources. Resources include buildings and neighborhoods of historic
   architectural significance, places of special historic or archaeological interest, and
   other features that have special value to the community.
   In the following sections, the term prehistoric resource is synonymous with Native
   American resource; this type of resource dates back to pre-Euroamerican contact.
   Historic (or historic-period) resources date back no further than the time of
   Euroamerican contact.
   11-1 VISION
   In 2035, several Santa Rosa neighborhoods are designated as historic preservation
   districts, ensuring protection of historic structures that contribute to the city‚Äôs char-
   acter and charm. Restoration of historic structures continues, preserving Santa Ro-
   sa‚Äôs architectural heritage. Santa Rosa‚Äôs Native American resources are fully evalu-
   ated and protected, providing valuable information about the area‚Äôs prehistory.
   11-2 NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE
   Santa Rosa is rich with Native American heritage. Archaeologists speculate that
   Native American habitation in the region began approximately 7,000 years ago. A
   2001 review of records and literature on file with the California Historical Resources
   Information System indicates that Santa Rosa contains 190 recorded Native
   American resources.
   Santa Rosa‚Äôs Planning Area encompasses the Santa Rosa Basin with six major
   drainages, including Santa Rosa, Matanzas, Piner, Rincon, Austin, and Brush Creeks.
   These creeks are significant with respect to prehistoric resources because Native
   American archaeological sites tend to be located near waterways, as well as along
   ridge tops, midslope terraces, alluvial flats, the base of hills, and near vegetation
   ecotones. In addition, Annadel State Park constitutes an important obsidian source
   for Native American tool manufacture. Native American resources may include chert
   or obsidian flakes, projectile points, mortars, pestles, dark friable soil containing
   shell and bone dietary debris, heat-affected rock, or human burials.

H I S T O R I C P R E S E R VAT I O N
Remnants of Native American civilization have been
discovered along Santa Rosa Creek and its tributaries,
in the adjacent alluvial valleys and surrounding plains,
in the hills, in the Annadel State Park area, in the
Laguna de Santa Rosa, and in the Windsor area. The
remains of entire settlements, including three former
villages, have been found in northern Santa Rosa.
Given the environmental settings, the archaeologically
rich nature of the Santa Rosa area, and the amount of
unsurveyed land (at least half of the Planning Area has
not been surveyed for archaeological resources), there is    A Victorian home at Cherry and Orchard
a high potential for finding additional Native American      Streets lends the city a sense of history and

sites in Santa Rosa.
11-3 HISTORIC RESOURCES
Historic resources include sites, structures, districts, landmarks, or other physical evidence of
past human activity generally greater than 50 years old. Santa Rosa has a rich architectural
heritage spanning many periods, with Mexican Period adobes, 19th century Gothic, Greek
Revival and Italianate houses, turn of the century Stick/Eastlake styles, early 20th century
Craftsman and California bungalows, 1920s Spanish Revival, and 1930s art deco buildings.
The city‚Äôs eclectic collection of different styles and periods is represented by numerous well-
preserved structures, which form part of the city‚Äôs character and identity. Some of the more
notable historic resources are the Luther Burbank Home and Gardens, Sonoma County
Museum (U.S. Post Office), DeTurk Round Barn, Church of the One Tree, Carrillo Adobe,
Fountaingrove Winery, Fountaingrove Round Barn, and Santa Rosa Air Center and its compass
rose.
Santa Rosa has 21 landmarks and 8 designated historic preservation districts, established to
officially recognize individual properties and whole neighborhoods as key components of the
city‚Äôs heritage. A landmark is any site having a specific historical, archaeological, cultural, or
architectural value, and preservation districts are areas that have special historic significance
or represent one or more architectural periods or styles typical to the city‚Äôs history. Historic
preservation districts include: Cherry Street, Saint Rose, Olive Park, Railroad Square, West
End, McDonald, Burbank Gardens and Ridgway. Santa Rosa‚Äôs historic preservation districts are
shown in Figure 11-1.
Adopted in 1988, the Historic and Cultural Preservation Ordinance created the Cultural
Heritage Board. The Board recommends to the City Council designation of landmarks and
preservation districts, reviews permits for alterations to landmarks, and promotes public
awareness of historic resources. Although many historic structures have been lost through

reconstruction, fire, and neglect, there remain many restoration opportunities. A growing
interest in the city‚Äôs historic resources and appreciation of the value of special historic
architecture is resulting in continued restoration and preservation efforts.
Owners of landmark properties and individual historic properties within a preservation district
can take advantage of: State Historic Building Code (which provides safe alternatives to the
Uniform Building Code), Housing Rehabilitation Assistance, possible federal income tax credits,
technical assistance from the Community Development Department, increased property values,
neighborhood protection, and official recognition.
General Plan policies strive to ensure long-term historic preservation in Santa Rosa by encour-
aging preservation of historic structures, as well as their surrounding setting in areas of new
development and redevelopment, and by discouraging demolition of historic resources and mis-
guided home improvements.
11-4 GOAL AND POLICIES
HP-A            Protect Native American heritage.
HP-A-1          Review proposed developments and work in conjunction with the California
                Historical Resources Information System, Northwest Information Center at
                Sonoma State University, to determine whether project areas contain known
                archaeological resources, either prehistoric and/or historic-era, or have the
                potential for such resources.
HP-A-2          Require that project areas found to contain significant archaeological resources
                be examined by a qualified consulting archaeologist for recommendations con-
                cerning protection and preservation.
HP-A-3          If cultural resources are encountered during development, work should be
                halted to avoid altering the materials and their context until a qualified
                consulting archaeologist and Native American representative (if appropriate)
                have evaluated the situation, and recorded identified cultural resources and
                determined suitable mitigation measures.
HP-A-4          Consult with local Native American tribes to identify, evaluate, and
                appropriately address cultural resources and tribal sacred sites through the
                development review process.
HP-A-5          Ensure that Native American human remains are treated with sensitivity and
                dignity and assure compliance with the provisions of California Health and
                                                                                                 11-3

12                       NOISE AND SAFETY
   This element presents an overview of the environmental and man-made hazards
   affecting Santa Rosa. Noise generation, geology and seismicity, flooding, hazardous
   materials, and wildland fires are all addressed.
   12-1 VISION
   Santa Rosa has safe and livable neighborhoods, shopping areas, workplaces, and
   recreation facilities in 2035. Noise levels along highways and regional/arterial
   streets are reduced through improved levels of service and noise attenuation
   measures, such as wide setbacks, landscaping, and traffic control signals. Noise
   along Highways 101 and 12 is buffered through construction of attractive sound
   walls adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
   All new rehabilitated structures are constructed according to the California Building
   Code to ensure safety. Geologic hazards are considered in site and building design,
   and storm water improvements ensure that development along creek corridors is
   protected from flooding hazards. New structures built within downtown or along
   the Rodgers Creek Fault Zone are designed to withstand seismic activity. Potential
   for wildland fires is addressed through site and landscaping design. Education about
   safety in the event of disaster continues, to ensure that Santa Rosa residents are
   well prepared for earthquakes, floods, and fires.
   12-2 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
   The Santa Rosa Emergency Operations Plan addresses how the city will respond to
   extraordinary events or disasters, from preparation through recovery. It includes a
   comprehensive assessment of potential hazards and threats, and sets forth policies
   and procedures pertaining to emergency planning, organization, and response.
   The plan is based on the principles and functions of the Standardized Emergency
   Management System (SEMS). Additionally, in 2006 the city adopted a Local
   Hazard Mitigation Plan. The plan‚Äôs overall goal is to make Santa Rosa a disaster
   resistant community by reducing the potential loss of life, property damage, and
   environmental degradation from natural disasters while accelerating economic
   recovery. The Sonoma County Fire and Emergency Services Department is the lead

NOISE AND SAFETY
agency for the Sonoma Operational Area and the City is one of nine incorporated cities within
the organizational boundary.
12-3 NOISE
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. In most of Santa Rosa, noise can be characterized as
routine background sounds, and unusual or intermittent events. Cars, trucks, buses, trains,
air conditioning systems, and aircraft generate background city noise. Intermittent, and
sometimes excessive, noise can come from leaf blowers, helicopters, train whistles (at grade
crossings), chain saws, un-muffled motor vehicles, and similar sources. Excessive noise can
cause annoyance, health problems, economic loss, and ultimately hearing impairment.
Sound waves, traveling outward from a source, exert a sound pressure level usually measured
in decibels (dB). Environmental noise is usually measured in A-weighted decibels; a metric
corrected for the human ear‚Äôs response to various frequencies (some animals can hear sounds
outside the human range). This plan describes noise in A-weighted scale. Most people can
detect a change in sound level at about 3 dB. An increase of 10 dB is perceived as a doubling of
loudness.
PROJECTED NOISE SOURCES
The major sources of noise in Santa Rosa throughout the General Plan timeframe include:
     U.S. Highway 101 and State Highway 12. Widening Highway 101 to six lanes through the
     city may increase noise levels as traffic is attracted from alternate routes (i.e. Petaluma Hill
     Road). Noise is created by tire interaction with the roadbed, and truck engines. In terms of
     sound energy, noise from one truck is equivalent to 20 autos.
     Regional/Arterial streets. Major regional/arterial streets with substantial noise levels include
     Fulton Road, Guerneville Road, Bellevue Avenue, Stony Point Road, Mendocino Avenue,
     Fountaingrove Parkway, Calistoga Road, Summerfield Road, and College Avenue. In general,
     auto traffic volumes will increase by 2035, along with greater noise levels.
     Railroad operations. When freight service resumes and passenger rail commences on the
     Northwestern Pacific Railroad, a number of large trucks and some vehicles may be removed
     from travel on Highway 101. Railroad noise will be most noticeable from horn soundings at
     grade crossings.
     Emergency medical helicopters and vehicles. Emergency medical vehicles with sirens create
     intermittent but significant noise. Helicopter operations can affect a large population; the
     city has received complaints regarding the medical helicopter operations at Memorial and
     Sutter hospitals.

    Landscaping equipment. Landscaping equipment, such as gasoline powered leaf blowers,
    generate noise and are regulated by the city‚Äôs Noise Ordinance.
    Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. Operation of the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma
    County Airport is addressed in the Sonoma County Transportation Element and the
    Airport Land Use Plan. The city regulates the type of development permitted on a small
    portion of land within the noise-shed of the airport runways.
    Industrial and commercial facilities. To a lesser extent, industrial and commercial facilities
    are sometimes the sources of noise, particularly auto wrecking and commercial loading
    operations. The city receives infrequent complaints about noises occasionally generated by
    these businesses.
The noise standards used by the City of Santa Rosa include the Land Use Compatibility
Standards for Community Noise environment (Figure 12-1), State of California Noise
Insulation Standards (California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 2), and applicable
standards in the City of Santa Rosa Noise Ordinance. General Plan policies address noise
attenuation along major regional/arterial streets through location of land uses, site design,
architectural standards, barriers, and street materials.
Figure 12-2 illustrates projected noise contours. A larger, separate fold-out map illustrating
projected 2020 noise contours, along with data tables specifying projected distances to 2020
noise contours, is available from the Santa Rosa Community Development Department.
12-4 GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
Santa Rosa is within the natural region of California known as the Coast Ranges geomorphic
province. The geology of Santa Rosa can vary from bedrock uplands to alluvial flatlands.
Because of this varied geology, geologic hazards that could affect the City of Santa Rosa include:
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Expansive soils. Expansive soils possess a ‚Äúshrink-swell‚Äù characteristic (cyclic change
           in volume due to the increase or decrease in moisture content) that occurs in fine-
           grained clay sediments. Expansion and contraction over the long term causes
           structural damage, usually the result of inadequate soil and foundation engineering
           or the placement of structures directly on expansive soils.
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Landsliding. A landslide is a mass of rock, soil, and debris displaced down-slope by
           sliding, flowing, or falling. Steep slopes and down-slope creep (slow downward slope
           movement) of surface materials characterize areas most susceptible to landsliding.
           The landslide hazard is increased with steep slopes located close to the Rodgers
           Creek Fault Zone.

faults, as shown in Figure 12-3. The Rodgers Creek Fault Zone, approximately eight miles
southeast of the Maacama Fault Zone, and 20 miles northeast of the San Andreas Fault Zone
runs through the central part of Santa Rosa. The Rodgers Creek and San Andreas faults are the
two principally active, Bay Area ‚Äústrike-slip‚Äù faults and have experienced movement within
the last 150 years--strike-slip faults primarily exhibit displacement in a horizontal direction.
The San Andreas Fault Zone is a major structural feature in the region. Other principal faults
capable of producing ground shaking in Santa Rosa include the Hayward, San Gregorio-Hosgri
Fault Zone, the Calaveras fault, and the Concord-Green Valley fault.
Santa Rosa could experience a major Rodgers Creek Fault Zone earthquake or an earthquake on
any one of the active or potentially active faults in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. General
Plan policies seek to ensure that the new structures are built with consideration of the four
major hazards associated with earthquakes.
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Surface Fault Rupture. Surface fault rupture, displacement at the earth‚Äôs surface
            resulting from fault movement, is typically observed close to or on the active fault
            trace. The Rodgers Creek Fault Zone extends beneath downtown and has the highest
            potential for significant fault rupture.
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Ground Shaking. Santa Rosa could be affected by strong ground shaking caused by
            a major earthquake during the next 30 years. Ground shaking can be described in
            terms of peak acceleration, peak velocity, and displacement of the ground. Areas
            that are underlain by bedrock tend to experience less ground shaking than those
            underlain by unconsolidated sediments such as artificial fill. Ground shaking may
            affect areas hundreds of miles away from the earthquake‚Äôs epicenter.
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Liquefaction and Ground Failure. Liquefaction is the process by which water-saturated
            soil materials lose strength and fail during strong seismic ground shaking. The
            shaking causes the pore-water pressure in the soil to increase, thus transforming the
            soil from a solid to a liquid. Liquefaction has been responsible for ground failures
            during almost all of California‚Äôs great earthquakes.
        ÔÇ∑ÔÄ† Earthquake-Induced Landslides. Seismically induced landsliding is typical of upland
            areas with slopes greater than 25 percent. Earthquake groundshaking can trigger
            slope movements such as earth flows and rotational landslides, or dislodge fractured
            bedrock material resulting in a rockfall.
                                                                                                   12-7

NOISE AND SAFETY
12-5 FLOODING
Flooding hazards may be considered in two categories: natural flooding and dam inundation.
Natural flooding hazards are those associated with major rainfall events, which result in the
flooding of developed areas due to overflows of nearby waterways, or inadequacies in local
storm drain facilities. In the City of Santa Rosa, most of the annual precipitation falls between
the months of November and April. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
identified several 100-year and 500 year flood zones along portions of Spring Creek, Matanzas
Creek, Colgan Creek, Naval Creek, Roseland Creek, and Kawana Springs Creek in Santa Rosa.
Figure 12-4 illustrates areas subject to flooding and dam inundation.
Major creeks in Santa Rosa have the potential to cause flooding during a large storm event and
historically flooding has occurred in areas near creeks. In northern Santa Rosa, the number
and geographic distribution of creeks, combined with favorable topography creates a condition
in which flooding risks are expected to remain minimal during the planning period. In southern
Santa Rosa, drainage conditions are less favorable due to flat topography and the limited
number of drainageways (creeks and conduits) that are available for storm water disposal.
Currently, the majority of collected storm water in southern Santa Rosa is channeled into
Colgan and Roseland creeks. Limited capacity and concentrated discharge place these creeks at
the greatest risk of flooding during a 100-year storm event. Drainage improvements to both
creeks will be necessary to minimize flooding risks in the future.
To reduce flood risk within the community, the City of Santa Rosa complies with National
Flood Insurance Program regulations which apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
city. Flood hazard maps indicate the level of risk for flooding within various watersheds and
provide a foundation from which to make key decisions for future developments and projects.
Dam inundation hazards are those associated with the downstream inundation that
would occur given a major structural failure in a nearby reservoir. A major earthquake
could potentially cause damage or failure to a dam structure, and cause localized flooding.
Although dam failure is unlikely due to current state regulations for design, maintenance, and
monitoring of dams, Santa Rosa is exposed to the hazard of inundation from failure of local
dams such as Lake Ralphine.
Improvements to the storm drain system consistent with expansion or intensification of urban
development is essential to protecting Santa Rosans from flooding hazards. Additionally,
General Plan policies require provision of open space areas for storm water retention and
infiltration and opportunities for groundwater recharge. Monitoring urban runoff resulting
from planned development will allow for controlled stormdrain discharge into existing creeks
while also adding to groundwater supply in order to replenish existing aquifers. Limiting the

amount of stormwater runoff discharged into the city stormdrain system will help reduce
flooding events. The city will maintain and monitor the city hydraulic corridors in order to
prevent future hazards associated with flooding.
12-6 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials are used in the city for industrial, commercial, and household purposes,
and are regulated by federal, state, and local government agencies. These regulations are
intended to protect both the environment and public health and safety from improper use,
handling, storage, and transport of hazardous materials and waste. For example, the U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates transportation of hazardous materials. The
North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board has jurisdiction over water quality issues,
including groundwater contamination. The Santa Rosa Fire Department has been designated by
the State of California as a Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for hazardous materials
regulatory enforcement. The Fire Prevention Bureau is responsible for hazardous materials,
hazardous waste program management, hazardous materials enforcement and oversight
of contaminated soils remediation, including underground and aboveground storage tanks
containing hazardous materials and petroleum products. The Santa Rosa City Fire Department
Hazardous Materials Response Unit responds to hazardous materials spills.
Potential environmental and health and safety risks associated with hazardous materials in
Santa Rosa include automobile accidents involving vehicles transporting hazardous materials
or wastes (particularly along the Highway 101 corridor), accidental spills or leaks associated
with seismic events, and improper use, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous
materials.
Santa Rosa strictly adheres to federal, state, and local regulations to prevent chemical storage
and handling activities associated with industrial and commercial uses. These regulations
ensure that underground storage tanks do not release hazardous materials such as petroleum
products into the soil and groundwater. Public education efforts reduce improper disposal of
household-generated hazardous waste such as used motor oil, paints, and solvents which can
impact local waterways and drinking water supplies.
12-7 WILDLAND FIRES
Hillside residential neighborhoods located in the northern and eastern portions of the city
are subject to risk of wildland fire, and historically have been the site of such fires. Open areas
and slopes covered with tall grasses and/or chaparral provide fuels to feed wildfires, once
started. The City has identified a Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) zone that encompasses
four types of fire hazard zones: moderate, high, very high, and mutual threat. Approximately
30 percent of Santa Rosa is located within the WUI zone. Figure 12-6 depicts the WUI zone
and the location of very high fire hazard severity zones within the WUI zone. While the Santa

NOISE AND SAFETY
Rosa Fire Department has primary responsibility for fire protection within City limits, the
City is aided by California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and other surrounding
fire departments such as Rincon Valley Fire Protection District, Bennett Valley Fire
Department, Kenwood Fire Department, Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety, Windsor
Fire Department, and Sebastopol Fire Department. Fire-resistant building materials and
landscaping contribute to prevention of damage to residences in case of a wildfire. General Plan
policies requiring adequate fire flows and community fire breaks in residential subdivisions also
minimize potential for fire damage.
12-8 GOALS AND POLICIES
NS-A            Prepare for disasters.
NS-A-1          Maintain the Emergency Operations Plan as the city‚Äôs disaster-response plan.
                Work with Sonoma County to update joint-emergency response and disaster
                response plans, as needed.
NS-A-2          Continue to promote the Citizens Organized to Prepare for Emergencies (COPE)
                public awareness program on the nature and extent of natural hazards in the
                Planning Area, and ways of minimizing the effects of disasters.
NS-A-3          Establish community programs which train volunteers to assist police, fire, and
                civil defense personnel during and after disasters.
NS-A-4          Implement the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to better prepare Santa Rosa for
                disaster.
                The Local Hazard Mitigation Plan is an adopted ‚Äúimplementation appendix‚Äù to this
                Safety Element. It can be viewed on the City of Santa Rosa website.
NS-A-5          Locate essential public facilities, such as hospitals and clinics, emergency
                shelters, emergency command centers, and emergency communications
                facilities, outside of high fire risk area, flood hazard zones, and areas subject to
                dam inundation.
NOISE
NS-B            Maintain an acceptable community noise level to protect the health and
                comfort of people living, working and/or visiting in Santa Rosa, while
                maintaining a visually appealing community.
12-12

                                                         S A N TA R O S A G E N E R A L P L A N
NS-B-1 Do not locate noise-sensitive uses in proximity to major noise sources, except
       residential is allowed near rail to promote future ridership.
NS-B-2 Encourage residential developers to provide buffers other than sound walls,
       where practical. Allow sound walls only when projected noise levels at a site
       exceed land use compatibility standards in Figure 12-1.
       In some established neighborhoods and subdivisions, sound walls may provide the only
       alternative to reduce noise to acceptable community standards. The Design Review
       process shall evaluate sound wall aesthetics and landscaping to ensure attractiveness
       along with functionality.
NS-B-3 Prevent new stationary and transportation noise sources from creating a
       nuisance in existing developed areas. Use a comprehensive program of noise
       prevention through planning and mitigation, and consider noise impacts as a
       crucial factor in project approval.
       The Land Use Compatibility Standards specify normally acceptable levels for
       community noise in various land use areas.
NS-B-4 Require new projects in the following categories to submit an acoustical study,
       prepared by a qualified acoustical consultant:
       ‚Ä¢ All new projects proposed for areas with existing noise above 60dBA DNL.
           Mitigation shall be sufficient to reduce noise levels below 45 dBA DNL
           in habitable rooms and 60 dBA DNL in private and shared recreational
           facilities. Additions to existing housing units are exempt.
       ‚Ä¢ All new projects that could generate noise whose impacts on other existing
           uses would be greater than those normally acceptable (as specified in the
           Land Use Compatibility Standards).
NS-B-5 Pursue measures to reduce noise impacts primarily through site planning.
       Engineering solutions for noise mitigation, such as sound walls, are the least
       desirable alternative.
NS-B-6 Do not permit existing uses to generate new noises exceeding normally
       acceptable levels unless:
       ‚Ä¢   Those noises are mitigated to acceptable levels; or
       ‚Ä¢   The activities are specifically exempted by the City Council on the basis of
           community health, safety, and welfare.
NS-B-7 Allow reasonable latitude for noise generated by uses that are essential to
                                                                                         12-13

NOISE AND SAFETY
          community health, safety, and welfare. These include emergency medical
          helicopter and vehicle operations, and emergency vehicle sirens.
NS-B-8    Adopt mitigations, including reduced speed limits, improved paving
          texture, and traffic controls, to reduce noise to normally acceptable levels in
          areas where noise standards may be exceeded (e.g., where homes front regional/
          arterial streets and in areas of mixed use development.)
NS-B-9    Encourage developers to incorporate acoustical site planning into their projects.
          Recommended measures include:
          ‚Ä¢   Incorporating buffers and/or landscaped earth berms;
          ‚Ä¢   Orienting windows and outdoor living areas away from unacceptable noise
              exposure;
          ‚Ä¢   Using reduced-noise pavement (rubberized-asphalt);
          ‚Ä¢   Incorporating traffic calming measures, alternative intersection designs, and
              lower speed limits; and
          ‚Ä¢   Incorporating state-of-the-art structural sound attenuation and setbacks.
NS-B-10   Work with private enterprises to reduce or eliminate nuisance noise from
          industrial and commercial sources that impact nearby residential areas. If
          progress is not made within a reasonable time, the city shall issue abatement
          orders or take other legal measures.
NS-B-11   Work with CalTrans to assign a high priority to traffic noise mitigation
          programs. Support construction of attractive sound walls, as necessary along
          Highway 101 and Highway 12.
NS-B-12   Cooperate with Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Sutter Medical Center, and other
          hospitals proposing helipads. Minimize the noise and safety impacts of medical
          emergency helicopters through location and design of landing pads, regulation
          of flight times and frequency and, if necessary, sound attenuating alterations to
          nearby residences.
NS-B-13   Prohibit new helipads in developments of industrial, commercial, office, or
          business park uses. The city may make an exception if the helipad will provide a
          significant benefit for community health, safety, and welfare.
NS-B-14   Discourage new projects that have potential to create ambient noise levels
          more than 5 dBA DNL above existing background, within 250 feet of sensitive
          receptors.

GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
NS-C     Prohibit development in high-risk geologic and seismic hazard areas to
         avoid exposure to seismic and geologic hazards.
NS-C-1   Prior to development approval, require appropriate geologic studies to identify
         fault trace locations within active fault zones as designated by the provisions of
         the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. California registered geologists
         or engineers must conduct these studies and investigation methodologies must
         comply with guidelines set forth by the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning
         Act.
         Compliance with the Act would insure proper setback or appropriate design to minimize
         the potential hazards resulting from fault movement and surface displacement.
NS-C-2   Require comprehensive geotechnical investigations prior to development
         approval, where applicable. Investigations shall include evaluation of landslide
         risk, liquefaction potential, settlement, seismically-induced landsliding, or weak
         and expansive soils. Evaluation and mitigation of seismic hazards, including
         ground shaking, liquefaction, and seismically-induced landslides, shall comply
         with guidelines set forth in the most recent version of the California Division of
         Mines and Geology (CDMG) Special Publication 117.
         The level of investigation would depend on physical site location, local or regional
         geologic or seismic hazards, and recommendations by a consulting engineer.
NS-C-3   Restrict development from areas where people might be adversely affected by
         known natural or manmade geologic hazards. Hazards might include unstable
         slopes, liquefiable soils, expansive soils or weak poorly engineered fills, as
         determined by a California registered geologist or engineer.
NS-C-4   Restrict development of critical facilities--such as hospitals, fire stations,
         emergency management headquarters, and utility lifelines, including broadcast
         services, sewage treatment plants, and other places of large congregations--in
         areas determined as high-risk geologic hazard zones (e.g. Rodgers Creek Fault
         zone, liquefiable soils, areas of slope instability).
NS-C-5   Require identification and evaluation of existing structural hazards related
         to unreinforced masonry, poor or outdated construction techniques, and
         lack of seismic retrofit. Abate or remove any structural hazard that creates an
         unacceptable level of risk, including requiring post-earthquake buildings that are
                                                                                             12-15
NOISE AND SAFETY
          not currently retrofitted and are located within areas determined to experience
          strong ground shaking during an earthquake.
NS-C-6    Require appropriate and feasible seismic retrofit, as determined by a registered
          structural engineer, of commercial, industrial, and public buildings that are

NS-G-1    Require proposed developments in the Wildland Urban Interface zone, including
          the Very High Fire Hazard Severity zone, to investigate a site‚Äôs vulnerability to
          fire and to minimize risk accordingly.
NS-G-2    Require new development in Wildland Urban Interface areas to utilize fire-
          resistant building materials. Require the use of on-site fire suppression systems,
          including enhanced automatic sprinklers systems, smoke and/or detection
          systems, buffers and fuel breaks, and fire resistant landscaping. Require
          development and ongoing implementation of vegetation management plans to
          reduce the risk of wildland fires and to help prevent fires from spreading.
NS-G-3    Prohibit untreated wood shake roofs in Wildland Urban Interface areas.
NS-G-4    Continue monitoring water fire-flow capabilities throughout the city and
          improving water availability at any locations having flows considered inadequate
          for fire protection.
NS-G-5    Require detailed fire prevention and control measures, including community
          fuel breaks, for development projects in the Wildland-Urban Interface, including
          very high fire hazard severity zones.
NS-G-6    Minimize single-access residential neighborhoods in development areas near
          open space, and provide adequate access for fire and other emergency response
          personnel.

   This element recognizes that art and culture pay important economic, educational
   and social dividends for the city. Provisions for public art displays, facilities to house
   art production and performance and art programs are all addressed.
   13-1 VISION
   In 2035, arts and culture contribute to an elevated quality of life in Santa Rosa
   through economic vitality, local cultural pride, inspired education and productive art
   jobs. Policy decisions regarding city services and allocation of city resources include
   and support arts and cultural activities.
   Public art and centralized cultural facilities enhance the city‚Äôs identity, pride, and
   image. These gathering places contribute to a positive business climate, as well as
   provide a draw for tourism. Because the city recognizes the contributions of arts and
   culture to the community, dedicated resources are established to support an Arts
   Commission within the city‚Äôs structure. This Commission has a leadership role in
   shaping Santa Rosa as the cultural hub of Sonoma County.
   13-2 PUBLIC ART
   Approximately 150 art-related organizations exist in the City of Santa Rosa. In
   1995, the Santa Rosa City Council requested, at the suggestion of the Board of
   Community Services, that research be conducted about responsibility for art and
   culture within the city. The Board of Community Services, the Cultural Arts Council
   of Sonoma County, Design Review Board and the Redevelopment Agency all had
   served to advise the city. In 1995, the Art in Public Places Committee was formed to
   oversee the integration of art in public spaces according to the Art in Public Places
   Policy (#000-42).
   Public art and centralized cultural facilities enhance the city‚Äôs identity, pride and
   image. These gathering places contribute to a positive business climate, as well as
   provide a draw for tourism. Arts districts can help revitalize blighted areas, fulfill the
   need for affordable live/work space for artists and bring increased tax revenue to the
   city.

A R T A N D C U LT U R E
The city‚Äôs art and culture programs recognize and build
on the city‚Äôs rich culture and ethnic diversity. Art in
educational programs can provide skills to develop creative
and critical thinking needed for the contemporary work
force. Constructive self-expression of creative work, offering
positive reinforcement, contributes to guiding youth into
positive directions.

Goal or Policy
  Number                         2 - LAND USE AND LIVABILITY
 LUL-A          Foster a compact rather than a scattered development pattern in order to
                reduce travel, energy, land, and materials consumption while promoting
                greenhouse gas emission reductions citywide.
 LUL-A-1        As part of plan implementation ‚Äì including development review, capital
                improvements programming, and preparation of detailed area plans ‚Äì foster
                close land use/transportation relationships to promote use of alternative
                transportation modes and discourage travel by automobile.
 LUL-C-2        Review parking regulations downtown to consider its role as a pedestrian-
                and transit-friendly center.
 LUL-D-1        Require that the first floor of downtown buildings house activity generating
                uses such as retailing, entertainment and dining establishments, theaters
                and galleries, except as specified in Appendix B of the Downtown Station
                Area Specific Plan. Upper floors of downtown buildings may also contain
                such uses.
 LUL-E          Promote livable neighborhoods by requiring compliance with green building
                programs to ensure that new construction meets high standards of energy
                efficiency and sustainable material use. Ensure that everyday shopping,
                park and recreation facilities, and schools are within easy walking distance
                of most residents.
 LUL-E-2        As part of planning and development review activities, ensure that projects,
                subdivisions, and neighborhoods are designed to foster livability.
 LUL-E-6        Allow residential or mixed use development in the Retail and Business
                Services or Office designations.

GREENHOUSE GAS APPENDIX
  Goal or Policy
    Number                        2 - LAND USE AND LIVABILITY
  LUL-E-7        Develop a zoning category to implement the complete neighborhoods
                 concept to allow the development of compact, walkable, mixed use
                 neighborhoods including various housing types, non-residential job
                 generating uses, services, and public facilities which center on a square or
                 green and which include a transit stop. Include criteria for the district‚Äôs
                 application in developed and undeveloped sites, such as ideal size, and
                 consider the use of form-based regulations.
  LUL-F-4        Allow development on sites with a Medium Density Residential designation
                 to have a maximum density of 24 units per gross acre (and up to 30 units
                 per acre provided at least 20 percent of the housing units are affordable, as
                 defined in the Housing Element).
  LUL-G          Promote mixed use sites and centers.
  LUL-G-1        Develop the following areas as mixed use centers (see General Plan Land
                 Use diagram): South of Hearn Avenue, at Dutton Meadow Avenue, West of
                 Corporate Center Parkway, at Northpoint Parkway, Piner Road at Marlow

                 stories or toward the back of parcels, with retail and office activities fronting
                 the regional/arterial street.
  LUL-G-3        Prepare and implement mixed-use zoning district(s) that provide
                 development standards for mixed use sites and centers. District regulations
                 should address minimum density and intensity requirements; allowable
                 uses; building heights; shared parking standards; and prohibition of new
                 auto-oriented and drive-through establishments.
  LUL-H          Foster development of the South Santa Rosa Avenue area ‚Äì from Bellevue
                 Avenue to just north of Todd Road ‚Äì with a mix of retail and residential

LUL-M-1        Coordinate with SMART to implement the regional pedestrian/bicycle
               pathway along the rail right-of-way.
LUL-M-2        Require dedication of right-of-way for improvement and/or expansion of
               pedestrian and bicycle facilities where insufficient right-of-way currently
               exists.
 LUL-M-3       Within the specific plan area, give priority to pedestrian and bicycle
               improvements in the Railroad Square and Railroad Corridor Sub-Areas to
               promote use of these travel modes by those living or working in closest
               proximity to the station site.

Detention Dam/Basin/Pond. Dams may be classified according to the broad function they
serve, such as storage, diversion, or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood
runoff and minimize the effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In
one type, the water is temporarily stored, and released through an outlet structure at a rate
which will not exceed the carrying capacity of the channel downstream. Often, the basins are
planted with grass and used for open space or recreation in periods of dry weather. The other
type, most often called a Retention Pond, allows for water to be held as long as possible and
may or may not allow for the controlled release of water. In some cases, the water is allowed to
seep into the permeable banks or gravel strata in the foundation. This latter type is sometimes
called a Water-Spreading Dam or Dike because its main purpose is to recharge the underground
water supply. Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment. These are often called
Debris Dams.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Land Use Element. A required element of the General Plan that uses text and maps to
designate the future use or reuse of land within a given jurisdiction‚Äôs planning area. The land
use element serves as a guide to the structuring of zoning and subdivision controls, urban
renewal and capital improvements programs, and to official decisions regarding the distribution
and intensity of development and the location of public facilities and open space.
Land Use Regulation. A term encompassing the regulation of land in general and often used
to mean those regulations incorporated in the General Plan, as distinct from zoning regulations
(which are more specific).
Less than Significant Impact. An impact that would not result in a substantial and adverse
change in the environment and would not require mitigation.
Level of Service (LOS). (1) A scale that measures the amount of traffic a roadway may be
capable of handling on a roadway or at the intersection of roadways. Levels range from A to F,
with A representing the highest level of service, as follows:
    LOS A. Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on vehicle
    movement or speed.
    LOS B. Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle movement and
    speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
    LOS C. Denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some limitations on
    movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.
    LOS D. Denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections still function,
    but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through one cycle during short peaks.
    LOS E. Describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (although
    momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon
    at peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked
    intersections.
    LOS F. Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by ‚Äútraffic jams‚Äù and
    stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait
    through one or more signal changes, and ‚Äúupstream‚Äù intersections may be blocked by the
    long queues.
(2) Some communities in California are developing standards for levels of service relating to
municipal functions such as police, fire, and library service. These standards are incorporated
in the General Plan or in separate ‚ÄúLevel of Service Plans.‚Äù

Life Cycle Assessment. The comprehensive examination of a product‚Äôs environmental
and economic aspects and potential impacts throughout its lifetime, including raw material
extraction, transportation, manufacturing, use, and disposal. It incorporates, but is distinct
from Embodied Energy, which does not include use or disposal. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is
relevant to historic buildings in that, through their use and adapted reuse, much less energy is
used than building a new building as using LCA.
Linkage. With respect to jobs/housing balance, a program designed to offset the impact of
employment on housing need within a community, whereby project approval is conditioned on
the provision of housing units or the payment of an equivalent in-lieu fee. The linkage program
must establish the cause-and-effect relationship between a new commercial or industrial
development and the increased demand for housing.
Liquefaction. The transformation of loose water-saturated granular materials (such as sand
or silt) from a solid into a liquid state. A type of ground failure that can occur during an

Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo). A five- or seven-member commission
within each county that reviews and evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts,
incorporation of cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts, and
merger of districts with cities. Each county‚Äôs LAFCo is empowered to approve, disapprove, or
conditionally approve such proposals. The five LAFCo members generally include two county
supervisors, two city council members, and one member representing the general public. Some
LAFCos include two representatives of special districts.
Local Streets. Local streets, which form the heart of quiet neighborhoods, function primarily
to provide access to neighborhood destinations and make numerous connections within
neighborhoods. All of these streets provide vehicle, pedestrian and utility access. Traffic speed
of not more than 15-25 mph is appropriate for such streets. A measure of how successful a local
street is performing its intended function is how well it adds to the quality of the neighborhood
by offering access, parking, tranquility, and safety.
Local Streets, Trails. Trails are pedestrian path connectors through neighborhoods or along
creeks not intended for motorized vehicles. They often follow their own independent rights-
of-way or utility corridors. Serving as an alternative transportation system, trails connect
many homes to parks, schools, transit stops, join cul-de-sacs, provide access to transitional
streets and other common destinations. Trails can provide access into commercial districts,
for added access to more distant commercial districts, employment centers and major transit
hubs. Neighborhood trails also make connection to natural areas and parks, and should provide
access to regional greenways and open spaces. In healthy neighborhoods, trails may comprise
20-40 percent of the total residential connectors. Trails should provide pedestrian amenities at
                                                                                                  G-23

intervals such as shade, benches, water fountains and restrooms. Sitting areas with benches at
vista points and along creeks should be included.
Local Streets, Alleys. Alleys are slow speed (10 mph) secondary access ways running behind
and sometimes between rows of houses, or commercial buildings. Alleys can provide service
workers easy access to utilities and sanitation and give residents easy access to garages,
backyards, and any accessory units.
Local Streets, Lanes. These narrow roads (typically 16-20 feet wide) are useful in accessing
small numbers of homes (up to approximately 12 homes). Parking, when needed, can be placed
on one side or in parking bays. One-way lanes can operate around parks or nature preserves.
They also work well as two-way facilities in many other contexts. Landscaping and sidewalks fill
the remainder of the available public right-of-way.
Local Streets, Neighborhood Streets. Neighborhood streets are the most common type of
access road in healthy neighborhoods. This is the preferred street to service residential streets
when the street does not exceed 100 homes or 1000 average daily trips (ADT). Streets are short,
terminating in two to six blocks. These streets can also encircle a square or other public space.
On-street parking is encouraged as it helps to provide needed parking and slows traffic.
Local Streets, Minor Streets. Minor streets are utilized when the traffic volume exceeds
1000 average daily trips. Although efforts should be made to create interconnected street
layouts which disperse traffic, in many cases a concentration of traffic is unavoidable.
Low-income Household. A household with an annual income usually no greater than 80
percent of the area median family income adjusted by household size, as determined by a
survey of incomes conducted by a city or a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on
the latest available eligibility limits established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) for the Section 8 housing program. (See ‚ÄúArea.‚Äù)
Maintain, v. To keep in an existing state. (See ‚ÄúPreserve, v.‚Äù)

includes: avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation;
rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;
reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance during the life
of the action; and compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources
or environments.
Mixed Use. Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, institutional, and
residential, are combined in a single building or on a single site in an integrated development
project with significant functional interrelationships and a coherent physical design. A ‚Äúsingle
site‚Äù may include contiguous properties.
Mobile Home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis
and designed for use as a single-family dwelling unit and that (1) has a minimum of 400 square
feet of living space; (2) has a minimum width in excess of 102 inches; (3) is connected to all
available permanent utilities; and (4) is tied down (a) to a permanent foundation on a lot either

generally more than two acres in size but less than ten acres. They provide spaces for informal or
casual play, family or small group activities such as picnics, community gardens, children‚Äôs play
areas, a special feature such as a splash area, hard court or multi-use field space for fitness, and
passive natural areas.
Neighborhood Unit. According to one widely-accepted concept of planning, the neighborhood
unit should be the basic building block of the city. It is based on the elementary school, with
other community facilities located at its center and arterial streets at its perimeter. The
distance from the school to the perimeter should be a comfortable walking distance for a
school-age child; there would be no through traffic uses. Limited industrial or commercial
would occur on the perimeter where arterials intersect. This was the model for American
suburban development after World War II.

surface, such as earth berms and/or solid concrete walls.
Noise Contour. A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same scale.
Noise levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured in dBA) require noise attenuation in
residential development.
Noise Element. One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local general plan, it assesses
noise levels of highways and freeways, local arterials, railroads, airports, local industrial plants,
and other ground stationary sources, and adopts goals, policies, and implementation programs
to reduce the community‚Äôs exposure to noise.
Non-conforming Use. A use that was valid when brought into existence, but by subsequent
regulation becomes no longer conforming. ‚ÄúNon-conforming use‚Äù is a generic term and
includes (1) non-conforming structures (by virtue of size, type of construction, location on
land, or proximity to other structures), (2) non-conforming use of a conforming building, (3)
non-conforming use of a non-conforming building, and (4) non-conforming use of land. Thus,
any use lawfully existing on any piece of property that is inconsistent with a new or amended
General Plan, and that in turn is a violation of a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently
adopted in conformance with the General Plan, will be a non-conforming use. Typically, non-
conforming uses are permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain
