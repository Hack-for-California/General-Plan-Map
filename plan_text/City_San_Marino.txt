INTRODUCTION
A. City Profile
The City of San Marino was incorporated in 1913 and is located in central Los Angeles County. The
City is bounded by the Cities of South Pasadena, Alhambra, San Gabriel, Pasadena, and
unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County. The City is well accessed by the Southern
California freeway network and also contains several major thoroughfares which connect San
Marino to surrounding jurisdictions. The City is primarily residential in nature with limited
commercial areas. The City is also home to the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical
Gardens.
The City’s prime Southern California location, large properties and well-maintained homes have
resulted in high property values. The City is fully developed with only a handful of vacant parcels.
With the City’s limited commercial area, most residents work outside of the City.
B. Consistency with State Planning Law
State law requires that each local government adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the
physical development of the city. The Housing Element is one of the seven mandated elements of a
local general plan and is required so that local governments can adequately plan to meet the existing
and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The Housing Element
establishes goals and policies which are intended to further statewide housing goals and guide City
decisions. This document will also set forth an implementation plan for these goals and policies.
C. General Plan Consistency
State law requires that the General Plan contain an integrated, consistent set of goals and policies.
The City of San Marino’s General Plan contains elements relating to land use, community services,
natural resources, safety, housing and circulation. The Housing Element will provide goals, policies
and implementation measures that are consistent with all other elements of the existing General
Plan. If any portion of the General Plan is amended, the City will ensure the Housing Element
remains consistent with the General Plan.
New State law requires that the Safety and Conservation (included in the Natural Resources
Element) Elements include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management
information upon revisions to the Housing Element. The City will ensure compliance with this
requirement by reviewing its Safety and Natural Resources Elements. The City will provide a copy
of the Housing Element to the water and sewer service providers and coordinate with these agencies
regarding State-mandated water and sewer service priority for proposed housing affordable to lower
income households (SB 1087) in the event of a rationing of services.1

  No unincorporated disadvantaged communities are located within the City or its sphere of influence. The City is not
required to address the availability of services to such communities.

D. Housing Element Organization
The Housing Element is comprised of the following major components:
       Introduction – Provides a brief overview of the purpose and background of the Housing
        Element
       Community Profile – Contains an overview of the City’s population, housing and
        employment characteristics in the context of regional trends.
       Housing Needs Assessment – Presents a discussion of the City’s existing and future
        housing needs, including special needs such as the elderly and large families, and the City’s
        fair share of regional growth needs.
       Housing Constraints - A review of housing constraints and resources, including
        governmental and market constraints to the maintenance, improvement and development of
        housing.
       Housing Opportunities and Resources – Identifies opportunities and resources that will
        assist with the provision of housing in San Marino.
       Housing Plan – Identifies the goals, policies and programs that will guide the City’s actions
        in relation to addressing the housing needs of the community.
E. Public Participation
On May 31, 2013, the City Council discussed potential challenges for the upcoming 2013-2021
Housing Element update and provided policy direction to staff in formulating strategies for meeting
the State Housing Element mandates.
A publically noticed Planning Commission meeting was held on July 31, 2013. The purpose of this
meeting was to discuss housing issues in San Marino and to receive comments on the draft housing
element. In addition to the meeting being locally noticed, special notices were sent to housing
developers and agencies that serve special housing needs. The outreach list includes individuals and
agencies on the City’s mailing list for senior services and issues, the San Marino Chamber of
Commerce, the Chinese Club of San Marino, and local developers, among others. The complete list
is contained in Appendix A. A notice was also published in the San Marino Tribune. A summary of
public comments received is also provided in Appendix A.
A publically noticed joint Planning Commission and City Council meeting was held on December 2,
2013. The purpose of this meeting was to present the document that was acceptable to HCD to the
community, Planning Commission and City Council. Notices were sent to the outreach list found in
Appendix A as well as to residents that had spoken at previous meetings.
F. Data Sources
The following sources of data were used to help develop the housing needs and assess the market
conditions in San Marino:
       U.S. Census 2000 and 2010
       2007-2011 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates
       Realtor.com
                                                   2

 Zillow.com
 SCAG Existing Housing Needs Data Report
 Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority Homeless Count
 City of San Marino Building Permit Data

 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data
                                          3

COMMUNITY PROFILE
The housing needs of the City are determined by the demographic characteristics of the population
and the characteristics of the housing available to that population. The local housing market is
seldom static, constantly changing with dynamic social and economic factors. As city demographics
and household socioeconomic conditions change, different housing opportunities arise and/or must
be created to meet demand. This section explores the characteristics of the housing needs in the San
Marino community. This information helps to provide direction in updating the City’s Housing
Element goals, policies, and programs.
A. Population Trends and Characteristics
The City of San Marino is one of 88 cities located in Los Angeles County. The County’s population
increased slightly between 2000 and 2010, from 9,519,330 to 9,787,747, a 1.02% increase. Between
2000 and 2010, San Marino’s population increased slightly from 12,945 to 13,147 residents, a 1.01%
increase, which closely matches L.A. County’s population trend. The average household size is 3.02
persons per household, down from a household size of 3.03 in the year 2000.
1. Age Composition
According to the 2000 Census, the City of San Marino was comprised mostly of persons between
the ages of 25 and 54. There were also a significant number of school-aged children and young
adults between the ages of 5 and 24. The 2010 Census shows a similar distribution but there is a
notable increase in the number of retirement aged citizens and correlating decrease in the 25-54 year
old group. These numbers indicate that the City continues to house a large number of working
families with children and that the City is experiencing an increase in its retirement aged population.
Table 1 illustrates the age distribution of residents in San Marino.
                                 Table 1: Age Distribution (2000-2010)

               Source: Bureau of the Census, 2000-2010
2. Race and Ethnicity
The U.S. Census provides statistics regarding the race and ethnicity of a city's population. These
statistics are helpful for assessing housing needs as different ethnic groups have varying housing
needs and expectations. As of 2010, San Marino was primarily comprised of persons classified as
“Asian.” The other racial group significantly represented in San Marino was “White, non-Hispanic.”
These two groups characterized approximately 94.8% of the residents in San Marino.
Approximately 6.5% of the City’s population was of Hispanic origin. Table 2 highlights the racial
and ethnic distribution of residents according to the 2010 Census.

                       1
                         The Census does not count persons of Hispanic origin as a distinct
                       race, therefore, this figure is not included in the total.
                       Source: 2010 Census
B. Employment Trends
Employment and income are two important factors in determining a household’s ability to secure
housing. According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, there were 5,904 residents of
the City of San Marino in the labor force. This is down from the 2007 figure of 6,300 residents in
the labor force, as estimated by the California Employment Development Department. This
reduction in the workforce is consistent with the City’s aging population. The 2007-2011 American
Community Survey (ACS) estimates San Marino’s unemployment rate at 2.1%, which is much lower
than the L.A. County unemployment rate of 6.4%. The ACS also indicates that members of the San
Marino labor force are primarily employed by the following industries: finance, insurance and real
estate; professional services; and education, health and social sciences. Employees of these
industries make up 64% of the labor force.

The City is primarily residential in nature and has four “pockets” of commercial uses. These areas
are primarily comprised of small scale retail and professional office space. The City’s largest
employers are the San Marino Unified School District with 415 employees and the Huntington
Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, with 385 employees.
C. Household Characteristics
Before current housing problems can be understood and future needs anticipated, the City’s housing
occupancy characteristics need to be identified. The following is an analysis of household size,
household growth, tenure, and vacancy trends. By definition, a "household" consists of all the
people occupying a dwelling unit, whether or not they are related. A single person living in an
apartment is a household, just as a couple with two children living in the same dwelling unit is
considered a household.
1. Household Formation and Composition
Between 2000 and 2010, the number of San Marino households grew at a slower rate than both Los
Angeles County and the State. While Los Angeles County’s total number of households increased
3.4% between 2000 and 2010, San Marino’s total number of households grew only 1.5% during the
same period. The total number of households in the City in 2010 was 4,330 representing a net
increase of 104 households since 2000. Table 4 compares total household growth in the City,
County and State.
                               Table 4: Total Households (2000-2010)
                                                                     % Increase

                    San Marino                      4,266      4,330         1.5%
                    Source: 2000 and 2010 Census
In 2000, the Census indicated that the average household size within the City was approximately
3.03 persons per household. This has decreased slightly to an estimated 3.02 persons per household
in 2010. In comparison, the average household size in Los Angeles County did not change from
2.98 persons per household from 2000-2010.
Understanding the composition of these households is important in planning for future housing
stock. San Marino households are comprised primarily of married-couple family households. As
indicated in Table 5, among the San Marino households, 12 percent were single-person households,
a smaller proportion than is found in neighboring jurisdictions, and approximately half of both the
County and State’s overall proportions. Households headed by seniors (65+) comprised 31 percent
of all households, while families with children comprised 40 percent of all households. Both senior-
headed households and families with children represented a much larger proportion of San Marino’s
total households than all neighboring jurisdictions, the County, and the State. In addition, five
percent of San Marino households consisted of single parents, a smaller proportion than that found
in neighboring jurisdictions and approximately half that of both the County and State’s overall
                                                   6

proportions. San Marino has a significantly higher rate of homeowner large households (89 percent)

Table 6 below identifies housing units by tenure. San Marino has a significantly higher home
ownership rate than the State, County and surrounding communities. This is likely due to the high
household income that will be discussed in the next section. The average household size of a rented
unit is 3.38 persons, which is larger than the 2.94 person average for an owner-occupied unit.

2. Household Income
Household income is an important factor in considering the housing needs of a community as it
directly relates to the types of housing a community desires or needs. A higher household income
results in a greater likelihood of home-ownership, whereas lower household incomes can limit
housing options and quality.
Household income estimates for San Marino are found in Table 7. With a median household
income of $154,692, the City enjoyed a much higher household median income than the countywide
median of $56,266. In fact, San Marino had a significant number of upper-income households with
the majority having incomes of $150,000 or more.

The State of California uses five income categories for the purpose of determining housing
affordability and need in communities. These are based on the Area Median Income of a
metropolitan area. This method is consistent with definitions of low- and moderate-income
households used in various Federal and State housing programs, e.g., Section 8. These categories are:
     Extremely Low Income – 30% of AMI or less
     Very Low Income – 30% to 50% of AMI;
     Low Income—51% to 80% of AMI;
     Moderate Income—81% to 120% of AMI; and
     Above Moderate Income—more than 120% of AMI
Table 8 presents the distribution of household income in the City of San Marino based on the
median household income as established by the HUD AMI for Los Angeles County. Many of the
lower income residents are likely elderly residents living on fixed incomes. Despite a lower income,
these same residents may be in possession of other assets that contribute to a higher net worth.

D. Housing Inventory and Market Conditions
This section summarizes the housing inventory in the City of San Marino and prevailing market
conditions. Analysis of past trends in the housing stock provides a method of projecting the future
housing needs of San Marino.
3. Housing Stock Profile
Data from the US Census indicates that the housing stock in the City increased by 40 units between
2000 and 2010 at a rate of 0.9%. San Marino’s proportionally smaller increase in housing stock
during this time period is due primarily to its near-capacity build-out. SCAG’s 2012 Existing
Housing Needs Data Report growth forecast shows a minimal increase in population (200 people)
and no change to the projected number of households over the next 20 years. The forecast does not
project the future number of housing units. An evaluation of the adequacy of a community’s
housing stock needs to consider the type and size of housing provided to meet the specific needs of
the community, as well as the affordability of these units.

          Source: 2000 and 2010 Census
Analysis of the housing stock as per 2010 Census reports indicates that 91.9% of San Marino’s total
housing units are comprised of three bedrooms or more, with only 7.3% of the stock comprised of
two-bedroom units. All of the City’s housing stock is comprised of single-family detached homes.
Assuming similar trends during this planning period, the City’s housing stock appears to provide an
adequate proportion of housing units with three or more bedrooms to meet the needs generated by
large families. The majority of these units, however, are ownership units, and therefore financially
unattainable for many lower-income renter households.
a. Vacancy Rates
The vacancy rate is a measure of the general availability of housing. It also indicates how well the
available units meet the current housing market demand. A low vacancy rate suggests that
households may have difficulty finding housing within their price range; a high vacancy rate may
indicate either the existence of a high number of units that are undesirable for occupancy, or an
oversupply of housing units. A vacancy rate of 3% to 5% is considered normal. San Marino’s
residential vacancy rate declined slightly from 2000 to 2010 from 3.9% to 3.3%. The homeowner
vacancy rate is quite low, at 0.5% and the rental vacancy rate is much higher, at 6.5%. The overall
decrease in vacancy rates and negligible increase of new City residents reconciles with the relatively
few units created. This indicates that there appears to be an adequate number of housing units
available in the City for its current population.
                                                     9

b. Tenure
A significant number of the housing units in San Marino are owner-occupied as shown in Table 10.
In LA County, the percentage of owner-occupied units is much closer to the number of renter
occupied units, at 47.7% and 52.3% respectively. The surrounding cities of Alhambra, Pasadena San
Gabriel and South Pasadena have numbers similar to those of LA County and they all have a higher
percentage of renter-occupied units than owner-occupied units. San Marino’s high ownership rate
can be primarily attributed to the city’s high household income. The average household size of a
renter-occupied unit is larger than that of an owner-occupied unit. The 2010 Census indicates that
there were 2.94 persons per owner-occupied and 3.38 persons per renter-occupied unit. In 2000,
renter occupied units also had a larger household size than owner–occupied units.

c.  Housing Stock
According to the 2010 Census, there were 4,477 housing units in the City. Single-family detached
dwellings characterize the City of San Marino. There are some accessory housing units throughout
the city. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know with certainty how many properties contain guest
houses or second units. Since 2006, there have been three new second units constructed in San
Marino. There is no multi-family housing in San Marino; however, there is a private school within
the city which has dormitory facilities and a church which provides housing units for clergy and/or
church staff.
d. Age of Housing Stock
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, approximately 82.7% of the current housing stock in San Marino
was constructed before 1960. In 2000, this number was higher, at 87.6%. The City’s older housing
stock is kept in very good shape and visually, very few homes appear to be in need of major repairs
or maintenance. Many of the surrounding communities were developed around the same time and
share a similarly aged housing stock. Table 11 illustrates the distribution of age for the housing stock
in San Marino.

e. Housing Conditions
The only information on housing conditions reported by the Census is the status of kitchen and
plumbing facilities. According to the 2010 Census, less than 1% of the total housing stock in the
City of San Marino lacked complete kitchen facilities and no housing units lacked complete
plumbing facilities. Units that lacked kitchen facilities were most likely second units or guest homes
inhabited by live-in domestic staff or family members. It is recognized that there are a number of
housing problems that are not included in this definition, such as structural, roofing, heating and
electrical deficiencies. However, deferred maintenance or substandard conditions are rarely found in
the city. Most residents are able to afford to maintain their properties as well as upgrade their
properties. For those that are not able to afford such repairs, the City has limited Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds available to assist homeowners with things such as
roofing or electrical repairs. Code enforcement and maintenance of the community is consistently
practiced and substandard housing conditions are not a major concern of the city. As mentioned
above, most of the City’s housing stock was developed prior to 1960. The main concern for the
future would be how the aging housing stock will withstand seismic activity.
f.  Bedrooms Per Unit
Table 12 shows the number of bedrooms per unit in the city. There are a minimal number of one
and two-bedroom units in the city. The majority of homes have three and four bedrooms. It
should be noted that the one-bedroom units are likely second units or guesthouses that were
occupied or rented by household employees such as nannies or housekeepers, or by other family
members.

2. Housing Costs and Rents
This section discusses resale cost of housing as well as the average rental prices in the City. The
information was obtained from reliable real estate industry data sources, the 2010 Census and data
provided by the City.
a. Home Price Trends
The 2007-2011 ACS documents a median housing unit value of over $1,000,000 in San Marino, well
above the County median of $478,300. The values indicate that just 5.1% of the houses were valued
at less than $500,000. Over 70% of the units were valued at $1,000,000 or more.
When looking at housing value, the ACS is useful because it provides a breakdown of price range, as
well as units within each price range. However, the ACS data sets do not provide very specific
information for most of the City’s housing stock because it does not provide a breakdown of units
over $1,000,000, which are the majority of San Marino units. It is more fitting to review
contemporary data available through countywide surveys gathered by private data firms. A March
2013 survey compiled by Zillow.com lists San Marino’s median sale price at over $1.6 million, and
Los Angeles County’s median home sale price at $369,700. Similar data collected from Zip Realty in
2007 indicates that San Marino’s median home price was over $1.4 million and the County’s median
sale price was $574,100. Comparing the City’s median with the County’s illustrates that the gap has
widened between the County and City, and the price of homes in San Marino remains significantly
greater than the County median, and beyond affordability for most families. Further, the price of
homes in San Marino has not been as affected by the economic highs and lows of the past 10 years
as greatly as the price of homes in the County. The San Marino prices retained a general upward
trend versus the LA County values which showed a distinct period of decline. The charts below
show how San Marino’s median sale prices compare with those of LA County and how current
median prices compare with surrounding communities.

b. Rental Prices
The 2007-2011 ACS reported the median contract rent of all rental units in the City is over $2,000
per month. Table 13 lists the rental ranges per the 2007-2011 ACS and the number of units that
rented for within that particular price range.

Since the units reported as multi-family in the City are actually units associated with a church and a
boarding school, it is assumed that the stock of rental units in the City is comprised of single-family
units. An informal survey of available rental units in the City was conducted in the second quarter
of 2013. Table 14 lists the rental ranges of selected units by number of bedrooms. It is interesting
to note that the majority of units available for rent consist of three and four bedroom units, with a
median size of 2,448 square feet and a median rent of $4,750 per month.

c.    Affordability Gap Analysis
The costs of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay for
housing in order to determine if a household is overpaying for housing. Overpayment refers to
renters and homeowners who must pay more than 30% of their gross incomes for shelter. A high
cost of housing eventually causes fixed-income, elderly, and lower income households to use a
disproportionate percentage of their income for housing. This may cause a series of related financial
problems which may result in deterioration of housing stock, because costs associated with
maintenance must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses (e.g. food, clothing, medical care, and
utilities), or inappropriate housing sizes and types to suit the needs of the household.
Table 15 shows the 2013 maximum affordable rent and purchase prices for housing in the City of
San Marino according to income categories and household size. The data indicates that it would not
be possible for an extremely low income, very low income, low income, or median income
household to afford a rental unit in San Marino. It may be possible for a larger moderate income
household to afford a small rental unit, however, this would likely result in overcrowded conditions.
It would not be possible for extremely low income, very low income, low income, median income,
or moderate income family to afford to purchase a house in San Marino. Only above moderate
income households would be able to afford to rent or purchase a home of adequate size for the
household in San Marino.

HOUSING NEEDS
A. Existing Needs
State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation of the private and public sectors is
necessary to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the community. A primary
State goal is the provision of decent housing and suitable living environments for Californians of all
economic levels. Historically, the private sector generally responds to the majority of the
community's housing needs through the production of market-rate housing. However, the
percentage of the population on a statewide basis who can afford market rate housing is declining.
In addition, there are other factors that affect a household or person’s ability to find adequate
housing. The following sections analyze the households in San Marino which experience some sort
of problem in their housing situation as well as discusses the special housing needs of certain
disadvantaged groups.
1. Households Experiencing Overcrowding
As defined by State housing policy, overcrowding is a unit that contains more than one person per
room. Overcrowding places a strain on physical facilities, does not provide a satisfying
environment, and eventually causes conditions that contribute both to deterioration of the housing
stock and neighborhoods in general. Table 16 shows the number of persons per room in all units in
the City of San Marino by tenure.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, only 0.8% of the total households in San Marino were
overcrowded. Numerically, this represents only 35 households. The SCAG Existing Housing Needs
Data Report contains slightly different numbers and identifies 0.72% of San Marino households as
overcrowded, which is equal to 31 households. This is still quite low and severe overcrowding (more
than 1.5 persons per room) was not documented in any San Marino household. Table 16 breaks
down overcrowded housing units by tenure. The data shows that all of the overcrowded units were
owner-occupied. Given the generally large size of housing units in San Marino, overcrowding is not
a prevalent problem in the city.

2. Households Overpaying for Housing
For policy and general planning purposes, local and state governments use the following criteria for
affordability: "Affordable housing costs with respect to very low, low and moderate income
households shall not exceed 30% of gross household income." (Health and Safety Code, Section
50052.9). The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census
Bureau for HUD, however, provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for
different types of households in San Marino. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2005-2009 ACS
data is displayed in (Table 17). Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
        Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
        Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
        Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
        Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
Overall, the majority of households in San Marino pay less than 30 percent for housing costs. The
majority of lower income households pay more than 30 percent of their gross income and are
overpaying for housing. When looking at overpayment by tenure, Table 17 shows that
overpayment was more widespread in owner households (39.3%) than in renter households (14.9%).
Lower income (less than 80 percent of median income) households comprise approximately 15
percent of all owner-occupied households, and lower income households comprise approximately
23 percent of all renter households.
A distinction between renter and owner housing overpayment is important because while
homeowners may overextend themselves financially to afford the option of a home purchase, there
are benefits to owning a home. Overpayment among the moderate and above moderate income
categories is not much of a concern. Some owner households choose to allocate a higher percentage
of their disposable income on housing costs because this allocation is justified in light of investment
qualities of ownership.
Purchase prices in the City are extremely high at the present time, and it is unlikely that a household
in the lower income range would be able to purchase a home without overextending themselves. It
is clear that lower income households in particular will have difficulty finding housing affordable for
purchase in the existing housing stock.

3. Special Needs Groups
State Housing Law requires that the special needs of certain disadvantaged groups be addressed.
The needs of the elderly, disabled, large families, female heads of households, the homeless and farm
workers are discussed below.
a. Elderly Persons
According to the 2010 Census, there were 2,099 persons in the City (16.2%) aged 65 and above.
The Census reports 30.4% of all of the City’s households were headed by persons 65 years or older.
Elderly persons often have fixed incomes in addition to other special needs related to housing. The
elderly often require physical improvements to their homes such as ramps, handrails, lower
cupboards and counters, etc. They may also need additional assistance in the form of a part-time or
live-in caretaker. In most instances the elderly prefer to stay in their own dwellings rather than
relocate to a retirement community. Of all of the City’s 2,099 senior households, only 47
households, or 2.2%, were renter-occupied housing units. In San Marino, and particularly among
the Asian community, it is very common for multiple generations of a family to remain together as
one household. Many new houses and addition projects have first story master suites to
accommodate elderly parents or grandparents who will also be living in the home.
b. Large Families
Table 18 displays the number of large households by tenure for the City of San Marino. Large
households are defined as five or more persons and are included as a special needs group because
they require larger dwellings with more bedrooms. According to the Census, large households
represent 14% of all households in San Marino. The data indicates that there were 607 large
households in the City in 2010. Proportionately, rental units had a larger percentage of large families
than owner-occupied units; numerically, there were a greater number of large owner-occupied
households. The 2007-2011 ACS shows that 48.7% of all housing units have four or more
bedrooms. The rental unit survey found in Table 14 shows that over half of the units available for
rent had four or more bedrooms. These units appear to be sufficient to accommodate the
percentage of large household renters as no renter-occupied households reported overcrowded
conditions. Although there are resources available to meet the needs of large families, there may not
be sufficient numbers at the price range affordable to all large households. Available units may be
out of the affordable price range for a number of households, and a number of larger bedroom units
may be rented or owned by smaller households or those able to afford the market price.

c.   Female-headed Households
Female-headed households are included as a special needs group because of the low rate of
homeownership, lower incomes, and high poverty rates experienced by this group. According to the
2010 Census, females head 756 households, or 17.4% of total households. Table 19 illustrates the
percentage of female-headed households for the City of San Marino. The data shows that the
majority of female-headed households have no children under the age of 18. The 2010 Census also
reports that 7.4% of female headed households have an income below the poverty level. However,
this data is reported with a large margin of error of +/- 8.8%.

d. Disabled Persons (Including Persons with Developmental Disabilities)
Given San Marino’s small population, both the 2010 Census and American Community Surveys do
not document updated data on persons with disabilities in the City.
The State Department of Developmental Services provides data regarding developmentally disabled
residents of San Marino. The Department breaks down the data into five categories by type of
residence (home of parent/family/guardian or residential care facility) and age group. However, if
the data set contains less than 25 people, the actual number of residents is not shown. As of
November 2012, the data extracted for the 91108 zip code identified less than 25 residents in four of
the five categories that are tabulated. The data identified 46 children under the age of 18 that are
living with a parent, family or guardian. Therefore, the exact number of developmentally disabled
residents cannot be identified. Assuming up to 24 residents in each of the four other categories, we
can determine that there are not more than 142 developmentally disabled residents.
The City of San Marino is home to one Adult Care Facility which was last known to staff to house
visually impaired adults. The property is located within a residential zone and it houses no more
than six individuals.
e. Homeless Population
Due to the nature of homelessness, an accurate count of the homeless population is difficult at best.
In addition, homelessness is a transitory condition (i.e., a person may be homeless one week, but not
the next). The very definition of homeless varies by person. There are those who are without
housing of their own and live on streets, in vehicles, etc. There are also those who are temporarily
sleeping in homes or apartments of friends or relatives. Every two years, the Los Angeles Homeless
Services Authority organizes volunteers to canvas the streets of Los Angeles County and count the
homeless population over the course of three days in January. In 2011 and 2013, San Marino has
participated in this count and each year there have been zero homeless observed in San Marino.
                                                     21

f.  Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural work. Farmworkers have special housing needs because they earn lower
incomes than many other workers do and move throughout the season from one harvest to the
next. According to the ACS, 44 residents (.8% of the total population) were employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, or mining occupations. Currently, there are no active agricultural field
operations in the City, so it is likely that persons reporting such occupations are employed at
locations outside of the City. The data indicates that there is not a need for farmworker housing in
the City.
4. Preservation of Assisted Units at Risk of Conversion
There are no existing assisted housing units deed-restricted for lower income households in the City
and therefore, no units are at risk of conversion to market-rate housing in San Marino.
B. Growth Needs
1. Overview of the SCAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for SCAG and local governments
to plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the need for housing within each jurisdiction
for each Housing Element update cycle. Communities then determine how they will address this
need through the process of completing the Housing Element of their General Plan. The RHNA
does not necessarily encourage or promote growth, but rather allows communities to anticipate
growth, so that they can grow in ways that enhance quality of life, improve access to jobs,
transportation, and housing, and not adversely impact the environment.
a. RHNA Methodology
The RHNA allocation methodology takes into account existing and projected housing needs.
Projected housing needs are determined by three components: projected household growth, healthy
market vacancy need, and housing replacement need. The future need for housing is determined
primarily by the forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by
a child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so
forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new households is then adjusted to
maintain a desirable level of vacancy needed to promote housing choice and mobility. In the SCAG
region, many communities currently have more than the ideal number of vacancies; the vacancy
adjustment, therefore, results in a net reduction in total housing need. Finally, a second adjustment
is made to account for units expected to be lost due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to
non-housing uses. The sum of these factors—household growth, vacancy need (which may be a
negative number), and replacement need— determines the construction need for a community.
Finally, the RHNA considers how each jurisdiction might grow in ways that will decrease the
concentration of low income households in certain communities. The need for new housing is
distributed among income groups so that each community moves closer to the regional average
income distribution.

b. Fifth Housing Element Update Cycle (October 15, 2013 through October 15, 2021)
For the fifth Housing Element update, the RHNA covers a slightly different planning period – from
January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2021. The RHNA fair share housing needs analysis for the
City of San Marino is provided in Table 20. Household growth during the 2014-2021 planning
period is expected to be 2 households. A base vacancy need and total replacement need of zero was
assigned to San Marino. The City was also not given a vacancy credit. This results in the following
housing needs for the city:
                Table 20: 2014-2021 RHNA Housing Needs by Income Category
                                                              Number of

c.  RHNA Penalty for Fourth Housing Element Update Cycle (July 1, 2008 through October 15, 2013)
AB 1233 amended the State Housing Element law to promote the effective and timely
implementation of local housing elements. If a jurisdiction fails to implement programs in its
Housing Element to identify adequate sites or fails to adopt an adequate Housing Element, this bill
requires local governments to zone or rezone adequate sites by the first year of the new planning
period. The rezoning of sites is intended to address any portion of the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) that was not met because the jurisdiction failed to identify or make available
adequate sites in the previous planning period.
For the fourth cycle update of the Housing Element (July 1, 2008 through October 15, 2013, as
amended by State law), the City of San Marino was allocated a RHNA of 26 units. The RHNA
planning period is slightly different than the Housing Element planning period, covering from
January 1, 2006 through October 15, 2013. Based on the RHNA methodology released by SCAG
on November 2, 2006, the City’s RHNA for the fourth Housing Element update was comprised
primarily (90%) of replacement units. New construction need represented only 7% of the RHNA
and vacancy need another 3%.
                Table 21: 2006-2013 RHNA Housing Needs by Income Category
                                 Income Category                 Number of Units

                     Low Income                                          4

                     Total RHNA Allocation                              26
Housing units constructed during the RHNA planning period can be credited toward the RHNA.
Between 2006 and 2012, 31 housing units were constructed in the City. Given the market
conditions in the city, these units were affordable only to above moderate income households.
                                                      23

In addition, there have been three new second units constructed in the City since 2006. City staff
contacted the property owners. One of the units is occupied by extended family members at a low
rent of $500 per month. The other two units are used as office and guest housing, not as permanent
housing. Therefore at least one second unit can be credited toward the very low income RHNA.
d. Overall RHNA Obligations
Based on the above information, the City has an overall RHNA obligation of 17 units in the lower
and moderate income categories, as shown in Table 22
                   Table 22: Overall RHNA Obligation by Income Categories

C. Conclusions
Three general categories of housing needs are discussed in this section: existing needs, growth needs,
and special needs. Some of the most important findings are:
     Overpayment. It is estimated that 38% of all San Marino households are overpaying for
        housing. Over 39% of lower-income owners are overpaying.
     Overcrowding. About 0.72% of all households in the City are considered to be
        overcrowded.
     Female-Headed Households. Approximately 17.4% of all households are headed by
        females, the majority of which do not include children under 18.
     Growth Needs. San Marino’s overall “fair share” housing need is 17 units in the lower and
        moderate income categories.
                                                  24

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
This section of the Housing Element examines the constraints that could hinder the City’s
achievement of its objectives and the resources that are available to assist in the production,
maintenance and improvement of the City’s housing stock.
A. Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements or actions imposed by the various
levels of government upon land and housing ownership and development. Although federal and
state agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental constraints, these agencies are beyond
the influence of local government and are therefore not addressed in this document.
1. General Plan and Zoning Code
Every city must have a General Plan that establishes policy guidelines for development within the
city. The General Plan is the foundation of land use controls in a jurisdiction. The Land Use
Element identifies the location, distribution and density of land uses in the city. In implementing
the General Plan, the City of San Marino utilizes Zoning Regulations and the Subdivision
Ordinance. General Plan densities are expressed as dwelling units per acre. The San Marino General
Plan provides for three residential land use designations in the City, as shown in Table 23.
                               Table 23: Residential Land Use Categories

    1 Density range expressed in dwelling units per gross acre.
    Source: City of San Marino General Plan.
Hypothetically, a total of 7,767 dwelling units could be accommodated within the corporate City
limits, based on build-out of all residentially designated acreage at the maximum of the density range.
This, however, is not the case in the City. The Census identifies 4,477 dwelling units currently
developed within the City. The amount of housing stock within the City is not expected to increase
beyond the stated maximum build-out of the General Plan.
Density is a critical factor in the development of affordable housing. In theory, maintaining low
densities typically increases the cost of construction per unit while higher density lowers the per unit
land cost and facilitates efficient construction retaining the overall density assignment of the entire
property. However, the City’s vision of the community is a high quality, low density residential
                                                       25

character, which does not lend itself to higher density mechanisms such as zero lot line and clustered
development. There are no residential designations in the City which permit a density of
development that will accommodate certain types of housing that might be affordable to Very Low
and Low income households. In addition, the City is considered built-out, and therefore there are
essentially no vacant parcels that could be re-designated to a higher density, nor are there areas that
are anticipated to be appropriate for recycling to higher density residential uses.
Zoning, which must be consistent with the General Plan, establishes more specific development
standards, allowable uses, and limitations. Zoning regulations control development by establishing
requirements related to height, density, lot area, yard setbacks, and minimum parking spaces. Site
development standards are comparable to other community requirements and ensure a quality living
environment for all household groups in the City. Design standards such as roofing materials,
architectural enhancements, and landscaping also increase the costs of housing. The City's
perspective is that all housing should meet the same fundamental high quality design standards.
The City of San Marino's Zoning Code contains eight residential district classifications within the
Residential R-1 Zone that accommodate a range of densities and lot size requirements from 60,000
square feet to 9,000 square feet per unit, as shown in Table 24.
The Zoning Code permits residential uses in Commercial districts with a Conditional Use Permit
(CUP). There are no specified development standards or criteria for the development of residential
units in a Commercial zone, except for a section that requires a minimum of 5,000 square feet of
land area per family in the C-1 Zone. This requirement is a constraint to the development of
residential uses in the C-1 Zone, but relief from this Code section can be requested through a
variance process.
In response to State mandated requirements and local needs, the City has regulatory mechanisms
allowing for further development of second units. Second dwelling units are permitted on certain
single family residential lots without a CUP. A lot greater than 12,000 square feet is allowed to
construct a second-unit without discretionary approval. Any lot less than 12,000 square feet would
require discretionary review.

2. Parking Requirements
Parking requirements in San Marino are typical for a city of its size and character, as shown in Table
25. The number of parking spaces required for a single-family unit is related to number of
bedrooms. These characteristics do not constrain the development of housing directly, although
greater amount of acreage is required for meeting parking requirements as the number of bedrooms
increase.
For residential uses within a Commercial zone, the parking requirements will be determined by the
Planning Commission, based upon either the requirements for the most comparable use specified in
the Zoning Code, or upon a special study of parking requirements for that use. The City does have
joint use provisions subject to approval of a CUP. The requirements for parking do not directly
constrain the development of housing.
                               Table 25: Residential Parking Requirements

3. Density Bonus Law
In general, this state law provides developers with density bonuses or other incentives in exchange
for the provision of affordable housing which meets certain requirements. San Marino does not
have its own density bonus ordinance and will comply with the provisions of the State Density
Bonus law when or if such a project arises. Given that there is no multi-family housing in San
Marino, the City has not yet received an application for a project that would be subject to these laws.
4. Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
a. Second Units
In response to state mandated requirements and local needs, the City of San Marino allows for the
development of a second dwelling unit. Second units primarily serve to augment resources for senior
housing, guest quarters, and domestic help living quarters, though they may serve the needs of other
segments of the population. Accessory dwelling units are permitted within R1 districts with lots of
12,000 square feet or more (typically within Area Districts IE, I, II, III, IV, and V), without CUP
approval. Prior to 2003, the required lot size was 15,000 square feet. There are approximately 2,143
residential lots in the City that exceed 12,000 square feet. This represents approximately 46% of all
City lots. Cooking facilities are permitted in second units. Conditions in the Zoning Code require:
         The minimum floor area shall not be less than 150 square feet; the maximum floor area of
          the unit shall not exceed 600 square feet, exclusive of garage;
         The lot currently contains an existing single family dwelling;
         The unit may be rented but not sold separately from the primary unit on the lot – a second
          unit shall at all times be held under the same ownership as the remainder of the lot;
         The unit shall conform to the same development standards as that set forth for the zone and
          area district in which the second unit is to be located.
         The unit shall have its own entrance;
         Common walls separating dwelling units shall be properly soundproofed. Details of the
          proposed means of soundproofing shall be submitted with the application;
         The design of the second unit shall be consistent with that of the main building; and
         The unit must be served by its own parking space.
         A second unit may not have separate utility services.
In order to increase the options available to homeowners, the required development standards could
be further modified to make a second unit feasible on a greater number of lots. In addition, the City
could provide financial incentives to property owners who propose to rent the unit out (i.e. not
intending to use it as a no-rent, live-in domestic help residence or as a guesthouse). Incentives could
include a reduction or deferment of processing fees, or priority processing for second unit
applications. The City may consider setting a condition of approval requiring the owner to rent the
unit at costs affordable to lower or moderate income, and/or senior households. There may also be
unpermitted accessory structures that are currently being used as second units. It is unlikely that
these units were counted by the Census and therefore not used in RHNA calculations. San Marino
is a city of single-family homes on relatively large lots. It would be very difficult for an illegal second
                                                      28

unit to be noticeable from public view. The City will explore an amnesty program whereby these
units may be converted to legal second units without penalty.
Overall, the level of interest among property owners is still low. Since 2008, the City of San Marino
has had three second units constructed, one of which is being rented to elderly parents at a rate of
$500 per month. A fourth second unit was recently approved via a reasonable accommodation
permit to house a disabled person. Much more frequently, applications are submitted for “pool
houses” which typically consist of one large room with a full bathroom. This type of structure does
not provide complete, independent living facilities and therefore, does not qualify as a second unit.
Pool houses require a CUP but have less restrictive development standards. Staff has found that
this type of use is preferred by owners over a second unit and may be a reason few second units are
being proposed. Second units can be a maximum of 600 square feet regardless of the lot size or
maximum allowable livable area and lot coverage. Second units also require the same setbacks that
are required for the main house. A pool house has no maximum size and the required rear yard
setback would be equal to the required side yard setback. For example, a pool house in Area
District V would require an eight-foot side and rear yard setback. A second unit on this same lot
would require an eight foot side yard setback and 30 foot rear yard setback. The setback and
maximum size restrictions that apply to second units but not pool houses end up making the pool
house option much more appealing to homeowners. Between 2008 and 2013, 20 pool houses were
approved in the City. Most have already been constructed with just the most recent ones in the plan
check and permitting process. In contrast, during the same time period only three second units have
been built with one recently approved. Changes to the second unit ordinance regarding the
maximum allowable size and required setbacks will help to reconcile the difference in these
numbers. A comprehensive review of previous approvals and existing Code requirements will help
staff determine how to update the Code in a way that encourages the construction of second units
and the conversion of pool houses into second units.
Given the existence of a large number of existing pool houses and lots over 12,000 square feet in the
City, which typically can accommodate a second unit under flexible development standards, there is
potential for this option to produce affordable rental housing opportunities.
b. Manufactured Housing
The City has allowed manufactured, prefabricated and mobile home construction in R-1 zones since
1996. No manufactured housing currently exists in the City. It is subject to the same development
standards as otherwise required for that zone. Certain additional requirements are included in the
City Code:
       Minimum Dimensions: Thirty feet (30') (excluding garage).
       Roof: Pressure treated, fire retardant wood shake or shingle, 300# or heavier composition
        shingle, clay or cement tile, rock, or gravel; shaped, rolled or reflective roofs are prohibited.
       Eaves: Minimum sixteen inch (16") eave protection unless otherwise approved by the
        Commission.
       Exterior Wall Treatment:
            - Permitted Materials: Wood siding, stucco, brick or as approved by the
                 Commission.
            - Color: Natural earth tones, white, with complementary trim color.
                                                    29

             -   Prohibited Materials: No reflective, glossy, polished, roll-formed, stamped,
                 extruded, plastic, PVC or similar type of materials shall be used for roofing or
                 siding.
       Foundation Required: All manufactured homes shall be installed on a foundation system,
        pursuant to section 18551 of the California Health and Safety Code, and no more than ten
        (10) years shall have elapsed between the date of manufacture of the home and the date of
        the application for issuance of a permit to install the manufactured home in the City.
       Design Review: Such manufactured homes shall meet all other requirements of this Code
        and are subject to design review as provided in Section 23.15.03 of this Chapter. (Ord. 096-
        1093, 7-10-1996)
c.  Emergency Shelters
State law (SB2) requires cities to provide at least one zoning category in which emergency shelters
can be located without discretionary approval. At least one site within this zone must be able to
accommodate an emergency shelter. Alternatively, a City may satisfy this requirement by entering
into an agreement with up to two other adjacent local governments to provide a joint facility. The
City currently has not designated a zone for emergency shelters. San Marino essentially has four
zoning categories – R-1 (which includes eight Area Districts within the R-1 designation), C-1, Parks
and Recreation (P&R), and Historic and Cultural Zones (H&C). The P&R and H&C Zones only
contain one parcel each and therefore would not be appropriate zones for the development of
emergency shelters. The C-1 Zone has the potential to support emergency shelter uses and contains
parcels of sufficient size to accommodate the development of new shelters or conversion of existing
space to a shelter. C-1 properties are primarily located along Huntington Drive, the major traffic
route in the City. Public transportation linking the City to surrounding communities (such as
Pasadena) is available along Huntington Drive. Some of the vacant and underutilized C-1 properties
are identified in Table 30.
d. Transitional Housing
The City Code currently prohibits “Transitory Residential Uses” in the R-1 zone. The Code defines
“Transitory Residential Uses” as any residential use where the average tenancy or stay is usually less
than ninety (90) days, including, without limitation, new parolee-probationer homes, safe houses,
residential care facilities not licensed by the state, and other residential uses similarly transitory in
nature.
e. Supportive Housing
According to the California Health and Safety Code, supportive housing means housing with no
limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the homeless or disabled population, and that is linked to
onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing,
improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work
in the community. Currently, the City’s Zoning Code does not address supportive housing.
f.  Residential Care Facility
Licensed residential care facilities are state licensed facilities maintained and operated to provide
non-medical residential care, day treatment, or foster agency services for six or fewer adults,
                                                    30

children, or adults and children. State law requires that these facilities be treated as a single
housekeeping unit for zoning purposes. Licensed residential care facilities are permitted in the R-1
Zone in accordance with state law. The City currently has one residential care facility in the R-1
Zone.
g. SRO Housing
The City of San Marino does not specifically address this use within the zoning code. The C-1
Commercial zone allows residential uses with the issuance of a conditional use permit, but it does
not allow for hotel or motel uses. The Code currently allows one residential unit per 5,000 square
feet of land. Market conditions and the relatively small size of C-1 zoned parcels are the likely
factors as to why higher density housing has not been pursued in the city.
h. Farmworker Housing/Employee Housing
The 2007-2011 ACS identifies zero agricultural employees living within San Marino. There is no
agricultural land in or near San Marino. Therefore, there does not appear to be a need for
farmworker housing. However, the State Health and Safety Code stipulates that housing for six or
fewer employees is considered a single-family residential structure and permitted by right where such
housing is permitted. The City will amend its Zoning Code to comply with State law.
5. Building Codes and Enforcement
A variety of building and safety codes, while adopted for purposes of preserving public health and
safety, and ensuring the construction of safe and decent housing, have the potential to increase the
cost of housing construction or maintenance.
The City of San Marino has adopted the 2010 edition of the California Building, Residential,
Plumbing, Mechanical and Electrical Codes, with amendments, which establish construction
standards as applied to all residential buildings. In January of 2014, the City plans to adopt the 2013
California Codes. The Codes are based on regulations necessary to protect the public health, safety
and welfare. The Building Codes and related amendments do not seem to impede the development
of housing. Many newer requirements such as fire safety systems and green building requirements
had been implemented by residents prior to being required.
Code enforcement is conducted by way of Code Enforcement Officers patrolling the city and
investigating complaints received. The main issue that Code Enforcement addresses is construction
or remodeling without permits. Very rarely are substandard housing conditions or other health and
safety issues identified. The City’s older housing stock is very well maintained.
6. Housing for People with Disabilities
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage
of units in new developments to be fully accessible to the physically disabled. Development of fully
accessible units may also increase the overall project costs. Enforcement of ADA requirements is
not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under federal law. However, the City does not
currently have any multi-family units. The provisions of the ADA would apply only to potential
residential components of a mixed-use project in a Commercial zone.
Compliance with building codes and the ADA may increase the cost of housing production.
However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must be complied with in order to
                                                    31

ensure the development of safe and accessible housing. Therefore, the local enforcement of these
codes does not significantly constrain the development of housing.
The City has seen an increase in projects such as handicapped accessible bathrooms, elevators, and
first floor master suites. These items are treated in the same manner as any other project in terms of
fees, permitting, and processing. Residential Care Facilities are also treated in the same manner as a
single-family home. There is no additional hindrance on the development of housing for the
disabled. No distance requirements have been adopted.
The City has also recently adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance. Under the ADA, cities
must reasonably modify policies when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,
unless they can show that the modifications “would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,
program or activity.” (28 Code of Federal Regulations 35.130(b)(7).) Generally speaking, under
these laws, local agencies retain their ability to regulate land uses and to apply neutral, non-
discriminatory regulations, but are required to make accommodations to allow persons with
disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing in the community. The City’s recent
reasonable accommodation ordinance establishes a process for considering these types of
accommodations. It provides certain findings that must be met in order for an application to be
approved as a reasonable accommodation. This process should make it easier for a resident to
obtain approval for an accommodation, such as a wheelchair ramp or front yard parking space, that
may not otherwise meet the Code requirements. A potential constraint to this process is the one- to
two-month processing time. The City will monitor the implementation of the reasonable
accommodation ordinance to determine its effectiveness.
The City’s Zoning Code defines “family” as “an immediate family related by blood, marriage or
adoption, or a group of individuals who are unrelated and live together as a single housekeeping unit
in a dwelling unit. This shall not include an individual paying rent to a landlord for the purpose of
temporarily residing in a dwelling unit.” This definition is inclusive and does not serve to constrain
housing for persons with disabilities.
7. Development Fees
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and other agencies to cover the cost of
processing development permits and providing local services. These fees help ensure quality
development and the provision of adequate public services. The City is legally required to set permit
and development fees in amounts that are no more than equal the cost of providing services
associated with these fees. The City recently conducted a comprehensive fee study to ensure the cost
of providing the services was consistent with the required fee for those services. San Marino is a
largely developed, suburban jurisdiction with most of its necessary infrastructure such as streets,
electrical, sewer and water facilities in place. Aside from fees collected to offset public school
impacts, required staff training costs, and General Plan maintenance, the City does not require
impact fees to make the necessary land improvements to accommodate development. The City does
not maintain a different fee schedule for single family or multi-family units. The fees charged by the
City are based on a square footage basis or contract price of the job, depending on the type of
permit application. Development fees are not believed to be a constraint to housing development in
the City. In fact, based on informal input from local contractors, San Marino has reasonable permit
fees that are lower than other surrounding cities. Table 26 displays the San Marino Planning
Department Fee Schedule. This is a comprehensive list of fees. The City does not charge any
development impact fees. School fees are required per State law.

To understand what these fees amount to for a development project, Table 27 identifies the
averages of the costs incurred by the nine (9) new single-family houses constructed in 2012. The
average livable area of these nine homes was 4,490 square feet with an average garage size of 821
square feet.

Contrary to new houses, second units are fairly standard in size. Instead of calculating average costs,
a typical one-bedroom second unit of 600 square feet was considered for the fees below.

These appear to be reasonable fees given the large scope of work for projects in San Marino.
Development fees do not seem to impede development in San Marino. The much larger cost
involved in purchasing and developing homes is the high cost of land in San Marino.
8. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The City of San Marino's development approval process is designed to accommodate, not hinder,
development. Other than legally required public hearing notice and environmental review periods,
developers and property owners are not hindered by “down time” in case processing. All new
homes require Design Review Committee approval, which is a public hearing process. This helps
ensure that new homes are compatible with the neighborhood and do not negatively impact the
neighbors. The City has Residential and Commercial Design Guidelines which encourage the use of
certain design features and materials. The Guidelines are not requirements but assist applicants in
designing a project that will move more quickly through the approval process. The Design Review
Committee also holds “open forum” sessions where applicants can get informal, preliminary
feedback on a design, which will also help facilitate the approval process.
The design review process consists of the applicant filing an application, processing fee ($715) and
one set of plans. Staff then reviews the proposal and responds with a letter indicating any code
issues or design concerns that should be addressed. After the applicant addresses the comment
letter, they submit eight sets of plans which are distributed to the Design Review Committee for
their review. The applicant must also present their plans to their neighbors as part of this process.
 The Code dictates that the notified neighbors must include two neighbors on each side of the
subject property; all properties adjoining the rear of the subject property and one on either side of
those properties; and the properties across from the subject property and one on either side of those
properties. This usually comprises about 10-12 neighbors depending on how the lots are arranged.
 This is primarily to make sure neighbors are aware of the proposed project and to give them an
opportunity to ask questions or provide comments. Even if all neighbors approve of or object to
the project, it would still proceed to the Design Review Committee for their review. Once the eight
sets of revised plans are submitted and the neighbor notification process is completed, staff assigns
the project to the next available agenda and notices the project for a public hearing. This process
                                                       35

typically takes about 8 weeks in total. Once the project is approved, the applicant could submit for
building plan check after the 15 day appeal period has expired.
The City has adopted Residential Design Guidelines to guide residents as well as review by the DRC.
The purpose of these design guidelines is to provide a clear concise summary of the City’s design
policies for projects within the City’s residential neighborhoods. The guidelines address
neighborhood compatibility, site development, physical design components, and landscaping.
Certain projects that exceed Code allowances or otherwise require an additional level of review will
require either a Variance or Conditional Use Permit (CUP). These applications are heard by the
Planning Commission. If the project also requires Design Review, the Planning Commission will
review both actions. City staff tries to work with applicants ahead of time to determine the
feasibility of their proposed project. Staff attempts to guide applicants toward a solution that has
the best chances of approval. Depending on the complexity of the project, initial Planning
Department review for new construction requiring Design Review Committee (DRC) or Planning
Commission review averages approximately three to four weeks. Table 29 illustrates the
approximate local processing times for developments in San Marino.

Table 29 identifies the approximate time from submittal to the initial public hearing. Since projects
may require more than one hearing before the Planning Commission or DRC, it is also important to
consider the length of time between submittal and approval or denial. For 2011, City staff reviewed
the total amount of time it took for a project to go from the initial submittal by the applicant to an
approval or denial from the DRC or Planning Commission. Staff found that the average time to
process a variance application was 56 days, the average time to process a CUP application was 61
days, and the average time to process a DRC application was 68 days. These time frames include
the time that the applicant spends correcting or modifying plans at the direction of staff or the
approving body, as well as multiple hearings, if necessary.
Once projects have completed the public hearing process, or once staff determines the project does
not require a hearing, the applicant may submit for building plan check. The City of San Marino
contracts with an outside plan checker for this service. Once the plans are structurally approved,
they are reviewed by both the Planning and Fire Departments. Informal conversations with
architects and contractors indicate that the City processes plans in a reasonable time frame.
                                                   36

It is difficult to significantly reduce these timelines due to a recent increase in construction activity
coupled with the City’s small staff. However, streamlining the development process and making it
more user-friendly is a very important goal of the current City Council. The community has a
perception that it is difficult to improve their property due to the City’s strict guidelines and policies.
It is important to the City to reverse this mind set. As part of an initial effort to do this, the City has
participated in community outreach events so that residents can meet City staff and learn more
about our processes in an informal setting. The City does not feel that the development time line is
a constraint to developing housing, but will continue to try to improve the process for property
owners.
9. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
a. Environmental Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions that provide
the greatest threat to the built environment. The City has identified areas where land development
should be carefully controlled. The following hazards may impact future development of residential
units in the City:
        Seismic Hazards: Like the entire Southern California region, the City of San Marino is
         located within an area of high seismic activity. The Raymond Hill fault passes through the
         City in a northeasterly direction, which subjects the area to surface rupture, ground shaking,
         and ground failure. The greatest potential danger is the collapse of older residential units
         constructed from unreinforced masonry and explosions of petroleum and fuel lines. The
         City regulates the construction of new habitable structures within the identified Proximal
         Fault Study Zone through the requirement of setbacks and construction standards.
        Flooding: No major water courses traverse the City. There is no threat of water damage
         from either a seiche or a tsunami condition.
        Dust and High Wind Hazards: This condition results in property damage from high
         winds, wind tunneling and channeling effects of buildings, soil erosion, and unpleasant living
         conditions. The severe winds San Marino experienced in 2011 have prompted the City and
         homeowners to consider high wind hazards. For example, properly maintained trees are an
         important factor in reducing property damage during wind events.
        Toxic and Hazardous Wastes: In San Marino, air pollution is the main area of concern
         relative to toxic substances. Major point sources of air pollution come from the variety of
         industrial uses throughout the region. The primary source, however, is automobile traffic.
        Fire Hazards: Brush fires have been significantly reduced as a major hazard due to the
         increased development of open land. The critical problem areas in residential buildings
         include structural fires due to aged or faulty electrical wiring, lack of separations in highly
         combustible structures, toxic material contained within buildings, building design, and poor
         maintenance. The City’s 2010 amendments to the California Fire Code address the need for
         fire sprinklers and fire alarms in residential buildings as well as brush clearance for homes in
         the High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
        Noise: Residential land uses are considered the most sensitive to loud noise. Noise is not
         considered a significant problem in the City. The principal noise sources in San Marino
         generate from local traffic.
                                                     37

b. Infrastructure Constraints
San Marino is a fully developed city and therefore, there are very few on or off-site improvements
that are required as part of the development of housing. Most housing construction involves the
demolition of an existing housing unit and the construction of a replacement unit, meaning almost
all infrastructure is already in place. As part of the building permit process, the City will occasionally
require the provision of on-site and off-site improvements necessitated by the development, such as
improvements to curbs and gutters, alleys, streets, sidewalks, street lights, and utility
undergrounding. The cost of such improvements may increase the cost of development, which
would ultimately be passed through to future tenants or owners. While these costs may not render a
project infeasible, they contribute to the range of factors that affect the affordability of a project.
Since the City is built-out, the only additional development would come from the subdivision of
existing, larger properties. Chapter 22 of the San Marino City Code identifies the following
minimum street widths for streets created as part of a subdivision:
     1. The width of all primary streets shall be one hundred feet (100'), and the width of all
         secondary streets shall be eighty feet (80'); except, that a primary street divided into two (2)
         drives by a parkway or railway shall have a width of sixty feet (60') on each side thereof, and
         secondary streets so divided shall have a width of forty five feet (45') on each side thereof.
     2. All local streets shall be at least sixty feet (60') in width; provided, that dead-end streets may
         be fifty feet (50') in width.
     3. All dead-end streets shall have a turning circle with a diameter of not less than eighty four
         feet (84').
     4. Alleys shall be provided at the rear of all lots zoned as business property and shall have a
         width of not less than twenty feet (20').
     5. Dead-end alleys shall have a turning circle with a diameter of not less than forty feet (40').
This chapter also requires sidewalks on all primary and secondary streets. Whether or not a sidewalk
is required on local streets is dependent on the amount of pedestrian traffic and is at the discretion
of the Council.
Compliance with Title 24 of the California Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient
appliances and insulation has reduced energy demand stemming from new residential development.
Southern California Edison also offers public information and technical assistance to developers and
homeowners regarding energy conservation measures and programs. The City has seen an increased
interest in permits for solar panels, electric car chargers, and other energy efficient home
improvements.
The California America Water Company provides water services for the City of San Marino.
Adequate water is available to serve existing and projected residences through 2021 (17 additional
units, according to the City’s Regional Housing Needs obligations). The Los Angeles County
Sanitation District provides sewer services for the City of San Marino. The entire City is currently
only utilizing about 25 to 30 percent of its sewer capacity. Adequate remaining capacity
(approximately 70 percent) is available to the projected residences through 2021 (17 additional units
per the City’s obligations under the Regional Housing Needs Allocation).
                                                      38

B. Non-Governmental Constraints
1. Vacant Land
The City's vacant land supply is extremely small. There six (6) vacant residential lots remaining in
the City and one (1) vacant commercial lot. The City has an established pattern and character of
development of high design standards and low densities. It is the established policy of the City to
maintain this community character for all new development. Based on this principle, and given the
limited amount of non-contiguous vacant land in the City, there is little potential to develop new
affordable housing units on vacant land within current City limits. It is likely that these lots will be
developed with market rate single family homes that will increase the City’s housing supply. Owners
of two of these lots have already applied for new construction.
2. Land Costs
The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. In turn, land prices are determined by a
number of factors, most important of which are land availability and allowable development density.
As land becomes scarcer, the price for land increases. In terms of development density (see
discussion of the City of San Marino's zoning regulations), land prices are positively related to the
number of units permitted on each lot. Relative to surrounding jurisdictions, as well as the region,
land prices in San Marino significantly constrain the production of housing.
3. Construction Costs
The cost of construction depends primarily on the cost of materials and labor, but it is also
influenced by market demand and market-based changes in the cost of materials. The cost of
construction depends on the type of unit being built and on the quality of the product being
produced. Labor saving materials and construction techniques are available but they tend to reduce
the quality of the finished product.
The type of product largely determines the cost of construction. The cost of labor is based on a
number of factors, including housing demand, the number of contractors in an area and the
unionization of workers, but it is generally two to three times the cost of materials. Thus the cost of
labor represents an estimated 17% to 20% of the cost of building a unit, which is a substantial
portion of the overall cost of construction. Most residential construction in Southern California is
performed with non-union contractors, and as a result, labor costs are responsive to changes in the
residential market. Recent figures published by the International Code Council (ICC) report that a
typical wood frame residence costs approximately $107.08 per square foot for labor and materials,
not inclusive of land. Construction costs in the City of San Marino would exceed this figure based
on the high quality of living and design standards embraced by the community. Construction costs
for San Marino are closer to $250-$300 per square foot. The construction cost of housing affects
the affordability of new housing and may be considered a constraint to affordable housing in the San
Marino area that is outside of the City’s control.
4.   Financing
Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is little that
local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-
downs to extend home purchase opportunities to lower income households. In addition,
government insured loan programs may be available to reduce mortgage down payment
requirements.
                                                   39

First time homebuyers are the group impacted the most by financing requirements. Mortgage
interest rates for new home purchases ranged from 3% to 4% for a fixed rate 30-year loan in 2013.
Lower initial rates are available with other mortgage types. However, variable interest rate
mortgages on affordable homes may increase to the point of interest rates exceeding the cost of
living adjustments, which is a constraint on the affordability. Although rates are currently low, they
can change significantly and substantially impact the affordability of the housing stock.
Interest rates at the present time are not a constraint to affordable housing. Financing for both
construction and long term mortgages is generally available in San Marino subject to normal
underwriting standards. However, a more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the
affordability of the housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment
requirements. Typically, conventional home loans will require 5% to 20% of the sale price as a
down payment, which is the largest constraint to first time homebuyers. This indicates a need for
flexible loan programs and a method to bridge the gap between the down payment required and a
potential homeowner's available funds. Recently, there has been an influx of all cash offers for
homes in San Marino. This makes it more difficult for first time home buyers with minimal down
payments to compete for a home. The availability of financing for developers under current
economic conditions may also pose a constraint on development outside of the City's control.
                                                  40
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES
This section examines the opportunities and resources that are available to assist in the production,
maintenance and improvement of the City’s housing stock.
A. Residential Sites Inventory
State law requires that a city must identify adequate sites for development of a variety of housing
types for all income levels. The Growth Needs section identified San Marino’s RHNA figure. As a
way to plan for the additional units, an analysis of the various available housing resources must be
conducted. Land availability in San Marino is scarce. Opportunities for residential development in
the City fall into one of four categories:
        Vacant land that is either designated for residential use or is likely to be designated for
         residential use in the future;
        Residentially designated land with lot sizes exceeding 12,000 square feet which can
         accommodate second units;
        Underutilized non-residential sites where infrastructure needs for recycling to residential
         development can be met by existing or proposed systems; and
        Mixed use or stand-alone residential development on non-residentially designated sites.
Table 30 identifies the vacant and potentially developable sites in the City.
1. Vacant Sites
There are six parcels of currently vacant residential land in the City that are designated for single-
family units. The new single-family units constructed would likely only be affordable to the above-
moderate income group. There is one parcel of vacant commercially zoned land. As mentioned
previously, the Zoning Code allows for residential uses in the C-1 Zone but does not establish any
standards or densities for residential uses in the commercial zone, except to require 5,000 square feet
per residential unit in the C-1 Zone. Even with this requirement, it is possible that the commercial
lot could still be developed with up to two units as part of a mixed-use project which may be
accessible to a wider range of income groups.
It is possible that a complete build-out of the residentially designated vacant land within the City by
the end of the 2013 to 2021 planning period may be realized. Although the development of mixed-
use projects with a residential component on commercially zoned property is provided for through
provisions in the Zoning Code, pursuit of mixed-use projects with a residential component may not
be easily realized. In General, the C-1 zoned lots are relatively small in size and lack sufficient
parking. However, in recent months, staff has been approached by two separate parties who
expressed interest in pursuing a mixed use development. While these may not result in a significant
number of units, it would at least provide an additional housing type choice in San Marino. It is also
possible for single family homes to be developed in the C-1 Zone provided they have a minimum lot
size of 5,000 square feet. There is also the option of people further developing their single-family
lots with a second unit in accordance with the City’s second unit ordinance. Likewise, a commercial
property owner maintains the option to apply for a CUP to add or convert a portion of the building
into a residential use.
                                                    41

2. Potentially Developable Sites
In examining potentially developable sites, larger and/or underutilized commercial properties were
considered. Mixed use projects do not currently exist in the City and based on community input,
they are not a compatible use with the existing character of the community. However, the City’s
current code allows one residential unit per 5,000 square feet of land in the C-1 Zone, resulting in a
density of approximately 8.7 units per acre.                  Table 30 identifies how many units could be
accommodated on each lot under the current requirements. Even if a portion of the potential units
were realized, it would provide San Marino with additional housing choices for a wider range of
income levels.
The potentially developable sites were selected for their size and ongoing vacancy issues. Very few
commercial parcels in the City have ample off-street parking. Of those that do, some tend to have
businesses that do not need that much parking, resulting in a lot of underutilized space. Three of
the four selected sites fell into this category3. The remaining site at 2995 Huntington sits at a very
busy intersection and has been vacant for about six months. The existing building is designed as an
oil change facility. Another benefit to this site is that it is surrounded by non-residential uses,
making higher density development more feasible.

  Since the time the data for Table 30 were collected, sites 9 and 11 no longer have vacancy problems as indicated in
  the table.

                                                                         43
3. Affordability Assumptions
Of the six (6) vacant residential lots, there is the potential to develop six main residential dwellings
and two (2) second units. The six main units would only be affordable to the above moderate
income category. The second units have the potential to serve lower income households. However,
as with all second units, this is dependent on how the owner utilizes the space.
As stated previously, the City has very limited information in the Code relating to development
standards for residential units in the Commercial Zone. Table 30 identifies the currently allowable
number of units.
4. Infrastructure Availability
All of the vacant and potentially developable sites would be infill development. All necessary
infrastructure is either already in place or readily available. This includes all utilities such as
electricity, gas, water, sewer, telephone, and cable/data services. Also included are physical
improvements such as roads and sidewalks. San Marino is a full service city with its own Fire,
Police, Recreation, Public Works, Library, Planning, Building and Administrative Services. The San
Marino Unified School District services the entire City.
5. Environmental Constraints
There are no apparent environmental constraints that would impede the development of these units.
B. Financial Resources for Housing
Development of affordable housing in San Marino is extremely limited, except in the case of second
units. This is due to the built out nature of the City coupled with very high land costs. San Marino
does not currently offer any financial resources for the development of affordable housing. Limited
Community Development Block Grant funds are available for the repair and maintenance of
housing for lower and moderate income households.
C. Administrative Resources
a. City of San Marino Planning and Building Department
The City’s Planning and Building Department provides the front line resource for the development
of new housing. The Planning Department provides Zoning Code reviews and updates. The
Planning Department also administers the Planning Commission and Design Review Committee
processes and meetings. The Building Department handles plan check and permitting issues in
association with plan check consultant.
b. Los Angeles County Community Development Commission
The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC) handles the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). As mentioned above this provides funding for lower
and moderate income households to improve and maintain their homes.
                                                    44

D. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is an important consideration in the development of housing. Despite
increased up front construction costs, energy efficient homes have long term benefits of decreased
utility costs and decreased consumption of energy. State Building Codes mandate certain levels of
energy efficiency for construction projects. In addition to this, the City of San Marino recently
developed an Energy Action Plan to chart a path for energy efficiency in the community. The
following resources have been identified for homeowners or developers to utilize:
        Energy Upgrade California – Homeowners in Los Angeles County are eligible for energy
         efficiency rebates up to $4,500 by completing a comprehensive energy upgrade on their
         house which may include things such as attic insulation, duct sealing or a more efficient
         HVAC system. Homeowners work with Home Energy Professionals identified by the
         program and are eligible for special financing options. Low and Moderate income
         households may qualify for financial assistance through the Energy Savings Assistance
         Program which works with the local energy provider or through the Weatherization
         Assistance Program and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which are
         federally-funded programs administered by the California Department of Community
         Services & Development. The Energy Savings Assistance Program, Weatherization
         Assistance Program and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program are available
         independent of the Energy Upgrade California program and provide no-cost energy
         upgrades for income-qualified residents to help increase the energy efficiency of their homes.
        Southern California Edison (SCE) Rebate Programs – SCE offers a multitude of rebate programs
         to assist homeowners. These include, among other things, rebates for energy efficient
         appliances, installation of solar panels, and reducing power consumption.

REVIEW OF HOUSING ELEMENT PERFORMANCE
A. Progress in Implementing the 2008 Goals and Objectives
State housing law requires communities to assess the achievements under past housing programs as
part of the update to their housing elements. These results should be quantified wherever possible,
but may be qualitative where necessary. In addition, these results need to be compared with what
was projected or planned in the earlier element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was
planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such differences should be discussed. The results of
the analysis should provide the basis for developing the comprehensive housing program strategy or
the future planning period. Table 31 illustrates the City’s progress in implementing the 2008
Housing Element programs.
The City’s 2008 Housing Element established a housing production objective of 26 new housing
units. Table 32 identifies the quantified objectives for the 2008-2014 Housing Element period by
income classification. The chart identifies the construction of 31 new homes. The City made
progress in meeting its new construction objectives, although the executive level character of the
City is evident in the achievement of goals by income classification. Although 31 units were
constructed, the shortfall occurred in the lower and moderate income categories, as no new units
were constructed, and subsequently, the objectives were not met. The City’s goal is to rehabilitate
two homes per year with CDBG money. Specific income level goals are not assigned.
Table 31 and Table 32 are found on the following pages.

Analysis of housing trends and population growth in the City during this period indicate that there is
limited possibility for the construction of enough housing to accommodate needs, particularly within
the moderate and lower income groups. First, the RHNA methodology did not differentiate
between primarily built out cities like San Marino with substantial investment in existing housing
resources, and newer communities that can accommodate substantial additional growth through
absorption of vacant land. The City has extremely limited resources in terms of vacant residential
land, and no vacant land designated at densities appropriate for construction of housing affordable
to lower and moderate income households. Although the Code allows for it, mixed use projects
have never been pursued by a developer. In terms of second units, there have only been three
applications submitted to the City during this period.
The stringent development standards and lot size minimums have been established for second units
in order to guard against “mansionization” (where homes are expanded to the point where they are
significantly larger and more lot intensive than surrounding homes). Although second units may
serve as an affordable rental resource, they are primarily utilized by residents in the City to provide
living accommodations for relatives or domestic employees. Recent years have demonstrated a
strengthening economy yet second unit production has not increased. It appears that this is not a
desirable option for many homeowners who instead choose to construct larger homes that are
intended to house multiple generations. The Chinese community has previously indicated that
multi-generational households could be accommodated in existing homes and this continues to be
the trend.
During this planning period, the City has adopted a Reasonable Accommodation ordinance and has
already approved two such requests under the new ordinance. Other accomplishments include
strengthening the Code Enforcement program through additional staff resources and the
continuation of seismic retrofitting of homes. The City also continues to rehabilitate homes through
the CDBG program and provide necessary repairs to the homes of low and moderate income
residents.

GOALS,          POLICIES,               PROGRAMS                 AND          QUANTIFIED
OBJECTIVES
A.     Goals, Policies and Objectives
The City of San Marino, in adopting the Housing Element, adopts the goals that follow as the
framework for implementing its housing policies and programs over the timeframe of the Element.
A housing survey will be performed to evaluate legalizing existing second units.
  GOAL 1: Provide a range of housing opportunities for all income levels.
POLICIES:
Policy 1.1    Encourage the development of housing on vacant R-1 land to meet market-rate
              housing demand.
Policy 1.2:   Continue to encourage the development of second units as a housing resource.
Policy 1.3:   Encourage the construction of attached second units to house multi-generational
              families, and as a source of affordable housing for extremely low and lower income
              households and persons with disabilities (including those with developmental
              disabilities).
Policy 1.4    Continue to allow residential uses in the C-1 zone as a conditionally permitted use.
Policy 1.5:   Allow for development of housing for lower income households and seniors in the
              City through provision of density bonus as required by State law.
IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS:
Program 1.1: Fast track all second unit applications through the permitting process.
              Timeline: Ongoing
Program 1.2: Facilitate second unit construction by revising the Second Unit Ordinance so that
              the development standards are more similar to those for a “pool house”, or
              accessory structure containing livable area. Specifically, undertake a comprehensive
              review of the City Code and identify barriers to the construction of second units and
              how they can be eliminated. Specific considerations include:
              a. Setbacks – Consider changing the required setbacks for second units so that they
                  are similar to those required for a pool house, or other accessory structure with
                  livable area. The current Code requires a second unit to have the same setbacks
                  as a main house, whereas a pool house allows for a much less restrictive rear yard
                  setback.
              b. Maximum allowable size - Consider increasing the maximum allowable size of a
                  second unit in relation to the lot size. Currently, the maximum allowable size for
                                                 51

                 a second unit is 600 square feet for all lots. A second unit size of 800-1,200
                 square feet may be more appropriate for larger lots.
             c. Parking – The Code currently requires a dedicated, enclosed parking space for a
                 second unit. Consider allowing an open parking space or pad that is not visible
                 from public view as an alternative.
             d. Definitions – Consider amending the Code definition for “kitchen” so that the
                 requirements for cooking devices in a second unit may be met by portable
                 cooking devices.
             Other possible actions to increase second unit construction include:
                  Amend the Zoning Code to allow the conversion of pool houses into second
                      units.
                  Waive permit fees for both new construction of second units and conversion
                      of existing accessory structures (legal or illegal) into second units. This
                      provision shall be valid for three years from the date of adoption of the
                      revised second unit ordinance.
                  Allow conversion of unpermitted, existing, accessory structures into second
                      units without penalty, provided that all other applicable Code requirements
                      are met. This provision shall be valid for three years from the date of
                      adoption of the revised second unit ordinance.
                  Contact property owners to educate them about second units and encourage
                      conversion of their pool house or illegal second unit into a legal second unit.
             Annually monitor the effectiveness of the City’s strategy for facilitating second unit
             construction and pool house conversion. If the City is not meeting its objectives,
             evaluate factors that may enhance the program effectiveness or develop alternative
             strategies, within one year, as appropriate in order to accommodate the City’s RHNA
             obligations. These policies shall consider appropriate time frames and reporting
             requirements to consider how units are being used.
             Timeline: Revise Second Unit Ordinance in 2014 and monitor effectiveness annually
Program 1.3: Distribute information on second units and the required development standards with
             the goal of achieving two second units annually for a total of 16 second units over
             the eight-year planning period, through new construction and conversion from pool
             houses. Information on second units will be posted on the City website, available at
             public counters, and published at least once a year in the City newsletter.
             Timeline: 2014 or after Program 1.2 is implemented
Program 1.4 Three years from the date of adoption of the Housing Element, evaluate the City
             Code as it relates to residential development in the C-1 Zone. Assess possible
             barriers to this type of development and re-evaluate the City’s policies as necessary.

             ensure the continued maintenance and good appearance of the City’s residential
             structures and neighborhoods.
             Timeline: Ongoing
Program 2.3: Continue to implement the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
             program that offers assistance to income-qualified households for home repairs.
             Target limited resources to extremely low income households and persons with
             disabilities (including developmental disabilities). Annually pursue other State and
             Federal programs that offer funding and other incentives for housing rehabilitation,
             energy efficiency improvements, and affordable housing development. In 2014,
             update the City’s website to provide information on assistance available for home
             repairs for income-qualified households.
             Timeline: Ongoing
