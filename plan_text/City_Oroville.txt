1 INTRODUCTION
  Oroville’s 2030 General Plan provides direction on how Oroville will fulfill its
  community vision and manage its future growth. This chapter provides an intro-
  duction to the City of Oroville and an overview of the contents of the 2030 Gen-
  eral Plan.
  A. Purpose of this General Plan
  The General Plan provides the fundamental basis for the City’s land use, develop-
  ment and conservation policy, and represents the basic community values, ideals
  and aspirations that will govern the City through 2030. This General Plan address-
  es all aspects of development, including land use; community character; economic
  development; circulation and transportation; open space, natural resources and
  conservation; public facilities and services; safety; and noise.
  California Government Code Section 65300 requires the General Plan to be com-
  prehensive and internally consistent, and to provide long-term guidance for the
  community. Although the General Plan is required to address the issues specified
  by State law, it may be organized in a way that best suits the City of Oroville.
  The overall role of the Oroville 2030 General Plan is to:
    ♦ Define a realistic vision of what the City desires to become in 25 years.
    ♦ Express the policy direction of the City of Oroville in regard to the physical,
       social, economic, cultural and environmental character of the city.
    ♦ Serve as a comprehensive guide for making decisions about land use, commu-
       nity character, economic development, circulation, open space, the environ-
       ment, and public health and safety.
    ♦ Serve as the City’s “constitution” for land use and community development.
       According to State law, the General Plan accomplishes this by providing the
       legal foundation for all zoning, subdivision and public facilities ordinances, de-
       cisions and projects, all of which must be consistent with the General Plan.
    ♦ Provide clear and easy-to-understand guidance that encourages public in-
       volvement and understanding.
  This 2030 General Plan document supersedes the previous General Plan, adopted
  in 1995, and coordinates with the Housing Element adopted in 2009. The General
                                                                                      I-1

Plan’s implementation will include actions to update other planning documents to
ensure consistency with the vision outlined in the Oroville 2030 General Plan.
B. Regional Location
The City of Oroville is one of five incorporated municipalities in Butte County and
is the county seat. The City’s incorporated area consists of a 13-square-mile area
located 65 miles north of Sacramento, where the Sacramento Valley meets the Sier-
ra Nevada foothills. 1 Oroville lies 5 miles west of Highway 99 along Highway 70, a
primary transportation route connecting Oroville with Sacramento to the south and
Plumas County to the north. Oroville’s geographic location is shown in Figure I-1.
C. The City and its Planning Area
The jurisdictional boundaries most relevant to comprehensive planning in Oroville
are the city limits, the Sphere of Influence (SOI), and the Planning Area. These
boundaries are depicted in Figure I-2. The approximately 13-square-mile area with-
in Oroville’s incorporated city limits covers an irregular shape. The city limits in-
clude the Oroville Municipal Airport but do not include Thermalito, an unincorpo-
rated area of land under County jurisdiction.
In addition to analyzing land within the incorporated city limits, the State of Cali-
fornia encourages cities to look beyond their current borders when undertaking the
comprehensive planning required of a General Plan. For this reason, Oroville’s
General Plan addresses two additional areas that are larger than the city limits, spe-
cifically the Sphere of Influence (SOI) and the Planning Area.
The SOI is considered to be the ultimate service area of the City and the area that
the City anticipates it will annex at some point in the future. The City of Oroville
can propose the area that it would like its SOI to include. However, the SOI is
ultimately defined by the Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO). Establishment of this boundary is necessary to determine which gov-
ernmental agencies can provide services in the most efficient way to the people and

property in the area. 2 The SOI is a 50-square-mile area, which includes two of the
three State Water Project (SWP) Thermalito bays, the Oroville’s Wildlife Refuge
and Thermalito to the west; South Oroville to Kelly Ridge to the east and north-
east; and the Las Plumas area and Palermo to the south. All of these unincorpo-
rated areas are developed to some extent. 3
The second additional area addressed in the General Plan is the Planning Area, an
84-square-mile area. It encompasses a significantly larger portion of land to the
west of the City, including, the SWP Thermalito Afterbay and a primarily undevel-
oped area between Highway 99 and Cottonwood Road. Both the City of Oroville’s
city limits and SOI are contained within the Planning Area boundary. While the
Planning Area does not give the City any regulatory power, it signals to the County
and to other nearby local and regional authorities that Oroville recognizes that de-
velopment within this area has an impact on the future of the City.
D. Oroville Today
Oroville is primarily a single-family residential community with an historic down-
town district and a main commercial corridor along Oroville Dam Boulevard. As
of 2014, the city has approximately 15,980 residents. 4 As a charter city, Oroville
operates largely in accordance with its own City Charter, compared to general law
cities, which are governed according to State statutes.
The City’s southern and western areas are primarily flat river basin lands that rise
into the Sierra Nevada foothills in the northeast. The eastern portion of the City is
located in an urban-wildland interface that begins the Sierra Nevada foothills. De-
velopment in this eastern area occurs in and around tracts of oak woodlands and
chaparral.

Known as the “City of Gold,” the history of Oroville began along the Feather Riv-
er before the Gold Rush of 1848. The discovery of gold at Bidwell Bar, located
just east of where the City sits today, led to the creation of one of the first gold-
mining sites in California. Now situated under Lake Oroville, Bidwell Bar brought
thousands of prospectors to the Oroville area seeking gold. Many of Oroville’s
historic homes and mansions are remnants from early settlers of this time who
made their fortunes from the Gold Rush. 5
Today, Oroville is most famous for being the site of the Oroville Dam and is the
starting point for the State Water Project (SWP), which stores and delivers water to
over two-thirds of California’s population. 6 From the Oroville Dam’s spillway, the
Feather River provides an open space corridor through the center of the city. The
Feather River winds its way through the Feather River Canyon, past Oroville’s his-
toric downtown, and out to the Oroville State Wildlife Area, an 11,400-acre wildlife
area on the southwestern edge of Oroville. 7 Along with Lake Oroville, the city is
bordered to the west by several other large bodies of water, which are part of the
SWP and make up the Lake Oroville State Recreation Area.
Oroville is beginning to see pressures for growth, as the housing markets in both
Chico to the north and Sacramento to the south become more constrained. From
1990 to 2000, Oroville’s population increased by 8.7 percent, from 11,960 to
13,004 residents, and the City saw a 12.2 percent increase in housing units, from
4,831 to 5,419. This trend continued from 2000 to 2014, during which time
Oroville’s population increased by approximately 23 percent from 13,004 to 15,980
residents. 8 This growth in population is a result of annexation and the comparative
affordability of single-family housing in Oroville compared to the larger region. 9
Over the next 25 years, Oroville is likely to see this trend continue, with significant
residential and employment expansion.

This General Plan is designed to address the issues that face Oroville as pressures
for growth and change increase. It encourages new employment opportunities to
allow residents to live, work, play, and shop within the community. It allows a
range of housing types to provide housing to meet everyone’s needs, while protect-
ing the open space lands that contribute to Oroville’s character, history and eco-
nomic success.
E. General Plan Update Process
The process for the comprehensive update of the General Plan began in August of
2005 and was completed, with the adoption of the General Plan by the City Coun-
cil, in 2008. Following this comprehensive update, in 2013, the City conducted a
targeted update to refine the land use map, add a new Economic Development
Element, support the City’s sustainability goals, and meet updated State laws. The
targeted update was adopted by the City Council in 2015.
The General Plan was developed with extensive community input and involvement
and reflects the community’s vision for the City of Oroville. The following de-
scribes the public process to update the General Plan.
1. Public Outreach and Involvement
The comprehensive General Plan Update process was overseen by a Steering
Committee of nine Oroville citizens. The Steering Committee represented the
diverse Oroville community throughout the Update process, acting as a “sounding
board” for ideas from community members, City staff and consultants. The Steer-
ing Committee also reviewed working drafts of documents and recommended a
preliminary General Plan to the City Council. To develop the Plan, there were a
total of 23 Steering Committee meetings, all of which were open to the public.
In addition to the Steering Committee meetings, the City held two community
workshops in July 2006. At the workshops, the City and its consultants worked
with community participants to develop the future vision for Oroville and identify
issues that needed to be addressed in the General Plan. To ensure that people
from all parts of Oroville could participate, one workshop was held in Thermalito,
and another was held in South Oroville. The City conducted extensive outreach
for both public workshops and all outreach materials were distributed in English,
Spanish and Hmong. There were also Spanish and Hmong translators present at
all the workshops.

During the targeted update, in September 2013, the City held a community meeting
to introduce the targeted update project and obtain community input on changes to
the General Plan land use map.
The workshops were advertised in the Oroville Mercury-Register, as well as
through public service announcements on local radio stations. A flier advertising
the workshop was included in a utility bill mailing, posted in businesses throughout
the City and sent to representatives of numerous community organizations.
In addition, Steering Committee members and City staff spoke to several commu-
nity groups and encouraged each group’s members to participate in the workshops.
Funding for the public outreach and workshops was provided in part by a Caltrans
Community Based Transportation Planning (CBTP) grant.
2. Public Review Period and Adoption
As required by State law, the General Plan was circulated for a 45-day review peri-
od along with its Environmental Impact Report (EIR) during the months of April
and May 2008. During this time, the public was allowed to submit additional
comments, which were taken into consideration at subsequent public hearings. As
part of this 45-day review period, a Planning Commission hearing was held on
April 28, 2009 to take public comments on the Draft Plan and EIR.
On June 2, 2009, another Planning Commission public hearing was held where the
Planning Commission passed a recommendation that the City Council certify the
Final EIR and adopt the Final General Plan. The City Council then adopted the
General Plan at a public hearing held on June 2, 2009.
The draft targeted updates to the General Plan and the associated Supplemental
EIR were circulated for a 45-day review period in early 2015. Similar to the com-
prehensive update, the public provided comments during this time, and they were
considered at the subsequent public hearings.
F. General Plan Contents
This General Plan includes this introduction, the Guiding Principles and eight sepa-
rate “elements” that set goals, policies and actions for each given area. These ele-
ments cover the seven topics required by California State Government Code Sec-
tion 65302. As previously mentioned, the Housing Element, one of the required
elements, was adopted under a separate process and is available as a separate doc-
                                                                                     I-9

ument. A brief explanation of the topics included in the Oroville General Plan is
provided here.
1. State Required Elements
Land Use Element. The Land Use Element designates all lands within the City
for specific uses such as housing, commercial, industrial, open space and recrea-
tional, public facilities and agricultural uses. The Land Use Element also provides
development regulations for each land use category and overall land use policies for
the City.
Transportation and Circulation Element. The Transportation and Circulation
Element specifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
streets and other transportation facilities. The Element must correlate with the
Land Use Element to ensure that adequate pedestrian, bicycle, motor vehicle and
emergency access is provided to serve both new and existing land uses.
Open Space, Natural Resources and Conservation Element. This Element
combines two elements required under State law: the Open Space Element and the
Conservation Element. It addresses the six State-categorized types of open space:
open space for the preservation of natural resources, open space used for the man-
aged production of resources, open space for outdoor recreation, open space for
public health and safety, open space in support of the mission of military installa-
tions and open space for the protection of Native American sacred sites. This El-
ement also addresses biological resources, water quality, mineral resources, agricul-
tural resources, cultural resources, air quality (including climate change), and energy
conservation.
Safety Element. The Safety Element is intended to protect the community from
risks associated with the effects of seismic and other geologic hazards, flooding and
dam inundation, and hazardous materials, and to ensure adequate emergency pre-
paredness. The Safety Element includes goals, objectives, policies and actions to
address current and foreseeable safety issues.
Noise Element. The Noise Element addresses noise problems in the community
and analyzes and quantifies current and projected noise levels from a variety of
sources. The Noise Element includes goals, objectives, policies and actions to ad-
dress current and foreseeable noise problems.
Housing Element. As previously stated, the City’s Housing Element was adopt-
ed in 2009 pursuant to State law. Government Code Section 65588 requires the

Housing Element be updated every five years and include specific components
such as analysis of existing housing stock, analysis of existing and projected hous-
ing needs, and quantification of the number of housing units that will be devel-
oped, preserved and improved through its policies and actions. The Housing Ele-
ment is available as a separate document.
2. Optional Elements
Community Design Element. This optional Element discusses urban design
principles that are intended to guide both public and private development and pro-
tect and enhance the positive characteristics of Oroville’s built environment, in-
cluding characteristics that contribute to its sense of place and contribute to a high
quality of life for its residents.
Economic Development Element. This optional Element describes the baseline
economic conditions in Oroville, reviews the extensive set of economic develop-
ment programs and initiatives already underway in the city, and establishes goals,
policies, and actions to guide a long-term vision for Oroville’s economy.
Public Facilities and Services. This optional Element assesses the current state
of public services and facilities within the City, including law enforcement, fire ser-
vices, schools, libraries, government facilities, water, wastewater, stormwater drain-
age, solid waste and utilities. Goals and policies in this Element focus on ensuring
minimum service levels within Oroville.
G. Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each element of this General Plan contains background information and a series of
goals, policies and actions. Some elements also have additional sections that are
specific to those elements. For example, the goals, policies and actions in the Land
Use Element are based on the principles of livability and smart growth. They were
developed through an extensive public involvement process and are written to pre-
serve and enhance the unique characteristics of Oroville and will guide overall de-
velopment in the City.
Figure I-3 illustrates that policies and actions are at the same level of importance,
and are both intended to implement goals. In most cases, goals have both imple-
menting policies and actions. However, it is also possible for a goal to be imple-
mented exclusively through either policies or actions. The following provides a
                                                                                      I-11

description of goals, policies and actions and explains the relationship between
them:
   ♦ A goal is a description of the general desired result that the City seeks to cre-
      ate through the implementation of its General Plan.
   ♦ A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making as the City works
      to achieve a goal. Such policies, once adopted, represent statements of City
      regulation and require no further implementation. The General Plan’s policies
      set out the standards that will be used by City staff, the Planning Commission
      and City Council in their review of land development projects and in decision-
      making about City actions.
   ♦ An action is a program, implementation measure, procedure or technique in-
      tended to help to achieve a specified goal. The City must take additional steps
      to implement each action in the General Plan.
These goals, policies and actions provide guidance to the City on how to direct
change and manage its resources over the next 15 years.

2 VISION STATEMENT AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
  The Vision Statement is a description of what Oroville wants to become through the implementa-
  tion of the 2030 General Plan. The Guiding Principles provides a sense of the purpose and mis-
  sion for the 2030 General Plan and sets the tone for the Plan’s goals, policies and actions.
  A. Vision Statement
  Oroville will be a thriving, full-service community where residents enjoy a high
  quality of life and can find well-paying jobs. Oroville’s residents will have a choice
  of housing to best suit their individual lifestyles. Safe, beautiful neighborhood and
  community parks will be scattered throughout the city and pedestrian and bicycle
  trails will provide access to the Feather River and the open spaces surrounding
  Oroville.
  Businesses with local, regional, national and international markets in a variety of
  sectors will be located in Oroville. Tourists and residents alike will be drawn to the
  attractive historic downtown, which will be home to local businesses as well as
  mixed-use buildings housing stores, offices, and apartments. Oroville Dam Boule-
  vard, Olive Highway, Ophir Road and Grand Avenue will be vibrant mixed-use
  corridors, allowing more people to live close to their jobs and other services that
  will be available along these roadways. The Airport Business Park will be a nexus
  of innovative light industrial and manufacturing uses, filling the need for 21st-
  century jobs in Butte County. Regional serving retail destinations, thoughtfully
  designed and landscaped, will be located at appropriate intersections along High-
  way 70. Many new homes, jobs and services will be developed under a Specific
  Plan, maximizing cohesive design and infrastructure efficiency.
  New residential growth, whatever the size or location, will be carefully regulated by
  the City and will be required to meet high standards for quality, appearance and
  integration with existing neighborhoods. Much of the new growth in the City will
  occur as infill development sensitively designed to enhance the community’s char-
  acter. Single professionals, young families, and retirees will be able to choose
  among large homes, smaller homes, townhouses and apartments as their needs
  change. New homes will be affordable for existing residents and people who work
  in Oroville. Schools and parks will be incorporated into new neighborhoods so
  that students and neighbors can walk to these important centers of community life.
  Oroville will take advantage of its unique natural setting by offering residents and

ture development within the city. Those neighborhoods at the urban fringe will be
carefully designed to create an appropriate transition from the urban environment
of Oroville to the rural environment of the surrounding area. Homes in the foot-
hills will be situated on larger lots so that foothill landscapes and woodlands can be
preserved. Kelly Ridge will retain its distinct character as a comfortable suburban
community with well-maintained homes and a strong focus on outdoor recreation.
Oroville’s urban character will continue to be shaped by the orchards, fields, wa-
terways and foothills that surround it.
Oroville will be a place people are proud to call home or will visit frequently.
B. Guiding Principles
The General Plan Guiding Principles are a description of how Oroville intends to
grow and develop through the implementation of its General Plan. These princi-
ples are based on recommendations provided by community members and ap-
proved by the General Plan Steering Committee.
  ♦ Livability. Ensure that future development enhances the existing character of
       our city as a whole, as well as its individual neighborhoods, and has a positive
       effect on our surroundings and quality of life.
  ♦ Enhanced Mobility. Provide an accessible and comprehensive transporta-
       tion system that integrates automobile use with other transportation options,
       including bicycle and pedestrian networks throughout the city.
  ♦ A Vibrant Local Economy. Create a sustainable economy that serves all
       segments of the population. Engage in economic development to encourage
       and retain businesses that provide a variety of job opportunities, quality goods
       and services, and a dependable tax base.
  ♦ Natural Resources and the Environment. Highlight and protect our
       unique open spaces, natural resources, underdeveloped areas, specimen trees,
       riparian zones and wetlands.
  ♦ Recreation. Enhance recreational opportunities and facilities in Oroville for
       local residents and visitors.
  ♦ Community Infrastructure. Improve and maintain our public services and
       facilities—including water and energy infrastructure, public safety and emer-

  accommodate future development.
♦ Health and Safety. Work to ensure the health and safety of Oroville’s resi-
  dents.
♦ An Involved Citizenry. Encourage civic participation in the General Plan
  Update process, and instill a sense of shared responsibility for our communi-
  ty’s well-being.

3 LAND USE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the future physical development of Oroville and
  to preserve, protect and enhance the current livability and quality of life for Oroville’s residents.
  The Land Use Element is not designed to discourage or promote development as allowed in this
  General Plan, but rather to describe the manner in which development should be managed in the
  event that it does occur. The Land Use Element is the central chapter of the General Plan.
  As required by California Government Code Section 65302(a) and Public
  Resources Code Section 2762(a), the Land Use Element of the General Plan
  addresses the following issues:
    ♦ Distribution, location and extent of the uses of land for housing, business,
       industry, open space, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic
       beauty, education, public buildings and grounds and other categories of public
       and private uses of land.
    ♦ Standards of population density and building intensity for the land use
       designations.
  The Land Use Element focuses on development that could potentially occur in
  both the existing city limits and the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI). The SOI is
  the area outside of the city limits that the City intends to incorporate in the future.
  Land use in the City of Oroville and surrounding area has not changed substantially
  since adoption of the 1995 City of Oroville General Plan. However, regional and local
  market trends have increased the rate of change over the past few years. This
  Element presents the regulatory and policy land use tools used to guide these
  trends in the City of Oroville, as well as existing land uses already present in
  Oroville. Additional land use-related topics covered by the Land Use Element
  include separate ongoing planning efforts, current development proposals and an
  assessment of the buildout potential of the City.
  The Land Use Element is divided into seven sections:
  A. Background Information. Provides details on jurisdictional boundaries,
        regulatory setting, other planning efforts and existing land uses in Oroville.
  B. SOI and Target Annexation Strategy. Describes the City of Oroville’s
        desired SOI and the City’s annexation strategy for unincorporated areas within
        the SOI.
                                                                                                   3-1

C. Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities. Describes disadvantaged
     unincorporated communities within Oroville’s SOI and assesses their
     infrastructure needs and deficiencies.
D. General Plan Land Use Designations. Describes the characteristics and
     intensity of each land use designation and contains a map of the application of
     these designations for Oroville.
E. General Plan Overlays. Describes the characteristics of General Plan
     Overlays, including three specific plan areas located within the SOI, and
     provides a general overview of how the City of Oroville envisions these areas
     will develop in the future.
F. Goals, Policies, and Actions. Provides guidance to the City of Oroville
     related to land use decisions.
G. General Plan Development Potential. Describes the full buildout potential
     of the General Plan and the expected amount of development that is likely to
     occur over the next 25 years.
A. Background Information
The City of Oroville utilizes a variety of tools to plan for future growth, including
the General Plan, Specific Plans, and Zoning Code. The following discussion
describes these tools, as well as the various applicable jurisdictional boundaries.
1. Jurisdictional Boundaries
The City of Oroville exercises regulatory authority over land use within its city
limits, and is allowed by law to establish future land use designations for areas
outside its city limits but within its SOI. The SOI demarcates the area that may
ultimately be subject to City of Oroville jurisdiction due to potential future
annexation. The city limits and the boundaries of the SOI are described in the
Introduction, Chapter 1, and illustrated in Figure I-2 of that chapter. Land use
discussions throughout this Element will be framed by the city limits and SOI.
2. Existing Land Use
The following section provides an overview of the existing land use pattern in the
Oroville Planning Area. Table LU-1 shows the acreages of various existing land
uses in the city limits and in the SOI, while Figure LU-1 illustrates existing land
uses. References to specific neighborhood, districts and corridors are described in
the Community Design Element (Chapter 4) and are illustrated in Figure CD-1.

b. Multi-Family Residential
For the purposes of this General Plan, “multi-family” includes any housing type
with more than one unit in a building, including duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes,
apartment buildings and condominiums.               Multi-family units are scattered
throughout the same areas as single-family neighborhoods, with a particular
concentration of higher-density, multi-family buildings along the Table Mountain
Boulevard corridor and the Oroville Dam Boulevard corridor. Multi-family parcels
occupy 265 acres within the city limits. An additional 535 acres are within the SOI.
With few exceptions, multi-family residential buildings in the SOI consist of smaller
projects that generally have less than five units.
c. Mobile Home Parks
Mobile home account for roughly 400 units within the city limits of Oroville. Most
are located in the City’s 32 acres of mobile home parks. An additional 962 mobile
home units are located within the 62 acres of mobile home parks in the SOI.
Concentrations of mobile homes are located in Kelly Ridge and Thermalito.
d. Commercial and Office
Commercial uses in this category of existing land use include retail, office and
service uses. There are 630 acres of land within the city limits in commercial use,
with an additional 513 acres in Oroville’s unincorporated SOI. Commercial and
office uses are concentrated in four main areas:
  ♦ The Historic Downtown district has traditionally been the commercial core of
     the City. In recent years the Oroville Dam Boulevard Corridor has taken away
     some retail presence from the Historic Downtown. However, revitalization
     programs should bring more life to the Historic Downtown district. Many
     parcels consist of ground-floor retail with office or residential units above.
  ♦ The Table Mountain Boulevard corridor contains newer office spaces and
     office complexes that house a variety of professional functions in both the
     public and private sectors.
  ♦ The Feather River Boulevard corridor has hospitality commercial located on
     the north end, while the south end of the corridor is populated by service
     commercial and Oroville’s only movie theater.
  ♦ Oroville Dam Boulevard and Olive Highway contain the remaining
     concentration of commercial uses. Beginning at the Highway 70 interchange,
     strip retail uses, including several big box retailers, dominate the Oroville Dam
     Boulevard corridor east to Olive Highway; this corridor also contains the Oro

     Dam Auto Center at Veatch Street. The retail concentrations along Olive
     Highway are generally located from Oroville Dam Boulevard southeast to
     Foothill Boulevard. Most of the strip shopping centers are occupied and
     active, but a few parcels are underutilized.
e. Industrial
In Oroville, prevalent industrial uses include light manufacturing, heavy industrial,
service and repair, processing and warehousing. Currently there are approximately
416 acres in industrial use within the city limits, and approximate 336 acres in the
SOI. Industrial uses are confined to two areas in the City of Oroville. The primary
industrial zone in the City is located on the Southside, bounded by the Oroville
Dam Boulevard on the north, the Western Pacific railroad tracks on the east, Ophir
Road on the south, and Highway 70 on the west. Major uses here include
manufacturing, wood processing, and warehousing. The Airport Business Park is
adjacent to Oroville Municipal Airport on the north and east. Uses here include
some light manufacturing/assembly operations as well as limited research and
design.
f. Public/Quasi-Public
The Public/Quasi-Public category encompasses several types of uses, including all
publicly owned parcels that are not parks or open space, and privately owned
parcels that accommodate civic and institutional uses such as churches and
hospitals. Public and quasi-public uses account for approximately 1,122 acres
within the city limits and 220 acres in the SOI. These include the Oroville
Municipal Airport, City of Oroville Government, Butte County Government
Complex and Institutional uses such as schools, hospitals, churches, and cemeteries
and a fish hatchery.
g. Parks and Recreational Facilities
Parks and recreational facilities, such as playing fields and neighborhood parks, are
fairly well distributed around the city, comprising 513 acres within the city limits. A
few of the largest parks include River Bend Park (on Feather River), Mitchell Park
(south of downtown), and Nelson Park and Recreational Center (north of
Thermalito). Parks in Oroville provide a number of recreational opportunities for
local residents, ranging from fishing, hiking, and river-rafting to sports fields and a
new skate park near the Historic Downtown.
h. Other Open Space
In addition to parks, Oroville has many open space resources that are protected by
State agencies or conservation trusts. The 12,000-acre Oroville Wildlife Refuge is a
riparian forest bordered by 12 miles of river channels and is important habitat for
                                                                                    3-7

beavers, egrets, and river otters. 2 Approximately 2,750 acres of the Oroville
Wildlife Refuge are within the Planning Area. In addition to the Wildlife Area, the
State of California manages a vast amount of land in the Lake Oroville State
Recreation Area, including recreation areas and lands associated with the State
Water Project, which begins at Oroville Dam and the Lake Oroville reservoir.
South and North Thermalito Forebay comprise approximately 610 acres and
Thermalito Afterbay is approximately 3,900 acres.
i. Agriculture
Agriculture is limited within the city limits of Oroville, accounting for only 17 acres.
However, agriculture occupies approximately 1,563 acres of land within the SOI.
Agricultural lands are typically used for field crops, orchards, and grazing. Grazing
and pasture land account for most of the agriculture in the Oroville area, with
much of the remainder is citrus and olive orchards. Small parcels of agricultural
land can be found in Thermalito, as well as around Wyman Ravine in the southeast
part of the SOI.
j. Tribal Lands
There are no tribal lands within the city limits of Oroville, but one reserve is
located in the SOI and another is located in the Planning Area. Both are anchored
by casinos. Gold Country Casino occupies 92 acres in the SOI located off of Olive
Highway and is operated by the Tyme Maidu of Berry-Creek Rancheria. The
Feather Falls Casino operated by the Concow Maidu of Mooretown Rancheria is
located off Ophir Road, outside of the SOI but within the Planning Area.
k. Vacant and Underutilized Land
Vacant land is defined as land with no structure or building improvement and that
is not used for active agricultural production. Conversely, underutilized land is
defined as land with the ability to accommodate additional density. Vacant land is
interspersed throughout the City and comprises a significant portion of the
Oroville area. Vacant land comprises 3,117 acres within the city limits and 5,805
acres of the land within the SOI. The average vacant parcel size is 2.83 acres. In
addition to vacant land, underutilized land is also scattered throughout the City.

3. Other Planning Documents
In addition to the General Plan, the City of Oroville has several other plans that are
used by the City to guide development and annexation in specific areas of the
Oroville. Among these are the Oro Bay Specific Plan, the Riverfront Master Plan,
and a number of policies addressing the City’s Economic Development Zones.
These plans are described below:
 ♦ Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. The Butte County Airport Land Use
    Commission is charged with promoting land use compatibility around the
    County’s airports to minimize public exposure to excessive noise and safety
    hazards. This is accomplished through the preparation and periodic update of
    an Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP), the most recent of which
    was adopted in 2000. Public Utilities Code Section 21676 requires Oroville’s,
    and the County’s, General Plan land use designations to be in conformance
    with the land use plans and policies of the adopted ALUCP. These zones are
    shown in Figures LU-1 and LU-6 for reference, and are described in more
    detail in Section E of the Safety Element.
 ♦ Riverfront Master Plan. The Master Plan was recently developed to
    coordinate improvements around the Feather River waterfront north of the
    Historic Downtown. The Master Plan recommends redevelopment of this area
    to accommodate new uses and to strengthen the connection between the
    Historic Downtown and the riverfront.
 ♦ Community of South Oroville Redevelopment/Annexation Feasibility
    Study. In 2007, the City completed a feasibility study to examine the
    possibility of annexing the South Oroville area. The Study Area comprised
    approximately 5,158 acres of land outside of city limits, extending south to
    Messina Avenue, west to Pacific Heights Road and the Feather River, and east
    to Upper Palermo Road. The Study also examined the possibility of expanding
    the City’s Redevelopment Area to include South Oroville.
4. Ongoing Planning Efforts
Development of this General Plan also acknowledges other ongoing planning
efforts that may influence, provide additional information, or impact the General
Plan in the future. These plans are described below:
 ♦ Butte County General Plan Update. Although the City of Oroville General
    Plan land use map does cover land outside the city limits, the City does not
    have land use authority unless annexation occurs. Absent annexation, the Butte
    County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance are the land use regulatory
    documents for land outside the city limits. The County updated its General
                                                                                 3-11

     Plan and Zoning Ordinance in 2010 and 2012, respectively. In general, the
     County’s General Plan land use map and zoning map are consistent with this
     General Oro Bay Specific Plan. This Specific Plan addresses land use in the
     2,400-unit Oro Bay development project west of the Oroville Municipal
     Airport. It applies to approximately 410 acres and includes a General Plan
     amendment. An annexation proposal is also associated with this Plan. This
     Specific Plan is described in more detail in Section E of this Land Use Element.
 ♦ Rio d’Oro Specific Plan. This Specific Plan addresses land use in the 2,700-
     unit Rio d’Oro development project in the southern portion of the Planning
     Area just west of Highway 70. It applies to approximately 650 acres and
     includes a General Plan amendment. An annexation proposal is also associated
     with this Plan. This Specific Plan is described in more detail in Section E of
     this Land Use Element.

physical boundaries and service area of a local agency, as determined by the
commission.” A SOI is an area within which a city may expand through the
process of annexation. The purpose of a SOI is to encourage “logical and orderly
development and coordination of local governmental agencies so as to
advantageously provide for the present and future needs of the county and its
communities.”
The Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission (Butte LAFCO) oversees
and adopts the SOI for each City in Butte County and approves a City’s annexation
of land outside the city limits. The current SOI, which was adopted by the Butte
LAFCO on December 4, 2014, is depicted in Figure I-2 in the Introduction
chapter.
According to the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act of 2000 which governs all
LAFCO’s in the State, the purpose of the Butte LAFCO is to discourage urban
sprawl, preserve open space and prime agricultural lands, allow for the efficient
provision of government services, and encourage the orderly formation and
development of local agencies based upon local conditions and circumstances. A
LAFCO cannot approve the annexation of land outside of a City’s SOI.

The City of Oroville works closely with Butte LAFCO to address local annexation
issues, and recently completed annexations of six island areas and the Southside
neighborhood. The 2014 SOI update, island annexations, and Southside
neighborhood annexation were the result of a 2011 annexation strategy developed
by the City. The City has also identified other potential future annexation areas,
including the Rio d’Oro, Oro Bay and unincorporated South Ophir Specific Plan
Areas that are discussed in Section E.
C. Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities
Senate Bill (SB) 244 requires that the Land Use Element identify Disadvantaged
Unincorporated Communities (DUCs) within the City’s SOI, analyze infrastructure
and fire service needs and deficiencies, and assess potential funding mechanisms
for expansions of services and facilities. DUCs are defined as follows:
  ♦ Inhabited with ten or more homes adjacent or in close proximity to one
    another; and
  ♦ Either within a city’s SOI, islands within a city boundary, or geographically
    isolated and have existed for more than 50 years; and
  ♦ The median household income is 80 percent or less than the statewide median
    household income.
1. Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities in Oroville’s SOI
The DUCs within Oroville’s SOI are shown in Figure LU-3. These communities
were mapped using the following steps:
  ♦ Identify Census block groups in which greater than 50 percent of the
    households have annual incomes that are less than 80 percent of the statewide
    median (based on 2010 Census data).
  ♦ Exclude areas of the Census block groups that are within the city limits or
    outside the SOI.
  ♦ Delineate the communities within these Census block groups based on aerial
    photographs and parcel data. Communities are defined as having ten or more
    homes adjacent or in close proximity to one another.
                                                                                3-13

As shown in Figure LU-3 and Table LU-2, there are nine DUCs in Oroville’s SOI
ranging in size from 9 acres to 1,940 acres. 3 Some mapped DUCs encompass
multiple communities that are adjacent to one another.
2. Infrastructure and Fire Service
This section assesses the water, wastewater, stormwater drainage, and structural fire
protection needs and deficiencies within the DUCs.
a. Water
As shown in Figure LU-4, the majority of the DUCs are within the service areas of
the water providers that are described below.
i. Thermalito Water and Sewer District
The Thermalito Water and Sewer District (TWSD) serves DUCs 1 and 2. TWSD
has rights to 8,200 acre-feet per year (AFY) and obtains its surface water from the
Concow Reservoir. TWSD also has five groundwater wells that are used as a
backup water source. TWSD serves customers in unincorporated Butte County as
well as within the city limits. According to the 2010 Butte County General Plan
Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR), TWSD has adequate capacity to serve
existing and new development throughout its service area through and beyond
2030.
ii. California Water Service Company, Oroville
The California Water Service Company, Oroville (Cal Water Oroville) serves
DUC 3 and the Southside neighborhood and Lincoln Blvd. portions of DUC 7.
Cal Water Oroville is a private water supplier that mainly serves customers within
the city limits. Cal Water Oroville obtains its water from four wells and surface
water from the west branch of the Feather River that is purchased from PG&E.
According to the 2010 Butte County General Plan Draft EIR, water demand from
existing and new development throughout its service area would approach the level
of the water system supply around the year 2025. However, additional water
supplies are available for purchase from PG&E.
           3 DUC 7 was mapped and evaluated prior to the City’s annexation of a portion of
this area.

iii. South Feather Water and Power Agency
The South Feather Water and Power Agency (SFWPA) serves DUCs 4, 5, 6, and 8,
as well as the portions of DUC 7 that are not served by Cal Water Oroville and the
majority of DUC 9, excluding its western portion. SFWPA has water rights for
51,000 AFY and obtains its surface water from the South Fork of the Feather River
and Slate Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of the Yuba River. SFWPA serves
customers in unincorporated Butte County as well as within the city limits.
According to the 2010 Butte County General Plan Draft EIR, SFWPA has capacity
to serve existing and new development throughout its service area through and
beyond 2030.
The western extent of DUC 9 (west of the extent of Mariah Lane) is not within the
service area of SFWPA. Residents within this area rely on groundwater from
private wells, indicating a water service need/deficiency. However, this area is
within the SOI of the SFWPA, indicating that the Agency may annex this portion
of DUC 9 into its district and service area in the future.
                                                                                  3-17

b. Wastewater
As shown in Figure LU-5, wastewater service in the DUCs is provided by a
combination of public sewer systems and individual on-site wastewater treatment
and dispersal systems (i.e. septic systems).
i. Thermalito Water and Sewer District
TWSD provides sanitary sewer collection service to DUCs 1 and 2. TWSD’s sewer
collection system consists of 49 miles of sanitary sewer line and is generally in
adequate condition. 4 TWSD’s collection system discharges into a wastewater
treatment plant that is operated by the Sewerage Commission – Oroville Region
(SCOR). According to the 2010 Butte County General Plan Draft EIR, SCOR’s
wastewater treatment plant has adequate capacity to serve existing development,
but would require additional capacity to serve new development anticipated by
2030.
DUC 3 is not within the service area of TWSD, so residents in this area rely on
individual septic systems, indicating a wastewater service need/deficiency.
However, DUC 3 is adjacent to TWSD’s service area and within its SOI, indicating
that the District may annex this DUC into its service area in the future.
ii. Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District
The Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District (LOAPUD) provides sanitary sewer
collection services to DUC 5 and portions of DUC 6 and 7. LOAPUD has
approximately 75 miles of sanitary sewer line and six pump stations. In general, the
collection system is in good condition. 5 Similar to TWSD, LOAPUD’s collection
system discharges into SCOR’s Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The following portions of DUCs 6 and 7 are not within LOAPUD’s service area,
so residents rely on individual septic systems, indicating a wastewater service
need/deficiency. With the exception of the northwestern portion of DUC 6, these
areas are within LOAPUD’s SOI, so the District may annex these areas into its
service area in the future.
  ♦ DUC 6: The easternmost portion along Miners Ranch Road and the portion
     that is west of Apica Avenue.

  ♦ DUC 7: The eastern portions along Foothill Boulevard, Oroville Garden
     Ranch Road, Inglewood Drive, and Edgemont Drive; an area north of Oak
     Knoll Way and west of Oroville Bangor Highway; and a large undeveloped
     parcel south of the Southside neighborhood.
iii. Private Septic Systems
DUCs 4, 8, and 9 are not within a service area or SOI of a wastewater service
provider, so the residents rely on individual septic systems, indicating a wastewater
service need/deficiency.
c. Stormwater Drainage
As shown in Figure SAF-5 in the Safety Element, the majority of the DUCs are not
within the 100-year flood zone. However, the following DUC areas are within the
100-year flood zone, indicating that they are susceptible to flooding during 100-year
storm events:
  ♦ DUC 1: Along Ruddy Creek and along the Feather River.
  ♦ DUC 7: Southwest of the Southside neighborhood, along an unnamed
     waterway south of Oak Knoll Way, and along Wyman Ravine.
  ♦ DUC 8: Along Wyman Ravine.
DUC 1 is located within the study area of the Thermalito Master Drainage Plans.
Although the majority of this area has adequate stormwater drainage, the Plans
identify areas within DUC 1 that have deficient stormwater infrastructure. The
Plans also identify potential measures to correct these deficiencies.
The remaining DUCs are within areas that lack stormwater drainage master plans
and municipal stormwater drainage systems. However, Butte County is responsible
for the culverts, ditches, and waterways that address roadway drainage throughout
the unincorporated county. Because these DUCs lack municipal stormwater
drainage infrastructure, and because portions of DUC 1 lack adequate stormwater
drainage infrastructure, all of the DUCs have stormwater drainage needs/
deficiencies.
d. Structural Fire Protection
The Butte County Fire Department (BCFD) and the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) provide structural fire protection to the
majority of the DUCs, with the exception of the Southside neighborhood portion
of DUC 7. Butte County contracts with CAL FIRE to provide staffing to BCFD
                                                                                  3-21

through an annual cooperative agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the
County funds CAL FIRE professional command, firefighting, and administrative
staff to operate the BCFD. Through this arrangement, CAL FIRE and the BCFD
function together as a fully consolidated fire protection agency and provide cost-
effective fire protection service to the DUCs. In addition, through an automatic
aid agreement with BCFD, the City of Oroville’s Fire Department provides first
response fire protection service to the DUCs when the City engine is the closest
resource.
El Medio Fire District (EMFD) provides structural fire protection service to the
Southside neighborhood portion of DUC 7, which is not served by BCFD or CAL
FIRE. EMFD also has an automatic aid agreement with BCFD and the Oroville
Fire Department.
With the BCFD/CAL FIRE and EMFD fire protection services, coupled with
automatic aid agreements with the Oroville Fire Department, all of the DUCs have
adequate access to structural fire protection service.
3. Potential Funding Mechanisms
As described above, all of the DUCs have identified stormwater drainage
infrastructure needs and deficiencies. In addition, the following DUCs have
identified water and wastewater infrastructure needs and deficiencies:
 ♦ DUC 3: Wastewater needs/deficiencies.
 ♦ DUC 4: Wastewater needs/deficiencies.
 ♦ Portions of DUC 6: Wastewater needs/deficiencies.
 ♦ Portions of DUC 7: Wastewater needs/deficiencies.
 ♦ DUC 8: Wastewater needs/deficiencies.
 ♦ DUC 9: Water needs/deficiencies (portion) and wastewater needs/deficiencies
     (entire DUC).
Funding for infrastructure improvements to address these needs and deficiencies is
available from a variety of sources, as described below.
The principal funding sources for local government infrastructure include taxes,
benefit assessments, bonds, and exactions. The following list details each principal
infrastructure funding mechanism available for local government: 6

 ♦ Taxes. Local governments can collect a general tax that is based on the value
    of property (e.g. property tax or utility tax) to fund capital improvement
    projects and services. This is generally for improvements that will serve the
    entire community. Special districts (e.g. utility districts) can finance their
    activities using a special tax. City and county governments can also levy a
    special tax that is dedicated to a particular use. Under the Mello-Roose
    Community Facilities Act of 1982, local jurisdictions, including special districts,
    are authorized to form “community facilities districts” to finance new public
    improvements and issue bonds; these are generally used to finance
    infrastructure that serves new development.
 ♦ Benefit Assessment. A benefit assessment finances improvements that
    directly benefit the assessed parcels in the benefit district.
 ♦ Bonds. There are three types of bonds that can be used to finance
    infrastructure projects: general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and lease
    revenue bonds. General obligation bonds are issued for the acquisition or
    improvements of real property (e.g. sewers and water systems) and secured by
    local governments’ ability to levy property taxes. Revenue bonds are secured
    by the future revenues of the facilities they are financing; therefore, they are
    used to fund projects that will generate revenue, such as wastewater treatment
    facilities. Lease revenue bonds are issued by a nonprofit organization or a
    special authority that constructs a facility and leases it to the local jurisdiction.
    After bonds retire, facilities are turned over to the local jurisdiction.
 ♦ Exactions. Exactions are dedications of land, improvements, or impact fees
    imposed on new development to fund the construction of capital facilities.
In addition to the principal infrastructure funding mechanisms described above, the
following funding opportunities can be used for infrastructure planning and
implementation: 7
 ♦ California Department of Public Health- Safe Drinking Water State
    Revolving Fund. The Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund provides
    low-interest loans to fund public water system planning and infrastructure
    projects.

D. General Plan Land Use Designations
This section describes the General Plan land use designations for the Planning
Area. These designations are intentionally broad enough to avoid duplicating City
or County zoning regulations. Additionally, more than one zoning district may be
consistent with a single General Plan use category.

Figure LU-6 illustrates the land uses designations for both of these areas and      for
the Planning Area outside of the SOI. Table LU-3 summarizes the acreage             for
each land use designation in the city limits and SOI. Although these lands          are
under the jurisdiction of Butte County, they demonstrate Oroville’s vision          for
creating a seamless transition between City and County lands.
The boundary lines between most land use designations are delineated as
specifically as possible, in most cases following parcel lines. The 20 land use
designations described in this element establish a range and intensity or density of
uses and are intended to help implement the future vision of the City of Oroville,
while providing flexibility for development. For each of the relevant land use
designations, these assumed densities and intensities are listed in Table LU-4. The
land use designations also reflect the goals and policies in this General Plan. In this
General Plan, standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as the
allowable range of dwelling units per net acre. Unlike gross acreage, which includes
all land, net acreage excludes the land that is necessary for providing streets,
services and rights-of-way. Typically, net acreage is about 20 percent less than the
gross acreage.
Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses are stated as maximum
floor-area ratios (FARs) based on net acreage. A FAR is a ratio of the gross
building square footage permitted on a lot to the net square footage of the lot. For
example, on a site with 10,000 square feet of land area, a FAR of 1.0 will allow
10,000 gross square feet of building floor area to be built. On the same site, a FAR
of 2.0 would allow 20,000 square feet of floor area (e.g. two-story building with 100
percent of lot coverage, or a four-story building with 50 percent lot coverage), and
a FAR of 0.4 would allow 4,000 square feet of floor area.
The goals, policies, and actions contained in this Element provide additional
direction on how the various land use designations should be developed to
contribute to the overall character and vision of Oroville.
1. Residential
Residential areas provide locations for various types of housing throughout
Oroville. Maximum densities for residential uses are expressed in numbers of units
per net acre of developable land, provided that at least one housing unit may be
built on each existing legal parcel designated for residential use. Second units
permitted by local regulation and State-mandated density bonuses for provision of
affordable housing are in addition to densities otherwise permitted. New
residential projects shall meet or exceed the minimum density specified in the land
                                                                                  3-25

a. Rural Residential Density
This designation provides a transition between sparsely developed areas and the
agricultural areas surrounding the community. This designation allows for a
maximum of 0.2 units per net acre (one unit for every 5 acres) and encourages large
lot development with a rural character, generally on the urban edge.

This designation provides a transition from lower densities at the edges of town to
the higher densities in the center of the community. This designation allows for
the development of land with a quasi-rural character. This designation allows for
1.0 to 3.0 units per net acre. Clustered lots as permitted in the Very Low Density
category may be substituted, as long as the overall gross density does not exceed
3.0 units per acre.
d. Medium Low Density
This designation applies to more typical development patterns in areas that consist
of single-family detached homes on ¼-acre lots. This designation applies to a
significant portion of the area within the SOI. This designation allows for 3.0 to
6.0 units per net acre.
e. Medium Density
This designation provides opportunities for small lot single-family attached homes,
duplexes and townhouses in the more urban areas that are found primarily within
the city limits. Development patterns in these areas would allow for 6.0 to 14.0
units per net acre.
f. Medium High Density
This designation provides opportunities for townhouses, garden apartments, and
apartment buildings that would typically be located in urban areas with major roads,
adequate infrastructure, and amenities to support higher densities. This designation
allows for 14.0 to 20.0 units per net acre.
g. High Density
This designation provides opportunities for townhouses, apartments and
condominiums that would typically be found in specifically urban areas with major
roads, adequate infrastructure and amenities to support higher densities. This
designation allows for 20.0 to 30.0 units per net acre.
2. Mixed Use
Mixed use development allows and encourages different but compatible uses to be
located in close proximity to each other. A common example is a single structure
3-30

                                                         C I T Y   O F  O R O V I L L E

or a group of physically integrated structures that combine residential uses with
commercial, public, entertainment and/or office uses. In multi-story mixed use
developments, the ground floor uses are predominantly nonresidential with the
purpose of creating pedestrian activity. Since this designation allows for both
residential and commercial uses a wider residential density range is established
along with an appropriate FAR.
This designation applies to urban areas with major roads, adequate infrastructure
and amenities to support higher densities. Townhomes, garden apartments,
apartments and condominiums would typically be found in this designation. Single
use commercial development may also be allowed by approval of the Planning
Commission. Single use residential development is prohibited under this
designation. This designation allows for 10.0 to 30.0 units per net acre and a
maximum FAR of 1.0. When mixed-use development is located in the Downtown
Historic Overlay District, as identified in the Oroville Municipal Code, Mixed Use
shall have a maximum density of 70 units per net acre and a maximum FAR
ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 based on amenities that are provided per Policy 2.8 in this
Land Use Element.
3. Retail and Business Services
This designation is intended to provide for business activities that offer goods and
services to the community. This designation allows for a maximum FAR of 0.40,
except in the Historic Downtown where an FAR of 2.0 will be allowed. Zoning
districts specify where specific allowed uses, such as the production of goods,
wholesale storage, and distribution facilities, may be located.
4. Office
This designation provides spaces for offices that will have minimal adverse impacts
upon immediate neighborhoods and residential character. Though limited in its
application, this designation is applied in areas that are suitable for offices, but not
retail businesses. Office commercial areas provide office sites for medical, legal,
insurance, and similar uses. Business and professional offices are to be developed
with a maximum FAR of 0.4.
5. Industrial
This designation allows for general manufacturing and distribution in an
environment that accommodates the needs of large-scale operations, some of
which require extensive outdoor storage. Retail uses are excluded, except those
oriented primarily to serving businesses or employees within the industrial area.
                                                                                   3-31

Adult-oriented businesses are also allowed in this designation. The maximum FAR
for this designation is 0.4.
6. Airport Business Park
This designation allows for light manufacturing, limited industrial, food processing,
wholesale trade and offices. Retail businesses and public services are permitted to a
lesser extent and would generally be allowed as an accessory use. Outdoor storage
is only permitted in limited amounts if heavily screened. Projects must maintain
architectural and landscape standards normally associated with the term “business
park” rather than “industrial area.” FAR range in this designation ranges from 0.20
to 0.35. Maximum FAR is 0.30 in the area bounded by Feather Avenue on the
north, Oroville Dam Boulevard West on the south, 20th Street on the east and 24th
Street on the west. Maximum FAR is 0.35 in all other areas.
7. Public Facilities and Services
This designation refers to schools, governmental offices, the Oroville Municipal
Airport, local cemeteries and other facilities that have a unique public character.
Governmental facilities that are similar to private offices or industrial facilities are
not shown as public. Places of religious assembly are not shown on the General
Plan Diagram.
8. Parks and Recreation
This designation refers to public parks, golf courses, or other appropriate
recreational uses. A recreational vehicle park or campground may be permitted
within areas designated for Parks and Recreation as a conditional use if deemed
appropriate with surrounding uses and densities.
9. Resource Management
This designation refers to areas primarily devoted to agricultural use, including
grazing, crop production and animal husbandry, and to areas which may contain
significant resources, such as wetlands. Agriculture is permitted within areas
designated as Resource Management with fewer restrictions on animal maintenance
than in residential designations. Development is limited to one dwelling unit per
legally created parcel.
10. Environmental Conservation and Safety
This designation denotes areas with significant wildlife habitat and/or physical
development constraints. Examples include woodland or wetland open space,
riparian corridors, the Oroville Wildlife Refuge, power transmission line corridors,
areas of slope exceeding 30 percent, areas prone to landslide and areas prone to
3-32

100-year floods as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
No subdivisions of land will be permitted for properties completely covered by an
Environmental Conservation and Safety designation unless acceptable evidence is
provided by the developer which demonstrates that· the classification is not
appropriate for the entire site. The Environmental Conservation and Safety
overlay allows for one residential unit on each existing legal parcel provided there
are suitable building site(s).
11. State Water Project
This designation refers to land areas of the State-owned Oroville-Thermalito
Complex.
E. General Plan Overlays
General Plan Overlays are applied over an underlying land use designation. The
Unique Agriculture, Foothill, Professional Office, and Arts, Culture, and
Entertainment Overlays described below provide more specific regulations and
information than the underlying designation. The Specific Plan Area Overlays
described below are applied to groups of parcels that will be developed in a
cohesive manner that is consistent with the goals of this General Plan. Adoption
of a Specific Plan will require a General Plan amendment and annexation into the
city limits. Each Specific Plan must be developed in accordance with the land use
designations described above and be representative of the goals, policies and
actions in this General Plan. All General Plan Overlays are displayed in Figure
LU-6, with the exception of the Foothill Overlay, which is shown separately in
Figure LU-7 for better readability.
1. Unique Agriculture Overlay
This designation allows agricultural support and specialty agriculture uses to protect
and promote small-scale agriculture, regardless of whether such uses are allowed in
the underlying designation. Such uses include wineries, roadside stands, farm-
based tourism, and ancillary restaurants and/or stores.
2. Foothill Overlay
As shown in Figure LU-7, the Foothill Overlay is applied to eastern areas of the
city and SOI that are characterized by the foothill landscape and low density
residential and open space uses. The intent of this Overlay is to consider the
                                                                                 3-33

nature of this foothill landscape when planning for and conducting development,
and to recognize that development is likely to happen slowly over time, affecting
the cohesiveness of development in this area. The Foothill Overlay limits activities
with high fire risk, and allows for rural roadway and sidewalk design standards
while avoiding intermittent sidewalks which can result from inconsistent
development patterns.
3. Professional Office Overlay
The Professional Office Overlay allows professional office uses in addition to the
uses allowed by the underlying designation. Such uses include offices for
accountants, attorneys, commercial art, design services, news services,
photographers, counselors, psychologists, engineers, real-estate agents, and other
similar professions. The Professional Office Overlay is applied to areas designated
for residential uses along Montgomery Street west of Oak Street.
4. Arts, Culture, and Entertainment Overlay
The Arts, Culture, and Entertainment Overlay is applied to the City’s Historic
Downtown, and is intended to bolster Oroville’s position as a tourist and
recreational destination by providing amenities that recreational enthusiasts and
tourists can enjoy. Additionally, the Arts, Culture, and Entertainment Overlay
seeks to plan for appropriate development of the Feather River waterfront to
stimulate high-quality commercial, retail, and restaurant establishments in order to
provide an enjoyable atmosphere; re-establish the Oroville Historic Downtown as
an art, cultural, entertainment, employment, and residential center for the region by
incorporating the Feather River; and establish a community gathering place to
enjoy shopping, dining, various museums, and live entertainment in a safe and
vibrant destination. The Arts, Culture, and Entertainment Overlay allows uses that
support these goals, regardless of the underlying designation.
5. Oro Bay Specific Plan Area
The Oro Bay Specific Plan will determine the mix of uses that will occur on the
409-acre site within the limits identified in this General Plan. This Specific Plan
will limit development to not more than 2,400 dwelling units of mixed residential
types. Commercial areas for this Specific Plan are limited to 5 acres of Retail and
Business Serving designation to be located along the Highway 162 frontage. The
uses would include, but are not limited to, grocery store, drug store or convenience
store; a bakery, deli, coffee shop, or café; a gas/service station; a drycleaner, hair
salon, health club, or similar neighborhood retail service. The Specific Plan will
specify a maximum permissible FAR of 0.4 for the proposed retail use.

1. General Land Use
Goal LU-1       Provide for orderly, well-planned, and balanced
                growth consistent with the limits imposed by
                infrastructure and the City’s ability to assimilate new
                growth.
        Policies
        P1.1    Establish a logical methodology for annexation of land into the
                City that will reduce “island effects” and provide a more
                coherent city limit boundary. Annexations shall be coordinated
                with the appropriate property owners and service providers and
                in substantial conformance with Butte LAFCO Guidelines.
        P1.2    Establish logical jurisdictional boundaries for the City. Work
                with service districts to provide services to facilitate property
                owner requests for annexation of properties within the City’s
                Sphere of Influence.
        P1.3    Ensure that all new development pays its fair share in financing
                of public facilities and services.
        P1.4    Link the rate of growth in Oroville to the provision of adequate
                services and infrastructure, including schools, roadways, police,
                fire and medical services, and water supply and wastewater
                treatment infrastructure to ensure that new development will not
                negatively impact existing infrastructure and level of services.
        P1.5    Encourage non-conforming land uses to relocate or redevelop in
                accordance with current land use and zoning designations.
        P1.6    Ensure all new development conforms to current land use and
                zoning designations.
        P1.7    Require preparation and approval of Specific Plans for large
                newly developing areas on the periphery of the City prior to
                annexation and development of these areas. At a minimum,
                Specific Plans shall be prepared for the Rio d’Oro, Oro Bay, and
                                                                               3-37

                   South Ophir Road Specific Plan Areas as mapped in Figure
                   LU-6. Specific Plans shall comply with the requirements of this
                   Land Use Element.
            P1.8   Require new specific plans to provide sufficient employment
                   generating land uses to achieve a jobs-to-housing balance equal
                   to the level provided in the incorporated communities of Butte
                   County.
            P1.9   Support infill development by encouraging eligible infill projects
                   to use the streamlined CEQA review provisions allowed by
                   Senate Bill 226. Eligible infill projects are described in Appendix
                   M of the CEQA Guidelines. 8                Eligibility is based on
                   performance standards such as on-site renewable power
                   generation and proximity to transit.
            P1.10 Review Butte County General Plan Updates, General Plan
                   Amendments, and major development project proposals within
                   the Sphere of Influence, and inform County staff of
                   project/plan consistency with this General Plan and City
                   regulations.
            Actions
             A1.1 As required by law, update the Citywide Municipal Services
                   Review as the City’s population and employment base grows to
                   identify what new or expanded public facilities and services are
                   needed to adequately meet the needs of both existing and
                   projected new development.
             A1.2 Review and revise, as necessary, the Development Code to
                   ensure its consistency with this General Plan.

                which the Historic Downtown is an active place.
        P2.6    Encourage restoration and reuse of Historic Downtown
                buildings.
        P2.7    Promote mixed-use development in the Historic Downtown by
                allowing higher densities and intensities of development.
        P2.8    Allow higher FARs in the Historic Downtown for mixed-use
                projects that benefit the community, such as by beautifying or
                improving wayfinding in the Downtown; providing pedestrian,
                bicycle, or transit amenities; providing arts or cultural amenities;
                or incorporating programs or measures to reduce commute trips,
                prevent crime, or improve sustainability.
                                                                               3-39

                   parking facilities.
           A2.3 Conduct a feasibility study regarding the installation of data
                   conduit or a wireless system in the Historic Downtown to allow
                   for high speed internet access, and install such a system if
                   feasible.
3.   Residential
Goal LU-3          Provide housing in a range of residential densities
                   and types to address the housing needs of all
                   segments of the community, including all income
                   groups expected to reside in Oroville.
           Policies
           P3.1    Provide for development of multi-family housing in parts of the
                   Planning Area where topography, noise and infrastructure are
                   appropriate, particularly along collector and arterial streets and
                   within easy walking distance of the Historic Downtown and
                   public facilities.
           P3.2    Promote the development of cohesive neighborhoods with
                   distinct characters and with adequate park land and other
                   neighborhood serving public facilities. For areas over 100 acres,
                   the City may require the preparation of a Specific Plan.

               blighting effect in some neighborhoods.
        P3.6   Prohibit detached single-family homes in the R-3 High Density
               Residential, RP High Density Residential/Professional, and R-4
               Urban Density Residential districts. Areas zoned as R-3 High
               Density Residential, RP High Density Residential/Professional,
               and R-4 Urban Density Residential should be preserved for
               higher density housing, especially rental housing.

5. Industrial
Goal LU-5       Encourage diverse industrial environments that will
                appeal to a broad range of manufacturers and
                distributors, and provide opportunities for the
                operation of profitable businesses in Oroville.
        Policies
        P5.1    Maintain zoning, design guidelines and operating standards for
                industrial uses that promote a community commitment to high
                aesthetic standards.
        P5.2    Locate new industries that require extensive outdoor storage and
                open structures, or that produce emissions which may be
                detectable off-site, in the appropriate industrial areas.
        P5.3    Locate only industries that are compatible with nearby residential
                areas in the area east of the mainline Union Pacific Railroad.
        P5.4    Require, as necessary, the installation of physical buffers, such as
                low maintenance solid masonry or decorative block walls and
                drought-tolerant landscaping, in conjunction with the
                development of industrial or residential projects along Lincoln
                Boulevard (generally between Wyandotte Avenue and the south
                side of Ophir Road) where residential and industrial land uses
                may interface, or in other locations in the City where potentially
                conflicting land uses may be adjacent to one another.
        P5.5    Encourage the development of flexible industrial space to
                accommodate a variety of industrial use and business size.
                                                                                3-43

6.   Public and Quasi-Public Uses
Goal LU-6          Provide adequate land for development of public and
                   quasi-public uses to provide necessary public services
                   and facilities in support of existing and new
                   residential, commercial, and industrial land uses.
           Policies
           P6.1    Designate adequate, appropriately located land for City, County,
                   special district, and school district facilities, particularly through
                   the Specific Plan and Master Plan processes.
           P6.2    Promote the clustering of public and quasi-public uses such as
                   schools, parks, trails, child care facilities, and community activity
                   centers. Joint use of public facilities shall be promoted, and
                   agreements for sharing costs and operational responsibilities
                   among public service providers shall be encouraged.
           P6.3    Encourage the development and operation of childcare facilities.
           P6.4    Encourage the development and operation of senior assisted-
                   living facilities.
           Actions
           A6.1 Periodically update the City General Plan to ensure adequate,
                   appropriately-located land for quasi-public uses such as medical
                   facilities, churches, public, and private school facilities and utility
                   uses.
            A6.2 Strongly encourage Oroville Hospital and adjoining landowners
                   to prepare a long-range development plan for the Medical
                   Center neighborhood. Issues to be addressed should include:
                    ♦ Long-term space needs for the hospital, medical offices, care
                       facilities if appropriate, and parking and landscaping.
                    ♦ The possibility of expanding parking and storage under or
                       near power transmission lines to make land available for

4 COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
  The City of Oroville has a wide array of neighborhood areas with distinct characteristics that create
  a unique sense of place with small town qualities. The purpose of the Community Design Ele-
  ment is to identify, protect, and enhance the positive characteristics of Oroville’s built environment
  that contribute to a high quality of life for its residents.
  The Community Design Element translates the two-dimensional Land Use Ele-
  ment into the third dimension by specifying how new development should look,
  feel, and function. The Community Design Element includes important concepts
  and guidelines that apply to the type, location, and character of both private and
  public development projects for new and existing areas of the city. This Element
  includes principles, goals, objectives, policies, actions, and concepts to maintain and
  enhance the City of Oroville’s unique character as it relates to both the physical
  design of the City and quality of life.
  This Element is organized into three sections as follows:
    ♦ Community Design Principles. Discusses community design principles that
        are intended to guide and shape new public and private development.
    ♦ Existing Community Design and Character. Provides a brief overview of
        the existing urban design characteristics of Oroville.
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions. Provide additional guidance to the City related
        to decisions on public and private development.
  A. Community Design Principles
  The principles that contribute to people’s understanding of their communities as
  unique places have evolved over many years. This section includes urban design
  principles that reflect the existing character of Oroville and are intended to guide
  and shape new development as the city grows.
  Many of the principles in this section come from New Urbanism and Smart
  Growth movements. “New Urbanism” advocates for urban development that is
  responsive to the human scale and human activities from a regional perspective
  down to the design of individual buildings. “Smart Growth” contributes to the
  development of communities that are both economically and socially sustainable.
  Concepts from these urban design practices can help create vibrant and memorable
  places by shaping the three-dimensional form of new development.
                                                                                                    4-1

C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
The following provides a basic overview of each of these approaches, which could
inform future development in Oroville.
1. New Urbanism
The New Urbanism movement has developed in the past two decades as a re-
sponse to the development of communities that lack a strong sense of place and
are built at the expense of existing central cities. The New Urbanist approach en-
courages both new development and the retrofitting of existing communities to
embody a sense of place, thereby creating communities that reflect and enhance the
diversity and heritage of specific places.
The principles of New Urbanism are emphasized at three scales:
  ♦ The Region. A region comprises a number of cities, towns, and communi-
     ties, and each is defined by clear distinctions between the urban development
     and the surrounding rural environment.
  ♦ Neighborhood, District, and Corridor. At this scale, individual communi-
     ties are recognized as comprising a series of pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods
     with a mix of land uses. There is a range of housing types and transit oppor-
     tunities. Transit-supportive development is focused along corridors. Open
     space is a significant component in the definition of neighborhoods. Sec-
     tion B of this Community Design Element describes Oroville’s neighbor-
     hoods, districts, and corridors.
  ♦ Block, Street, and Building. At this scale, the details of the built environ-
     ment—defined both by architectural and landscaping details—are propor-
     tioned to the scale of a pedestrian. Block dimensions and building designs
     place equal emphasis on pedestrian and vehicular uses. These more detailed
     design principles are addressed in Oroville’s Development Code and Design
     Guidelines.
2. Smart Growth
The concept of “smart growth,” an alternative to conventional suburban develop-
ment, seeks to design vital, sustainable neighborhoods that meet the needs of many
different people, regardless of their income level or transportation choices. There
are a number of design and development goals that adhere to the principles of
smart growth. Particularly relevant to the development history and future potential
of Oroville are the goals described below.

                                                   2 0 3 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
                                        C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
♦ Mix of Land Uses. One of the defining characteristics of sustainable neigh-
  borhood design is the mixing of different, complementary land uses. Instead
  of separating residential areas from commercial development, neighborhoods
  provide space near peoples’ homes for useful services; civic buildings, such as
  schools; and places where people can gather in their free time. Neighbor-
  hoods have schools within walking distance of children’s homes, and include
  housing near workplaces so that residents can avoid a long commute to their
  jobs.
♦ High Connectivity. A neighborhood that follows the principles of smart
  growth will offer many different ways for people to get around. Instead of
  streets that form loops and cul-de-sacs, forcing people to make long detours, a
  highly connected network of streets creates several direct routes to any desti-
  nation. A connected street pattern also provides drivers with a variety of route
  choices, which leads to less traffic buildup on major streets and at busy inter-
  sections. Sidewalks and bicycle lanes provide safe routes for people who
  choose to walk or bike to nearby destinations.
♦ High-Quality Development. All types of development that follows smart
  growth principles can enhance the character of a neighborhood. In a smart
  growth neighborhood, retail buildings are located adjacent to sidewalks, fram-
  ing the street’s public space and encouraging people to walk from shop to
  shop. They include architectural details that make the buildings more attrac-
  tive and more compatible with the surrounding development. Single-family
  houses emphasize the front door frontage to the street rather than garages, and
  apartment buildings use varied building forms to give a sense of the individual
  dwelling units they contain. In addition, all types of development incorporate
  the principles of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
  by delineating private and public spaces, enhancing visibility, controlling prop-
  erty access, and ensuring adequate property maintenance.
♦ Range of Housing Types. Smart growth principles lead to neighborhoods
  with different types and sizes of dwelling units that accommodate all parts of
  the population. Different types of housing are distributed throughout the
  neighborhood. For example, single-family houses are often located near
  townhouses and well-designed apartments. As people’s needs change—for
  example, when a woman has her first child, or when an older couple decides to
  find a smaller house after their children move out—the variety of housing
  types allows people to find new places to live within the same neighborhood,
  so that they can continue to live near friends and neighbors.
                                                                                4-3

C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
  ♦ Housing Affordability. A neighborhood that follows smart growth princi-
     ples is not restricted to people with high incomes. Affordable housing is an in-
     tegral part of the neighborhood, and it is distributed throughout the neighbor-
     hood so that people with different income levels can live on the same street, or
     even in the same building. Affordable housing units are designed to fit well
     with their surroundings and to be as long-lasting as market-rate housing units.
     Policies addressing housing affordability in Oroville are included in the 2009
     Housing Element, which is being updated as of 2015.
3. Key Urban Design Concepts
Urban design addresses the image or character of a city’s built form. It considers
the relationship between the location of uses that helps to achieve a strong sense of
place. That sense of place is highly dependent on the visual appearance and devel-
opment character of the built environment. Urban design principles that should be
followed to attain a strong sense of place and unique community character are de-
scribed below.
  ♦ Human-scale Design. People feel most comfortable and secure in environ-
     ments that are designed at the scale of the individual. At a neighborhood level,
     this translates into shorter block lengths that are walkable and provide more
     connections throughout a neighborhood. At a site or building design level,
     human-scale design involves the massing of buildings, articulation of building
     facades, organization of buildings on a site, landscaping of public and private
     areas, and the use of color and materials. Generally, this means avoiding or
     minimizing the use of soundwalls and cul-de-sacs in future residential devel-
     opment and ensuring that future retail, office, and commercial development
     presents an attractive “face” to the street.
  ♦ Nodes. A node is a focal point or meeting place where people might gather.
     Examples of nodes include a popular shopping area or a plaza, park, or com-
     munity center. The crossing of significant streets, particularly those with trans-
     it lines, can also be a node. Nodes are important components of a community
     because they provide a common location for people to meet, talk, shop, and
     play.
  ♦ Edges. Edges help to define space; in built environments, they can be created
     by buildings or rows of trees. Edges can have differing degrees of permeabil-
     ity. For example, an edge created by a wall would be considered “impermea-
     ble.” A building can create a “semi-permeable” edge with a feature such as a
     columned arcade, which allows people visual and physical access between the
     sidewalk area and the private property. Ensuring that buildings, trees, or other

                                                        2 0 3 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
                                            C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
     architectural features provide edges or definition to the street enhances the vi-
     tality and feeling of safety and security in urbanized areas. Edges are particu-
     larly important in areas with high pedestrian traffic, such as a downtown. As a
     whole, cities are defined by their edges. Edge conditions can be “hard,” where
     there is an abrupt or clearly defined transition between urban and rural areas,
     or “soft,” where the transition between urban and rural is more gradual or
     smooth.
  ♦ Development on Corners. On parcels located at roadway intersections, de-
     velopment should be built at the outside corners in order to enclose the space
     and provide greater definition to the intersection, particularly for pedestrians.
     Ensuring that buildings are designed to occupy the corners of parcels at street
     intersections will enhance the visual quality and the safety of the pedestrian
     environment.
  ♦ Pedestrian Orientation. Designing places that are pedestrian-oriented rather
     than automobile-oriented often creates a stronger sense of place, because it
     encourages people to use public spaces. Pedestrian orientation involves
     providing good physical connections between destinations, a mix of uses
     where possible, and a safe walking environment. In terms of building design,
     pedestrian orientation can be achieved by orienting buildings to the street and
     providing pedestrian amenities such as awnings, benches, and attractive street
     lighting.
  ♦ Visual Landmarks and Gateways. Visual landmark or gateways are physical
     elements by which people orient themselves and can help create a unique iden-
     tity for an area. Examples of visual landmarks include statues, major works of
     public art, historic buildings, water towers, significant landscaping or land
     forms, and other easily identifiable features. Gateway design treatments can
     include fountains, attractive signage, or natural features such as rows of trees.
4. Livable Street Design
A key goal of the Community Design and Circulation Elements of this General
Plan is to maintain the quality and character of Oroville’s streets and to preserve
the safety of schoolchildren, pedestrians, and cyclists along those streets, while also
allowing for efficient movement of commuters and trucks.
Most streets can be designed or improved to provide sidewalks, bicycle facilities,
street trees, and on-street parking while continuing to allow adequate traffic flow.
                                                                                    4-5

B. Existing Community Design and Character
This section provides an overview of the existing community design and character
of Oroville’s various neighborhoods, districts, corridors, and preserves. By examin-
ing the built environment in Oroville’s SOI, one can understand the ways in which
the City has developed and the opportunities that are present to guide future devel-
opment. This understanding will help direct future improvements to the City’s
character and built form. For the purposes of this analysis, the City has been divid-
ed into a series of geographic areas. They have been classified into four categories
based on the nature of the development and use in each area. These areas, illus-
trated in Figure CD-1, include Neighborhoods, Districts, Corridors, and Preserves.
1. Communitywide Design
In Oroville, as in many other American cities, conventional zoning codes and high
dependence on the automobile, particularly since World War II, have contributed
to urban development that lacks a connection to the city’s history and natural char-
acter. The manner in which streets and buildings have been designed and devel-
oped greatly affects the image that people will have of their city.
By examining the built environment in Oroville’s Planning Area, one can under-
stand the ways in which the City has developed and the opportunities that are pre-
sent to guide future development. This understanding will help direct future im-
provements to the City’s character and built form.
2. Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods are generally defined as those areas where residential land uses
predominate. Each neighborhood contributes to Oroville’s unique urban form.
The sections below describe Oroville’s individual neighborhoods.
a. Thermalito
Most parts of the Thermalito Neighborhood have a rural character, with post-
World War II ranch houses built on large, deep lots. Additionally, the neighbor-
hood contains pockets of more recent single-family development, which typically
have a very different, more suburban character. Streets outside of these more re-
cently-built areas typically have drainage ditches and gravel strips in place of side-
walks, curbs, and gutters.

b. Table Mountain
The Table Mountain Neighborhood is generally a modern, suburban area, built in
the decades following World War II. The areas around Table Mountain Boulevard,
which crosses the neighborhood, have seen a great deal of infill development in
recent years, comprised primarily of single-family homes. Recent development has
also included apartment buildings.
c. Western Pacific
Although the Western Pacific Neighborhood was subdivided with small residential
lots and connected by a grid of streets, this pattern of development is not well suit-
ed to the neighborhood’s rolling topography and craggy outcrops. As a result,
many lots in this neighborhood remain undeveloped and densely forested. Manu-
factured and mobile homes comprise much of the existing development. Most of
the planned streets do not exist, and those that do are generally unpaved.
d. Kelly Ridge
The Kelly Ridge Neighborhood’s hillside location near the Oroville Dam provides
views of both Historic Downtown Oroville and Lake Oroville. This suburban en-
clave is a mixture of post-World War II housing types, predominantly ranch homes
with large parking bays for automobiles and boating vessels.
e. Hammon
The Hammon Neighborhood has an eclectic mixture of housing styles compared
with other neighborhoods in Oroville. In particular, houses on Hammon Avenue
use a variety of materials and recall many different architectural periods. Hammon
Avenue is unusually narrow for a residential street in Oroville, yet it accommodates
parking on both sides of the street, along with sidewalks and a few small street
trees. Other parts of the Hammon Neighborhood have more typically suburban
housing styles and street patterns.
f. Canyon Highlands
The Canyon Highlands Neighborhood is composed primarily of large, suburban
homes, along with a few houses built in more ornate architectural styles. This
neighborhood’s street layout and site planning are typically oriented towards the
views created by the neighborhood’s hillside location.
g. Historic Downtown
This Historic Downtown is a combination of distinct residential and business areas
that have served the needs of Oroville’s residents’ since the City’s founding. The
                                                                                    4-9

C I T Y   O F   O R O V I L L E

C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
areas labeled N7 and D1, as identified in Figure CD-1, depict the geographic area
that is generally considered the Historic Downtown.
The residential neighborhood portion of the Historic Downtown is built on a grid
of streets, like many other American cities that were founded in the 1800s. Most of
the neighborhood’s one- and two-story houses were built before World War II.
Many streets have closely-planted street trees that provide shade for streets and
sidewalks. The street configuration typically includes one lane of traffic and park-
ing in each direction, providing space for residents to park their vehicles. The de-
sign of the homes has historically included front porches and other architectural
features that emphasize a human-scale, although those types of details are not as
evident in recent construction. This neighborhood is bordered by the Feather Riv-
er along its northern edge. Although the river’s flood-control levees separate the
neighborhood from the river, implementation of the City’s Riverfront Master Plan
could improve connections across the levee.
h. South Oroville
The South Oroville Neighborhood’s streets form a grid pattern, similar to streets in
the Historic Downtown neighborhood. This neighborhood has a discontinuous
network of sidewalks, with sidewalk sections replaced by drainage ditches or gravel-
covered areas along many streets. There are few street trees and other plants with-
in the public right-of-way. Most houses are small, single-story buildings, often
manufactured homes. Myers Street provides space for some neighborhood-serving
retail businesses, such as small convenience stores, as well as less neighborhood-
oriented uses, such as shops selling tires and other automobile parts. Myers Street
is also the location of the El Medio Fire Protection District’s fire station.
i. Foothills
The Foothills Neighborhood is a predominantly rural area, with large, deep lots set
among the oak woodlands. There are some pockets of newer, larger, and more
suburban houses, along with a senior apartment complex, dispersed throughout its
curvilinear network of streets.
j. Oakvale
The Oakvale Neighborhood is a hilly area with a sparse network of streets, separat-
ed by large stands of oak woodlands. Many of the neighborhood’s single-family
homes have dense vegetation in their front yards, creating an impression that al-
most none of the neighborhood has been developed. Homes are generally built on
large, deep lots, and the neighborhood’s streets rarely have sidewalks or street trees.

k. Oro Bangor
The Oro Bangor Neighborhood is a largely rural area to the southeast of the South
Oroville Neighborhood. The area is sparsely developed with single-family homes
on large, deep lots, and streets typically lack sidewalks and landscaping. Some
homeowners take advantage of their large yards by keeping horses and other live-
stock on their properties.
l. Las Plumas
The Las Plumas Neighborhood is a mix of post-World War II suburban clusters
dispersed among large, undeveloped lots, some of which were once orchards, in a
generally flat plain below the foothills. These clusters are developed largely with
1960s and 1970s ranch homes, with garages and wide driveways that dominate their
facades.
3. Districts
A district contains—or has the potential to provide—a mix of land uses with a
greater percentage of retail, office and job-generating land uses than is generally
found in a conventional suburban neighborhood. The sections below describe
Oroville’s individual districts:
a. Historic Downtown Business District
The Historic Downtown Business District is Oroville’s historic center. It includes
civic buildings such as the Municipal Auditorium, City Hall and a branch of the
County library. The district’s streets are often planted with street trees, and
bulbouts at corners provide additional greenery and benches where people can sit.
Although parts of this district are listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
the district’s character changes towards the south and east, shifting to newer archi-
tectural styles and more auto-oriented patterns of development.
Trails and overlooks provide access to the Feather River at the district’s northern
edge. The Riverfront Master Plan proposes additional enhancements to this dis-
trict’s connection with the river.
b. South Oroville Industrial District
The South Oroville Industrial District, located south of Highway 162 and east of
Highway 70, includes a variety of industrial businesses, ranging from machine rent-
al businesses to large metalworking shops. The district also includes commercial
businesses that are unrelated to industrial uses, such as the Feather River Cinemas,
along with several historic cemeteries. Much of the district is undeveloped, with
large, vacant lots that are not served by utility connections or public streets. On the
                                                                                   4-11

eastern edge of the district, there are several spurs from the Union Pacific rail line
that serve industrial businesses.
c. Oroville Municipal Airport District
The Oroville Municipal Airport District is located along Highway 162, west of
Thermalito. This district encompasses the airport as well as the Airport Business
Park, a cluster of light industrial and office buildings. While the Airport Business
Park includes several attractively-landscaped buildings that are occupied by thriving
businesses, it also has several vacant buildings and undeveloped parcels.
4. Corridors
Corridors are linear districts in that they contain—or have the potential to pro-
vide—a mix of land uses to a greater degree than a neighborhood, but the focus of
their development pattern is linear. Corridors are usually distributed along a signif-
icant street or transit line. The sections below describe Oroville’s individual corri-
dors:
a. Oroville Dam Boulevard and Olive Highway Corridor
The Oroville Dam Boulevard and Olive Highway Corridor forms the main east-
west connection through the Planning Area. It consists of automobile-oriented,
“strip” retail development along the portions of Highway 162 between Highway 70
and Foothill Boulevard; much of Oroville’s commercial land supply is concentrated
along this corridor.
b. Feather River Boulevard North Corridor
The Feather River Boulevard North Corridor, located between Montgomery Street
and Oroville Dam Boulevard, parallels Highway 70 and is generally more intensely
developed than other parts of Feather River Boulevard. The shopping centers
along the corridor include large, deep lots with large parking areas and a number of
vacant or underutilized storefronts and buildings. There is also a concentration of
motel buildings along this corridor.
c. Feather River Boulevard South Corridor
The Feather River Boulevard South Corridor is located between the Georgia Pacif-
ic exit from Highway 70 and Oroville Dam Boulevard. Lots along this corridor are
relatively small, and development is more sparse here than along the Feather River
Boulevard North Corridor. Although the Feather River Cinemas are located along
this corridor, most of the existing businesses are light industrial uses, such as mini-
storage facilities and equipment rental. Most parts of this corridor lack sidewalks,
but there are large, mature street trees in several places along the street.

tomobile-oriented businesses, as well as some vacant commercial sites. The corri-
dor also includes newly-constructed multi-family residential buildings and single-
family homes. In addition, a county building housing the Department of Employ-
ment and Social Services is located along the corridor near East Grand Avenue.
There are few streetscape improvements along the corridor.
5. Preserves
Preserves are single-use areas that are not likely to change in form, character or use
in the near future. By the nature of their existing land use, preserves have little or
no chance of providing a mix of land uses or access via circulation or transporta-
tion networks. The sections below describe Oroville’s individual preserves:
a. Oroville Dam Area
This area includes the steeply-sloped hillsides around the dam. This area could
provide passive open space recreation opportunities for Oroville residents.
b. Feather River Waterfront
The Feather River waterfront is located between Highway 70 and the Feather Riv-
er, and it includes Riverbend Park, which is managed by the Feather River Recrea-
tion and Park District. The Feather River Waterfront area contains other active
and passive recreation opportunities, including the multi-use Brad Freeman Trail
that follows the river.
c. Oroville Wildlife Refuge
The refuge begins at Highway 162, between the Feather River to the west and the
Oroville Municipal Airport and Thermalito Afterbay to the east, continuing south
to the Planning Area boundary. Mine tailings from Oroville’s past fill much of the
Wildlife Refuge. The Clay Pits State Vehicle Recreation Area, which is managed by
the California Department of Parks and Recreation, is located in this area.
d. North and South Thermalito Forebay
The North and South Thermalito Forebay receive water diverted from Lake
Oroville as part of the State Water Project, one of the largest water and power sys-
tems in the world. North Thermalito Forebay offers recreation opportunities in-
cluding swimming, boating and picnicking. South Thermalito Forebay also pro-
vides recreational opportunities including boating and fishing. Flat rice fields and
grazing land surround the forebays.
                                                                                  4-13

e. Thermalito Afterbay
Thermalito Afterbay also receives water diverted from Lake Oroville as part of the
State Water Project. The Afterbay has approximately 43,000 surface acres of water
and includes opportunities for boating, swimming and fishing. The afterbay is ad-
jacent to the Oroville Wildlife Area and the Feather River Fish Hatchery Annex.
These five preserves are identified in this Community Design Element because of
their unique qualities and character. Both individually and collectively these pre-
serves are key components that help to distinguish and define Oroville’s urban
form. Since these preserves are located on lands not intended for urban develop-
ment, the Goals, Policies, or Actions related to these preserves can be found
throughout the Open Space, Natural Resources and Conservation Element in this
General Plan.
C. Goals, Polices, and Actions
The Community Design Element’s framework of goals, policies, and actions ad-
dress Oroville built environment and character through architecture; building de-
sign, and siting; landscaping and streetscaping; and gateways and landmarks.
1.   Communitywide
Goal CD-1            As the community grows, maintain a coherent and
                     distinctive physical form and structure that reflects
                     Oroville’s unique qualities.
            Policies
            P1.1     Require quality architectural and landscaping design as well as
                     durable and efficient materials for all projects.
            P1.2     Maintain a compact growth pattern that allows a mix of uses,
                     high connectivity, and a range of housing types for the subse-
                     quent development of the community. Locate new development
                     proposals in locations that have support infrastructure currently
                     in place and suitable serviceability.

       P1.3     Require compliance with the City of Oroville Design Guidelines
                as part of any project approval process.
       P1.4     Preserve the architectural details and design elements of historic
                structures during building renovations and remodels.
       P1.5     Work with Butte County to focus new countywide development
                into the City of Oroville, in order to foster more compact pat-
                terns of growth consistent with this General Plan and smart
                growth concepts.
       P1.6     Encourage the State and County to incorporate human-scale,
                pedestrian-oriented design and native landscaping for their
                building facilities where appropriate and along the urban inter-
                face.
Goal CD-2       Maintain and enhance the quality of Oroville’s land-
                scape, streetscape and gateways.
        Policies
       P2.1     Encourage livable street design standards for new roadway de-
                velopment and for improvements or rehabilitation of existing
                roadways. Livable Street Design Standards for Arterials, Com-
                mercial Collectors, Residential Collectors and Local Streets are il-
                lustrated in Figure CD-2 and Figure CD-3.
       P2.2     Encourage private landowners to install screen type landscaping
                on private properties adjacent to Highway 70 which are not in-
                cluded within the State Highway 70 Landscaping Project, in or-
                der to create a continuous and unified landscaped corridor along
                Highway 70.
       P2.3     Encourage imaginative design concepts in woodland areas to
                perpetuate and preserve native trees.
                                                                               4-15

           P2.4    Use appropriate landscaping to reduce the effects of surface
                   runoff in developing areas, with an emphasis on native and
                   drought-resistant species, minimization of impervious surfaces,
                   and provisions for recharge.
           P2.5    Continue to support and maintain Oroville’s involvement and
                   commitment to the Tree City USA® program.
           P2.6    Encourage the planting of trees and other landscape features
                   along Oroville’s corridors to make them interesting, appealing,
                   and inviting.
           P2.7    The existing canopy of street trees and landscaping along major
                   streets shall be extended as the City grows, as a means to en-
                   hance the visual character, human scale, and pedestrian orienta-
                   tion of special and important streets within Oroville.
           P2.8    An existing street tree removed for any reason shall be replaced
                   with an appropriate species of tree from the list maintained by
                   the Parks and Trees Department no later than the end of the
                   next planting season, provided it is so directed by the Director of
                   the Department of Parks and Trees.
           P2.9    The street tree maintenance program will maintain the health of
                   trees through regular maintenance in order to maintain the cli-
                   mate change benefits of the canopy.
           P2.10 Parking lots intended for automobiles and small trucks with six
                   spaces or more shall include shade trees. Trees shall be evenly
                   distributed throughout parking areas and provide at least 50 per-
                   cent shading of the paved surface by tree canopy within 15 years.
           P2.11 New development shall provide evenly spaced street trees plant-
                   ed between the curb and the adjacent sidewalk in park strips.
                   Street trees shall be species that will provide a canopy of shade
                   over the public right-of-way when the trees reach maturity, and
                   the species of trees planted on a given street shall be consistent.
                   In developed areas with an existing and prevailing species of
                   street trees, new street trees shall be consistent with the prevail-
                   ing species.

P2.12 Require non-residential development to provide landscaping on
       portions of the property along public right-of-ways that are not
       occupied by structures or used for pedestrian circulation or vehi-
       cle parking and circulation.
P2.13 New four-lane arterials shall include a median with both land-
       scaping and trees.
P2.14 New development along or adjacent to the major gateway loca-
       tions to the City shall contribute towards the establishment of
       distinctive gateway entrances and landmarks, each with a unified
       design concept that includes a combination of features such as
       landscaping, monuments, and signing.
P2.15 Encourage the development and installation of unique gateway
       features and landmarks for distinct neighborhoods, districts, and
       corridors in order to make them more easily identifiable, provide
       better city orientation, and contribute to developing a sense of
       place.
Actions
A2.1   Install appropriate landscaping along major arterials throughout
       the City; specifically, Oroville Dam Boulevard, Feather River
       Boulevard, Lincoln Boulevard, Grand Avenue, and Nelson Ave-
       nue.
A2.2   Conduct a study to explore the possibility of enhancing power
       transmission corridors with plantings, bicycle and pedestrian
       corridors, revenue producing crops, or off-street parking.
A2.3   Conduct a study to explore the potential for under-grounding
       powerlines.
A2.4   Establish a tree planting program that will work with neighbor-
       hood residents to plant street trees on existing neighborhood
       blocks that do not have street trees or are missing street trees.
                                                                      4-19

2.   Neighborhoods
Goal CD-3          Preserve and enhance the existing character of
                   Oroville’s established residential neighborhoods.
           Policies
           P3.1    Encourage housing and accommodations on both sides of
                   Feather River adjoining the Historic Downtown. Strive to pro-
                   vide parks and attractions for the river bank area of the Table
                   Mountain neighborhood.
           P3.2    Preserve the vital qualities of existing, stable residential neigh-
                   borhoods, including a human scale, pedestrian orientation, ample
                   landscaping and trees, attractive architecture, and materials that
                   complement the historic character of existing buildings.
           P3.3    Continue to preserve and enhance the character of existing rural
                   residential neighborhoods, consistent with their land use desig-
                   nation, by limiting development projects that would increase
                   density to a point where the physical and visual character of the
                   neighborhood would be adversely affected.
           P3.4    New development in existing residential neighborhoods shall re-
                   flect the existing scale and character of the neighborhood and
                   shall be compatible in design.
           P3.5    Encourage the maintenance of private property within the City’s
                   existing neighborhoods.
           P3.6    Renovations of and additions to existing structures shall result in
                   a design that is compatible with surrounding development within
                   a residential neighborhood.
           P3.7    Maintain the streets, sidewalks, and street trees within existing
                   neighborhoods, repairing streets and sidewalks, and replacing
                   trees as needed.

        Actions
       A3.1     Complete a study of Ruddy Creek as an attractive and accessible
                natural feature in Thermalito, including the feasibility of recrea-
                tional and scenic uses along the creek.
       A3.2     Develop and implement Neighborhood Improvement Plans in
                order to provide targeted improvements for specific neighbor-
                hoods and create better transitions between distinct neighbor-
                hood areas within the City of Oroville.
Goal CD-4       Create new residential neighborhoods that preserve
                and enhance the existing community character and
                fabric of Oroville, create a sense of place, provide a
                high quality living environment, and emphasize pe-
                destrian access.
        Policies
       P4.1     Require new development to result in well-defined residential
                neighborhoods that offer neighborhood-serving retail uses,
                schools and parks, a highly connected network of streets, homes
                that emphasize the front door more than the garage, and a wide
                range of housing types.
       P4.2     New residential development shall reflect the human scale and
                pedestrian-oriented character of existing neighborhoods in
                Oroville.
       P4.3     Each neighborhood should have at least one clear focal point,
                such as a park, school, or other open space or community facili-
                ty. Focal points shall have ample public spaces, and shall be
                within ¼-mile from any point in a neighborhood.
       P4.4     New neighborhoods shall be designed to maximize direct pedes-
                trian, bicycle, and vehicular connections both within the neigh-
                borhood and to surrounding neighborhoods. Using Oroville’s
                existing grid system as a model, new neighborhoods shall be de-
                signed on a traditional or curvilinear grid. In most instances,
                                                                               4-21

                   block lengths should be short, typically no more than 400 feet,
                   to create a fine-grained street pattern that allows for multiple
                   routes through a neighborhood and encourages walking. Cul-
                   de-sacs may be used within the grid if through bicycle, pedestri-
                   an and emergency vehicular access is provided at the end of the
                   cul-de-sac.
           P4.5    Garage doors shall not dominate the street facing facades of res-
                   idential buildings. Garages for new single-family houses, du-
                   plexes, and townhouses should be subordinate in visual im-
                   portance to the living area and front entryways. A number of
                   different design strategies can achieve consistency with this poli-
                   cy, including locating garages towards the back of properties,
                   constructing alleys, and placing the garages along the alleys, lim-
                   iting the width of garages to two car spaces, building garages as
                   separate structures from the house, requiring garages to be set
                   back from the front façade of the house, building garages under-
                   neath the structure, and orientating garage doors at 90 degrees to
                   the street.
           P4.6    A variety of architectural styles shall be provided within each
                   neighborhood. Within each neighborhood block, the exterior
                   design of residential buildings shall be varied to provide visual
                   interest to the streetscape.
           P4.7    Buildings shall include appropriate, consistent details and design
                   treatments on all sides of the building and not just on the sides
                   that face a street.
           P4.8    Buildings located at corners shall be designed to address the cor-
                   ner, with porches and main entryways oriented towards the cor-
                   ner or located on the portion of the structure adjacent to the
                   corner.
3.   Districts
Goal CD-5          Establish the Historic Downtown Business District as
                   the “Heart of the City” focusing on its unique histor-
                   ic, civic, cultural, and natural amenities.

4. Corridors
Goal CD-7        Develop Oroville’s major corridors as attractive loca-
                 tions with a diverse mix of land uses and development
                 patterns that include high quality pedestrian-oriented
                 design.
         Policies
        P7.1     Encourage upper floor residential uses in multi-story buildings
                 along Oroville’s major corridors.
        P7.2     New commercial development along Oroville’s major corridors
                 shall include building frontages with human-scale design ele-
                 ments, varied and articulated facades, and entries oriented to
                 public sidewalks or pedestrian pathways. Building facades locat-
                 ed along pedestrian pathways and public rights-of-way shall also
                 have window openings and shall not consist of solid blank walls.
         P7.3    Ensure that sound attenuating and screening features located
                 along Oroville Dam Boulevard, Feather River Boulevard, 20th
                 Street, Table Mountain Boulevard, Lincoln Boulevard, and
                 Grand and Nelson Avenues are appropriately designed and
                 make a positive visual contribution to these corridors.
        P7.4     Surface parking lots along Oroville’s major corridors shall be
                 minimized by requiring buildings to be located adjacent and par-
                 allel to property lines abutting public rights of way. Ample land-
                 scaping and low walls should be provided to create a buffer be-
                 tween off-street parking and circulation areas and the adjacent
                 public sidewalk.
         Actions
         A7.1    Develop a program to work with property and existing business
                  owners along corridors to improve the appearance and mainte-
                  nance of those properties that do not contribute to an attractive
                  appearance or pedestrian-oriented design.
                                                                                 4-25

                   Oroville’s major corridors to ensure facades and landscape fea-
                   tures complement and enhance the character of the corridor.
5. Preserves
As noted in Section B of this Element, the preserves are located on lands not in-
tended for urban development. The Goals, Policies, or Actions related to these
preserves can be found throughout the Open Space, Natural Resources, and Con-
servation Element in this General Plan.

5 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  Note: This is a new chapter for the General Plan Update. Because the entirety of
  the chapter is new, changes are not tracked. In addition, some of the policies and
  actions in this Element were previously contained in the Land Use Element; in
  those cases, the existing policy/action number is provided in parentheses following
  the policy/action text. Other new policies and actions are based on the 2014 Eco-
  nomic Development Strategy; in such cases “2014 Economic Development Strate-
  gy” is noted in parentheses following the policy/action text.
  The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to provide a long-term vision for the growth
  and development of the local economy that is supported by goals that carry this vision into specific
  topic areas. These goals and the corresponding policies and actions will guide the City’s economic
  development efforts.
  Oroville enjoys a multifaceted economy that includes a charming downtown along
  the Feather River in the northern section of the city, strong commercial corridors
  in the central portion of the city and leading out to Lake Oroville, a wealth of in-
  dustrial and vacant land in the southern end of the city, and a municipal airport
  with available commercial land adjacent to the west. The Feather River, Lake
  Oroville, and nearby Sierra Nevada foothills and Plumas National Forest draw rec-
  reational visitors to the region, providing robust tourism and recreation-based eco-
  nomic opportunities. In addition, the City has developed numerous economic de-
  velopment programs and projects to boost the local economy, which are described
  in this Element.
  This Economic Development Element is divided into two sections, as follows:
    ♦ Background Information: Contains baseline economic information for
        Oroville, including major economic sectors, employment data, and infor-
        mation about existing City plans and programs.
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides goals and policies that are designed to
        retain and attract large employers, maximize the city’s retail opportunities, and
        strengthen and expand the city’s industrial and employment base. Key imple-
        mentation actions are also provided, which are to be pursued during the life-
        time of the General Plan.
  A. Background Information
  The City of Oroville utilizes a variety of programs and initiatives to accommodate
  future economic growth, including an Economic Development Strategy, various
                                                                                                 5-1

economic development initiatives and programs, and focus areas for economic
growth. This section of the General Plan Economic Development Element pro-
vides baseline information about Oroville’s economy and the City’s economic de-
velopment strategies, initiatives, and programs that aim to enhance the overall qual-
ity of the local economy.
1. Economic Sectors
The most recent economic data from the US Census is from 2007. One of the key
policies and actions in this Element calls for regular updates of this baseline infor-
mation as resources are available. According to the US Census, the retail trade
business sector brings in the most revenue in Oroville; in 2007, this sector generat-
ed approximately $374 million in revenue, which was about 41 percent of total in-
dustry revenue in Oroville. Manufacturing was next at 28 percent of total revenue,
followed by health care and social assistance at 19 percent. Together these top
business sectors made up almost 90 percent of Oroville’s total business sales and
revenue. Table ED-1 and Figure ED-1 illustrate the 2007 sales and revenue data
for each business sector in Oroville.
2. Employment Trends
Similar to the sales and revenue data discussed above, the health care and social
assistance, retail trade, and manufacturing sectors employ the most people in
Oroville, together comprising about 75 percent of the total employees in the city.
Table ED-2 and Figure ED-2 illustrate the employment data for each business
sector in Oroville.
Oroville’s employment is expected to continue to grow and diversify. According to
the Center for Economic Development, 30 percent of the new jobs expected be-
tween 2008 and 2018 will be in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry.
Other leading job growth industries are wholesale trade (19 percent of expected job
growth); healthcare and social assistance (17 percent of expected job growth); and
administrative, support, waste management, and remediation services (16 percent
of expected job growth).
3. Economic Development Strategy
In 2008, the City adopted the 2014 Economic Development Strategy, which pro-
vides a framework and purpose for the City’s economic development initiatives
through 2014. Although this Strategy is intended to provide long-term economic
development policy guidance, it also recognizes that economic development needs
to be a flexible program that the City must regularly evaluate. The Strategy outlines
steps to plan, implement, check, and manage economic development activities. As

the first economic development plan adopted by the City, the Strategy examines
existing opportunities and provides a context for future initiatives and priorities for
implementation.
The Economic Development Strategy identifies three key goals for the City to
maintain economic sustainability and quality of life: 1) create new jobs, 2) increase
tourism benefits, and 3) grow the City’s General Fund. The City works to achieve
these goals using various economic development programs and resources that are
described below, as well as continued efforts to procure grant funds for investment
in infrastructure upgrades, business retention, and entrepreneurial and small busi-
ness assistance.
4. Economic Development Programs
The City has initiated and maintained numerous economic development programs
to retain existing jobs and businesses, attract new businesses to the city, support
small businesses, and revitalize the local economy. Key programs are described
below.

a. Oroville Recycling Market Development Zone
The Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ) program combines recycling
with economic development to fuel new businesses, expand existing ones, create
jobs, and divert waste from landfills. RMDZ areas are designed to attract business-
es that will convert goods from the waste stream into recycled products by provid-
ing attractive loans, technical assistance, and free product marketing to businesses
that use materials from the waste stream to manufacture their products.
As one of seven zones in the North State region, the Oroville RMDZ covers all of
the Airport Business Park, Downtown, and other commercial and industrial areas
in the city, as shown in Figure ED-3. The RMDZ is particularly successful in at-
tracting emerging green industries into the city with incentives such as expedited
permit processing, revolving loan financing, and marketing and technical assistance.

b. Historically Underutilized Business Zone
The US Small Business Administration (SBA) has mapped “Historically Underuti-
lized Business Zones” (HUBZones) throughout the country based on economic
data available from various federal agencies like the Census and Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Within HUBZones, the SBA promotes job growth, capital investment,
and economic development by providing incentives for government agencies to
purchase goods and services from certified small businesses. The program’s bene-
fits for certified companies include competitive and sole source contracting, price
evaluation preferences, and subcontracting opportunities. The federal government
has a goal of awarding 3 percent of all dollars for federal prime contracts to HUB-
Zone-certified businesses. Oroville has three different Census tracts that are locat-
ed in a HUBZones, as shown in Figure ED-3.

5. Economic Focus Areas
As part of its Economic Development Strategy, which is discussed further in Sec-
tion A.3, the City identified four geographic focus areas where specific strategies
                                                                                     5-9

E C O N O M I C D E V E L O P M E N T   E L E M E N T
are needed to achieve the City’s key economic goals. Figure ED-4 shows the loca-
tions of all four economic focus areas.
a. Downtown-Gateway
The Downtown-Gateway Focus Area consists of Oroville’s Historic Downtown;
the Montgomery Street corridor, which serves as the primary gateway entry into
Downtown from Highway 70; and the riverfront area. Because the revitalization of
Oroville’s historic core relies heavily on the successful redevelopment of this focus
area, the City has identified strategic sites to attract private investment for hotel,
retail, and mixed-use development.
Keys to achieving economic development success in the Downtown-Gateway Fo-
cus Area include the following:
  ♦ Exploring ways to attract more visitors and residents to the Historic Down-
     town, which is rich in natural and historic amenities.
  ♦ Revitalizing and reusing historic structures.
  ♦ Retaining and recruiting businesses into the Downtown.
b. Airport Business Park
The Airport Business Park Focus Area contains approximately 172 acres of vacant,
developable land adjacent to the Oroville Municipal Airport. A portion of the fo-
cus area is available to leasehold interests only, as required by the Federal Aviation
Administration, but the majority of the focus area is unrestricted and available for
private acquisition and development. As this area represents some of Oroville’s
largest and most suitable land for light industrial and office uses, the City is posi-
tioning it to capture emerging industries, including green businesses, and is working
closely with other economic development partners to locate suitable uses here.
c. Industrial
The Industrial Focus Area constitutes the city’s primary manufacturing, wholesale
and business-to-business node. The opportunities for this focus area include va-
cant infill sites, brownfields, and City-owned properties. The Industrial Focus Area
also has opportunities to leverage the numerous business development and expan-
sion incentives to attract growing industries in the city, including wholesale trade
and construction.

d. Commercial Core
The Commercial Core Focus Area includes regional serving and other destination
retail commercial uses along the Oro Dam Boulevard and Feather River Boulevard
corridors. The Oro Dam Boulevard corridor is the busiest commercial district in
the city, containing auto sales, large discount stores, shops, restaurants, and visitor-
serving uses. It is located along State Highway 162, which leads visitors from
Highway 70 to Lake Oroville. The Feather River Boulevard corridor is the second
busiest commercial corridor in Oroville, containing many hotels and retail frontage
and redevelopment potential.
6. Arts, Culture, and Entertainment District
As described in the Land Use Element, the City has established an Arts, Culture,
and Entertainment Overlay, which will support the City’s efforts to revitalize
Oroville’s Historic Downtown. The City is working to establish an Arts, Culture,
and Entertainment District with the following objectives:
  ♦ Establish Oroville as a recreation and tourism destination by providing ameni-
     ties that recreational enthusiasts and tourists can enjoy.
  ♦ Plan for appropriate development of the Feather River waterfront to stimulate
     high-quality commercial, retail, and restaurant establishments.
  ♦ Re-establish the Historic Downtown as an arts, culture, entertainment, em-
     ployment, and residential center for the region by incorporating the Feather
     River.
  ♦ Establish a community gathering place for shopping, dining, museums, and live
     entertainment in a safe and vibrant atmosphere.
B. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The Economic Development Element’s framework of goals, policies, and actions
address the enhancement and diversification of Oroville’s economy; the Historic
Downtown; commercial, office, and industrial development; tourism and recrea-
tion; employment; and the City’s fiscal health.

         Development Corporation to attract employment- and revenue-
         generating uses through flexible land use and zoning considera-
         tions. (Land Use Element Policy P5.6)
P1.5     Build and strengthen partnerships with the City’s many econom-
         ic development partners, including local business associations,

6 CIRCULATION AND TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
  The Circulation Element of the Oroville General Plan is concerned with the safe and efficient
  movement of people and goods in and around the City of Oroville by means of a wide range of
  transportation modes. The Element accounts for the critical link between land use patterns and
  transportation. Therefore, it has been developed in close correlation with the Land Use Element to
  ensure that the circulation system will be adequate to serve Oroville’s existing and future land uses.
  Local conditions and development patterns dictate that automobile travel is, and
  will remain, the primary mode of transportation in Oroville. Though the Element
  strongly supports alternate modes of transportation, the reductions in traffic that
  will result from implementation of these strategies are projected to be modest. The
  Circulation Element therefore addresses, as a central focus, the provision of a
  roadway network that has adequate capacity to serve current and projected traffic
  within the City. To achieve this, a number of circulation system improvements and
  a framework for their implementation are set forth in the Element.
  The Circulation Element is a required element of the General Plan. As required by
  Section 65302(b) of the California Government Code, this Circulation Element is
  correlated with the Land Use Element, and includes information on the general
  location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation
  routes, terminals and other local transportation facilities.
  State law also requires that a Circulation Element contain data and policies related
  to the operation of water, sewage, storm drainage, and other public utilities. These
  components are not included here, and instead are incorporated in the Public Facil-
  ities Element.
  The California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358), passed in 2008, requires all Gen-
  eral Plan updates after January 1, 2011 to “plan for a balanced, multi-modal trans-
  portation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways
  for safe and convenient travel” and defines “users of streets, roads, and highways”
  to include bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, pedestrians, users
  of public transportation, and seniors. The policies and actions in this Circulation
  Element are intended to meet the requirements of Complete Streets legislation.
  The Circulation Element is divided into four sections:
    ♦ Background Information
    ♦ Roadway Classifications and Standards
    ♦ Programmed and Planned Improvements
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions
                                                                                                    6-1

A. Background Information
1. Vehicular Circulation
Oroville’s existing roadway system serves inter-city and regional travel, with local
streets primarily serving local trips and Highways 70 and 162 serving regional trav-
el. Congestion occurs on some roadways, mainly on arterials and collectors.
a. Existing Roadway System
The major routes in the Plan Area roadway system are shown in Figure CIR-1 ac-
cording to operational classification and number of travel lanes. Highways 70 and
162 are the primary transportation corridors extending through Oroville. The clas-
sifications in Figure CIR-1 indicate the operational hierarchy of the roadway sys-
tem. Highway 70 primarily serves inter-city and regional travel while the City’s
roadways serve local trips. One notable exception is Highway 162, which serves
regional travel to Highway 99 to the west and local trips to/from the commercial
uses that have developed along the corridor.
b. Roadway Capacity and Level of Service
The current Level of Service (LOS) was calculated for each roadway study segment
in the roadway system to evaluate the quality of existing traffic conditions. LOS is
a general measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade, from A
(the best) to F (the worst), is assigned. These grades represent the perspective of
drivers and are an indication of the comfort and convenience associated with driv-
ing as well as speed, travel time, traffic interruptions and freedom to maneuver.
The LOS grades are generally defined as follows:
  ♦ LOS A represents free-flow travel with an excellent level of comfort and con-
     venience and the freedom to maneuver.
  ♦ LOS B has stable operating conditions, but the presence of other road users
     causes a noticeable, though slight, reduction in comfort, convenience and ma-
     neuvering freedom.
  ♦ LOS C has stable operating conditions, but the operation of individual users is
     substantially affected by the interaction with others in the traffic stream.
  ♦ LOS D represents high-density, but stable flow. Users experience severe re-
     striction in speed and freedom to maneuver, with poor levels of comfort and
     convenience.

  ♦ LOS E represents operating conditions at or near capacity. Speeds are reduced
    to a low but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver is difficult with
    users experiencing frustration and poor comfort and convenience. Unstable
    operation is frequent, and minor disturbances in traffic flow can cause break-
    down conditions.
  ♦ LOS F is used to define forced or breakdown conditions. This condition ex-
    ists wherever the volume of traffic exceeds the capacity of the roadway. Long
    queues can form behind these bottleneck points with queued traffic traveling in
    a stop-and-go fashion.
LOS was determined by comparing existing traffic volumes for selected roadway
segments with peak-hour LOS capacity thresholds. These thresholds are shown in
Table CIR-1 and were calculated based on the methodology contained in the High-
way Capacity Manual (HCM) (Transportation Research Board, 2000). The HCM
methodology is the prevailing measurement standard used throughout the United
States.
Figure CIR-2 shows PM peak hour LOS results for the Plan Area roadways. LOS
is calculated using traffic counts from 2006, 2012, and 2013 from the City of
Oroville Transportation Capital Improvement Program (TCIP), Butte County As-
sociation of Governments (BCAG), and Caltrans. Traffic counts for State facilities
are from 2012.
The transportation analysis is based on the PM peak hour because it represents the
highest hourly volume during a typical weekday and is generally a good indication
of roadway operation. PM peak hour volumes are used to design future roadways
because of their regular weekday occurrence, which makes them a reasonable
measure for identifying the number of through travel lanes that are needed. Using
an hour with higher or lower volumes could lead to inadequate roadway designs or
designs that have excessive capacity. However, this methodology does not com-
pletely capture the operational effect (i.e. vehicle queuing and delay) of closely
spaced, signalized intersections.
Policy P2.1 of this Circulation Element sets forth the minimum operating standard
of LOS D for all arterials, collector streets, and intersections, with some exceptions.
As shown in Figure CIR-2, and based on the thresholds identified in Table CIR-1,
Olive Highway between Oroville Dam Boulevard and Foothill Boulevard is the
only segment that exceeds the LOS D threshold established in Policy P2.1 under
existing conditions. This result is consistent with field observations, which indicate
                                                                                      6-5

unacceptable operation, characterized by extensive vehicle queuing, on this east-
bound segment of Olive Highway (SR 162). The observed vehicle queues had a
relatively short duration of about 15 minutes, but had significant impacts on vehicle
progression.
2. Parking
Oroville generally has an adequate supply of parking and parking deficiency is not
an issue. All new residential and commercial developments are required to meet
the City’s parking standards, contained within the City’s Zoning Code, and provide
off-street parking spaces. Most streets within Oroville also have on-street parking.
3. Public Transit System
Public transportation in Oroville consists of the following services and facilities.
 ♦ Public bus service
 ♦ Commercial bus services
 ♦ Shuttle service
 ♦ Taxi service
 ♦ Park-and-ride facilities
BCAG operates the B-Line of the Butte Regional Transit system, which serves the
residents of Oroville and provides intercity/regional and local fixed-route services.
Oroville’s B-Line service includes four local fixed transit routes within Oroville and
three intercity/regional routes that provide commuter route service to Biggs, Chico,
and Paradise. Figure CIR-3 shows the B-Line transit routes. The B-Line fixed stop
locations have signs indicating the bus stop’s location, while the flag stop areas are
where riders may flag down a passing bus in any location provided it is safe for the
bus to stop.
Generally, the service frequency and average daily ridership on the local Oroville
transit routes is low. Table CIR-2 details the average daily boardings for bus routes
serving Oroville. The regional service between Chico and Oroville, however, is
well used with peak hour ridership near capacity. Additionally, Butte Regional
Transit provides paratransit service through B-Line Paratransit, which offers on-
demand shared ride services for seniors and persons with qualifying disabilities who
are not able to use the fixed-route service.
Commercial bus service is provided by Greyhound, which has over 3,600 service
locations within North America. Greyhound provides a limited service bus stop in
Oroville at the ARCO gas station located at 410 Oroville Dam Boulevard. Grey-

hound provides connections from Oroville to full-service stations located in the
San Francisco Bay Area and the greater Sacramento area. Commercial bus service
is also provided by Amtrak. Amtrak offers daily bus service between Medford (Or-
egon), Redding, Sacramento and Stockton. Amtrak stops at the Oroville park-and-
ride facility, which is discussed below. The Amtrak bus service provides connect-
ing train service to the San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley, and Los Ange-
les.
Commercial shuttle service is provided by North Valley Shuttle with service to Sac-
ramento International Airport. Taxi services are provided by Yellow Cab Company
of Oroville and are available on demand or by reservation.
Park-and-ride lots provide a place for commuters in single-occupant vehicles to
transfer to public transit or carpools. Oroville has one park-and-ride facility, which
is owned by Butte County, on Highway 70 at Grand Avenue. The lot, which has
30 parking spaces, is intended to encourage ridesharing by providing a safe, attrac-
tive, and convenient place to leave a personal vehicle in order to use public trans-
portation or another form of ridesharing. The park-and-ride lot is well used with
annual counts by Caltrans from 2003 and 2004 showing 80 to 90 percent occupan-
cy.
4. Bicycle System
The quality and convenience of roadways for the bicycle system varies widely in
different parts of Oroville. The western and central areas of Oroville typically have
more grid street networks that are relatively flat and better for bicycling. In
Oroville’s eastern areas, steeper terrain and windier roads make bicycling more
difficult. Figure CIR-4 shows the bikeways and unpaved multi-use recreational
trails in the Oroville area. Few areas are served by on-street bicycle facilities.
Caltrans classifies bikeways into the following three types:
  ♦ Class I – off-street bike paths.
  ♦ Class II – on-street bike lanes marked by pavement striping.
  ♦ Class III – signed on-street bike routes that share the road with motorized ve-
     hicles.
Class II bike lanes exist on Nelson Avenue and Grand Avenue (east of SR 70),
Orange Avenue (Montgomery Street to Oroville Dam Boulevard), Lincoln Boule-
vard (Wyandotte Avenue to Arnold Avenue) and Foothill Boulevard (Olive

Highway to Pinedale Avenue). A Class III bike route exists on Washington Ave-
nue (Orange Avenue to Oroville Dam Boulevard).
Off-street Class I and unpaved multi-use recreational trails are located on the
Feather River and Thermalito Afterbay. These off-street facilities are part of the
Brad Freeman Trail, which is a 40-mile loop trail.
5. Pedestrian System
There are distinct differences in the quality and convenience for users of the pedes-
trian system in different areas of Oroville. Historic Downtown Oroville (generally
north of Highway 162) and South Oroville are close to shopping and have grid
street networks with relatively short block lengths that are good for walking. How-
ever, much of South Oroville does not have sidewalks, and the streets are narrow,
with on-street parking that creates an obstacle for pedestrians. In the eastern part
of the Sphere of Influence (SOI), steeper terrain, low density development, and
increased distance from destinations make walking less convenient. Pedestrians
also have access and use Class I and multi-use recreational trails located on the
Feather River and Thermalito Afterbay.

6. Freight Delivery System
The railroad system and state highway system provide the major transportation
network for the delivery of freight in the City of Oroville. Each system is discussed
below, and illustrated on Figure CIR-5, as it relates to operation and service of
transporting freight.
a. Rail Transportation
The City of Oroville is served by the Union Pacific Railroad. Union Pacific Rail-
road serves 23 states in the western two-thirds of the United States. Transported
commodities include chemicals, coal, food and food products, truck trailers and
containers, forest products, grain and grain products, metals and minerals, and au-
tomobiles and parts.
The Feather River Corridor line runs between the Interstate 5 Corridor line and the
Overland Route and Central Corridor line in Nevada. Figure CIR-5 shows the
Union Pacific Railroad Feather River Corridor line that runs through the City of
Oroville. On average, approximately 6 to 26 trains a day travel on the Feather Riv-
er Corridor line. Most of the major railroad crossings in Oroville are grade-
separated, except for Mitchel Avenue.
b. Highway Transportation
Figure CIR-5 also shows designated truck routes in the City of Oroville. Highway
70, Highway 162 and some City roadway segments are designated truck routes.
The entire length of Highway 70 and the segment of Highway 162 between Larkin
Road and Lincoln Boulevard are included in the National Network for Service
Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA). Trucks are defined as heavy
freight vehicles that meet the STAA definitions in the California State Vehicle
Code. Segments of Highway 162 from Highway 99 to Larkin Road and Lincoln
Boulevard east are part of the California Legal Network, which limits larger trucks
allowed under the STAA network. Segments of Feather River Boulevard, 5th Ave-
nue, Lincoln Boulevard, Montgomery Street and Mitchell Avenue are designated as
local truck routes.
7. Aviation System
The Oroville Municipal Airport is located south of Highway 162 and west of Lar-
kin Road. The airport has two paved asphalt concrete runways. Runway 2/20 is
the longest runway at 6,020 feet long. There are 74 aircraft based at the airport
field. Aircraft operations average about 99 per day with 56 percent for transient

B. Roadway Classifications and Standards
Each of the roadways in Oroville’s comprehensive roadway network can be catego-
rized according to a typology known as roadway functional classification. Roadway
functional classification is a method to classify a roadway based on the type of ser-
vice it provides. Since two major functions of a roadway are to serve through traf-
fic and provide access to adjacent property, different roadways prioritize these two
functions differently. For instance, arterials generally prioritize the movement of
traffic over access to individual adjacent properties whereas local streets prioritize
access to private properties over through traffic. Roadways are also intended to
provide bicycle and pedestrian access and circulation and are the backbone of the
bicycle and pedestrian network.
The city’s conceptual roadway plan, with general functional classifications, is shown
in Figure CIR-6. The functional classifications for roadways in Oroville are de-
tailed below.
1. Freeways
Freeways are intended to carry traffic efficiently from one end of the city to the
other, serve inter-regional travel, and provide connections from Oroville to other
cities and counties. A freeway is an access-controlled facility with two or more
lanes in each direction. Freeways are designed for high speed inter-city travel.
State Highway 70 north of Oroville Dam Boulevard is considered a freeway.
2. Highways
Highways are State-designated, relatively high-speed, high-capacity routes designed
to carry heavy traffic volumes at speeds of 40 to 55 miles per hour. Highways
should serve longer distance interregional trips and link Oroville to other commu-
nities. State Highway 70 south of Oroville Dam Boulevard is a highway. Access is
limited, crossings are at grade, and parking is not allowed.
3. Arterials
Arterials are designed to move large volumes of traffic and are intended to provide
a high level of mobility between freeways/highways, other arterials, and lo-
cal/collector roadways and provide non-freeway/highway connections between
major residential, employment, and activity centers. Arterials are intended not just
                                                                                    6-17

for motor vehicle circulation but also for bicycle and pedestrian circulation and
should not be designed to facilitate motor vehicle travel at the expense of bicycle
and pedestrian circulation. As appropriate to the terrain and character of the
neighborhood, arterials shall include sidewalks of sufficient width to allow two pe-
destrians to walk side-by-side and a planting strip wide enough to accommodate
large canopy shade street trees between the sidewalk and the curb and gutter. All
arterials shall also include on-street, Class III bicycle routing, Class II bicycle lanes,
or Class I off-street bicycle paths, as shown on Figure CIR-3. In addition, arterials
may require a raised median or center turn lane for safe and efficient movement of
vehicles to and from adjacent development.
Arterials are divided into two- and four-lane facilities, as described below. Road-
ways classified as arterials on Figure CIR-6 that have both four-lane and two-lane
segments include:
 ♦ Table Mountain Boulevard                    ♦ Oroville Dam Boulevard
 ♦ Lincoln Boulevard
Two-lane roadways classified as arterials on Figure CIR-6 include:
 ♦ Nelson Avenue                                ♦ Montgomery Street
 ♦ Grand Avenue                                 ♦ Orange Avenue
 ♦ Foothill Boulevard                           ♦ Ophir Road
 ♦ Feather River Boulevard                      ♦ Oroville Dam Boulevard E
 ♦ Larkin Road                                  ♦ Highway 162
 ♦ Lower Wyandotte Road                         ♦ Washington Avenue
4. Collectors
Collectors are intended to “collect” traffic from local roadways and carry it to
roadways higher in the street classification hierarchy such as arterials, highways, and
freeways. These roadways also serve adjacent properties. Collectors typically have
one lane of traffic in each direction. Roadways that are listed as both Arterials,
above, and Collectors have different segments that meet the criteria for both classi-
fications. Roadways classified as collectors on Figure CIR-6 include:

5. Local Streets
Local streets are intended to serve adjacent properties only and should enhance
community livability. They carry very little, if any, through traffic, and generally
carry very low traffic volumes, usually less than 5,000 vehicles per day. Speed limits
on local roadways normally do not exceed 25 miles per hour. Figure CIR-6 does
not show local streets.
C. Programmed and Planned Improvements
This section describes the programmed and planned roadway system, public transit,
bicycle network, and freight delivery system improvements.
1. Roadway System Improvements
a. Metropolitan Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Projects
In December 2012, BCAG adopted the Butte County Metropolitan Transportation
Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy (MTP/SCS). The MTP/SCS is an in-
tegrated transportation and land use plan to implement provisions of California’s
Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) for passenger vehicle greenhouse gas re-
ductions. The MTP/SCS includes funding for the SR 70 Passing Lane Project.
Implementation will occur in three phases with the first phase programmed to
begin in 2016 and the final phase programmed to begin in 2030. Phase 1 will con-
struct a five-lane facility (i.e. two travel lanes in each direction with a center turn
lane) between Ophir Road to just south of Palermo Road. Phases 2 and 3 of this
                                                                                      6-21

project will add passing lanes to SR 70 from the terminus of Phase 1 to Yolo Coun-
ty. No other capacity-increasing projects are programmed in the MTP/SCS in
Oroville.
b. Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program
The MTP/SCS identifies funding for and describes three Congestion Mitigation
and Air Quality (CMAQ) projects in Oroville: the Oroville Park and Ride Project,
Table Mountain/Nelson Avenue Roundabout, and SR 162 Signalization Synchro-
nization Project. The federal government funds CMAQ projects that improve air
quality or decrease congestion. These projects are described below:
 ♦ The Oroville Park and Ride Project will construct a park-n-ride facility on
     Montgomery Street just west of Table Mountain Boulevard that will include a
     transit bus shelter, bike racks, and other amenities.
 ♦ The Table Mountain/Nelson Avenue Roundabout will construct a roundabout
     at the existing 2-way stop controlled intersection.
 ♦ SR 162 Signalization Synchronization Project will coordinate traffic signals
     along Mitchell Avenue, Myers Street, and Washington Avenue. The project
     will include intersection controller updates, vehicle detection, and emergency
     signal preemption.
c. Federal Transportation Improvement Program
The Federal Transportation Improvement Program (FTIP) is a programming doc-
ument that identifies all regionally significant transportation projects and programs
for Butte County that will be funded by federal, State, and local funding sources
within the short-term horizon. BCAG is responsible for preparing, adopting, and
submitting the FTIP. Projects identified in the FTIP include those for:
 ♦ Streets and roads
 ♦ Highways
 ♦ Transit
 ♦ Safety
 ♦ Bridge reconstruction
 ♦ Enhancements
 ♦ Other programs that receive federal dollars or require some type of federal ap-
     proval
The City of Oroville has one project in the 2015 Butte County FTIP (Project
HSIP5-03-009), which is for the installation of a traffic signal at the Oroville Dam
Boulevard/Orange Avenue/Acacia Avenue intersection.

d. City of Oroville Transportation Capital Improvement Program (TCIP)
The City of Oroville Transportation Capital Improvement Program (TCIP), which
was adopted in December 2012, includes numerous transportation improvements
for City-maintained roadways, including upgrading existing City roadways to full
cross-sections with center turn lanes, bike lanes, sidewalks, and landscaping. The
TCIP identifies and will fund a capacity-increasing project to widen Table Moun-
tain Boulevard between Nelson Avenue/Cherokee Road and Montgomery Street
from two to four lanes.
Appendix A includes all of the intersection, roadway, and bicycle facility improve-
ments included in the TCIP. Many of the improvements in the TCIP will improve
operations of the City transportation system and mobility for all users without
roadway widening. The associated City of Oroville TCIP fee schedule will fund
$75.1 million in improvements by establishing impact fees for new residential, re-
sort and tourism, industrial, institutional, office, and commercial development.
e. Unfunded Projects
The TCIP also identifies the need to widen Olive Highway (SR 162) between
Oroville Dam Boulevard and Foothill Boulevard from two to four lanes and up-
grade Olive Highway between Foothill Boulevard and Miners Ranch Road to a
major two-lane arterial standard. However, the TCIP will not provide funding for
these improvements, since they are State facilities.
The MTP/SCS identifies a long-term future strategy to work with Caltrans to com-
plete a Project Study Report to widen SR 162 from Oroville Dam Boulevard to
Foothill Boulevard to four lanes. This strategy and corresponding improvements
are not funded.
The MTP/SCS also identifies several local street and road projects in Oroville as
unfunded regional priorities beyond financial constraints. These projects include
the SR 70/Ophir Road Interchange Project and the SR 70 Georgia Pacific Inter-
change. The projects would replace the existing at-grade intersections with grade
separated interchanges. These projects cannot be funded based on anticipated rev-
enue over the term of the MTP/SCS.
2. Public Transit System Improvements
Opportunities for improved regional transit service to Oroville should be encour-
aged through the development of new park-n-ride lots located to serve proposed
specific plan areas. A new park-n-ride lot is planned and funded in the MTP/SCS
to be located on Montgomery Street, west of Table Mountain Boulevard.
                                                                                      6-23

3. Bicycle Network Improvements
The City’s 2010 Bike Plan is shown in Figure CIR-7. The 2010 Bike Plan shows
existing and planned Class I, II, and III bicycle facilities and existing multi-use
trails.
In addition to Class I, II, and III facilities, Figure CIR-7 also identifies locations for
potential trail/path connections where these facilities meet.
4. Freight Delivery System Improvements
Figure CIR-8 shows existing goods movement and aviation facilities and areas
where new local truck routes should be provided. Oroville is well served by exist-
ing truck routes and rail facilities. However, the area south of Oroville Dam
Boulevard/east of Highway 70 that is designated for retail, business service, and
industrial land uses and the employment land uses around the airport do not have
local truck route designations. These locations are identified as potential areas for
local truck routes.
D. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The Circulation and Transportation Element’s comprehensive framework of goals,
policies and actions address Oroville’s need for Intergovernmental Coordination
and Communication; Roadways; Transit and Ridesharing; Parking; Bicycles and
Pedestrians; and Oroville Municipal Airport.
1.    Intergovernmental Coordination and Communication
Goal CIR-1           Promote intergovernmental communication and co-
                     operation          concerning            transportation-related
                     issues.
             Policies
             P1.1    Coordinate with the efforts of Butte County and the State of
                     California Department of Transportation to:
                      ♦ Achieve the General Plan’s roadway classification system and
                        street network within the Oroville City Limit and Sphere of

             Actions
             A2.1 Develop a roadway improvement program to identify the timing
                     of freeway, roadway, and intersection improvements based on
                     market-level development projections to implement the General
                     Plan roadway plan.
             A2.2 Periodically review the availability of federal and State funding
                     sources and pursue those sources aggressively in support of the
                     roadway improvement program process and alternative transpor-
                     tation projects.
             A2.3 Establish and maintain a master list of the most recent available
                     traffic counts. The master list shall be updated with traffic
                     counts taken in conjunction with project traffic studies and spe-
                     cial counts conducted by the City.

                     (MMLOS) standards by the Transportation Research Board,
                     other agencies, and jurisdictions. When a valid methodology for
                     Oroville is identified, develop and adopt Transportation Impact
                     Analysis (TIA) guidelines that include MMLOS standards specif-
                     ic to Oroville. The MMLOS standards will apply to City-
                     maintained roadways and will allow for flexibility as necessary to
                     recognize site-specific constraints, such as protecting sensitive
                     resources or ensuring pedestrian and bicycle safety.

Goal CIR-3      Promote the strategic development of new roadways
                that benefit and enhance the existing roadway net-
                work and improve access and mobility for all modes.
        Policies
        P3.1   Widths for new streets shall be limited to the minimum width
               necessary to adequately carry the volume of anticipated traffic
               and meet the City’s LOS Policy of D, while allowing for adequate
               bicycle and pedestrian facilities, emergency access, and large ve-
               hicle access.
        P3.2   Prohibit development of private streets in new residential pro-
               jects, unless emergency access standards, maintenance agree-
               ments, and design standards are met to the satisfaction of the
               City Engineer and there are compelling circumstances that pro-
               hibit the streets from being designed to meet public standards.
        P3.3   New development shall ensure that safe and efficient emergency
               vehicle access is provided.
        P3.4   Ensure, through a combination of traffic impact fees and other
               funding mechanisms, that new development pays its fair share of
               the costs of circulation improvements.
        P3.5   Provide transportation facilities based on a “Complete Streets”
               set of criteria that facilitates the balanced use of all travel modes
               (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit users) meeting the
               transportation needs of all ages and abilities and providing mobil-
               ity for a variety of trip purposes.

              A3.1 Conduct a study to develop strategies to improve the efficiency
                     of traffic flow along Oroville Dam Boulevard. Improvement
                     options could include the following:
                      ♦ A new east-west arterial (north or south of Oroville Dam
                          Boulevard).
                      ♦ A bypass between Feather River Boulevard and Olive High-
                          way,
                      ♦ ITS strategies to enhance/maximize existing roadway capaci-
                          ty.
             A3.2 Establish review procedures to ensure that access standards on
                     arterial and collector streets are maintained as development pro-
                     ceeds.
             A3.3 Periodically maintain and update the City’s Transportation Capi-
                     tal Improvement Program.
             A3.4 Coordinate with BCAG and Caltrans to study alternatives to
                     Highway 162 for access to Lake Oroville. An alternative routing
                     could include Ophir Road, Lower Wyandotte Road and Miners
                     Ranch Road to the intersection of Highway 162 and Kelly Ridge
                     Road. The study should consider funding and other economic
                     considerations.
              A3.5 Update the City’s Engineering and Street Design Standards to
                     ensure that roadway and streetscape design specification are in
                     accordance with the Complete Streets concept described in Poli-

         Policies
         P4.1   Wherever possible, avoid reductions in on-street parking as a
                means to provide additional travel lanes.
         P4.2   If future growth in traffic volumes necessitates removal of on-
                street parking places to provide additional traffic lanes, ensure, if
                feasible, that the lost on-street spaces are replaced with an equal
                number of off-street spaces within the same vicinity.
         P4.3   Require provision of adequate off-street parking in conjunction
                with all new developments outside the historic downtown.

7 OPEN SPACE, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND
  CONSERVATION ELEMENT
  The Open Space and Conservation Element of the Oroville General Plan is dedicated to preserv-
  ing and improving the quantity, quality, and character of open space in Oroville. The Element
  identifies Oroville’s important open space lands and ensures that future development will respect the
  natural and scenic qualities of those places, helping to shape the desired physical form of the com-
  munity by safeguarding open space for future generations. The Element also provides direction
  regarding the conservation, development and use of natural resources in and around Oroville, in-
  cluding mineral, agricultural and cultural resources, as well addressing water and air quality. The
  Element also addresses energy conservation and efficiency.
  State law requires that a General Plan include both an Open Space Element and a
  Conservation Element. The Oroville General Plan combines these two elements
  into a single Open Space and Conservation Element that addresses their similar
  and overlapping concerns and satisfies the legal requirements for both.
  The Government Code identifies a series of six types of Open Space which must
  be addressed in the General Plan. Most of these types of Open Space are covered
  in this Open Space, Natural Resources and Conservation Element (OPS), while a
  few are covered elsewhere in this General Plan. Table OPS-1 lists all six types, and
  tells where they are addressed in this General Plan.
  The Conservation Element is required to address the conservation, development
  and utilization of natural resources, including forests, soils, rivers and other waters,
  harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, water and hydrology.
  This Open Space and Conservation Element addresses one additional topic that is
  not specifically required by State law. The issue of air quality is addressed, in con-
  sideration of the importance of the air as a natural resource and as a vital compo-
  nent of a healthy environment.
  This Element is divided into the following ten sections:
     A.    Recreational Open Space
     B.    Scenic Resources
     C.    Agriculture
     D.    Minerals
     E.    Biological Resources
     F.    Water Quality
     G.    Air Quality
     H.    Cultural Resources

A. Recreational Open Space
1. Background Information
The section describes Oroville’s recreational open space lands as well as the State,
regional and local park lands located throughout the Planning Area. Figure OPS-1
illustrates the location of existing or planned parks as well as other open space
lands, owned by the City and entities other than the City of Oroville.
a. Open Space
Oroville has many recreational open space resources that are protected by State
agencies or conservation trusts. The State of California manages a vast amount of
land in the Lake Oroville State Recreation Area, including recreation areas and
lands associated with the State Water Project, which begins at Oroville Dam and
the Lake Oroville reservoir. The 12,000-acre Oroville Wildlife Refuge, of which
2,750 acres are within the Planning Area, is a riparian forest that serves both as
habitat and as a recreational destination for hiking, bird watching, canoeing, fishing,
and seasonal hunting.
b. Regional and State Parks
Regional and State parks offer additional open space preserves and recreational and
wildlife-viewing opportunities. The City of Oroville Department of Parks and
Trees works with the Feather River Recreation and Park District (FRRPD) and the
California Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) to coordinate open space
corridor connections where possible and provide regional recreation opportunities
in the Oroville area. The largest parks in the city include Riverbend Park (on the
Feather River), Mitchell Park (south of Downtown) and Nelson Park and Recrea-
tional Center (north of Thermalito), all of which are owned and operated by the
FRRPD. Some of the parks located within Oroville city limits are owned by the
City, but are operated and maintained by the FRRPD. Bedrock Park is an example
of this type of park. Table OPS-2 provides acreage for FRRPD- and City-owned
parks within Oroville city limits.
                                                                                       7-3

c. City Parks and Recreation
City Parks and Recreation refers to established City-owned and maintained parks
and recreational facilities, such as neighborhood parks and pocket parks. Parks and
recreation areas are fairly well distributed around the City. The Department of
Parks and Trees administers and manages the City’s parks and recreation areas, as
well as implementing cultural programs to accommodate varied interests, ages, cul-
tures, and abilities. These recreational opportunities for local residents range from
fishing, hiking, and river-rafting to sports fields and the Downtown Skate Park.
A sufficient supply of park land is important to maintain community livability. The
Oroville Parks Commission has adopted a standard of providing a minimum of
three acres of neighborhood and community parks per 1,000 residents.
The City owns and operates the Feather River nature Center and Native Plant Park
(“Meditation Park”), which is located on the south bank of the Feather River. Fig-
ure OPS-1 illustrates the sites of existing parks, recreational facilities and open
space, as well as general locations slated for future green space development.
d. School Facilities
Playing fields and playground facilities associated with schools within the Planning
Area comprise an important recreational resource. Thirteen elementary, five junior
high and four high schools have the potential to offer recreational facilities to the
public, which could help meet the community’s park and recreational needs. These
facilities would include ball fields; basketball, tennis, handball and volleyball courts;
areas for hard-surface play and multi-purpose turf areas.
e. Trails
The Oroville area trail network enhances the recreational enjoyment, health and
safety of the community. With the increased awareness of the health benefits of
walking and jogging, the trend towards promotion of non-motorized transporta-
tion, the growing recreational use of bicycles and the continued popularity of
horseback riding, a greater portion of the community than ever before will enjoy
Oroville’s existing and future trails.
The California Hiking and Equestrian Trail (comprised of segments known as the
Dan Beebe Trail and the Bridle Trail), owned and maintained by the DPR, is the
longest recognized trail within the Planning Area, stretching from the Thermalito
Diversion Dam about seven miles to the Kelly Ridge Visitor’s Center and then to
Bidwell Canyon and Saddle Dam in the east. As implied in its name, this trail is
geared for use by foot traffic and horses.
                                                                                       7-7

A proposed unpaved multi-use recreational trail, called the Brad Freeman Trail, will
also begin at Garden Drive and loops around the North and South Thermalito
Forebays, the Thermalito Afterbay, and through the Oroville Wildlife Refuge. The
trail will eventually reconnect with the Feather River Parkway in Historic Down-
town allowing users to travel continuously from Historic Downtown through the
Thermalito waterways and the Oroville Wildlife Refuge.
There are also existing, less formally recognized trails and paths used frequently by
Planning Area residents; these include dozens of unimproved dirt trails within the
Oroville Wildlife Refuge.
2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal OPS-1           Provide a comprehensive, high-quality system of rec-
                     reational open space and facilities to maintain and
                     improve the quality of life for Oroville residents.
             Policies
             P1.1     Preserve and develop open space that includes a diversity of
                      passive and active recreational amenities, that is geographically
                      distributed throughout the City, and that is easily accessible by
                      pedestrians and bicyclists.
             P1.2     Develop the Thermalito Forebay and Afterbay as a destination
                      water recreation park defining the western boundary of the
                      community, in accordance with the State’s original master plan
                      for recreation development associated with the Federal Energy
                      Regulatory Commission (FERC) license.
             P1.3     Where feasible, develop dual purpose recreational facilities that
                      can additionally serve as drainage basins. These sites should be
                      built with a contoured or tiered design to optimize the potential
                      for drainage.
             P1.4     Support appropriate management of local lakes and reservoirs
                      and releases from these water bodies to sustain recreational us-
                      es and an appropriate environment that maintains natural con-
                      ditions for aquatic and other species.

                  reational uses to serve the wider regional population.
        Actions
        A1.1     Identify and pursue State, federal, private, and foundation fund-
                 ing to preserve, protect, and enhance open space.
        A1.2     Review and comment on plans and actions of local, State, and
                 federal agencies concerning management and releases from local
                 reservoirs. In so doing, request that the recreational and wildlife
                 benefits of local lakes and streams be considered.
Goal OPS-2      Engage in coordinated and cooperative planning ef-
                forts between local, regional, and State parks
                providers.
        Policies

                  continue joint planning for future development of the Feather
                  River Parkway and bicycle path.
        P2.3      Work with the Feather River Recreation and Park District to
                  enhance Mitchell and Nelson Parks, so as to ensure that they
                  achieve true “community park” status by providing adequate
                  space for a range of activities aimed at a variety of user groups,
                  without sacrificing their value as popular sports facilities.
        P2.4      Recognize and support the efforts of Feather River Recreation
                  and Park District, including the collection of impact fees to
                  fund the acquisition of new community parks.
                                                                                   7-9

                      ceed if they are not.
        A2.2     Work with the Feather River Recreation & Park District to con-
                 sider adoption of a Development Impact Fee that would be ap-
                 plied to development throughout the City to fund a range of
                 community, neighborhood, and regional parks and facilities.
Goal OPS-3      Create a high quality, diversified public park system
                that provides adequate and varied recreational oppor-
                tunities conveniently accessible to all present and fu-
                ture residents, and that enhances Oroville’s unique at-
                tributes.
        Policies
        P3.1      New development will be required to provide adequate park-
                  land at a ratio of 5 acres per 1,000 residents in accordance with
                  the Quimby Act (California Code 66477). Golf course devel-
                  opment shall not be counted towards park acreage require-
                  ments.
        P3.2      Promote new park development and use through the selection
                  of highly visible locations in populated areas.
        P3.3      Maximize visual and physical access to waterways and open wa-
                  ter within park areas, provided that such access will not conflict
                  with preservation of habitat values.
        P3.4      Where human presence will not negatively impact sensitive
                  species, locate neighborhood and community parks adjacent to
                  or surrounding riparian corridors, in order to take advantage of
                  the scenic value of the riparian corridor, to ensure its preserva-
                  tion, to strengthen the connection between riparian corridors
                  and parkland throughout the Planning Area, and to maintain
                  the presence of nature in the Planning Area.
                                                                                  7-11

             P3.5     Enhance the wildlife value of the Planning Area’s “urban for-
                      est” by landscaping park and recreation lands with native vege-
                      tation and by preserving existing trees and shrubs where they
                      offer significant wildlife value.
             P3.6     Minimize substitution of private recreation facilities for devel-
                      oper fee payment or park dedication to ensure that a public
                      park system will be permanently available to the entire commu-
                      nity.
             P3.7     Pursue cooperative efforts with local school districts through
                      joint use agreements for park and recreational facilities creation
                      and operations.
             P3.8     Require all development proposals, rezoning requests and/or
                      General Plan amendments to be submitted to the Department
                      of Parks and Trees for review and response.
             P3.9     Continue to collect user fees for improving and operating park
                      and recreation facilities.
Goal OPS-4           Support the development of an extensive, intercon-
                     nected multi-use trail system for Oroville.
            Policies
             P4.1     Create and maintain a system of multi-use and specialized use
                      trails serving both recreational needs, such as walking, hiking,
                      jogging, and equestrian and bicycle use, and emergency access
                      needs.
             P4.2     Consider conversion of abandoned rail corridors and power
                      line corridors into recreational trails.
             P4.3     Establish agreements with private entities and public agencies

Actions
A4.1    As a component of the Parks, Recreation, Open Space, and
        Trails Master Plan and in coordination with the Feather River
        Recreation and Park District, prepare a Trails Section depicting
        regional and community multi-use and specialized trails. The
        Trails Plan shall incorporate the following provisions:
         ♦ Identification of existing and future trails throughout the
            Planning Area, connections to trails outside of the Planning
            Area, and, ultimately, trail connections to other communi-
            ties, including other communities throughout Butte County;
         ♦ Specification of which trails are to be designated for which
            types of uses, recognizing that separate trails may be needed
            for specialized uses;
         ♦ Identification of off-road bicycle paths in addition to on-
            street bike lanes to ensure that bicyclists have the option of
            riding somewhere separate from automobile traffic, con-
            sistent with the City's General Bikeway Plan;
         ♦ Analysis of how trail alignments relate to access to existing
            transit lines, and a strategy for provision of transit access
            points for weary hikers;
         ♦ Design trails in proximity to riparian corridors where such
            locations will not negatively impact biotic resources;
         ♦ Location of trail rights-of-way with concern for safety, con-
            sideration for nearby residents, convenience and enabling
            users to see the Oroville area in ways not available to road-
            bound travelers;
         ♦ Connections between important cultural and natural fea-
            tures;
         ♦ Landscape and design standards that include an emphasis
            on maintenance of natural vegetation and topography along
            the trailway; and
         ♦ A program for construction, maintenance and rehabilitation
            of trails.

                     known as the Feather River Trail Parkway. This trail system
                     shall run along the Feather River, from the Lake Oroville Dam
                     to the Oroville Wildlife Area, using existing trail segments, and
                     creating new segments, where necessary.

B. Scenic Resources
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville has a number of scenic resources available in the form of
prominent land formations and preserves.
a. Views
The Oroville area has multiple prominent land forms that help its citizens to distin-
guish places and locate themselves within the city, including Table Mountain and
the Foothills. Table Mountain is a large, flat-topped mountain, just north of
Oroville, and is highly visible from many parts of the Planning Area. Some parts of
Oroville also have views towards the foothills, located just east of the city. Views
of the city are possible for the people who live in these foothills and views of the
foothills are available from most areas in the city.
b. Preserves
Preserves are single-use areas that are not likely to change in form, character or use
in the near future. By the nature of their existing land use, preserves have little or
no chance of providing a mix of land uses or ingress via circulation or transporta-
tion networks. Along with the Feather River Nature Center and Native Plant Park
(“Meditation Park”) there are five preserves identified as components of Oroville’s
urban form:
i. Feather River Nature Center and Native Plant Park
The Feather River Nature Center and Native Plant Park is a stone structure located
on Old Ferry Road on the south bank of the Feather River across the river from
the Feather River Fish Hatchery. Constructed in the 1930s, it operated as a Works
Progress Administration (WPA) bathhouse and has been restored and converted
into a Nature Center. The historic construction and scenic vistas make it a won-
derful place for families to encounter the natural beauty of the Feather River. The
site also contains picnic tables and other recreational amenities.

ii. Oroville Dam Area Preserve
This area includes the steeply-sloped hillsides around the dam. This area could
provide passive open space recreation opportunities for Oroville residents.
iii. Feather River Waterfront Preserve
The waterfront is located between Highway 70 and the Feather River. Riverbend
Park is part of this preserve. This area contains other active and passive recreation
opportunities.
iv. Oroville Wildlife Refuge Preserve
The refuge begins at Highway 162, between the Feather River to the west and the
Oroville Municipal Airport and Thermalito Afterbay to the east, continuing south
to the Planning Area boundary. Mine tailings from Oroville’s past fill much of the
Wildlife Refuge.
v. North and South Thermalito Forebay Preserve
The North and South Thermalito Forebay receive water diverted from Lake
Oroville as part of the State Water Project, one of the largest water and power sys-
tems in the world. North Thermalito Forebay offers recreation opportunities in-
cluding swimming, boating and picnicking. South Thermalito Forebay also pro-
vides recreational opportunities including boating and fishing. Flat rice fields and
grazing land surround the forebays.
vi. Thermalito Afterbay Preserve
Thermalito Afterbay also receives water diverted from Lake Oroville as part of the
State Water Project. The Afterbay includes opportunities for boating, swimming
and fishing. The Afterbay is adjacent to the Oroville Wildlife Area and the Feather
River Fish Hatchery Annex.

             P5.4     Require new light fixtures within new development to be de-
                      signed and sited so as to minimize light pollution, glare, and
                      light trespass into adjoining properties.
            Actions
            A5.1     Conduct a study to identify and locate scenic vistas and
                     viewsheds throughout the City and develop a program to pro-
                     tect these resources and provide public awareness.
            A5.2     Conduct a study to identify the most serious sources of light
                     pollution and day-time glare in Oroville, and implement a pro-
                     gram to work with relevant public and private property owners
                     to retrofit, remove or replace light polluting fixtures or glare-
                     inducing surfaces.
C. Agricultural Resources
1. Background Information
Areas used for agriculture are scattered throughout the Planning Area and
Oroville’s Sphere of Influence (SOI). Row crops and rice fields occur predomi-
nantly in mostly flat areas in the northwest portion of the Planning Area along
Highway 99. Within the Planning Area, small olive groves occur on hillsides in the
southeastern portion and citrus orchards in the southwest corner.
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, better known as the Williamson
Act, works to preserve agricultural and open space lands through restrictive use
contracts administered by counties and cities under State regulations. Private land-
owners voluntarily restrict their land to agricultural and compatible open space uses
under minimum 10-year rolling term contracts, with counties and cities also acting

voluntarily. In return, the property tax on a Williamson Act parcel is assessed at a
rate consistent with its actual use, rather than potential market value. 1
Approximately 12 percent (6,000 acres) of agricultural land in the Planning Area are
designated Williamson Act land. Roughly 900 acres of these Williamson Act lands
are considered prime agricultural lands and under a Williamson Act contract within
the Oroville Planning Area. Figure OPS-2 shows the location of all Williamson Act
lands and their designation as well as farmland not covered by the Williamson Act.
2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal OPS-6             Preserve the maximum feasible amount of agricultur-
                       ally productive land, in order to maintain agriculture’s
                       contributions to the local economy, lifestyle, air quali-
                       ty, habitat value, and sense of Oroville’s heritage.
              Policies
              P6.1       Support the South Feather Water and Power Agency and the
                         Thermalito Water and Sewer District investigations of the need,
                         availability, and cost of irrigation water to support agriculture
                         within the Planning Area.
              P6.2       Cooperate with Butte County to retain agricultural uses on
                         lands within the Oroville Sphere of Influence prior to their an-
                         nexation to the City.
              P6.3       Encourage activities that support local agriculture such as farm-
                         ers’ markets, on-site sale of produce, community gardens, and
                         special events promoting local agricultural products.
              Actions
              A6.1      Study the possibility of forming a local land trust, possibly in
                        cooperation with Butte County, or solicit the interest of an ex-

                     sistance, water hookups, equipment loans, and assistance in ob-
                     taining liability insurance.
D. Mineral Resources
1. Background Information
Sand and gravel, stone, and gold mining are the three primary mining industries in
Butte County. Of these, the Butte County’s Energy, Natural Resources, and Recre-
ation Element identifies only sand and gravel operations as present within the
Oroville Planning Area. Despite its historical importance, gold mining has dwin-
dled to a negligible level within the Planning Area.
Oroville’s position within the “gravel belt” of Butte County, where sediments
washed down from the Sierra Nevada reach the slower moving rivers of the flatter
Central Valley, places it in an area for potential gravel mining. The gravels are val-
ued, as are sands within the deposits, to be used in combination with Portland ce-
ment or asphalt compounds in construction and road building.
Sand and gravel deposits are also mined for silica, used in the production of cleans-
ers, abrasives, and toothpaste. All of the sand and gravel mining operations within
the Planning Area are located south of the Oroville city limits, adjacent to or east of
the Feather River. There is one sand/gravel mine on the north side of Ophir Road.

Urban preemption of prime deposits and conflicts between mining and other uses
throughout California led to passage of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of
1975 (SMARA). This Act establishes policies for conservation and development of
mineral lands and contains specific provisions for the classification of mineral lands
by the State Geologist.
SMARA requires all cities and counties to incorporate in their General Plans
mapped designations approved by the State Mining and Geology Board. These
designations include lands categorized as Mineral Resource Zones, the most signifi-
cant of which is a designation of mineral resources that are of regional or Statewide
significance. These categories must be recognized by the local General Plan, to
establish policies and programs for the conservation and development of these
resources.
The State Geologist has not yet mapped the mineral resources in Butte County, nor
does the State intend to formally survey Butte County within the next 2 to 3 years. 2
A policy in the Butte County General Plan’s Energy, Natural Resources and Recre-
ation Element states that the County Board of Supervisors shall formally request
that the State Division of Mines and Geology map mineral resources in Butte
County of “Regional or Statewide Significance.” 3 The Oroville General Plan reiter-
ates this policy.

Goal OPS-7           Protect economically viable mineral resources and
                     related industries in Oroville, while avoiding land use
                     conflicts and environmental impacts from mining ac-
                     tivities.
             Policies
              P7.1    Manage mineral resource extraction to ensure that this activity
                      results in the fewest possible environmental impacts. Require
                      preparation and assured implementation of a rehabilitation plan
                      for mineral extraction sites as a condition of mining approval.

                      The mineral resource extraction plan should address the protec-
                      tion and restoration of biotic resources.
             P7.2     New or expanded mining operations within the City of Oroville
                      and its Sphere of Influence shall adhere to the following guide-
                      lines:
                       ♦ Demonstrate no significant adverse impacts from the min-
                          ing operations on adjoining areas and uses, including, but
                          not limited to, those associated with noise, dust, and vibra-
                          tion.
                       ♦ Demonstrate no substantial increase in hazards to neighbor-
                          ing uses, water quality, air quality, agricultural resources, or
                          biological resources.
                       ♦ Demonstrate that the proposed plan complies with existing
                          applicable County and State waste management standards.
                       ♦ Incorporate sufficient buffering between mining operations
                          and adjacent non-mining uses to minimize noise in accord-
                          ance with guidelines described in the Noise Ordinance.
                       ♦ Incorporate landscaping buffers and other measures to min-
                          imize visual impacts to the extent possible.
             P7.3     If the State Division of Mines and Geology determines that the
                      Planning Area contains significant aggregate resources, con-
                      serve sufficient aggregate resources to meet the Planning Area’s
                      fair share of future regional needs.
             P7.4     Apply zoning regulations permitting extraction as a conditional
                      use on any lands that may be designated as Significant Con-
                      struction Aggregate Resource Areas.
             P7.5     Restrict permitted uses on lands containing important mineral
                      resources to those compatible with mineral extraction, except
                      in cases where such uses offer public benefits that outweigh
                      those of resource extraction.
             P7.6     Reclaim former mining sites to a condition which is readily
                      adaptable for alternative land uses, consistent with the Land

in the mid-1800s as the area was first hydraulically mined, and later dredged for
gold, as well as developed for agriculture. Despite these human modifications to
the natural environment, important biological resources continue to exist in and
around Oroville.
Within the Planning Area, several regional parks and other protected public lands
contain sensitive biological habitats (e.g. riparian, oak woodland and vernal pool)
and may support State and federally listed species. These lands include the Ther-
malito Afterbay, Thermalito Forebay, Oroville Wildlife Area, and other natural
lands managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW), Califor-
nia Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), and the Feather River Recreation
and Parks District. Although not in the Planning Area, nearby open space and
wilderness areas such as the Plumas National Forest and North Table Mountain
Wildlife Area provide important biological resources to the region. Wide-ranging
wildlife species (e.g. black-tailed deer, osprey, golden eagle, bald eagle, and numer-
ous species of migratory birds) within these areas could migrate through or forage
in the Planning Area. Important biological resources in the Planning Area are de-
scribed in greater detail below.
a. Biological Communities
Nine main types of biological communities occur in the Planning Area. These nine
communities include:
  ♦ Foothill Pine-Blue Oak Woodland. Foothill pine-blue oak woodlands are
     scattered throughout the Planning Area but are concentrated in the eastern
     half of the Planning Area in a mostly rural setting, with extensive woodlands
     occurring around Lake Oroville.
  ♦ Riparian Woodlands. Riparian woodlands are common throughout the
     Planning Area and occur along portions of the Feather River, Thermalito Af-
     terbay and Forebay, Thermalito Diversion Pool, and along numerous perennial
     and ephemeral drainages in the eastern portion of the Planning Area. Riparian
                                                                                     7-23

     woodlands are also commonly associated with dredge tailings throughout the
     Planning Area.
  ♦ Annual Grasslands. Annual grasslands occur throughout the Planning Area.
     Large, open areas of annual grasslands occur primarily in the western half of
     the Planning Area and are typically grazing pastures for livestock. Annual
     grasslands also form the understory for foothill pine-blue oak woodland and
     occur on vacant parcels in developed areas.
  ♦ Chaparral. A small aggregation of chaparral occurs in the northern portion of
     the Planning Area on the south-facing slopes of South Table Mountain. Small
     scattered areas of chaparral are also present within the understory of wood-
     lands throughout the Planning Area.
  ♦ Agricultural Lands. Areas used for agriculture are scattered throughout the
     Planning Area. Row crops and rice fields occur predominantly in mostly flat
     areas in the northwest portion of the Planning Area along Highway 99. Within
     the Planning Area small olive groves occur on hillsides in the southeastern
     portion and citrus orchards in the southwest corner.
  ♦ Wetlands. Wetlands are considered sensitive natural communities by several
     resource agencies and should be given special consideration in the Planning
     Area because they provide a variety of important ecological functions and es-
     sential habitat for wildlife resources. Natural wetland habitats are steadily de-
     clining compared to their historical distribution, as a result of land manage-
     ment practices and development activities. Four types of wetlands occur in
     the Planning Area.
  ♦ Vernal Pools. Vernal pools occur primarily in the western half of the Plan-
     ning Area and are concentrated in the areas shown on Figure OPS-3. The
     largest area of vernal pools is located north and south of Cottonwood Road
     between Highways 99 and 70; these pools are northern volcanic mud flow
     vernal pools. Vernal pools in the Planning Area occur within annual grass-
     lands and represent a variety of pool types, including northern hardpan and
     northern volcanic mudflow pools. Vernal pools may occur as individual pools
     with discrete boundaries or be connected with other vernal pools via vernal
     swales to form a vernal pool complex. Vernal swales consist of vernal pools
     that occur within shallow, linear depressions.

   ♦ Drainages. Perennial and ephemeral drainages occur throughout the Plan-
      ning Area and are shown in Figures OPS-3. These drainages are typically as-
      sociated with riparian habitat described above and may support patches of
      freshwater marsh. Primary drainages within the Planning Area include the
      Feather River, Cottonwood Creek, Little Cottonwood Creek, Wyman Ravine,
      Wyndotte Creek, and the Western Canal.
   ♦ Freshwater Marsh. Freshwater marsh occurs in the northwest portion of the
      Planning Area along the margins of flooded rice fields adjacent to Highway 99.
      Drainages and open water habitats in the Planning Area may also support
      patches of freshwater marsh.
   ♦ Reservoir. The Thermalito Afterbay and Thermalito Forebay are large reser-
      voirs located on the Feather River in the western portion of the Planning Area
      formed by earthen dams. The Thermalito Afterbay and Thermalito Forebay
      provide resting and foraging habitat for migratory waterfowl traveling along
      the Pacific Flyway. The Thermalito Afterbay is part of the larger Oroville
      Wildlife Area (shown on Figure OPS-3). The eastern portion of the preserve
      surrounding the Feather River contains numerous dredge tailings and borrows
      pits. The distribution of biological communities in the Planning Area is closely
      associated with topography and hydrology. Some of the flat valley area sup-
      ports agricultural lands, the hilly portions support most of the remaining grass-
      land and woodland communities and stream corridors support riparian com-
      munities.
b. Special-Status Species
Special-status species are plants and animals that are legally protected under the
State and/or federal Endangered Species Act or other regulations, and species that
are considered by the scientific community to be sufficiently rare to qualify for such
listing. Special-status plants and animals are species in the following categories:
   ♦ Species that are candidates for possible future listing as threatened or endan-
      gered under the federal Endangered Species Act.
   ♦ Species listed or proposed for listing by the State of California as threatened or
      endangered under the California Endangered Species Act.
   ♦ Species that meet the definitions of rare or endangered under the California
      Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
   ♦ Plants listed as rare, plants about which more information is needed to deter-
      mine their status, plants of limited distribution that may be included as special-
                                                                                      7-27

      status species on the basis of local significance or recent biological infor-
      mation, or plants considered to be “rare, threatened, or endangered in Califor-
      nia,” under the California Native Plant Protection Act.
   ♦ Animals fully protected in California under the California Fish and Wildlife
      Code.
   ♦ Animal species of special concern to the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
i. Special-Status Plants
A total of 37 special-status plants have the potential to occur or are known to occur
in the Planning Area. Of these 37 species, five species are federally and/or State
listed: Hoover’s spurge (Chamaesyce hooveri), Butte County meadowfoam (Limnanthes
floccosa ssp. californica), hairy Orcutt grass (Orcuttia pilosa), slender Orcutt grass (Orcuttia
tenuis) and Greene’s tuctoria (Tuctoria greenei). Slender Orcutt grass has been reported
twice within the Planning Area and Butte County meadowfoam has been reported
on the western boundary of the Planning Area. The USFWS has designated critical
habitat for Butte County meadowfoam in the northwestern portion of the Planning
Area.
ii. Special-Status Wildlife
A total of 13 State and/or federally listed and 19 non-listed special-status wildlife
species are known to occur or have the potential to occur in the Planning Area
based on a review of existing information and presence of suitable habitat. USFWS
has designated critical habitat in the northwestern portion of the Planning Area for
vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp.
iii. Special-Status Fish
Within the Planning Area, the Feather River and its tributaries provide habitat for
fall/late fall and spring-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, white stur-
geon, green sturgeon and Pacific lamprey. Critical habitat for Central Valley steel-
head and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon is designated in the Feather
River from the confluence of the Yuba River upstream to Oroville Dam.
2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal OPS-8             Preserve and protect all special-status species, species
                       that are candidates for federal or State listing, State
                       species of special concern, and CNPS listed plant
                       species.

Policies
P8.1     Require a biological assessment of any proposed project site
         where federally-, or State-listed species or critical habitat may be
         present.
P8.2     Require a habitat-based site assessment during the project de-
         sign phase to determine the potential for special-status species
         to occur within a proposed project area. If potential habitat for
         special-status plant or animal species is identified, additional fo-
         cused surveys may need to be conducted during the appropriate
         season.
P8.3     Require agency consultation for proposed projects for which
         there is the potential to impact federal or State-listed species, or
         other appropriate agency assistance for non-listed special-status
         species.
P8.4     Require proposed trail projects that have the potential to im-
         pact special-status species to coordinate trail planning and de-
         velopment with habitat preservation efforts.
P8.5     Make information available to interested parties concerning the
         presence and condition of special-status species.
P8.6     If special-status plant or animal species are found to be located
         within a development site, the developer shall mitigate project
         impacts in accordance with State and federal law. Examples of
         mitigation may include:
          ♦ Redesign the proposed project to avoid and minimize im-
             pacts.
          ♦ Restrict construction to specific seasons based on project-
             specific special-status species issues (e.g. minimizing impacts
             to special-status nesting birds by constructing outside of the
             nesting season).
          ♦ Confine construction disturbance to the minimum area nec-
             essary to complete the work.
                                                                         7-29

                       ♦ Mitigate for the loss of special-status species by purchasing
                          credits at an approved conservation bank (if a bank exists
                          for the species in question), funding restoration or habitat
                          improvement projects at existing preserves in Butte County,
                          or purchasing or donating mitigation lands.
                       ♦ Maintain a minimum 100-foot buffer on each side of all ri-
                          parian corridors, creeks and streams for special-status and
                          common wildlife. Ruddy Creek would be an example of
                          where this applies.
                       ♦ Establish setbacks from the outer edge of special-status
                          species habitat areas.
                       ♦ Prohibit livestock grazing or drainage into the setback of
                          special-status species habitat areas.
                       ♦ Construction of barriers to prevent compaction damage by
                          foot or vehicular traffic.
            Actions
            A8.1     Work with BCAG to develop a regional Habitat Conservation
                     Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan and database,
                     and subsequently update it as necessary, for the management
                     and protection of sensitive biological resources such as wet-
                     lands, riparian corridors, and critical habitat areas. The plan
                     should be developed in cooperation with the California De-
                     partment of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
                     vice, and local interest groups, and should address all known
                     critical habitat areas, special-status plant populations, wildlife
                     movement corridors specifically including deer migration routes,
                     and should prioritize areas for management and protection that
                     are likely to be impacted by development.

                 species, including, if it is found to be feasible, a tiered approach
                 that would prioritize protection of State and federally listed spe-
                 cies. Such an approach may include identification of appropri-
                 ate buffers for preservation of species identified on a develop-
                 ment site, and appropriate avoidance and mitigation measures
                 for special-status species determined to be affected by a pro-
                 posed development.

        Policies
        P9.1      Encourage the Department of Water Resources and Depart-
                  ment of Fish and Wildlife to manage and maintain the Oroville
                  Wildlife Refuge for multiple uses, while protecting property
                  values on land adjacent to the refuge.
        P9.2      Minimize loss of wetland value or acreage consistent with the
                  needs of wildlife and humans, to the extent practicable and as
                  regulated by State and federal law.
        P9.3      Work with Butte County and the Department of Fish and
                  Wildlife to support the protection of migratory and resident
                  deer herds in the Planning Area, by preserving habitat and
                  movement corridors.
        P9.4      Develop a program to preserve wildlife corridors that includes
                  designing and constructing freeway and arterial street under-
                  crossing areas at locations that currently serve as wildlife corri-

F. Water Quality
1. Background Information
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has jurisdiction over nine
Regional Water Quality Control Boards, whose charge it is to identify and imple-
ment water quality objectives. The Oroville area falls under the authority of the
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB), Region 5, and
is located within the Sacramento River Basin (Basin SA). The Water Quality Con-
trol Plan (Basin Plan) which affects this hydrologic sub-basin was most recently
revised in March 1990.
All land uses, whether undeveloped, agricultural, industrial or urban, have some
type of water quality impacts. Water quality problems are typically characterized by
erosion and sedimentation considerations, and concerns about contamination of
ground or surface water. Major sources of chemical or toxic discharge within the
Oroville region include agriculture, silviculture, municipalities, and industries.
Water quality is intimately tied to water supply, since adequate uncontaminated
flows significantly mitigate the presence of contaminated flows, through dilution,
flushing and general availability of alternate sources. Water supply is discussed
further in the Public Facilities and Services Element of this General Plan. Dis-
                                                                                     7-35

charge requirements and pretreatment of industrial wastewater are also discussed in
the Public Facilities and Services Element.
a. Erosion and Sedimentation
Lands that are preserved in agriculture are subject to surface water flows that carry
particles away from a site. This erosive action results in downslope or downstream
sedimentation, which can impair drinking water, as well as adversely affect fisheries
and water-related habitat. In addition, toxic substances may bind to soil particles,
which then distribute and circulate contaminants throughout the riparian, estuarine
and marine systems. Given Oroville’s position, primarily upslope and upstream of
the intensive Central Valley agriculture, and the dispersed nature of agricultural
operations throughout the Planning Area, it is unlikely that erosion and sedimenta-
tion within the Planning Area would be a significant concern.
Erosion and sedimentation can also result from timber harvesting practices, includ-
ing road construction, logging and post-logging operations, and from the construc-
tion and operation of mines. The CVRWQCB has not identified any particular
water quality problems within the Oroville area related to upstream timber harvest-
ing or mining activities.
Land development and associated construction activities in steeper portions of the
Planning Area might be expected to contribute regionally to erosion and sedimen-
tation. The CVRWQCB encourages the submission of an erosion plan for con-
struction in steeper areas, including areas where greater than 10,000 square feet of
surface area and/or more than 100 cubic yards of excavated material will be dis-
turbed; this would probably include construction in all areas of moderate and high
slopes.
Although historically a problem of regional significance, dredging activities are not
currently identified as a significant source of erosion and sedimentation within the
Planning Area. While flood control maintenance dredging may be necessary on
some waterways, it has not been identified by the a RWQCB as a problem in
Oroville.
b. Contamination
Sources of water contamination in the Oroville Planning Area include:
i. Pesticides, Fertilizers, Herbicides, and Urban Runoff
The CVRWQCB has not identified any existing problems or concerns relating to
pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, or urban runoff within the Planning Area. How-

Residences in the portions of the Planning Area not served by sewers are on septic
systems. According to the Butte County Environmental Health Department, there
is no record of any ongoing water quality problems related to contamination by
septic systems, although the City is aware of occasional incidents of malfunction.
iii. Industry-related Toxics
The EPA has identified the following three superfund sites in the Planning Area
that affect surface and/or groundwater quality:
   ♦ Koppers Industries
   ♦ Oroville Army Airfield (Oroville Municipal Airport)
   ♦ Sierra Pacific
Each of these sites are currently undergoing cleanup and monitoring. These sites
are discussed in more detail in the Safety Element of this General Plan.

                     cides, fertilizers, household chemicals, landscaping to control
                     erosion, maintenance of septic systems, and proper disposal of
                     used motor oil and batteries.
G. Air Quality
1. Background Information
Air quality is a critical element in the natural environment, and the availability of
clean, non-polluted air is an important factor for human health and quality of life
for all Oroville residents. The primary factors that determine air quality are the
locations of air pollutant sources and the amount of pollutants emitted from those

sources. Meteorological and topographical conditions are also important factors.
Atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed, wind direction and air temperature
gradients, interact with the physical features of the landscape to determine the
movement and dispersal of air pollutants.
Oroville is located in central Butte County, in the Sacramento Valley Air Basin
(SVAB). The SVAB includes Butte, Sacramento, Sutter and Yolo Counties and
parts of Solano, Placer, and El Dorado Counties. The SVAB is bounded on the
west by the Coast Ranges and on the north and east by the Cascade Range and
Sierra Nevada. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin is located to the south. Oroville,
although north of the Sacramento metropolitan area, often suffers from transport
of pollutants from the Sacramento area.
The SVAB has a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and
cool, rainy winters. During summer, the wide, flat expanse of the Sacramento Val-
ley provides an ideal environment for the formation of photochemical smog. Hot,
cloudless days of low-velocity winds allow sunlight to combine with photochemi-
cally reactive hydrocarbons, or ozone precursors (reactive organic gases [ROG]),
along with nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced throughout the Valley, resulting in an
increase in ozone, particularly during late afternoons. Winds arising later may help
dispel pollutants, but may also transfer it to other areas from Sacramento to
Oroville.
There are no monitoring stations within the Planning Area. The closest monitoring
stations are in Chico and Paradise. Monitoring data indicates that ozone concentra-
tions occasionally exceeded State and federal standards during the past five years;
PM10 (particulate matter) concentrations often exceeded State standards; PM2.5 con-
centrations exceeded the federal standard twice during the most recent five years of
data; and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations did not violate State or federal
standards in Chico. Although the Chico monitoring results are not representative
of Oroville, they indicate that CO2 is not likely to be an issue in Oroville; this con-
clusion is based on the lower number of motor vehicle trips and vehicle miles trav-
eled in the Oroville area than in the Chico area.
In general, the prevailing wind in the Sacramento Valley is from the southwest be-
cause of marine breezes flowing through the Carquinez Strait. The influx of air
through the Carquinez Strait forms a low-level southerly jet between 500 and 1,000
feet above the surface that is capable of speeds in excess of 35 mph. This jet is
important for air quality in the Sacramento Valley because of its ability to transport
air pollutants over large distances.
                                                                                     7-39

C O N S E R V A T I O N E L E M E N T
The SVAB’s climate and topography contribute to the formation and transport of
photochemical pollutants throughout the region. The region experiences tempera-
ture inversions that limit atmospheric mixing and trap pollutants, resulting in high
pollutant concentrations near the ground surface. The highest concentrations of
photochemical pollutants occur from late spring to early fall, when photochemical
reactions are greatest because of more intense sunlight and the lower altitude of
daytime inversion layers.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal OPS-12          Reduce particulate matter pollution in Oroville to
                     meet State and federal ambient air quality
                     standards.
            Policies
             P12.1 Cooperate with the Butte County Air Pollution Control District
                      to achieve 5 percent annual emissions reductions for non-
                      attainment pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter,
                      by implementation of air pollution control measures as required
                      by State and federal standards.
             P12.2 Support planning measures in the Sacramento metropolitan ar-
                      ea that would result in a net decrease in the production of
                      ozone precursors and other wind-transported pollutants that ul-
                      timately affect air quality in the Planning Area.
             P12.3 Require all construction projects to implement dust control
                      measures to reduce particulate matter emissions due to disturb-
                      ance of exposed top-soils. Such measures would include water-
                      ing of active areas where disturbance occurs, covering haul
                      loads, maintaining clean access roads, and cleaning the wheels
                      of construction vehicles accessing disturbed areas of the site.

        Actions
        A12.1 Develop a program to identify and reduce local sources of par-
                 ticulate matter. These sources could include construction,
                 wood-burning stoves, dust from City activities, or other sources.
        A12.2 Require all road improvements and parking areas to be built to
                 City standards to reduce dust and particulate matter.
Goal OPS-13     Reduce emissions of air contaminants, including
                greenhouse gases, and minimize public exposure to
                toxic, hazardous, and odoriferous air pollutants.
        Policies
        P13.1 Prohibit sensitive receptors, such as residential uses, schools
                  and hospitals, from locating in the vicinity of industrial and
                  commercial uses known to emit toxic, hazardous or odoriferous
                  air pollutants, and prohibit the establishment of such uses in
                  the vicinity of sensitive receptors.
        P13.2 Reduce automobile dependence, thereby reducing greenhouse
                  gas emissions, by encouraging mixed land use patterns that lo-
                  cate services such as banks, child care facilities, schools, neigh-
                  borhood shopping centers and restaurants in close proximity to
                  employment centers and residential neighborhoods.
        P13.3 Promote expansion of employment opportunities within
                  Oroville to reduce commuting to areas outside Oroville.
        P13.4 Encourage the use of alternative fuels in vehicle fleets and the
                  use of alternative forms of transportation for City staff and
                  other public agencies.
        P13.5 Work with the Butte County Air Quality Management District
                  (BCAQMD) to accurately monitor PM10, carbon monoxide,
                  and other regulated air pollutants in Oroville, and to upgrade its
                  facilities as needed in the future to ensure that accurate moni-
                  toring is maintained.
                                                                                   7-41

                      order to minimize future increases in vehicle travel and to assist
                      in implementing appropriate indirect source regulations adopt-
                      ed by the Air Pollution Control District.
             P13.7 Design new intersections to function in a manner that reduces
                      air pollutant emissions from stop-start and idling traffic condi-
                      tions. Possible techniques include the use of roundabouts
                      and/or using integrated signalization to improve traffic flow.
             P13.8 Require the use of EPA-certified wood stoves, fireplaces, pellet
                      stoves or natural gas fireplaces in new development and require
                      retrofit or replacement of non-certified appliances for renova-
                      tion projects.
             P13.9 Control measures shall be implemented at all construction sites,
                      such as alternative fuels, after-market add-ons, and other
                      measures to further minimize exhaust emissions from construc-
                      tion equipment.
             P13.10 New development served by bus transit will be evaluated by the
                      City to determine if the development project should include
                      bus shelters to increase access to transit and decrease automo-
                      bile dependence. The provision of bus shelters shall be re-
                      viewed by transit authorities to determine feasibility.
            Actions
            A13.1 Establish targets for replacement of City-owned vehicles, as ap-
                     propriate, with alternative-fuel models, and aggressively pursue
                     funding sources to facilitate a replacement program.
            A13.2 Offer “Fast Track Processing” for mixed-use development and
                     development that reduces automobile dependence. Under fast
                     Track Processing, the City will offer expedited permitting as in-
                     centive for mixed land use patterns and development that in-
                     creases opportunities for walking, biking, and transit use.

H . Cultural Resources
1. Background Information
Cultural resources in Oroville include both prehistoric and historic resources in the
realms of archaeology, paleontology and historic structures, sites and areas that
played important roles in local history.
a. Prehistoric Archaeological and Historic Resources
Prehistoric and historic archaeological resources in the Planning Area include: Na-
tive American habitation sites, temporary campsites, lithic reduction stations (stone
tool making locations), milling stations, rock features and burial locations. To pre-
vent possible looting and/or disturbance, the location of archaeological resources
are not mapped.
A total of 33 sites with prehistoric components have been recorded within the City
of Oroville SOI. Six of these sites contain historic components as well. The most
common type of prehistoric site found in the City of Oroville SOI are milling sta-
tions at locations such as the Feather River Nature Center, followed by temporary
campsites, habitation sites, burial locations and rock features. Two sites have
known Native American burials.
Prehistoric sites are often found along major rivers in the Sacramento Valley, with
their associated areas of high ground and natural levees. Prehistoric sites are also
often found along the various creeks and minor drainages in the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains and their adjacent interior valleys and grasslands. This
pattern applies to the City of Oroville SOI, where prehistoric sites tend to be locat-
ed along the Feather River, its tributaries and smaller drainages. In particular, the
banks of the Feather River and its tributaries in the Historic Downtown, Hammon,
Western Pacific, Canyon Highlands, northern Oakvale and Kelly Ridge areas are
very sensitive for prehistoric archaeological resources.
Historic archaeological site types in the SOI include abandoned transportation cor-
ridors and alignments, and remnants of activities associated with historic mining,
settlement and agriculture. For the purposes of this General Plan, historic archaeo-
logical resources are distinguished from historic resources (the built environment)
largely by condition. That is, resources that are still functional (roads that are trav-
                                                                                    7-43

C O N S E R V A T I O N E L E M E N T
eled, ditches carrying water, standing structures) are considered part of the built
environment. The remnants of these structures are considered archaeological re-
sources.
Historic archaeological sensitivity is considered particularly high along the banks of
the Feather River in the Historic Downtown, Hammon, Western Pacific, Kelly
Ridge, Oroville Dam Area, Oro Bangor, Foothills and Oakvale areas.
b. Historic Resources
Historic resources generally include buildings, roads, trails, bridges, canals and rail-
roads usually associated with the time period beginning with the first Euro-
American contact. Because non-Native American settlement of the City of
Oroville area dates to the 1840s, the city is rich in historic cultural resources. In
general, concentrations of historic resources in the city are expected to occur:
   ♦ Adjacent to transportation corridors (historic highways, railroads, navigable
      sloughs);
   ♦ On historic ranches;
   ♦ In areas of historic rock, soil and mineral extraction; and
   ♦ Within historic neighborhoods and business districts.
Based on records searches, the largest concentration of historic buildings and struc-
tures occurs in the Historic Downtown Oroville area. Table OPS-3 lists known
historic resources in the Historic Downtown area that are listed on or eligible for
listing on national, state and local registers that could be located via readily available
sources. The corresponding map, Figure OPS-4, indicates historic resources in the
vicinity of Historic Downtown Oroville. A number of resources are of indetermi-
nate location and/or outside of the downtown area, and, therefore, are not indicat-
ed on the map but are still identified in Table OPS-3. The map and table are the
most comprehensive listing of resources in the Historic Downtown area currently
available, but new resources are continuously located.
i. Historic Properties in the State Database
The Historic Property Data File Historic Resources Inventory (HRI), which is
maintained by the State Office of Historic Preservation (SHPO), identifies proper-
ties that have been recorded and whether those properties are considered eligible or
ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The listing
for the City of Oroville indicates that over 150 properties within the City have been

are listed or appear to meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP and/or CRHR.
The HRI also includes buildings identified as historically significant by local gov-
ernment agencies.
Most of the historic properties in Oroville are residential and commercial buildings.
Oroville’s historic resources include both individual resources such as the Oroville
Inn as well as historic districts such as the Old Oroville Commercial District, which
dates to the mid-1800s. Bridges (Table Mountain Boulevard Bridge), railroad fea-
tures (Western Pacific Railroad Depot) and ranching structures (Granary for Biggs
Ranch) are examples of engineering features that are located in the City of Oroville

in part or whole and are noted within the HRI as meeting significance criteria or
specifically awaiting future formal determination. Sites, such as the location of the
discovery of the last Yahi Indian, are listed in the HRI only when deemed prudent
by the Office of Historic Preservation because of the low potential for vandalism.
ii. California State Historical Landmarks
California Historical Landmarks include sites that are of statewide historical im-
portance and must be the first, last, only, or most significant of a type in a large
geographical area. There are five resources in the City of Oroville that the State has
designated as California Historical Landmarks. The first is the Chinese Temple
(Landmark No. 770). Located in downtown Oroville, this landmark commemo-
rates the temple of worship for 10,000 Chinese, then living in the area, at the time
of the building’s dedication in 1863. The second is the Discovery Site of the Last
Yahi Indian (Landmark No. 809), located at 2547 Oroville-Quincy Highway, at
Oak Avenue. The third is the Mother Orange Tree of Butte County (Landmark
No. 1043). The fourth is the Bidwell Bar Bridge and Tollhouse (Landmark No.
314) and the fifth, currently located under Lake Oroville, is Bidwell’s Bar (Land-
mark No. 330).
iii. California Points of Historical Interest
California Points of Historical Interest are sites, buildings, features, or events that
are of local (city or county) significance and have anthropological, cultural, military,
political, architectural, economic, scientific or technical, religious, experimental, or
other value. To be eligible for designation as a Point of Historical Interest, a re-
source must meet at least one of the following criteria:
   ♦ The first, last, only, or most significant of its type in the state or within the lo-
     cal geographic region (city or county);
   ♦ Associated with an individual or group having a profound influence on the his-
     tory of the local area; or
   ♦ A prototype of, or an outstanding example of, a period, style, architectural
     movement or construction or is one of the more notable works or the best
     surviving work in the local region of a pioneer architect, designer or master
     builder.
There are eight California Points of Historical Interest in the City of Oroville.
They are:
   ♦ Lott Museum, Sank Park at 1067 Montgomery Street
                                                                                         7-49

c. Native American Sacred Sites
This section seeks to facilitate the preservation of the physical integrity of Native
American sacred sites, as well as access to these sites, within Oroville.
The City of Oroville is required to conduct consultation with Native American
tribes to aid in the protection of traditional and cultural places, or sacred sites, as
required by Senate Bill 18 (SB 18) in Chapter 3 of the California Government
Code. For the purposes of this Element, the term “sacred site” refers to any spe-
cific, discrete, narrowly delineated location that is identified by a Native American
tribe, or Native American individual determined to be an appropriately authorita-
tive representative of a Native American religion, as sacred by virtue of its estab-
lished religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, a Native American religion.
Under the guidance of SB 18, the City’s cultural resources consultant requested
contact information from the Native American Heritage Commission on January
26, 2006. The NAHC responded by fax on February 16, 2006 providing contact
information for six Maidu tribes: Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians, Enter-
prise Rancheria of Maidu Indians, Greenville Rancheria of Maidu Indians, Maidu
Nation, Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria, and Mooretown Rancheria
of Maidu Indians.
On March 17, 2006, contact letters illustrating the project area, describing the re-
sults of the cultural resources records search, and inviting the tribes to consult with
the City of Oroville regarding the General Plan Update were sent to all six contacts.
Three tribes responded.
A representative from the Mechoopda Indian Tribe of Chico Rancheria responded
in a letter dated May 9, 2006 withdrawing from consultation with the City regarding
changes to the Oroville General Plan.

In a letter dated April 25, 2006, a representative of the Greenville Rancheria indi-
cated that they were interested in consulting with the City regarding changes to the
General Plan. The City of Oroville planning staff contacted the Greenville
Rancheria in late December of 2007. A meeting was scheduled and held with Mi-
chael DeSpain, the representative of the Greenville Rancheria on January 4, 2008.
City staff provided a summary review of the changes to the General Plan including
sphere expansion and contraction area as well as land uses and densities. Mr. DeS-
pain indicated that the tribe was interested in promoting the overall stewardship of
the land in terms of resource conservation. A concern over development in the
Oroville area was the disturbance of mine tailings which could release residual mer-
cury deposits left over from mining activities into the Feather River. Mr. DeSpain
expressed a desire to see more public facilities, interpretive centers, or interpretive
kiosks that provide information about the tribal history of the area. A copy of the
Steering Committee Draft General Plan was provided to Mr. DeSpain with the
expectation that additional written comments may be submitted.
A representative from the Enterprise Rancheria responded in a letter dated August
14, 2006, stating their interest in consultation with the City regarding changes to the
General Plan. On December 19, 2007 the City of Oroville contacted Ren Reynolds
of the Enterprise Rancheria to set up a meeting with the tribe to provide consulta-
tion on the City’s General Plan. Mr. Reynolds needed to check with other tribal
members before scheduling a meeting and would get back to the City. After the
initial contact two additional attempts were made to schedule a meeting with Mr.
Reynolds and representatives of Enterprise Rancheria. However, at the time of
publishing the 2030 General Plan Public Review Draft, the City and Mr. Reynolds
have not been able to meet. The City will continue its due diligence in attempting
to meet with Mr. Reynolds and representatives of Enterprise Rancheria.
The City of Oroville values its Native American heritage and will continue to make
City staff and representatives available for consultation will all Native American
tribes in the Greater Oroville Area.

2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal OPS-14          Preserve Oroville’s cultural resources, including ar-
                     chaeological, historic and paleontological resources,
                     for their aesthetic, scientific, educational and cultural
                     values.
            Policies
             P14.1 Require consultation with the Northeast Information Center of
                      the California Historical Resources Information System and
                      completion of a records search as part of review of proposed
                      development projects to determine whether the project site
                      contains known prehistoric or historic cultural resources
                      and/or to determine the potential for discovery of additional
                      cultural resources and the necessity of further investigation.
             P14.2 Require applicants for projects identified by the Northeast In-
                      formation Center as potentially affecting cultural resource sites
                      or in need of further investigation to hire a consulting archae-
                      ologist or historian (as applicable) to conduct inventory and
                      evaluation studies and develop an cultural resources mitigation
                      plan and monitor the project to ensure that mitigation measures
                      are implemented, as necessary.
             P14.3 Require that areas found during construction to contain signifi-
                      cant historic or prehistoric archaeologic artifacts be examined
                      by a qualified consulting archaeologist or historian for appro-
                      priate protection and preservation. Require that historic or
                      prehistoric artifacts found during construction be examined by
                      a qualified consulting archaeologist or historian to determine
                      their significance and develop appropriate protection and
                      preservation measures as necessary.
             P14.4 For projects involving federal land, or requiring federal permis-
                      sion (including review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) or
                      funding, work with applicants to meet appropriate criteria for
                      cultural resources review, prior to commencement of work.

P14.5 Consult with qualified paleontologists to identify and protect
         Oroville’s significant paleontological resources.
P14.6 Support the City of Oroville Park Commission/City Council in
         providing direction for the Butte County Pioneer Memorial
         Museum, which helps preserve Oroville’s past and educate citi-
         zens.
P14.7 If cultural resources, including archaeological or paleontological
         resources, are uncovered during grading or other on-site exca-
         vation activities, construction shall stop until appropriate miti-
         gation is implemented.
P14.8 If human remains are located during any ground disturbing ac-
         tivity, work shall stop until the County Coroner has been con-
         tacted, and, if the human remains are determined to be of Na-
         tive American origin, the NAHC and most likely descendant
         have been consulted.
P14.9 Encourage development to avoid impacts to burial sites includ-
         ing:
       ♦ Designing or clustering development to avoid archaeological
           deposits that typically contain human remains and to avoid
           any known cemeteries or other concentrations of human re-
           mains.
       ♦ Dedicating permanent conservation easements if subdivisions
           and other developments can be planned to provide for such
           protective easements.
Actions
A14.1 Work with the State Office of Historic Preservation to conduct
        a formal, comprehensive inventory of historic resources in the
        built environment; if warranted, expand the existing Historic
        District to include newly identified historic resources.
A14.2 Conduct a survey of structures in the Oroville area to determine
        any of historical or architectural significance to the City.
                                                                         7-53

Goal OPS-15          Protect the City of Oroville’s Native American
                     heritage.
            Policies
             P15.1 Treat with respect and dignity any human remains discovered
                      during implementation of public and private projects within the
                      Planning Area and fully comply with the California Native
                      American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and other
                      appropriate laws.
             P15.2 Support access to and ceremonial use by Native American reli-
                      gious practitioners of Native American sacred sites located in
                      Oroville.
             P15.3 Consistent with California Senate Bill 18, the City shall consult
                      with the California Native American Heritage Association to
                      identify Native American tribes that may be interested in pro-
                      posed new development and land use policy changes in the
                      Planning Area.
             P15.4 The City and the Advisory Committee on Tribal Matters shall
                      consult with concerned tribes regarding appropriate procedures
                      to accommodate tribal concerns when a tribe has a religious
                      prohibition against revealing precise information about the lo-
                      cation or practice at a particular sacred site.
             P15.5 Support Tribal governments holding conservation easements
                      over land voluntarily set aside for the protection of cultural
                      places.
            P15.6 Encourage voluntary landowner efforts to protect cultural re-
                      source and tribal sacred sites consistent with State requirements.

I.   Energy Use and Greenhouse Gases
1. Background Information
Leading scientists around the world now agree that climate change is a reality and
that human activities are disrupting the earth’s climate by intensifying the green-
house effect. A balance of naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere determines
the Earth’s climate by trapping solar heat through a phenomenon known as the
greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases like (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide (N2O),
chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor keep solar radiation from exiting our atmos-
phere. In a process very similar to the windows on a greenhouse, greenhouse gases
trap so much heat that the temperature within Earth’s atmosphere is rising.
Greenhouse gases are emitted by natural processes and human activities. Emis-
sions from human activities, such as electricity production, motor vehicle use and
agriculture, are elevating the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
and have led to a trend of unnatural warming of the earth’s climate, which is
known as global warming or climate change. Emissions of CO2 and N2O are by-
products of fossil fuel combustion from motor vehicle and electricity generation.
N2O is also associated with agricultural operations such as fertilization of crops.
Methane is commonly created by off-gassing from agricultural practices (e.g. de-
                                                                                      7-55

composition of agricultural waste, keeping livestock) and landfill operation. Me-
thane is over 21 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.
It is now apparent that the increasing atmospheric concentration of green-house
gasses resulting from human activities is changing the climate in ways that pose
serious risks to Oroville’s health, economy and environment. Increased precipita-
tion and rising sea levels could lead to increased flooding and more pressure on
levee and flood control systems. Mass migration and/or loss of plant and animal
species could also occur. Global climate change could also lead to more extreme
heat waves and heat-related stress in Oroville; an increase in climate-sensitive dis-
eases; more frequent and intense natural disasters such as flooding and drought;
and increased levels of air pollution.
Addressing climate change will require the participation of all levels of government,
all sectors of society and every individual. The State of California has taken steps,
including Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the California Climate Solutions Act of 2006,
which directs the California Air Resources Board to deter-mine what the state-wide
greenhouse gas emissions level was in 1990, and to develop and implement regula-
tions that, by 2020, would achieve State-wide greenhouse gas emissions equivalent
to 1990 levels. The emissions inventories and regulations required by AB 32 are
currently being developed by the State.
Coping with climate change is ultimately part of the larger challenge of fostering
sustainable communities. Climate change goals are more effectively accomplished
when efforts are focused on integrating principles of sustainability within sectors
such as transportation, buildings, ecosystems and water systems.
Using “green building” techniques, which incorporate energy-efficient design, recy-
cled and non-toxic building materials, siting and landscaping to maximize passive
heating and cooling opportunities, and incorporating water efficient systems and
landscaping, can significantly reduce the environmental impacts of new develop-
ment. On a wider scale, a sustainable community can be fostered by development
patterns that reflect compact, neighborhood-oriented infill and clustered develop-
ment that decreases urban sprawl, minimizes loss of open space and natural re-
source impacts, and encourages alternative modes of transportation.
The effects of climate change will be felt throughout all aspects of life in the city.
While local action alone cannot solve the problem, the City of Oroville is commit-
ted at the local level to reduce its contribution to climate change. Because of the
wide-ranging causes and effects of climate change, this General Plan addresses the

issue in several elements. While the aim is to provide a framework for addressing
atmosphere and climate change, the detailed policies and programs that address
climate protection are located throughout the Oroville General Plan.
Policies related to energy use and climate change are identified below and can also
be found in the following elements:
  ♦  Land Use
  ♦  Circulation and Transportation
  ♦  Community Design
  ♦  Public Facilities
2. Climate Action Plan
The City of Oroville adopted a Climate Action Plan (CAP) in 2015 that focuses on
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Oroville. The CAP includes an inventory of
2010 greenhouse gas emissions and models 2020 business as usual forecasts of
greenhouse gas emissions. The CAP also includes a target for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, strategies that will enable the City to meet that target, and a monitor-
ing and implementation plan for those strategies.

Actions
A17.1 Prepare and adopt a Green Building Strategy for Oroville. The
        Strategy should identify the best ways to encourage, incentivize
        and promote all aspects of “green building,” and include goals,
        policies and actions that seek to actively increase green building
        practices into development in Oroville. The strategy may con-
        sider and recommend standards for green building practices.
A17.2 As an interim action, prior to completion of the Green Building
        Strategy, compile informational resources on green building
        techniques, and make that information available at the Planning
        Division and local library. As part of this effort, create a “green
        building” page on the City website, and provide information and
        links to internet resources, such as the U.S. Green Building
        Council and U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Technolo-
        gies Program.
A17.3 In cooperation with local utility providers, conduct an energy
        audit of City-owned facilities, and implement feasible energy-
        saving measures wherever possible. Such alterations may in-
        clude automatic heating and cooling systems, insulation, energy-
        efficient lighting and natural ventilation.
A17.4 Work with energy providers to encourage community-wide re-
        ductions in energy consumption through conservation practices.
A17.5 Train all plan review and inspection staff in green building mate-
        rial options, techniques, and practices.

8 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
  The City of Oroville is committed to providing a high quality of life for its residents. The Public
  Facilities Element addresses the changing public services and infrastructure needs in Oroville and
  presents information and policy guidance to ensure adequate provision and maintenance of facilities
  and services in the City of Oroville.
  Although the Public Facilities and Services section is not explicitly required by State
  law, the topics addressed here are an integral part of the City’s overall planning
  strategy and a basic consideration in setting growth and development policy.
  Additionally, State law requires the Land Use Element to include “the proposed
  general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land
  for…solid and liquid waste disposal facilities” and it requires the Circulation
  Element to include information on “the general location and extent of existing and
  proposed…public utilities and facilities.”
  These required components are included in this Element, which is divided into the
  following ten sections:
    ♦ Police
    ♦ Fire
    ♦ Schools
    ♦ Libraries
    ♦ Government and Civic Facilities
    ♦ Water Supply
    ♦ Wastewater
    ♦ Stormwater Drainage
    ♦ Solid Waste
    ♦ Gas, Electric, and Communication Utilities
  Each section is divided into two sub-sections, as follows:
    ♦ Background Information: Contains information on current facilities and
       public services in the City of Oroville.
    ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides guidance to the City regarding public
       facilities and services decisions.

The Oroville Police Department (OPD) is a small but innovative organization that
is fully committed to the community-oriented policing concept. Currently, the
OPD provides service to a 13-square-mile area. It operates a single central police
station located at 2055 Lincoln Street, and has 21 full-time sworn personnel,
including a K-9 officer, and 14 full-time non-sworn positions. Additionally, the
police department has three part-time sworn personnel, two part-time non-sworn
positions and three volunteers. The location of the police station can be found on
Figure PUB-1.
Currently, the OPD is meeting its goal of a response time of less than 4 minutes for
all emergency responses and 20 minutes for non-emergencies. However, in 2004,
Oroville’s crime averaged 9.84 incidents per 100 persons compared to the national
average of 3.98 crimes per 100 persons. Most of the crime in Oroville is theft
related. The total amount of vehicle thefts, larceny thefts and burglaries in Oroville
results in 8.3 crimes per 100 people of the City’s total crime rate of 9.8 crimes per
100 people. As a result, there is discussion in the OPD, and in the City generally,
as to possible causes of this elevated crime rate.
The OPD does not have any planned facility expansions. However, the OPD has
not been fully staffed in nearly a decade, so there is a need to hire additional trained
officers. The OPD began recruiting new hires in December 2007.
The area within the County, but outside the City of Oroville is within the
jurisdiction of the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. The Butte County Sheriff’s
Office and the Oroville Police Department work together on occasion but
generally do not police the other’s jurisdiction.

C. Schools
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville and its Planning Area are served by five separate school
districts for both elementary and high school aged students. These are the Oroville
City Elementary School District, the Oroville Union High School District, Palermo
Union School District, Thermalito Union School District and Biggs Unified School
District. The location of school districts and schools can be found in Figure
PUB-2. In recent years some of these school districts have experienced declining
enrollment. However, it is anticipated that number of school age children will
eventually increase over the next 25 years.
a. Oroville City Elementary School District
The Oroville City Elementary School District (OCESD) operates eight schools that
serve students in preschool through eighth grade.
  ♦ Sierra Del Oro Preschool
  ♦ Bird Street School
                                                                                        8-9

  ♦  Oakdale Heights Elementary School
  ♦  Ophir Elementary School
  ♦  Stanford Avenue Elementary School
  ♦  Wyandotte Avenue Elementary School
  ♦  Central Middle School
  ♦  Ishi Hills Middle School
Currently, the OCESD’s enrollment is in decline. Enrollment has dropped by
approximately 100 students per year for the past ten years. In 2006, the OCESD
closed Eastside Elementary School, a school of approximately 100 students, due to
declining enrollment. For the 2007-2008 school year, all the schools in the
OCESD were enrolled below capacity with the exception of Oakdale Heights
Elementary School and Wyandotte Avenue Elementary School. The OCESD
anticipates that the number of school age children will eventually increase at an
annual rate of 1.12 percent. 3 It is expected that there will be 669 additional
elementary school students and 250 additional middle school students in the
OCESD by 2025. In general, students in the district make up a diverse population.
b. Palermo Union School District
Palermo Union School District (PUSD) is located in Palermo, just south of
Oroville. It is a “School of Choice District,” which means that it has an open
enrollment policy within the PUSD boundaries.
The PUSD operates six schools which include:
  ♦ Palermo Pre-School
  ♦ Helen M. Wilcox Elementary
  ♦ Honcut Elementary
  ♦ Golden Hills Elementary School
  ♦ Palermo Middle School
  ♦ Palermo Community Day School
Total enrollment during the 2007-2008 school year was 1,347 students. 4 In
addition, the PUSD runs independent/home study programs, the Palermo

2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal PUB-3           Provide educational facilities in Oroville sufficient to
                     meet the demands of existing and new development.
             Policies
             P3.1    Collaborate with all area school districts in their efforts to
                     provide quality public education services to Oroville residents.
             P3.2    Support and cooperate with the Oroville Planning Area school
                     districts in planning for and providing educational services,
                     school facilities with sufficient capacity, and District-wide
                     support facilities to meet the needs of current and projected
                     future student enrollments and employees.

     needs generated by the project, to the extent permitted by State
     law.
P3.4 To the extent allowed by State law, the City shall ensure that
     school facilities to serve new development are available
     concurrently with need.
P3.5 In consultation with the school districts, continue to monitor
     student enrollment projections and projected school capacities
     for use in determining whether mitigation measures are
     appropriate. The City and school districts shall identify,
     establish and implement additional measures to fully mitigate the
     impacts of new development on the school system.
P3.6 Ensure that access to all utilities and services, including sewer,
     water, gas, electricity, and drainage, are provided to school sites
     at the time new schools are to commence operations.
P3.7 Continue to forward all development proposals, rezoning
     requests, and/or General Plan amendments to the appropriate
     school district for review and response. When such information
     is available, notify the appropriate school district of proposed
     development on federal property not under the City’s
     jurisdiction.
P3.8 Require that all subdivision and parcel maps address the need for
     dedication and reservation of school sites where a future site is
     identified in this General Plan.
P3.9 Locate schools centrally to student populations through physical
     and functional integration of schools into their surrounding
     neighborhoods. School locations should be:
      ♦ Centrally located within residential neighborhoods;
      ♦ Central to the anticipated attendance area to minimize
         walking distances;
      ♦ Located to minimize the number of students having to cross
         major natural or artificial barriers to reach the school; and
                                                                         8-15

             P3.11 Work with the school districts to ensure that all school sites
                     meet State Department of Education site review requirements.
                     (7.20g)
             P3.12 Wherever possible, school sites should be cooperatively
                     developed with parks, recreation and open space facilities to
                     promote a diverse array of experiences as part of the educational
                     process and provide additional recreational opportunities for the
                     community at large.
             P3.13 The City shall coordinate with local school districts on the siting
                     and design of school sites in order to facilitate private and public
                     transportation vehicle access and pedestrian and bicycle routes
                     that promote safe and hazard-free access and egress to schools.
                     The City shall continue to apply for funds from the Safe Routes
                     to School program.
             P3.14 Allow private schools in areas designated for land uses that allow
                     public and semi-public uses. The general locational criteria for
                     schools in Policy P3.7, P3.9, P3.12, and P3.13 should be applied
                     to private as well as public schools.
             P3.15 Support the Oroville school districts’ efforts to secure funding
                     for education and the construction of facilities from State and
                     local agencies.

D. Libraries
1. Background Information
Butte County Library System operates the main library branch in Oroville.
Additionally, there is the Butte County Public Law Library which was established
by state legislation and is funded by civil filing fees.
a. Butte County Library System
The Butte County Library System is made up of six branch locations, including the
Oroville Branch Library (OBL). As shown in figure PUB-1, the OBL is located on
the corner of Lincoln Boulevard and Mitchell Avenue and houses the
administrative offices for the entire County System as well as the literacy
department. 10
The OBL is open Tuesday through Sunday and offers services including internet
access, inter-library and branch-to-branch loans, videos, CDs and tapes, books by
mail, research search engines, children’s programs, online book clubs and monthly
book discussions. 11 The OBL is funded by the County and through property tax it
receives as a county special district. Monies are also received from a State public
library fund.
Recent population growth in Oroville has translated to a 14 percent increase in
circulation rates since 2005. However, while use of the OBL has increased,
expanded usage is constrained because of limited funding and space.

E. Government and Civic Facilities
1. Background Information
Oroville City Hall, located at 1735 Montgomery Street, houses the majority of City
departments and is the primary place where residents and business owners address
City-related business. The following departments are located at City Hall:
Administration, City Clerk, Personnel, Community Development & Public Works,
Finance, Parks and Trees, and Business Assistance/Housing Development.
Although the majority of City departments are located at City Hall, only 24 of the
107 City employees work there. Civic facilities outside of City Hall include the
police and fire stations (both located at 2055 Lincoln Street) and public works
corporation yard.
In order to streamline government services and create a one-stop service counter
for development, the front counter at City Hall is consolidated and managed under
the guidance of the City’s Building Official. Community members may also attend
the twice monthly City Council meetings at City Hall, the first and third Tuesday of
each month.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal PUB-5          Maintain facilities and staff adequate to provide a
                    high level of government services and administration

F. Water Supply
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville does not provide water service directly. Oroville is served by
three local domestic water providers: the California Water Service Company, South
Feather Power and Water, and the Thermalito Water and Sewer.
a. California Water Service Company – Oroville District 13
The California Water Service Company – Oroville District (Cal Water Oroville)
supplies water to a large extent of Oroville south of the Feather River, including
the Historic Downtown, the closest portion of the eastern foothills and South
Oroville. In 2005, the population served by Cal Water Oroville was estimated at
10,000 individuals and is projected to increase to approximately 16,700 individuals
by the year 2025. Although the district’s boundaries are fixed, there are a
significant number of vacant and undeveloped lots where growth would occur in
the future.
In 2004, Cal Water Oroville treated and distributed just over 1.1 billion gallons of
water. Approximately 30 percent of their water supply is drawn from groundwater
pumped from four wells, with the rest coming from surface water sources including
the west fork of the Feather River. 14 The surface water resources are purchased
from PG&E and are then processed through a conventional treatment plant.
Currently, there is no set limit on the amount of water that may be purchased. Cal
Water Oroville operates four wells, a treatment facility, and distribution pipeline.
Currently, there are no plans for expansion of the water treatment facility.
Currently, Cal Water Oroville has a production potential of 10.7 million gallons per
day (MGD), an amount more than adequate to meet the current maximum daily
water demand of 6.3 MGD for the Cal Water Oroville area. It is projected that
maximum daily water demand in the Cal Water Oroville will reach 10.5 MGD by
the year 2025, which will approach the combined production potential for ground
and surface water.

b. South Feather Water and Power Agency
South Feather Water and Power Agency supplies water to the eastern and southern
portions of the City and SOI. 15 Formerly called the Oroville-Wyandotte Irrigation
District, South Feather Water and Power Agency serves a district of approximately
17,000 residents, the majority of whom reside in the SOI and Planning Area. The
Agency has approximately 6,700 domestic accounts and 600 irrigation accounts,
supplying water for agricultural, residential, industrial and commercial purposes.
Water is sourced from the South Fork of the Feather River and from the Yuba
River system, and is stored in reservoirs at Little Grass Valley, Sly Creek, Lost
Creek, Ponderosa, Miner’s Ranch, and Lake Wyandotte comprising approximately
171,500 thousand acre feet (TAF) of storage capacity. 16 The Agency also has four
treated water storage tanks with a combined capacity of 5.2 million gallons.
South Feather Water and Power Agency delivers approximately 28,000 TAF of
water annually, and has the capacity to treat approximately 14.5 MGD. The
Agency has begun a strategic planning process to accommodate growth within the
Agency’s SOI, including a strategic financial plan for funding rehabilitation,
improvement and expansion of infrastructure.
c. Thermalito Water and Sewer District 17
Thermalito Water and Sewer District (TWSD) serves areas of the City of Oroville
to the north and west of the Feather River as well as adjacent unincorporated areas
of Butte County. The TWSD serves approximately 9,500 individuals and
anticipates this number to increase to 15,272 by the year 2025, based on growth
rates given by the Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG). Currently,
multiple large subdivision developments are proposed and under construction on
the west side of the Oroville Municipal Airport, part of which is within the
TWSD’s service area. Additionally, significant growth is anticipated in the TWSD’s
service area north of the Thermalito Diversion Canal within unincorporated Butte
County.

TWSD has rights to approximately 8,200 acre feet of surface water from Concow
Lake/Wilnore Reservoir with a 3.0 MGD backup supply coming from four wells,
as needed. Total water consumption is currently 2.5 MGD annually for the TWSD
and is expected to grow to just over 5.0 MGD by 2025. The District’s water supply
is sufficient to meet this future demand as it has secured water rights to 7.3 MGD
annually. The capacity of the water treatment plant was recently expanded to 10
MGD. This is sufficient to meet current demand.
In addition to a water treatment plant and four wells, the District has
approximately 50 miles of water distribution pipe that range in age from 27 to 65
years. Aging pipelines are being replaced in phases. Although TWSD has
sufficient water supply, limited infrastructure outside TWSD may have insufficient
flow capacity to support new development. Impact fees are collected to improve
the water treatment plant, but are not collected to install new pipelines. Developers
are required to either upgrade existing infrastructure or dig wells to supply new
development within TWSD’s SOI.
2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions

G. Wastewater
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville and the Planning Area are served by three wastewater
collection agencies: the City of Oroville, Thermalito Water and Sewer District, and
the Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District. These three agencies have a Joint
Powers Agreement with the Sewerage Commission-Oroville Region to handle
wastewater treatment and disposal.
a. City of Oroville
The City of Oroville currently provides wastewater collection services to
individuals within the city limits. Average dry wastewater flows were 1.7 MGD in
2007 and are expected to grow to approximately 6.5 MGD by 2030 as residential,
commercial and industrial development occurs throughout the City‘s planning area.
Peak Wet Weather Flow (PWWF), defined as a peak instantaneous flow rate
occurring during a 10-year reoccurrence interval storm event, was 11.3 MGD in
2007 and is expected to grow to 20.7 by 2030. 18
The City’s Engineering Division of the Community Development/Public Works
Department is responsible for the City’s system and operates approximately 66
miles of sanitary sewer line with approximately 1,350 manholes and over 11,000
feet of force main. The City also maintains seven sewer lift stations. 19 Figure

PUB-3 illustrates the locations of sewer collection infrastructure, including pipes
and lift stations.
The City’s collection system discharges into the SCOR main interceptor pipe for
treatment at SCOR’s plant. Generally, the City’s collection system is in good
condition, except for isolated areas of older pipe. Any discovered problems are
rehabilitated through the ongoing repair and upgrade program. In 1996, the City
repaired 9,160 linear feet of sanitary sewer pipe that contained 2,300 defects. 20 The
City’s collection system is generally sufficient to meet current demands. However,
these pipelines are not large enough to support additional growth. A capacity
analysis conducted for the City’s collection system as part of the City’s Sanitary
Sewer Master Plan update found that 35 percent of the manholes and 11 percent of
the sewer pipes are undersized to convey anticipated flows in 2030. The Sanitary
Sewer Master Plan update considers funding sources for the improvement projects
needed to address these deficiencies. 21
Some portions of the City’s wastewater collection system that are over 100 years
old and have not been rehabilitated may be subject to inflow and infiltration.
Inflow and infiltration (I/I) can affect the level of service of sewer systems. Inflow
is when stormwater enters the sewer system from such sources as roof drains,
sump pumps, downspouts, etc. Infiltration occurs when groundwater enters the
sewer system through cracks and or leaks in the sewer pipes. I/I increases the load
on the sewer system and can back-up the sewer system or cause treatment plants to
release untreated water into water bodies. In an effort to begin addressing these
I/I issues, the City has conducted two Sanitary Sewer Reline Projects to rehabilitate
and reline 17,500 linear feet of sanitary sewer pipe over the past ten years. 22
b. Thermalito Water and Sewer District 23
TWSD provides wastewater collection services to approximately 1,985 customers
or approximately 2,650 Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDUs). Wastewater dry
weather flows average 0.41 MGD presently and are expected to grow to 0.67 MGD

within the next 20 years. Monthly instantaneous peak wet weather flows (PWWFs)
are 4 MGD. 24
TWSD’s collection system consists of 40 miles of sanitary sewer line with
approximately 560 manholes and is generally in adequate condition. TWSD’s
collection system discharges into the SCOR west interceptor pipe for treatment at
their plant. On average, dry weather flows are at approximately 30 percent capacity
and wet weather flows are at approximately 70 to 80 percent capacity. During
extreme wet weather events, the system experiences the highest level of I&I impact
at the east trunk line. During major storm events the east trunk line has almost
overflowed during rainy days.
Currently, TWSD has issued “will serve” letters that commit to serving
approximately 30 additional EDUs. Although TWSD has issued these letters, there
are no plans for future infrastructure capacity expansion. Developers are required
to either upgrade existing infrastructure or install new infrastructure for new
development within TWSD’s SOI.
c. Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District
The Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District (LOAPUD) provides sanitary sewer
collection services to approximately 12,000 individuals, mainly in unincorporated
areas east and south of the City of Oroville. As of January 2008, LOAPUD
provides service for approximately 5,900 EDUs. Population growth in the service
area is expected to reach over 20,000 individuals by 2025 as significant
development is expected throughout the service area. LOAPUD will likely annex
4,400 acres of the State Water Project area which has been approved by LAFCO
and is pending State Board of Equalization approval. 25
On average, LOAPUD collects 384 million gallons of wastewater annually.
Current dry weather flow is 0.81 MGD and is expected to increase to 1.35 MGD
over the next 20 years. A PWWF was measured in December 2005 at 9.8 MBD. 26

LOAPUD has approximately 75 miles of sanitary sewer line, 1,547 manholes and
six pump stations, with approximately 80 percent of the system constructed in the
last 35 years. 27
In general, the collection system is in good condition and lines requiring service are
maintained by LOAPUD. LOAPUD’s Master Plan from 2000 outlines several
capital improvements, including pipeline replacement, new pipeline installation and
facility construction to be complete by 2020. LOAPUD’s collection system
discharges into the SCOR east interceptor pipe for treatment at the SCOR plant.
Currently, there are no collection capacity issues and no plans for capacity
expansion. Within the LOAPUD system, new development may be required to
upgrade the existing collection system if additional capacity is required. LOAPUD
is currently on track for meeting its construction goals outlined in the 2000 Master
Sewer Plan, having completed all but three of the recommended improvements in
the Plan.
d.    Sewerage Commission – Oroville Region, Regional Wastewater Treatment
      Plant 28
The Sewerage Commission – Oroville Region (SCOR) system and Regional
Wastewater Treatment Plant is the single regional wastewater treatment facility for
City of Oroville and the Planning Area. The SCOR treatment plant is located at
2880 South 5th Avenue, between Oroville Dam Boulevard and Georgia Pacific
Way, as illustrated on Figure PUB-3.
As previously mentioned, SCOR operates under a Joint Powers Agreement with its
member entities: the City of Oroville, Thermalito Water and Sewer District and
Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District. SCOR is responsible for the operation
and maintenance of the wastewater treatment plant and three interceptor lines (or
trunk lines) that collect wastewater discharges from the three member entities. The
treatment plant and interceptor lines are less than 30 years old and are generally in
good condition. Additionally, SCOR is responsible for meeting the pollution
discharge and water quality standard defined by the federal National Pollutant
        27  Butte County LAFCO Municipal Service Review, Domestic Water and
Wastewater Services, February 2006.

Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and State Regional Water Quality
Waste Discharge Requirements.
Currently, SCOR serves approximately 17,500 EDU’s in the City of Oroville and its
Planning Area and has additional dry weather flow capacity to add an additional
2,800 EDU’s. Historically, connection rates to the SCOR facility have grown at a
rate of roughly one percent or 175 EDU’s a year.
As of 2006-2007, the SCOR treatment plant currently receives an average dry
weather flow of 2.9 MGD and an average wet weather flow of 3.3 MGD. 29
Effluent discharge from the plant is expected to increase to approximately
5.2 MGD by 2025. Currently, the treatment facility is capable of treating 6.5 MGD
of dry weather flow wastewater and is therefore adequate to accommodate
increased dry weather flow from expected growth in its service area over the next
20 years.
The treatment plan is permitted by the Central Valley RWQCB to receive, treat and
discharge a maximum of 6.5 MGD daily dry weather flow (July through
September). The RWQCB has no limitation of wet weather flow discharges from
the plant (October through June). SCOR has reported to the RWQCB that the
plant has the capacity to process, treat and discharge a maximum of 15.5 MGD of
wet weather flow. 30
Historical operational data provided to the RWQCB by SCOR show that over the
last 10 years the highest average wet weather flows received by the plant occur
annually in the calendar months of January and February, with average daily flows
based on monthly throughput to the plant of 4.2 MGD. Since 1997, the average
instantaneous PWWF’s during the months of January and February (wettest
historical months) are 12.3 and 12.0 MGD. The highest individual instantaneous
PWWF’s range from 16.0 (January 2004) to 23.2 MGD (January 1997). These

maximum daily wet weather throughput flowrate of 15.5 MGD. During these
timeframes, excess flow is diverted to one or two equalization basins (storage
ponds) with a reported total temporary storage capacity of 26.5 million gallons.
The basins temporarily store peak flows during the time necessary for the storm
event and peak flows to drop below the plant’s maximum throughput level. The
temporarily stored wastewater is then processed through the plant. Data shows
that since 1997 the plant has successfully processed all peak wet weather flows by
using the storage ponds to temporarily store peak flows. SCOR has reported that
the higher historical peak flow events do challenge the plan’s capacity limits.
Continued I&I reduction efforts to be completed by the collection entities in the
upcoming years are expected to reduce peak wet weather flows to the plant in the
future.
In December 2005, SCOR experienced a sanitary sewer overflow in their east
interceptor line outside the plant. SCOR’s east interceptor line conveys the
combined flows from all three collection entities into the plant. This overflow was
of a limited duration, and was caused by excessive I&I contributed by the three
collection entities. As discussed above, continued I&I reduction efforts to be
completed by the collection entities in the upcoming years should have the effect of
reducing peak wet weather flows to the east interceptor line in the future.
SCOR is currently conducting a capacity study, updating its Master Plan and
adjusting its connection fee structure to plan and fund additional improvements
that will address increase capacity needs in both the interceptor lines and treatment
plant capacity. Once the capacity study and Master Plan updates are completed,
SCOR will have an improvement and funding plan in place that will enable SCOR
to accommodate an additional 13,000 EDU’s. SCOR anticipates that this study will
be complete in mid-2008. SCOR will implement the needed improvements
incrementally to meet increased capacity needs.

H . Stormwater Drainage
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville currently maintains six regional detention basins. These were
constructed along different branches of Dry Creek to retain peak stormwater
events. 31 To accommodate the impacts of increased impervious surfaces from new
development, the City of Oroville requires installation of stormwater detention
ponds or underground storage tanks to retain the peak stormwater runoff. 32
Butte County's Stormwater Management Program is a requirement of Phase II of
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program as
ordered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The County's

I.   Solid Waste
1. Background Information
The City of Oroville contracts all solid waste collection and recycling services with
Norcal Waste Systems of Butte County, Inc. Norcal has 600 vehicles operating 24
hours per day and provides commercial and residential garbage and recycling
collection, debris box service and compactor service for residents and businesses of
Butte County. In addition, the company operates a materials recovery facility, a
transfer station, a household hazardous waste facility, a scrap metal public drop-off
center, a recycling buyback center, green waste recycling, and construction and
demolition service. 35 The City also operates a hazardous household waste facility
and a buyback center in an effort to reduce the amount and toxicity of waste
generated in Oroville.

Waste generated within the city is collected and processed at the Oroville Transfer
Station, which receives an average of over 200 tons of material per day. This
facility is permitted to receive 975 tons per day. This existing permit volume
exceeds the service area’s needs for the foreseeable future, so there are no current
plans for expansion of this facility. Once processed, waste that cannot be recycled
is transported to the Ostrom Road Landfill, which is located in Wheatland,
California and operated by Norcal. The landfill receives approximately 26,000 tons
of waste annually and its expected capacity of 41.8 million cubic yards is expected
to be reached in 2066. There are no planned expansions or deficiencies at the
Ostrom Road Landfill at this time. 36

                     consistent with the model ordinance promulgated by the
                     California Integrated Waste Management Board.
J.   Gas, Electric, and Communication Utilities
1. Background Information
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides Butte County with most
of its electricity. Electricity purchased from PG&E by local customers in Oroville
is generated and transmitted by a statewide network of power plants and
transmission lines.
Most of the electrical service in the county is carried through above-ground lines.
This is beginning to change, however, as many new developments have started to
run lines underground. Public Utility Commission Rule 28 mandates an annual
                                                                                         8-39

allocation from PG&E to fund an ongoing program to place service lines
throughout the county underground.
Butte County is crossed and served by two general types of transmission lines: a
500 kilovolts (kV) line that is part of the Pacific Intertie System and the 60-230 kV
lines that serve the specific needs in the county. The 500 kV line consists of four
transmission lines that cross the county from north to south. These four lines
appear as a unified structure that runs through a wide right-of-way to a major
substation on Cottonwood Road west of Table Mountain. The 60-230 kV lines
conduct electricity from the 500 kV lines and local substations to serve the users in
the county. The siting of transmission lines is evaluated on a case-by-case basis as
there are no designated transmission line corridors identified in the county.
PG&E also supplies most of the natural gas used within Oroville. Much of this
supply comes from Canada and is supplied to the region through the Hershey
station in Colusa County.
AT&T provides telephone service for the City of Oroville. The main office is
located in Chico, with district offices in Oroville, Paradise, Paradise Pines, and
Biggs. At present, most of the AT&T service lines within Oroville are above
ground. Underground service has become more common for new development
projects, however, and each project is evaluated to determine the economic
feasibility of underground service. AT&T participates in a joint undergrounding
program with PG&E and has been incrementally placing service lines underground
in designated areas of the county.
2. Goals, Policies and Actions
The goals, policies, and actions in the sections below are organized to enhance
existing public facilities and services.
Goal PUB-10          Provide telecommunications and energy utilities in
                     ways that are safe, environmentally acceptable, and
                     financially sound.
             Policies
             P10.1 Ensure that utilities, including electricity, natural gas,
                     telecommunications, and cable television, are available or can be
                     provided to serve the projected population within the City in a

       manner which is fiscally and environmentally responsible,
       aesthetically acceptable and safe.
P10.2 Review proposed utility projects, including power line,
       substations, and other facilities, to ensure their compatibility
       with surrounding land uses.
P10.3 Encourage utility agencies to use existing transmission corridors
       for future power transmission line development.
P10.4 Encourage future construction of power transmission lines
       underground, where technologically feasible.
P10.5 Locate wireless communications facilities in a manner that
       minimizes adverse impacts on adjacent land uses. Where
       feasible, new telecommunication facilities should be located on
       existing structures, such as the water tower and existing
       buildings, in order to minimize the visual impact of the new
       facilities and avoid the need for dedicated telecommunication
       towers. New freestanding towers and structures should only be
       considered when no feasible alternative exists or when visual
       intrusion would be less than that associated with placement on
       an existing structure or building.
P10.6 Require new freestanding wireless communications facilities to
       be designed to fit into the existing surroundings or camouflaged
       to reduce any negative aesthetic impacts.
Actions
A10.1 Coordinate with PG&E to educate the public about the need to
       conserve the scarce energy resources.
                                                                           8-41

9 SAFETY ELEMENT
  The Safety Element provides information about risks in Oroville due to natural and man-made
  hazards and contains goals, policies, and actions designed to protect the community and its property
  as much as possible from seismic hazards, flooding, fire, hazardous materials and electromagnetic
  fields.
  As required by State law, the Safety Element addresses the protection of the com-
  munity from unreasonable risks associated with the impacts of:
     ♦ Geologic hazards, including earthquakes, groundshaking, liquefaction, and
         landslides.
     ♦ Flooding, including dam failures and inundation.
     ♦ Wildland and urban fires.
     ♦ Hazardous materials.
     ♦ Airport operations.
     ♦ Electromagnetic fields.
  This Element also contains information and policies regarding general emergency
  response.
  Each section is divided into two sub-sections, as follows:
     ♦ Background Information: Contains information on current risks due to
         natural and man-made hazards.
     ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions: Provides goals and policies that are designed to
         reduce the risks to health and property due to naturally and man-made haz-
         ards. Actions are also provided which are to be pursued during the lifetime of
         the General Plan.
  A. Geologic and Seismic H azards
  1. Background Information
  This section provides background information on potential public safety issues,
  relating to geologic and seismic hazards, earthquakes, landslides, and expansive
  soils.
  a. Earthquakes
  Geologic hazards in the Oroville area are related both to the influence of seismic
  activity and to soils conditions. The following section discusses Oroville’s location
  and how it relates to the threat of seismic activity and unstable soils. Figure SAF-1
                                                                                                  9-1

illustrates several geologic hazards, including potential for landslides or liquefaction
and the location of faults and steep slopes.
i. Earthquake Faults
While less seismically active than some areas of the state, Oroville is subject to haz-
ards associated with earthquake fault activity. One known active fault is found
within the Planning Area; other active faults outside the Oroville Planning Area but
in the region have the potential to affect the City of Oroville.
Figure SAF-1 illustrates mapped known faults in the Oroville area. One seismically
active fault, the Cleveland Hills Fault, is located within the Oroville Planning Area,
about six miles southeast of Oroville. This fault is classified as an Alquist-Priolo
Special Studies Zone, to which special development regulations apply. 1 Seismic
activity associated with the Cleveland Hills Fault resulted in a 5.7 magnitude earth-
quake in August 1975; studies estimate a maximum credible earthquake of 6.5 to
6.7 on the Richter Scale could occur on this fault in the future. 2
Other mapped, active faults in the wider region, outside of Butte County, have the
potential to generate seismic activity that could be felt in Oroville. These include:
   ♦ The Midland-Schweitzer Fault, an approximately 80 mile long fault found
      about 60 miles southwest of Oroville.
   ♦ The northern section of the 350-mile long San Andreas Fault, located about
      115 miles west of Oroville.
   ♦ The Hayward-Calaveras Fault complex in the San Francisco Bay Area, located
      approximately 120 miles southwest of Oroville.
   ♦ The Russell Fault, located about 70 miles east of Oroville, which was associat-
      ed with a major earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 in 1966.
   ♦ The Last Chance-Honey Lake Fault, located along the California/Nevada bor-
      der to the east of Oroville.
   ♦ The Willows fault is located about 30 miles west of the Oroville, and the Coast
      Ranges thrust zone is located about 60 miles west of the City.
         1 The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in 1972. Its main
purpose is to prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on top of
active faults.

In addition to mapped known faults, there are a large number of other faults within
Butte County and in neighboring areas that could be considered potentially active,
based on criteria developed by the California Department of Mines and Geology.
Within Butte County, faults that are considered by some geologists to be potentially
active include the Big Bend fault, which is thought to be capable of generating an
earthquake of up to magnitude 7.0 in Butte County; the Foothill shear zone, which
extends into southern Butte County, and the Chico monocline fault, which could
produce an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.0, having the most significant impacts
in the Chico area but which could also severely affect other parts of the county,
including Oroville.
Outside of Butte County a number of potentially active faults exist; those with the
greatest potential to cause damage within Butte County include the Willows fault
and the Coast Ranges thrust zone, to the west. There may also be seismic risk pre-
sented by the numerous faults present in the Sierra Foothills to the east and south-
east, but their status is uncertain and subject to debate among geologists. 3
ii. Earthquake-related Effects
Earthquake-related effects include groundshaking and liquefaction. Groundshak-
ing can be of varying intensity depending on the intensity of earthquake activity.
Oroville is classified as being within Seismic Zone 3 (on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is
least hazardous and 4 is most hazardous) of the Uniform Building Code’s (UBC)
Seismic Hazard Map. This designation is based on probability of significant
ground shaking in a seismic event.
Liquefaction is a phenomenon primarily associated with saturated, cohesionless soil
layers located close to the ground surface. During liquefaction, soils lose strength
and ground failure may occur. Mapping developed by Butte County for its 2006
Flood Mitigation Plan indicates that much of the west and southwestern part of the
Planning Area is considered to have a high potential for liquefaction. Where older
alluvial sediments underlie the Planning Area, liquefaction potential is considered to
be low. Since soils must be saturated to be at risk of liquefaction, the areas in
Oroville most susceptible to liquefaction include areas within the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-year flood zone along the Feather River
and other drainages, and where there are high groundwater levels. 4 Figure SAF-1
shows low/moderate potential areas for liquefaction in the Planning Area.

b. Steep Slopes and Landslides
Steep slopes, in conjunction with certain soil types, can be prone to soil erosion
and landslides. Landslides occur as a result of topographical and soil conditions,
where loose soils move down steep slopes. Some of the natural causes of this in-
stability are earthquakes, weak soils, erosion, and heavy rainfall. Human activities
such as poor grading that undercuts steep slopes or overloads them with fill, exces-
sive irrigation, and removal of vegetation can also contribute to ground failure.
Earthquakes can also induce landslides by initiating strong ground motion. Several
areas of steep slopes (greater than 30 percent), and hills prone to landslides are
found within the Oroville Planning Area. These are primarily concentrated on
hillsides and bluffs in the northern part of the Planning Area as illustrated in Figure
SAF-1.
c. Expansive Soils
Soil mapping is used to help identify potential geotechnical concerns, such as ero-
sion and expansion that are more common with certain soils types. Expansive soils
contain higher levels of clay and present problems for development since these
soils expand and shrink depending on water content. The shrinking and swelling
of soils can damage structures that were not appropriately engineered. Expansion
potential is related to factors including the amount of moisture present and the
proportion and percentage and type of clay minerals present in the soil. Sands and
silts with low amount of clay minerals have a low expansion potential. Different
soil types can be classified based on their expansive properties. 5 These properties
are described below and are illustrated in Figure SAF-2.
   ♦ Low Potential for Expansion: This soils class includes sands and silts with
      relatively low amounts of clay minerals. Sandy clays may also have low expan-
      sion potential.
   ♦ Moderate Potential for Expansion: This class includes silty clay and clay
      textured soils, heavy silts, light sandy clays, and silty clays with mixed clay min-
      erals. These types of soils are not found in the Oroville Planning Area. This
      description is included for informational purposes only.
   ♦ High Potential for Expansion: This class includes clays that expand and
      contract more than the types of soils described above.

2. Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-1      Reduce the risk of injury, loss of life, and property
                damage from earthquakes, landslides, and other geo-
                logic hazards.
        Policies
        P1.1    Group and locate new residential development in such a way as
                to avoid areas of geologic hazard, including steep slopes and are-
                as of unstable soils.
        P1.2    Require all new developments to be subjected to a geotechnical
                study prior to development approval and to mitigate any identi-
                fied hazards to a level of insignificance. If mitigation is not pos-
                sible, do not approve the development.
        P1.3    Encourage retrofitting of structures, particularly older buildings,
                to withstand earthquake shaking and landslides, consistent with
                state Building Codes and Historic Building Codes.
        P1.4    Ensure that new development incorporates design and engineer-
                ing that minimizes the risk of damage from seismic events and
                landsliding, consistent with state Building Codes and Historic
                Building Codes.
        Actions
        A1.1    Develop a City-based public awareness and preparedness pro-
                gram to educate the public of the potential for earthquakes and
                other natural disasters within the Planning Area, and what to do
                in the event of an earthquake or other disaster.
                                                                                   9-9

B. Flooding
1. Background Information
Flooding is an important concern throughout the entire Oroville Planning Area,
with flooding hazards associated with dam failure and release of water, and flood-
ing associated with major waterways.
a. Dam Inundation
Figure SAF-3 maps the approximate areas that would be subject to inundation as a
result of failure of dams in the Oroville Area. Most substantial among these is the
Oroville Dam, located northeast of the city. Other smaller dams, upstream of the
Oroville Dam, also pose a risk of flooding to the city. As shown in Figure SAF-3,
there is also a dam inundation risk from smaller dams in the area, including from
Lake Wyandotte, Bidwell Bar, and Miner’s Ranch dams and Lake Almanor, which
are located further up the Feather River Canyon.
The Oroville Dam sits east of Oroville’s City Center, nestled at the mouth of the
Feather River Canyon. At 770 feet tall and 6,920 feet long, the Oroville Dam is
one of the 20 largest dams in the world and impounds the second largest reservoir
in California. Lake Oroville has a capacity of 3.5 million acre feet and is the princi-
pal water storage facility of the State Water Project (SWP). Currently, the Depart-
ment of Water Resources is undergoing contract renewal for the Oroville Dam
facility with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the City of
Oroville and Butte County. 6
Failure of the Oroville Dam could result in release of water held behind the dam,
and inundation of much of the city and surrounding area. A major seismic event
would be the most likely cause of dam failure. A number of geologic faults have
been mapped in the Oroville area which could cause a seismic event. However,
based on studies of the dam completed following the 1975 Oroville earthquake, the
dam could withstand a 6.5 magnitude earthquake, which is considered to be the
largest credible event projected for the region. 7 Landslides around the reservoir
rim have occurred since Lake Oroville has been in operation. These landslides are

b. Levees
Figure SAF-4 shows the location of levee centerlines for federal and non-federal
levees in the Oroville Planning Area. The majority of levees in the Planning Area
are non-federal levees, and they are concentrated along the Feather River, the west-
ern and southern fringes of the Thermalito Afterbay, and the southern fringes of
the Thermalito Forebay. Federal levees are located in the southwest portion of the
Planning Area, between the Feather River and the Thermalito Afterbay.
Levee inundation area maps are not available for the Oroville Planning Area.
However, the California Department of Water Resources mapped Levee Flood
Protection Zones for State Water Project levees in the Sacramento River Basin in
August 2011, and only a small portion of the Planning Area is included in the Lev-
ee Flood Protection Zone: approximately 150 acres adjacent to the southeast cor-
ner of the Thermalito Afterbay, which is currently used for open space and desig-
nated State Water Project in this General Plan. 9
c. Floodplains
The Oroville area has historically been subject to flooding from various rivers and
creeks found within the Planning Area, most particularly from the Feather River
and its tributaries. Local flooding was much more prevalent prior to the construc-
tion of the Oroville Dam and its related flood control projects, which have helped
to protect Oroville and many other areas of the County from serious flooding in
recent years.
However, flooding remains an issue which regulatory agencies, the City and Butte
County are seeking to address, in part through mapping of flood hazard areas and
study of flooding hazards. Locally, Butte County, in consultation with the City of
Oroville, has completed an assessment of flooding hazards as part of the Flood
Mitigation Plan. This includes the Feather River and Lower Honcut Creek Water-
sheds.

Nationally, FEMA provides guidance for floodplain management. FEMA manages
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides insurance to com-
munities that participate in the program, and works with State and local agencies to
adopt floodplain management policies and flood mitigation measures. Property
owners participating following FEMA regulations intended to reduce or mitigate
losses from flooding are eligible for federal flood insurance coverage.
A key component in the NFIP is the identification of floodplain boundaries, which
are depicted on FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). The concept of the
100-year flood (also termed the “base flood”) is a central component in FIRM
mapping. The 100-year flood represents a flood event that is likely to occur once
every 100 years, or, stated differently, that which has a one percent chance of oc-
curring in any given year. FEMA mapping of flood hazards for all of Butte Coun-
ty, including Oroville, has been completed, with the most accurate and up-to-date
information derived from the January 6, 2011 FIRM mapping.
Figure SAF-5 shows FEMA flood hazard mapping for the Oroville Planning Area.
FEMA flood maps show areas that are likely to flood, though areas not included in
the map may flood as well. Areas at risk for flooding include those along much of
the Feather River, particularly south of Oroville Dam Boulevard, in the southern
part of the Planning Area. Also, areas along Wyman Ravine, Ruddy Creek in Ther-
malito, and Cottonwood Creek in the far northwest of the Planning Area are at risk
for flooding.
Pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 162 (2007), the California Department of Water
Resources (DWR) and Central Valley Flood Protection Board (formerly State Rec-
lamation Board) adopted the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP) in
2012. Every jurisdiction located within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley area,
which includes Oroville, is required to update its General Plan and Zoning Ordi-
nance in a manner consistent with the CVFPP. In addition, the locations of the
State and local flood management facilities, locations of flood hazard zones, and
the properties located in these areas must be mapped and consistent with the
CVFPP. This General Plan maps this information in Figures SAF-3, SAF-4, and
SAF-5, which are described above.
AB 162 and the CVFPP also set a higher standard for flood protection for the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Valley area by requiring an urban level of flood protection
necessary to withstand a 1 in 200 chance of occurring in any given year (200-year

2.    Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-2            Reduce hazards associated with flooding, including
                      flooding caused by failure of Oroville Dam.
              Policies
              P2.1    Discourage development within the Feather River floodplain
                      and other flood-prone areas, in order to minimize risks associat-
                      ed with flooding.
              P2.2    If development occurs within flood plains, ensure that existing
                      and proposed structures are provided adequate protection from
                      flood damage and hazards.
              P2.3    Continue to work with appropriate local, State, and federal agen-
                      cies (particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency)
                      to maintain the most current flood hazard and floodplain infor-
                      mation and use it as a basis for project review and to guide de-
                      velopment in accordance with federal, State, and local standards.
              P2.4    Continue to participate in the Federal Emergency Management
                      Agency National Flood Insurance Program – Community Rating
                      System.
              P2.5    Where feasible, given flood control requirements, maintain the
                      natural condition of waterways and flood plains to ensure ade-
                      quate groundwater recharge and water quality, preservation of
                      habitat, and access to mineral resources.
              P2.6    Support a multi-use concept of flood plains, flood-related facili-
                      ties, and waterways, including, where appropriate, the following

            P2.7     Cooperate with all affected or interested public and private
                     agencies involved to ensure that flood control improvements do
                     not result in unacceptable degradation of environmentally sensi-
                     tive areas.
            P2.8     Incorporate stormwater drainage systems in development pro-
                     jects to effectively control the rate and amount of runoff, so as
                     to prevent increases in downstream flooding potential.
            P2.9     Explore the possibility of creating an additional stormwater de-

            P2.10 If future studies establish a conclusive relationship between res-
                     ervoir drawdown, refilling, and seismic activity, encourage the
                     Department of Water Resources to manage the Oroville Dam
                     water regime to reduce risk.
            P2.11 Prior to project approval, consult Flood Insurance Rate Maps on
                     file with the Planning Department to identify areas in the vicinity
                     of a waterway or drainage course that have not been subject to
                     detailed study. If the project falls within an area that has not
                     been studied, perform studies and, if necessary, require mitiga-
                     tion or restrictions on development.
            Actions
            A2.1     Incorporate Federal Emergency Management Agency map
                     changes and incorporate mapped revisions to the 100-year flood

C. Wildland and Urban Fire
1. Background Information
Both wildland and urban fires pose a risk to Oroville and its Planning Area.
a. Wildland Fire
Wildland fire hazards are most pronounced in rural-urban interface areas, or where
urban development is located close to open space areas where vegetation serves as
fuel. Calculation of threat from wildfire hazard is based on a number of factors
including fuel loading (vegetation), topography, and climatic conditions such as
winds, humidity and temperature, as well as the proximity of structures and urban
development to fire hazards. Generally speaking, the late summer and early fall,
when vegetation is at its driest, are the periods of greatest risk for wildland fire.
Human activity, including residential and agricultural burning, careless disposal of
cigarettes, campfires, arson and use of fireworks can all trigger fires; natural causes
such as lightning strikes may also be a cause.
Figure SAF-6 maps the wildland fire risk in Oroville, based on data from the Cali-
fornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), based on the
proximity of population density to those areas most likely to be at risk due to pre-
                                                                                   9-19

vailing physical and climatic conditions. Most areas of Oroville face some level of
threat from wildland fire. The eastern part of the Oroville Planning Area is at the
greatest risk and is designated as a High Fire Hazard Severity Zone by CAL FIRE.
This is due to the location of homes within areas of denser vegetation, and where
steep slopes and other similar conditions exist. The risk of losses as a result of
wildland fire can be amplified by the relatively poor access provided by rural roads
and the lack of fire hydrants.
Historical wildfire perimeters dating back to 1950 in the Oroville Planning Area are
mapped in Figure SAF-7. The map clearly illustrates that the majority of wildfires
in the Oroville Planning Area since 1990 occurred in the areas west of the railroad
tracks, including large areas north of the Thermalito Forebay during the 1990-1999
period, and near the Feather River south of Thermalito and west of Palermo since
2000. Wildfires during the 1950s and 1960s primarily occurred in areas east of the
railroad tracks, including in the foothills north and east of the city and in the area
north of Palermo.
b. Urban Fire
Urban fire risk is greatest in older structures and neighborhoods built before mod-
ern building codes for fire safety and building systems were in place. Other factors
affecting urban fire risk and relative likelihood of loss of life or property include
building age, height, and use; storage of flammable material; building construction
materials; availability of sprinkler systems; and proximity to a fire station and hy-
drants.
c. Fire Protection and Response
Responsibility for prevention and response to wildland fire is provided by the
Oroville Fire Department (OFD), while unincorporated portions of the Planning
Area are served by the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection/Butte
County Fire Department (CAL FIRE/BCFD) and the El Medio Fire Department.
The OFD, CAL FIRE/BCFD and El Medio Fire Department have an automatic
aid agreement, in which personnel and equipment are shared in the event of an
emergency. More information on these agencies is provided in the Public Facilities
and Service Element.
In State Board of Forestry-designated State Responsibility Areas (SRAs), shown in
Figure SAF-8, the State has fiscal responsibility for preventing and suppressing
wildfires. Due to the heightened risk of wildfire and increased potential for damage
or loss in SRAs, development within these areas must comply with special building

Notes: CAL FIRE is remapping Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ)
for State Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) in Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) to
provide updated map zones, based on new data, science, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          FIGURE SAF -6

2.   Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal SAF-3         Protect lives and property from risks associated with
                   wildland and urban fire.
           Policies
           P3.1    Enforce fire protection standards as specified by the City of
                   Oroville Fire Department, Butte County Fire Department, and
                   California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection within
                   rural and undeveloped portions of the Planning Area and in the
                   urban-wildland interface, including implementation of fire safety
                   ordinances to minimize wildland fire hazards, including incorpo-
                   ration of fire resistant building and roofing materials, and at-
                   tainment and maintenance of “defensible space.” Defensible
                   space may include revegetation with less flammable species, such
                   as fire resistant native and adapted species, and the use of mulch
                   to prevent erosion on bare soil.
           P3.2    Ensure that the development review process addresses wildland
                   fire risk, including assessment of both construction- and project-
                   related fire risks particularly in areas of the City most susceptible
                   to fire hazards. Review fire safety plans and provisions, con-
                   sistent with California Public Resources Code (PRC) 4290 and
                   4291, for new development, including aspects such as emergency
                   access, site design for maintenance of defensible space, and use
                   of non-combustible materials.
           P3.3    Require that all development in areas of potential wildland fire
                   hazards, including areas designated by CAL FIRE as High Fire
                   Hazard Severity Zones, include the following:
                      ♦ Fire breaks adjoining open space areas.
                      ♦ Adequate access to adjoining open space areas.
                      ♦ Adequate clearance around structures.
                                                                                      9-25

                       ♦ Fire-resistant ground cover.
                       ♦ Fire-resistant roofing materials.
                       ♦ Adequate emergency water flow.
            P3.4     Incorporate drought-resistant and fire-resistant plants in public
                     works projects in areas subject to wildland fires.
            P3.5     Regularly train Oroville Fire Department staff for wildland fire-
                     fighting conditions.
            Actions
            A3.1     Revise the Fire Sprinkler Ordinance to provide protection in re-
                     mote areas that cannot achieve adequate fire flows in the water
                     systems.
D. H azardous Materials
1. Background Information
Historical gold mining operations along the Feather River and local creeks created
large deposits of mine tailings, most of which have been dispersed or carried down-
stream over the past century. However, some in areas adjacent to the Feather Riv-
er and local creeks, undisturbed deposits may remain. Although these deposits
have not been extensively analyzed, there is a potential that concentrations of heavy
metals may exist within these undisturbed deposits as a result of the nineteenth-
century mining practices.
In more recent times, hazardous materials include a wide variety of substances
commonly used in households and businesses. Used motor oil, paint, solvents,
lawn care and gardening products, household cleaners, gasoline, and refrigerants
are among the diverse range of substances classified as hazardous materials. Nearly
all businesses and residences generate some amount of hazardous waste; certain
businesses and industries generate larger amounts of such substances, including gas
stations, automotive service and repair shops, printers, dry cleaners, and photo
processors. Hospitals, clinics, and laboratories generate medical waste, much of
which is also potentially hazardous.

In addition to these sources, material that is toxic or hazardous is routinely trans-
ported through Oroville on local roads and railway lines, and could be subject to
accidental release.
a. Hazardous Materials Regulation
Use, storage and transportation of hazardous wastes is heavily regulated by federal,
State and local agencies, including the California Department of Toxic Substances
Control (DTSC), which is authorized to implement the regulations of the EPA.
b. Hazardous Material Response
In Butte County, there is a unified team that serves as first responders to hazardous
materials incidents or emergencies. The team was first organized by the Butte
County Fire Chiefs Association beginning in 1989 through the use of a Joint Pow-
ers Agreement. Team members are from the fire departments of Chico, Oroville,
Paradise, Biggs, Gridley, and Butte County, and CAL FIRE. The team staffs two
units and is composed of specialists and technicians. Haz Mat 64 is stationed at the
Kelly Ridge Fire/Butte County Station, and Haz Mat 1 is stationed at Chico Sta-
tion 1.
Hazardous materials incidents result from cleanup of waste, especially drug labs,
highway collisions involving tankers or other hazardous transporters, industrial
accidents, accidental rupture of a pipeline or tank during construction or demoli-
tion, or from a natural disaster such as a flood or landslide which damages a haz-
ardous materials container or pipeline. Handling of such emergencies is regulated
under both federal and State laws, which are designed primarily to protect human
health and, secondarily, to safeguard the environment.
c. Hazardous Waste Collection
There is no landfill facility in the county equipped to handle hazardous waste dis-
posal. Norcal Waste Systems of Butte County operates a household hazardous
waste collection and transfer service in Oroville, which is open two days per month
to Oroville residents and customers of Norcal Waste. Butte County also operates a
Permanent Household Hazardous Waste Collection Facility (PHHWCF), which is
located outside of Chico, near the airport, and is open to all county residents. Both
facilities receive small quantities of household hazardous waste from domestic
sources and from some designated Small Quantity Generators.

d. Hazardous Materials Sites
The DTSC oversees designation, monitoring and cleanup of contaminated sites in
the State. The DTSC maintains a database of such sites. These sites are identified
in Figure SAF-9 and are described below:
  ♦ Koppers Industries Site, Baggett-Marysville Road. This site is designated
      as a Federal Superfund Site, with contamination detected in both soils and off-
      site groundwater. Cleanup began in 1993, and although soils cleanup to indus-
      trial standards has been completed, groundwater contamination remains.
  ♦ Louisiana Pacific Corporation Site. Located at Highway 70 and Georgia
      Pacific Way, the site consists of a sawmill and lumber treatment facility and a
      115-acre landfill. Prior to 1988, LP used a fungicide spray containing penta-
      chlorophenol (PCP) to prevent discoloration of cut lumber. In 1973, the Cali-
      fornia Department of Water Resources discovered PCP contamination in local
      groundwater. Since 1973, state agencies have monitored the LP site and have
      detected PCP contamination in surface water, sawdust, and wood waste. In
      1986, the site was added to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
      National Priority List. EPA determined that pentachlorophenol (PCP) con-
      taminated groundwater is the responsibility of the adjacent Koppers facility.
  ♦ Ophir Road Property. The site is located in the City of Oroville in a mixed
      agricultural and industrial area, and has been used for the accumulation of ma-
      terials related to salvage and metal recycling. Hazardous wastes including ar-
      senic, copper, chromium, lead, zinc, and a group of compounds known as pol-
      ychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were detected in the surface soil and waste piles
      at the Site.
  ♦ Oroville Municipal Airfield. This 804-acre site is currently the site of the
      Oroville Municipal Airport and Airport Business Park. Several underground
      storage tanks were located on the site, but have been removed. The site is des-
      ignated as a State Response site, which identifies a confirmed release site where
      DTSC is involved in remediation, either in a lead or oversight capacity. Since
      1997, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board has been in
      charge of the remediation for the site.

  ♦ Sierra Pacific Site. This site, located at 1980 Kusel Road, is also designated a
      State Response site. The facility has been used primarily as a plywood manu-
      facturing plant and wood molding facility, and is currently in operation. On-
      site soils are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin.
      Although present levels are considered acceptable for the current industrial
      use, restrictive actions may be necessary to prohibit development of the prop-
      erty for future uses that present an unacceptable risk.
  ♦ Western Pacific Railroad Company. Located approximately one mile
      southwest of Oroville between Lincoln Road and Baggett Marysville Road,
      The site encompasses an area of approximately 90 acres which is cut by the
      still active north-south oriented main rail line and switching yard. The con-
      tamination site is not currently active, is fenced and dust control has been im-
      plemented. Land use restrictions for the site include no groundwater or oil ex-
      traction at any depth without approval. Residential and agricultural uses, as
      well as hospital, school, day care, and elder care facilities are prohibited.
In addition to these three sites, the Foothill Boulevard Middle School site, which is
located on a former agricultural field where spray residues were detected, was sub-
ject to voluntary cleanup and was certified by DTSC as having been remediated
satisfactorily in 2004. Two other federal Superfund sites in Oroville, the Louisiana
Pacific Facility and Western Pacific Railroad site, have been delisted. 11

E. Airport Operations
1. Background Information
The Oroville Municipal Airport is located in the far western part of the City. The
airport has been in operation since the 1930s, and has undergone a series of im-
provements since then. The most recent Airport Master Plan was adopted in 1990.
The airport is managed by the City of Oroville, although the Butte County Airport
Land Use Commission is charged with promoting land use compatibility around
the County’s airports in order to minimize public exposure to excessive noise and
safety hazards. The primary means by which this is accomplished is through the
preparation and periodic update of an Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
(ALUCP), the most recent of which was adopted in 2000. Public Utilities Code
Section 21676 requires Oroville’s, and the County’s, General Plan land use designa-
tions to be in conformance with the land use plans and policies of the adopted
ALUCP.
The ALUCP identifies a series of “Compatibility Zones” related to proximity to
aircraft overflight paths. Zone A, the Runway Protection Area, has the greatest
restrictions on land uses, with Zones B1, B2, C and D providing progressively few-
er restrictions. Table SAF-1 describes the allowed uses within the Airport Compat-
ibility Zones. Figure SAF-10 shows the location of the airport compatibility zones.
Additionally, certain uses are not permitted within the Airport Compatibility Zones
regardless of whether they meet the intensity criteria, including
  ♦ All structures except facilities with location set by FAA criteria.
  ♦ Assemblages of people.
  ♦ Objects exceeding FAR Part 77 height limits.
  ♦ Above ground bulk storage of hazardous materials, except as described in
      Chapter 26 of the City of Oroville’s Zoning Code.
  ♦ Hazards to flights including physical, visual and electronic interference.
  ♦ Children’s schools (K-12), libraries, hospitals and nursing homes.

All but the lowest density residential uses are considered “Normally Incompatible”
with Zones A, B1, and B2. Zone C would allow residential uses under some cir-
cumstances, but would prohibit most institutional uses such as schools and hospi-
tals. Most industrial and commercial uses are considered compatible, or compatible
with restrictions (e.g. on building heights) within Zones B1, B2, C, and D.
Other aspects related to airport safety, in particular, how and where aircraft operate
on and around an airport are regulated by other agencies, notably the Federal Avia-
tion Administration (FAA). The FAA stipulates operating procedures for aircraft
operations and air traffic control, and is responsible to navigable airspace and flight
procedures, as well as oversight of pilot licensing.

F. Electromagnetic Fields
1. Background Information
Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) are associated with the flow of electricity. In
nature, phenomena such as lightning and static electricity generate EMF; human-
made fields are generated by sources such as powerlines and electrical devices.
Electric and magnetic fields are analogous to sound, in that they have wave-like
properties related to strength and frequency. Powerlines and typical electrical wir-
ing in building and appliance generate low-frequency fields of 50 or 60 Hertz.
Some studies have linked health risks, including cancer, to certain kinds of power-
lines that generate strong magnetic fields. However, a wide range of studies, most
of which have focused on exposure to magnetic fields, 12 have not shown any clear
or definitive link between health hazards and EMF exposure. Nonetheless, there
continues to be concern about EMF exposure. There are a large number of high
voltage transmission lines in the Oroville Planning Area, mostly associated with
transmission of electricity from Lake Oroville’s power generation facilities. These
lines include a 500 kV line that crosses the northwest corner of the Planning Area,
two 230 kV lines running north-south in the eastern part of the planning area, and
several 115kV lines.
        12 Magnetic fields have been the focus of most studies because they are harder to
shield and easier to measure than electric fields.
                                                                                      9-35

S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
EMF comes from both point sources (e.g. appliances) and line sources, such as
powerlines. The strength of the fields from these sources decreases with distance,
diminishing more rapidly from point than from line sources. A fact sheet pub-
lished by the State of California Department of Health Services notes that the
magnetic field diminishes to background levels within 3 to 4 feet of an appliance,
about 60 to 200 feet from a distribution line, and 300 to 1,000 feet from a transmis-
sion line. 13
There are no federal regulations concerning siting of land uses in proximity to high
voltage power lines. The California Department of Education has established regu-
lations that require minimum setbacks from new school facilities and the edge of a
transmission “right-of-way.” These distances are 100 feet for 50-133 kV lines, 150
feet for 220-230 kV lines, and 350 feet for 500-550 kV lines, based on diminution
of the strength of EMF fields at those distances. Existing schools facilities and
other land uses are not regulated at the State level.

G. Emergency Response
1. Background Information
Butte County adopted a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan in June 2014. The Mitiga-
tion Plan represents a cooperative effort between the County and the incorporated
cities, including Oroville, to document and plan for mitigation of natural and man-
made hazards. According to the document, the overall intent of the Mitigation
Plan is to “reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from haz-
ards.” It identifies past and present mitigation activities, current policies and pro-
grams, and mitigation strategies for the future. The Mitigation Plan also guides
hazard mitigation activities by establishing hazard mitigation goals and objectives.

10 NOISE ELEMENT
   The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify sources of noise in Oroville and to define strategies
   for reducing the negative impact of noise to the community. Noise has become recognized as an
   environmental pollutant that can threaten quality of life and human health by causing annoyance
   or disrupting sleep and everyday activities. With the presence of significant noise sources in
   Oroville, including Highways 70 and 162, the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe
   Railroads and the Oroville Municipal Airport, reducing the negative impact of unwanted and
   excessive noise is an important aspect of maintaining the city’s valuable quality of life and commu-
   nity character, which includes maintenance of a peaceful rural environment.
   State law requires that the General Plan include a Noise Element, which is to be
   prepared according to guidelines adopted by the California Office of Noise Control
   (ONC). In accordance with State law requirements, this Noise Element provides a
   systematic approach to limiting community exposure to noise, including the follow-
   ing components:
     ♦ Quantitative analysis, based on noise measurements and modeling of major
        existing and future noise sources in the community, including both mobile and
        stationary sources;
     ♦ Mapping of generalized noise level contours to be used as a basis for land use
        decision-making;
     ♦ Goals, policies and actions to address community exposure to existing and
        projected noise sources.
   This Element is to be used as a guide to identify and mitigate noise problems in the
   City of Oroville, and it is divided into three sections:
     ♦ Background Information: Provides information as to how noise is measured,
        the effects of noise and land use compatibility.
     ♦ Oroville’s Noise Environment: Describes the noise environment in Oroville
        Planning Area.
     ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides guidance to the City related to noise
        impact decisions.
   Noise data developed for the General Plan serves as a basis for addressing noise
   issues, primarily by promoting development patterns that recognize identified
   sources of noise and by regulation of the location of noise-sensitive uses. Noise
   exposure information provided in this Element will also be used to provide base-
   line information about community noise and noise sources.
                                                                                                   10-1

A. Background Information
This section provides a brief discussion of acoustical fundamentals to assist in un-
derstanding the current noise environment of the City of Oroville. This section
explains how noise is measured and gives an overview of the potential effects from
excessive noise. An explanation of how noise affects various land uses is also pro-
vided.
1. Measurement of Noise
Noise may be defined as unwanted sound. Noise is usually objectionable because it
is disturbing or annoying. The objectionable nature of sound could be caused by
its pitch or its loudness. Pitch is the height or depth of a tone or sound, depending
on the relative rapidity (frequency) of the vibrations by which it is produced. High-
er pitched signals sound louder to humans than sounds with a lower pitch. Loud-
ness is intensity of sound waves combined with the reception characteristics of the
ear. Intensity may be compared with the height of an ocean wave: it is a measure
of the amplitude of the sound wave.
In addition to the concepts of pitch and loudness, there are several noise measure-
ment scales which are used to gauge noise in a particular location. A decibel (dB) is
a unit of measurement which indicates the relative amplitude of a sound. The zero
on the decibel scale is based on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired
human ear can detect. Sound levels in decibels are calculated on a logarithmic ba-
sis. An increase of 10 decibels represents a ten-fold increase in acoustic energy,
while 20 decibels is 100 times more intense, 30 decibels is 1,000 times more in-
tense, etc. There is a relationship between the subjective noisiness or loudness of a
sound and its intensity. Each 10 decibel increase in sound level is perceived as ap-
proximately a doubling of loudness over a fairly wide range of intensities. Tech-
nical terms used throughout this chapter are defined in Table NOI-1.
There are several methods for measuring sound. The most common in California
is the A-weighted sound level or dBA. This scale gives greater weight to the fre-
quencies of sound to which the human ear is most sensitive. Representative out-
door and indoor noise levels in units of dBA are shown in Table NOI-2. Because
sound levels can vary markedly over a short period of time, a method for describ-
ing either the average character of the sound or the statistical behavior of the varia-
tions must be utilized. Most commonly, environmental sounds are described in
terms of an average level that has the same acoustical energy as the sum of all the
time-varying events. This energy-equivalent sound/noise descriptor is called

Equivalent Noise Level (Leq). The most common averaging period is hourly, but
Leq can describe any series of noise events of arbitrary duration.
The scientific instrument used to measure noise is the sound level meter. Sound
level meters can accurately measure environmental noise levels to within about
±1 dBA. Various computer models are used to predict environmental noise levels
from sources such as roadways and airports. The accuracy of the predicted models

depends upon the distance of the receptor from the noise source. Close to the
noise source, the models are accurate to within about ±1 to 2 dBA.
Since the sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at night—because
excessive noise interferes with the ability to sleep—24-hour descriptors have been

developed that incorporate artificial noise penalties added to quiet-time noise
events. The Community Noise Equivalent Level, CNEL, is a measure of the cu-
mulative noise exposure in a community, with a 5 dB penalty added to evening
(7:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.) and a 10 dB addition to nocturnal (10:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.)
noise levels. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn, is essentially the same as
CNEL, with the exception that the evening time period is dropped and all occur-
rences during this three-hour period are grouped into the daytime period.
2. Effects of Noise
There are numerous short and long term effects of noise on communities. These
include hearing loss, sleep and speech interference and annoyance.
a. Hearing Loss
While physical damage to the ear from an intense noise impulse is rare, a degrada-
tion of auditory acuity can occur even within a community noise environment.
Hearing loss occurs mainly due to chronic exposure to excessive noise, but may be
due to a single event such as an explosion. Natural hearing loss associated with
aging may also be accelerated from chronic exposure to loud noise.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has produced a noise
exposure standard, which is set at the noise threshold where hearing loss may occur
from long-term exposures. The maximum allowable level is 90 dBA averaged over
eight hours. If the noise is above 90 dBA, the allowable exposure time is corre-
spondingly shorter.
b. Sleep and Speech Interference
The threshold for speech interference indoors is approximately 45 dBA if the noise
is steady or above 55 dBA if the noise fluctuates. The threshold is approximately
15 dBA higher in outdoor environments. Steady noise of sufficient intensity
(above 35 dBA) and fluctuating noise levels above approximately 45 dBA have
been shown to affect sleep. Interior residential standards for multi-family dwellings
are set by the State of California at 45 dBA Ldn. These standards are designed for
sleep and speech protection and most jurisdictions apply the same criterion for all
residential uses.
Typical structural attenuation is 12 to 17 dBA with open windows. With closed
windows in good condition, the noise attenuation factor is around 20 dBA for an
older structure and 25 dBA for newer homes. Sleep and speech interference is
therefore possible when exterior noise levels are between 57 to 62 dBA Ldn with
open windows and between 65 to 70 dBA Ldn if the windows are closed. Levels of
                                                                                   10-5

55 to 60 dBA are common along collector streets and secondary arterials, while 65
to 70 dBA is a typical measurement for a major arterial. Levels of 75 to 80 dBA are
normal noise levels for development immediately fronting a freeway right-of-way.
In order to achieve an acceptable interior noise environment, bedrooms facing
secondary roadways must have windows that close; those facing major roadways
and freeways typically need specially designed glass installed in window frames.
c. Annoyance
Attitude surveys are used for measuring the annoyance felt in a community for
noises intruding into homes or affecting outdoor activity areas. In these surveys, it
was determined that the causes for annoyance include interference with speech,
radio, television, sleep and rest and house vibrations. The Ldn as a measure of noise
has been found to provide a valid correlation of noise level and the percentage of
people annoyed.
There continues to be disagreement about the relative annoyance of noise from
aircrafts and roadways. When measuring the percentage of the population highly
annoyed, the threshold for ground vehicle noise is about 55 dBA Ldn. At an Ldn of
about 60 dBA, approximately 2 percent of the population is highly annoyed. When
the Ldn increases to 70 dBA, the percentage of the population highly annoyed in-
creases to about 12 percent. There is, therefore, an increase of about 1 percent per
dBA between an Ldn of 60 to 70 dBA. Between an Ldn of 70 to 80 dBA, each deci-
bel increase results in about a 2 percent increase in population that is highly an-
noyed. People appear to respond more adversely to aircraft noise. When the Ldn is
60 dBA, approximately 10 percent of the population is believed to be highly an-
noyed. Each decibel increase to 70 dBA adds about two percentage points to the
number of people highly annoyed. Above 70 dBA, each decibel increase results in
about a 3 percent increase in the percentage of the population that is highly an-
noyed.
3. Land Use Compatibility
Different types of land uses are considered to have various sensitivities to noise
based on the types of activities that are expected to take place in those uses. Land
uses typically deemed to be noise sensitive include residences, hospitals, nursing
homes, places of worship, and schools. Land uses that are less sensitive to noise
include some office and retail developments. There is a range of insensitive noise
receptors which generate significant noise levels or where human occupancy is typ-
ically low. Examples of insensitive uses include industrial and manufacturing uses,
utilities, agriculture, vacant land, parking lots, salvage yards and transit terminals.

The City of Oroville has developed maximum allowable noise exposure levels for
interior and exterior spaces for various land use categories. These maximum noise
levels are shown in Tables NOI-6 and NOI-7 in Section C of this element.
B. Oroville’s Current Noise Environment
As a prerequisite to an effective noise program, the City of Oroville must be cogni-
zant of the location and extent of local noise problems, including major noise
source locations, noise sensitive receptor locations and current levels of exposure.
This data can be utilized to focus noise control and abatement efforts where they
are most needed. In some cases, the control of noise sources may be beyond the
City’s jurisdiction. However, by recognizing these limitations, more effective land
use strategies can be developed to mitigate or avoid problematic noise.
Major mobile noise sources in the city include vehicular traffic, trains and aircraft,
each of which is described below.
1. Traffic
The existing noise generated by vehicular traffic in the city has been evaluated using
traffic volumes developed for the Circulation and Transportation Element and the
Federal Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model (TNM) Version 2.5. Traffic
noise expressed as Ldn at a fixed distance of 100 feet from the roadway centerline
has been calculated for primary roadways in the city. As will be discussed later, the
City uses 60 Ldn as the compatibility standard for most noise sensitive land uses
including residential, lodging, school, and hospital uses. To identify those areas in
the city where traffic noise currently exceeds 60 Ldn, the distances from roadway
centerlines to the 60 Ldn contour have been evaluated. Table NOI-3 identifies the
roadways evaluated along with the Ldn values at 100 feet from the roadway center-
line. Distances to the 65 and 70 Ldn contours are also provided. Figure NOI-1
graphically depicts the 60, 65, and 70 Ldn traffic noise contours in the Oroville
Planning Area.
2. Rail
A Union Pacific Railroad line runs north-south through the city. Burlington
Northern Santa Fe has joint track rights with Union Pacific. There are approxi-
mately 35 train trips through the city on a daily basis. Based on this number of
trips the 65 dB- Ldn contour is located about 190 feet from the centerline of the
track and the 60 dB- Ldn contour is located about 410 feet from the centerline of
                                                                                    10-7

The Oroville Municipal Airport is located southwest of the city. Noise contours
have been updated as part of the 2000 Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
Figure NOI-2 depicts the most recent aircraft noise contours.
4. Major Stationary Noise Sources
Industrial processes and facilities can be a substantial source of noise. Large scale
mechanical equipment and trucks operated at these facilities are the primary
sources of noise. The City’s daytime noise compatibility standard for non-
transportation sources is 50 dBA-Leq, as identified in Table NOI-6 in Section C of
this Element. Table NOI-4 identifies facilities that are representative of major sta-
tionary noise sources in the city and summarizes the range of distances from each
facility to the 50 dBA-Leq contour line.

C. Oroville’s Future Noise Environment
This section describes the projected future noise environment in Oroville over the
next 25 years. Projection of the future noise environment in Oroville was modeled
based on the future land uses and traffic volumes described in the Circulation and
Transportation Element of this 2030 General Plan and in the 2030 General Plan
EIR.

Anticipated train noise was taken from existing levels, since it is not possible to
precisely determine if future train activity will increase, remain the same, or de-
crease. Accordingly, train noise levels in the future are expected to be similar to the
current levels.
The major noise sources in Oroville will continue to be transportation related, in-
cluding roadways, trains and aircraft. Table NOI-5 summarizes traffic noise mod-
eling results for 2030 conditions under the 2030 General Plan, and Figure NOI-3
graphically depicts the forecasted 60, 65, and 70 Ldn traffic noise contours. Trans-
portation noise sources, as well as individual stationary and industrial noise genera-
tors, must be considered in the planning process to ensure long-term noise compat-
ibility. Greater detail on the future noise environment in Oroville can be found in
the General Plan EIR.
The greatest increases in noise are projected along major transportation corridors,
industrial areas and near the Oroville Municipal Airport. Roadways projected to
have an increase in noise include:
  ♦   Highway 70, throughout the Planning Area
  ♦   Oroville Dam Boulevard between Highway 70 and Larkin Road
  ♦   Olive Highway and Highway 162
  ♦   Georgia Pacific Way between Highway 70 and the railroad
  ♦   South 5th Avenue between Oroville Dam Boulevard and Georgia Pacific Way
  ♦   Larkin Road from Rabe Road to Oroville Dam Boulevard
  ♦   Larkin Road from the border of the SOI to Rabe Road
Sensitive receptors along the roadways identified above within the noise contours
identified in the General Plan EIR may be impacted by future traffic noise. This is
particularly true with older homes that take direct access from the roadway or
where individuals in outdoor activity areas such as front or rear yards and porches
are exposed to vehicles driving behind their homes, with no intervening barriers.
Medium to high density residential areas west of Highway 70 and north of Oroville
Dam Boulevard may be exposed to future noise levels exceeding 60 Ldn.
Aircraft operations at the Oroville Municipal Airport are not anticipated to increase
substantially in the future. Accordingly, aircraft noise contours in the future are
expected to remain similar to current conditions. Residential development in the
vicinity of the airport is limited by the 2000 Butte County Airport Land Use Com-
patibility Plan, in part, to limit exposure to noise. It is not anticipated that noise

D. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The Noise Element’s comprehensive framework of goals, policies, and actions ad-
dress Oroville’s noise issues through compatibility, planning and permitting pro-
cess, and noise source reduction.
This Noise Element establishes objectives and implementing policies intended to
limit community exposure to excessive noise levels. Noise/land use compatibility
standards are detailed in Tables NOI-6 and NOI-7. Table NOI-6 summarizes the
standards for transportation (i.e. mobile) sources and Table NOI-7 summarizes
standards for non-transportation (i.e. stationary) sources. Table NOI-8 identifies
significance thresholds for increases in noise based on changes in cumulative noise
exposure.
1.   Land Use Compatibility
Goal NOI-1          Minimize community exposure to excessive noise by
                    ensuring compatible land uses relative to noise
                    sources.
            Policies
            P1.1    Include noise considerations in land use planning, transportation
                    planning and project design decisions.
            P1.2    Require new development to mitigate exterior noise to the noise
                    exposure levels shown in Tables NOI-6 and NOI-7 in the back-
                    yards of single-family homes and in outdoor common use areas
                    in multi-family residential facilities.
            P1.3    Require preparation of a noise analysis/acoustical study, which is
                    to include recommendations for mitigation, for all proposed
                    projects which may result in potentially significant noise impacts
                    to nearby noise sensitive land uses, such as residences or that is
                                                                                     10-21

                    predicted to be exposed to noise levels greater than the exterior
                    or interior noise levels shown in Tables NOI-6 and NOI-7.
                    The following provisions would apply to project-specific acous-
                    tical analyses:
                      ♦ Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
                      ♦ Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields
                          of environmental noise assessment and architectural acous-
                          tics.
                      ♦ Include representative noise level measurements with suffi-
                          cient sampling periods and locations to adequately describe
                          local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
                      ♦ Where the noise source in question consists of intermittent
                          single events, the report must address the effects of maxi-
                          mum noise levels in sleeping rooms in terms of possible
                          sleep disturbance.
                      ♦ Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance
                          with the adopted policies and standards of the Noise Ele-
                          ment, giving preference to proper site planning and design
                          over mitigation measures which require the construction of
                          noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which
                          may be considered to contain noise-sensitive land uses.
                      ♦ Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation
                          measures have been implemented.
                      ♦ Describe a post-project assessment program which could be
                          used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitiga-
                          tion measures.
            P1.4    Require an acoustical analysis and include appropriate mitigation
                    measures in the project design where the land uses listed in Ta-
                    ble NOI-6 are proposed in areas exposed to existing or project-
                    ed exterior transportation noise levels exceeding the levels speci-
                    fied in Table NOI-6.

  Note: Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5dB for simple tone noises, which
  are noises consisting primarily of speech, music or recurring impulsive noises. These noise-level
  standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with industrial or commercial
  uses (e.g. caretaker dwelling).
                           ♦ The significance of noise impacts may be determined by
                               comparison of overall noise levels (including contributions
                               from the project) to applicable federal, State or local noise
                               level standards, and by the expected change in ambient
                               noise levels which will occur as a result of the project.
                           ♦ The overall noise level shall be considered significant if the
                               project results in the exposure of noise sensitive land uses to
                               noise levels which exceed the noise standards in Table
                               NOI-7.

         ♦ An increase of 3 dB will be considered a significant increase
            in the ambient noise level.
         ♦ For transportation noise sources in the City of Oroville the
            increases in noise specified in Table NOI-8 represent a sig-
            nificant increase in ambient noise.

P1.7   Only allow land uses to exceed the noise exposure standards in
       Tables NOI-6 and NOI-7 if the proposed use can be shown to
       serve the greater public interests of the citizens of Oroville.
P1.8   Discourage the construction of sound walls. Instead, use build-
       ing set-backs, earthen berms, alternative architectural layouts and
       other means to meet the land use compatibility requirements
       specified in Table NOI-6 and Table NOI-7.
P1.9   Encourage homeowners to retrofit homes exposed to existing
       unacceptable interior noise levels, and those that become ex-
       posed to unacceptable interior noise in the future, with sound
       insulating features.
P1.10 When considering development proposals in the environs of the
       Oroville Municipal Airport, enforce the noise compatibility crite-
       ria and policies set forth in the adopted Butte County Airport
       Land Use Compatibility Plan. This includes restricting the de-
       velopment of residential or other noise sensitive receptor uses
                                                                       10-25

            P1.11 Reduce potential impacts from groundborne vibration associated
                    with rail operations by requiring that vibration-sensitive build-
                    ings (e.g. residences) are sited at least 100 feet from the center-
                    line of the railroad tracks whenever feasible and that develop-
                    ment of vibration-sensitive buildings within 100 feet from the
                    centerline of the railroad tracks require a study demonstrating
                    that groundborne vibration issues associated with rail operations
                    have been adequately addressed (i.e., through building siting or
                    construction techniques).
            Actions
            A1.1    Develop and adopt an appropriate and consistent Community
                    Noise Ordinance to control noise impacts and to ensure that res-
                    idents are not exposed to excessive noise levels from stationary
                    and mobile sources.
            A1.2    Amend the City Building Code as necessary to implement the
                    policies of Goal NOI-1 and to be consistent with the noise poli-
                    cies and criteria of the Butte County Airport Land Use Compat-
                    ibility Plan.
            A1.3    Conduct a noise monitoring study at least every five years to
                    measure noise levels associated with operation of the Oroville
                    Municipal Airport, and evaluate the noise impact boundary of
                    the airport, in accordance with Sections 3525 through 3560 of
                    Title 21 of the California Code of Regulations.
            A1.4    Periodically evaluate and provide a report to the City Council on
                    the Butte County Airport Land Use Commission’s noise moni-
                    toring efforts, data and noise abatement efforts. Develop neces-
                    sary actions in response to the findings of the report.
            A1.5    Adopt a list of acceptable mitigations that might be applied to
                    mitigate noise impacts to acceptable levels, including specific
                    guidelines for their implementation. Chapter 4 of the US De-

2. Noise Source Reduction
Goal NOI-2      Reduce noise levels from sources such as domestic
                uses, construction, and mobile sources including
                motor vehicles and aircraft.
        Policies
        P2.1    Mitigate noise created by new transportation noise sources, in-
                cluding roadway improvement projects, so as not to exceed the
                levels specified in Table NOI-6 at outdoor activity areas or inte-
                rior spaces of the existing uses specified in Table NOI-4.
        P2.2    Enforce provisions of the Community Noise Ordinance, which
                limits maximum permitted noise levels that cross property lines
                and impact adjacent land uses.
        P2.3    Limit noise generating construction activities located within
                1,000 feet of residential uses to daytime hours between 7:00 a.m.
                and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays and non-holidays.
        P2.4    Require the following standard construction noise control
                measures to be included as requirements at construction sites in
                order to minimize construction noise impacts:
                  ♦ Equip all internal combustion engine driven equipment with
                     intake and exhaust mufflers that are in good condition and
                     appropriate for the equipment.
                  ♦ Locate stationary noise generating equipment as far as pos-
                     sible from sensitive receptors when sensitive receptors ad-
                     join or are near a construction project area.
                                                                               10-27

2 0 3 0 G E N E R A L P L A N
N O I S E E L E M E N T
                       ♦ Utilize “quiet” air compressors and other stationary noise-
                         generating equipment where appropriate technology exists
                         and is feasible.
                       ♦ The project sponsor shall designate a “noise coordinator”
                         who would be responsible for responding to any local com-
                         plaints about construction noise. The noise coordinator will
                         determine the cause of the noise complaint (e.g. starting too
                         early, bad muffler) and will require that reasonable measures
                         warranted to correct the problem be implemented. The
                         project sponsor shall also post a telephone number for ex-
                         cessive noise complaints in conspicuous locations in the vi-
                         cinity of the project site. Additionally, the project sponsor
                         shall send a notice to neighbors in the project vicinity with
                         information on the construction schedule and the telephone
                         number for noise complaints.
            P2.5    Control the sound of vehicle amplification systems (e.g. loud ste-
                    reos) by enforcing Section 27007 of the California Motor Vehi-
                    cle Code. This section prohibits amplified sound which can be
                    heard 50 or more feet from a vehicle.
            P2.6    Support efforts to reduce vehicle and equipment noise, e.g.
                    through fleet and equipment modernization or retrofits, use of
                    alternative fuel vehicles and installation of mufflers or other
                    noise reducing equipment.
            P2.7    Work with Caltrans to implement design methods other than
                    sound walls to attenuate traffic noise along highways in Oroville.
                    Encourage Caltrans to incorporate noise reducing features, uti-
                    lizing alternative road surfacing materials that minimize vehicle
                    noise, during highway improvement projects, when feasible and
                    where consistent with City policies.

B. Terminolog y
Acceptable Risk
A hazard is a tolerable exposure to danger given the expected benefits to be ob-
tained. The level of loss, injury, or destruction below which no specific action by
local government is deemed necessary other than making the risk known. Differ-
ent levels of acceptable risk may be assigned according to the potential danger and
the criticalness of the threatened structure. The levels range from “near zero” for
nuclear plants and natural gas transmission lines to “moderate” for farm structures
and low-intensity warehouse uses.
Acreage, Gross
The land area that exists prior to any dedications for public use, or for health and
safety purposes.
Acreage, Net
The portion of a site that can actually be built upon, which is the land area remain-
ing after dedication of ultimate rights-of-way for:
  ♦ Exterior boundary streets
  ♦ Flood ways
  ♦ Public parks and other open space developed to meet minimum standards re-
     quired by City ordinance
  ♦ Utility Easements and rights-of-way may not be counted as net acreage
Action
A program, implementation measure, procedure or technique intended to help
achieve a specified objective. (See “Objective”)
Adverse Impact
A negative consequence for the physical, social, or economic environment resulting
from an action or project.
Archaeological Resource

Arterials are designed to facilitate two or more lanes of moving vehicles in each
direction and rarely contain on-street parking.
Average Dry Weather Flow (ADWF)
The amount of wastewater that flows into a system on an average day during the
dry weather part of the year.
Base Flood (100-year flood)
In any given year, a flood that has a 1 percent likelihood of occurring, and is recog-
nized as a standard for acceptable risk. (See “Floodplain”)
Bicycle Path (Class I Facility)

an otherwise unpaved area. Bicycle paths may parallel roads but are typically sepa-
rated from them by landscaping.
Bicycle Lane (Class II Facility)
A corridor expressly reserved for bicycles, existing on a street or roadway in addi-
tion to lanes for use by motorized vehicles.
Bicycle Route (Class III Facility)
A roadway shared with motorists and identified only by signs, a bicycle route has
no pavement markings or lane stripes.
Bikeways
A term that encompasses “bicycle lanes,” “bicycle paths” and “bicycle routes.”
Blight
Areas with physical or economic challenges including building code violations; in-
compatible land uses; irregular parcel sizes; high business vacancies; an excess of
bars liquor stores or adult clubs; and high crime rates.
Buffer Zone
An area established between potentially conflicting land uses, or agricultural and
non-agricultural uses, which depending on the impact may utilize landscaping or
structural barriers such as setbacks or roads.

Building Height
The vertical distance from the average contact ground level of a building to the
highest point of the coping, whether a flat roof, the deck line of a mansard roof, or
to the mean height level between eaves and ridge for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof.
The exact definition varies by community. For example, in some communities
building height is measured to the highest point of the roof, not including elevator
and cooling towers.
Buildout
Development of land to its full potential, or theoretical capacity, as permitted under

Used in determining the potential of an area to absorb development: (1) The level
of land use, human activity or development for a specific area that can be perma-
nently accommodated without an irreversible change in the quality of air, water,
land, or plant and animal habitats. (2) The upper limits of development beyond
which the quality of human life, health, welfare, safety or community character
within an area will be impaired. (3) The maximum level of development allowable
under current zoning. (See “Buildout”)

Decibel (dB)
A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human
ear. The lowest volume a normal ear can detect under laboratory conditions is
0 dB, the threshold of human hearing. Since the decibel scale is logarithmic,
10 decibels are ten times more intense and 20 decibels are a hundred times more
intense than 1 db.
dBA
The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels, which weighs or reduces
the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every
increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness even though the noise is actual-
ly ten times more intense.
Dedication
The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction
over the public function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks,
school sites, or other public uses are often required by a city or county as condi-
tions for approval of a development. (See “In-Lieu Fee”)
Density
The amount of development or people per unit of area or property. (See also
“Density, residential” and “Floor Area Ratio”)
Density, Residential (du/acre)
The number of permanent residential dwelling units (du) per acre of land. Densi-
ties specified in the General Plan are expressed in dwelling units per net acreage
(du/acre) and not per gross acre. (See “Acres, Gross” and “Acres, Net”)
Development Review; Design Review

adjacent land areas.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
The size of a building in square feet (gross floor area) divided by net land area, ex-
pressed as a decimal number. For example, a 60,000 square foot building on a
120,000 square-foot parcel would have a floor area ratio of 0.50. The FAR is used
in calculating the building intensity of non-residential development.
General Plan
A compendium of City policies regarding its long-term development, in the form
of maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of
each local agency by the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and

speed.
Level of Service B
Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle movement and
speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
Level of Service C
Denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some limitations on
movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.
Level of Service D

common at peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-standing queues and
blocked intersections.
Level of Service F
Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by “traffic jams” and
stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have to wait
through one or more signal changes, and “upstream” intersections may be blocked
by the long queues.
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)
A five- or seven-member commission within each county that reviews and evalu-
ates all proposals for formation of special districts, incorporation of cities, annexa-
tion to special districts or cities, consolidation of districts and merging of districts

Mixed Use
Any mixture of land uses on a single parcel, including mixtures of residences with
commercial, offices with retail, or visitor accommodation with offices and retail.
As distinguished from a single use land use designation or zone, mixed use refers to
an authorized variety of uses for buildings and structures in a particular area.

from a regional perspective down to the design of individual buildings.
Noise Contour
A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same scale. Noise
levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured in dBA) require noise attenuation
in residential development.
Non-Conforming Use
A use that was valid when brought into existence, but not permitted by later regula-
tion. “Non-conforming use” is a generic term and includes: (1) non-conforming
structures (because their size, type of construction, location on land, or proximity
to other structures is no longer permitted); (2) non-conforming use of a conform-
ing building; (3) non-conforming use of a non-conforming building; and (4) non-
conforming use of land. Any use lawfully existing on any piece of property that is
inconsistent with a new or amended General Plan, and that in turn is a violation of
a zoning ordinance amendment subsequently adopted in conformance with the
General Plan, will be a non-conforming use. Typically, non-conforming uses are
permitted to continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain re-
strictions.

I.       INTRODUCTION
A.       Purpose of the Housing Element
Statutory Overview: All cities and counties in the State of California are required to
affirmatively further affordable housing opportunities within their respective jurisdictions.
Principal requirements of California Land Use Law include: adoption of Housing Elements
as part of each community’s General Plan; inducements to provide affordable housing
through density bonuses and secondary dwellings; limitations on local land use authority
to deny affordable projects or impose conditional use requirements on multifamily
housing; and prohibitions on down zoning or imposition of development standards that
prevent attainment of Housing Element goals.
Housing Element Law: Housing Element law is codified in Article 10.6 of the California
Government Code commencing with §65580. Under these statutes, all communities in
California are required to have a Housing Element as part of their adopted General Plan.
These Elements are to be updated periodically. The law further stipulates that Housing
Elements consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs
along with a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and
scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. In
summary, the Housing Element is required to contain: (i) an assessment of housing needs
and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of those needs;
(ii) a statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing; and (iii) a
program that sets forth a schedule of actions to implement relevant Housing Element
policies and achieve stated goals. A cross reference of relevant statutes to
corresponding sections of the Housing Element is summarized in Table A.
Housing Element Contents: The Housing Element consists of the following major
components:
       •    An analysis of the city’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
            (Chapter II);
       •    An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
            address the City’s housing goals (Chapter III); and
       •    A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
            to meeting Oroville’s identified housing needs (Chapter IV);
       •    The Housing Action Plan for addressing the City’s identified housing needs,
            including housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter V).
B.       Community Context
The City of Oroville is one of five incorporated municipalities in Butte County and is the
county seat. The City’s incorporated area consists of 13 square miles, located 65 miles
north of Sacramento, where the Sacramento Valley meets the Sierra Nevada foothills.
Oroville lies 5 miles west of Highway 99 along Highway 70, a primary transportation route
connecting Oroville with Sacramento to the south and Plumas County to the north.
                                               1                                     June 2014

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                      I. Introduction
Oroville is situated at the head of navigation on the Feather River. The Yuba River flows
into the Feather River near Marysville, and these rivers flow together to the Sacramento
River. Oroville is situated at the meeting place of three provinces, the Central Valley
alluvial plain to the west, the crystalline Sierra Nevada to the southeast and the volcanic
Cascade Mountains to the north. The City’s southern and western areas are primarily flat
river basin lands; the eastern portion of the City is located in an urban-wildland interface
that begins the Sierra Nevada foothills. Development in this eastern area occurs in and
around tracts of oak woodlands and chaparral.
Known as the “City of Gold,” the history of Oroville began along the Feather River before
the Gold Rush of 1848. The discovery of gold at Bidwell Bar, located just east of where the
City sits today, led to the creation of one of the first gold mining sites in California. Now
situated under Lake Oroville, Bidwell Bar brought thousands of prospectors to the Oroville
area seeking gold. Many of Oroville’s historic homes and mansions are remnants from
early settlers of this time who made their fortunes from the Gold Rush. Today, Oroville is
most famous for being the site of the Oroville Dam and is the starting point for the State
Water Project (SWP), which stores and delivers water to over two-thirds of California’s
population.
From the Oroville Dam spillway, the Feather River winds its way through the Feather River
Canyon, past Oroville’s historic downtown, and out to the Oroville State Wildlife Area, an
11,400-acre wildlife area on the southwestern edge of Oroville. Along with Lake Oroville,
the City is bordered to the west by several other large bodies of water, which are part of
the SWP and make up the Lake Oroville State Recreation Area.
Oroville is primarily a single-family residential community with a historic downtown overlay
district and a main commercial corridor along Oroville Dam Boulevard. As of 2013, the
City had approximately 15,979 residents. As a charter city, Oroville operates largely in
accordance with its City Charter, compared to general law cities, which are governed
according to State statutes.
Oroville has experienced population growth of about 23% since 2000, as the housing
markets in both Chico to the north and Sacramento to the south become more
constrained. This trend is a result of the comparative affordability of single-family housing
in Oroville compared to the larger region. Over the Housing Element 5th cycle planning
period, Oroville expects to see this trend continue, with significant residential and
employment expansion.
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Oroville, and
this update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties
numerous opportunities for involvement. Appendix C contains a summary of these
opportunities as well as a list of persons and organizations that were notified during the
Housing Element update process and a summary of comments and issues raised.

D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
State law requires that all portions of the General Plan be internally consistent. The
Oroville General Plan was comprehensively updated in 2009. In addition to this Housing
Element, the General Plan includes the following other elements: Land Use; Community
Design; Circulation and Transportation; Open Space, Natural Resources and
Conservation; Public Facilities and Services; Safety; and Noise. This Housing Element
maintains consistency with the policies set forth in the other elements of the General Plan
through the designation of land uses, infrastructure, and public services to
accommodate the projected housing needs of the 5th cycle planning period. As the
General Plan is amended from time to time, the Housing Element will also be reviewed
and amended as necessary to ensure internal consistency.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.

II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the city’s projected housing growth needs based on the latest Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) are examined. The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent
available data from the 2010 U.S. Census, American Community Survey (ACS), California
Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Department (EDD),
Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG) and other relevant sources.
Supplemental data was obtained through field surveys and from private organizations.
The implications of these findings for the city’s housing policies and programs are also
discussed.
A.      Population Characteristics
        1.         Population Growth Trends
Oroville experienced a modest population increase during the 1990s, but its population
growth has accelerated since 2000 with an estimated increase of nearly 23% from 2000
to 2013, which is substantially greater than the county as a whole (see Table II-1 and
Figure II-1).

        2.       Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the city’s and county’s
population by age group in 2010. This table shows that the age distribution of the city’s
population is, overall, younger than Butte County as a whole (median age of 31.5 years
vs. 37.2 years for the county). Children age 19 and under represent about 31% of the
city’s population compared to about 25% for the county as a whole. Oroville also has a
smaller percentage of seniors (65+) compared to the county (12.5% city vs. 15.5%
county).

        3.        Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of Oroville differs from Butte County in that a slightly
smaller proportion of city residents are White and Hispanic/Latino and a slightly higher
proportion are of other minority groups such as Black, American Indian and Asian (Table II-
3).

B.      Household Characteristics
        1.        Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Butte County as
a whole, as reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised approximately
62% of all households in the city, compared to about 60% for the county as a whole. The
city’s average household size is somewhat larger than the county as a whole (2.60
persons per household in the city vs. 2.45 persons per household in the county). It is
noteworthy that a significant portion of households in both Oroville (30%) and the county
(28%) are persons living alone.

        2.        Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and
composition, and lifestyles. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a
whole. It reveals a significantly lower level of homeownership in the city, approximately
15 percentage points lower than for the county as a whole (43% city vs. 58% county).

        3.        Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Overcrowded households are
usually a reflection of the lack of affordable housing. Table II-6 indicates that over-
                                                               8                                                    June 2014

crowding in the City of Oroville is slightly more prevalent than for Butte County as a
whole.

             Source: 2006-2010 ACS, Table B25014
According to Census Bureau estimates, overcrowding is more likely to affect renters;
about 5% of renter households in the city were overcrowded and an additional 4% were
severely overcrowded while only about 3% of owner households were overcrowded and
none was severely overcrowded.
        4.       Household Income and Overpayment
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community – the
ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to
recent Census estimates, about 32% of owner households and 64% of renter households
in Oroville fell into the lower-income categories 1 (Table II-7).
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Recent Census estimates reported that about 62% of lower-
income owner households and 70% of lower-income renter households were overpaying
for housing. Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other
benefits that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may
need to defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to
deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to
double up resulting in overcrowding and related problems.
   Together, the extremely-low, very-low, and low income categories are considered “lower-income”

Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income (ELI) households. Extremely low income is defined as households
with income less than 30% of area median income. The 2013 area median income for
Butte County was $58,700 (see Table II-14, page 10). For extremely-low-income
households, this means an income of $17,600 or less for a four-person household.
Households with extremely-low-income have a variety of housing needs.
        Existing Needs
According to recent Census estimates, extremely-low-income households represented
about 7% of owner households and 24% of renter households in Oroville. As shown in
Table II-7 above, recent Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data
indicated that about 74% of ELI owners and 76% of ELI renters were overpaying for
housing. CHAS data for 2006-2010 also indicated that about 74% of ELI owners and 79%
of ELI renters had from 1 to 4 “housing problems,” which are defined as: incomplete
kitchen facilities; incomplete plumbing facilities; more than 1 person per room; or cost
burden greater than 30%.
        Projected Needs
The projected housing need for extremely-low-income households is assumed to be 50%
of the very-low-income regional housing need of 419 units, or 210 extremely-low-income
units during the 2014-2022 period. The resources and programs to address this need are
similar to those for other low-income households and are discussed throughout the
Housing Element, including Chapter V, the Housing Action Plan. Because the needs of
extremely-low-income households overlap extensively with other special needs groups,
further analysis and resources for extremely-low-income households can be found in
Chapter II, Needs Assessment, Section E, Special Needs, and Chapter IV, Constraints,
Section A.c, Special Needs Housing.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.       Current Employment Characteristics
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-8 shows that the city’s estimated labor
participation rate was approximately 55% of the working-age population, which is slightly
lower than the estimated 57% for the county as a whole.

D.          Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.

        1.       Housing Type
As of 2013, nearly 60% of the housing stock in Oroville was comprised of single-family
detached homes, while multi-family units comprised about 32% of housing units. About
6% of units were mobile homes and about 3.5% were single-family attached (condo)
units. Table II-10 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type compared to the
county as a whole.

        2.       Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed, may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by lead-based paint
coated windows and doors opening and closing.
Table II-11 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Oroville as reported in recent
Census data. This table shows that about 58% of all units were constructed prior to 1970.
These findings suggest that there is an ongoing need for maintenance and rehabilitation,
including remediation of lead-based paint, for a substantial proportion of the City’s
housing stock.

housing units. The survey found that about 44% of all units were in need of some repair,
ranging from minor cosmetic deterioration to a dilapidated condition (Table II-12).
Observations of the City’s Business Assistance and Housing Development staff indicate
that housing conditions have not substantially changed since that survey was
conducted, although the City’s resources for rehabilitation assistance have declined due
to the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency.

According to the state Department of Finance, the housing vacancy rate in Oroville was
approximately 9% in 2013. For the county as a whole, the vacancy rate was estimated to
be about 8.6% (Table II-13).

        4.       Housing Cost and Affordability
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. According to HUD and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, housing is considered
“affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a household’s gross income.
Table II-14 shows 2014 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices
for housing in Butte County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards, the
maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $440, while the
maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $734. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1,174, while the maximum for moderate-
income households is $1,761. These figures are based on a 4-person household and are
adjusted for different household sizes.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-14 have been
estimated based on typical conditions.

b.        For-Sale Housing
Median housing sales price statistics for Oroville and Butte County during 2012-13 (Table
II-15) show that housing in Oroville is less expensive than in the county as a whole. The
median sales price in 2013 was $125,000 compared to $205,000 for the entire county.
Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-14, housing
affordability is relatively good in Oroville, and many low-income households should be
able to find suitable housing without overpaying. This data illustrates that public subsidies
are required to reduce sales prices to a level that is affordable to very-low- and
extremely-low-income income households.

c.        Rental Housing
An internet search of available rental units in Oroville in February 2014 found monthly
rents ranging from $550 for a 2-bedroom apartment to $2,400 per month for a large
luxury single-family home 2.
When market rents are compared to the amounts lower-income households can afford
to pay (Table II-14), it appears that low- and very-low-income households may be able to
find affordable units, but extremely-low-income households have difficulty finding rental

housing without overpaying. However, most rental units appear to fall within the
affordable range for low- and moderate-income households.
E.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Oroville
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
        1.       Persons with Disabilities
Disabilities may include sensory difficulties (vision, hearing, etc.), cognitive difficulties,
mobility difficulties, or self-care difficulties. Such issues may make independent living
problematic.
Recent ACS data estimated that approximately 3,332 people in Oroville, or about 22% of
the total population, had some type of disability (see Table II-16). As may be expected,
those aged 65 and over had the highest rate of disabilities. Included within these
disabilities are persons whose disability hinders their ability to live independently (6.2% of
the working age population and 24.4% of the senior population). Housing opportunities
for persons with disabilities can be expanded through housing assistance programs and
providing universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered
countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. During the prior planning period the
City amended the Municipal Code to establish procedures to ensure reasonable
accommodations for persons with disabilities pursuant to Government Code Sec. 65008
and 65583 (SB 520).

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
          •      Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
                 and physical impairments;
          •      Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
          •      Is likely to continue indefinitely;
          •      Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
                 areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive
                 language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for
                 independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
          •      Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
                 interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms
                                                                 18                                                 June 2014

                 of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
                 planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and
their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental
centers, and two community-based facilities. The Far Northern Regional Center 3 (FNRC) is
responsible for serving residents of the nine counties in Northern California (Butte, Glenn,
Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Tehama, Trinity, Shasta and Siskiyou). FNRC’s main office is in
Redding and also maintains a satellite office in Chico. As of 2013 the FNRC served
approximately 6,600 clients. The Department of Developmental Services reported
approximately 2,500 clients with developmental disabilities in Butte County, including
approximately 700 Oroville residents in 2013 4. Any resident who has a developmental
disability that originated before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to
people with developmental disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may
include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior
management programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant
development programs; information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis;
residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy; transportation;
consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training.
         2.      Elderly
According to ACS estimates, approximately 29% of owner households and 17% of renter
households in Oroville were headed by someone age 65 or older (Table II-17). Many
elderly persons are dependent on fixed incomes and many have disabilities. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be partially addressed through smaller units, second
units on lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, congregate housing and
housing assistance programs.

        3.       Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Recent ACS data reported that about 13% of owner
households and about 10% of renter households had five or more members (Table II-18).
This distribution indicates a relatively low need for large units with four or more bedrooms,
and over 60% of both owner and renter households in Oroville contain only one or two
persons. Among renters, nearly 40% of households are individuals living alone.

        4.       Female-Headed Households
According to ACS estimates, about 10% of owner households and 21% of renter
households were headed by a female (Table II-19). While female-headed households
represent a relatively small portion of all households, they often have special challenges
of balancing work and childcare responsibilities. All of the City’s efforts to increase the
supply of affordable housing respond to the needs of female-headed households.

        5.        Farm Workers
Agriculture is a significant component of the economy in Butte County, with a total
annual crop value of over $721 million in 2012 according to the County Agricultural
Commissioner 5. The highest producing crops were walnuts ($235 million), almonds ($161
million) and rice ($155 million).
As shown previously in Table II-9, total farm employment in Butte County is projected to
increase by about 100 jobs during 2010-2020. According to recent Census estimates,
there are approximately 2,962 persons living in Butte County who work in the agriculture,
forestry, fishing, hunting and mining industries. Of those, about 106 persons reside in
Oroville (Table II-20). Available data does not provide a subtotal for farmworkers
(separate from those employed in forestry, fishing, hunting and mining) therefore the City
also contacted the Butte County Office of Education to obtain data regarding children
of farmworkers enrolled in K-12 schools. BCOE indicated that there are currently 28
children of migrant farmworkers living in Oroville who are participating in a special
program targeted for migrant farmworker families. However, this total does not include
all children of agricultural workers, therefore it is difficult to extrapolate this data to
estimate the total number of farmworkers living in Oroville.

temporary housing for migratory workers. In compliance with the Employee Housing Act
(Health and Safety Code §17021.5 and §17021.6), the Municipal Code allows farmworker
housing for up to 12 units or 36 persons by-right (i.e., without a CUP or other discretionary
approval) in zones where agriculture is a permitted use.
        6.       Homeless Persons
Homelessness is a continuing national problem. The Butte Countywide Homeless
Continuum of Care conducted its seventh Point-In-Time Homeless Census and Survey on
January 30, 2013. Over 100 volunteers collected survey data at designated sites around
Butte County. The effort yielded 1,221 surveys, which contained information about 1,553
total individuals who were experiencing homelessness in Butte County on the day of the
census. This represents a 12% decrease from the number of homeless individuals surveyed
during the census in 2011.
Stakeholders believe the reason for this decrease in the number of persons surveyed is
the result of funding cuts and dwindling resources, which led to key agency staff being
unavailable for outreach, particularly to people who were sharing the housing of family
or friends. Another reason for the decrease may be because the economy has improved
and the unemployment rate has dropped significantly since 2011. The 2013 results for
most survey questions were similar to the results from the 2011 survey. There was an
increase in the number of children reported, a decrease in the number of persons
reporting sharing housing, and a decrease in the number of people reporting
unemployment or financial problems as the reason they were experiencing
homelessness. The rates of unsheltered persons and chronic homelessness increased.
The 2013 homeless count reported 579 homeless persons in Oroville, which represents
about 37% of the county total (Table II-21).

There are several agencies that provide services and temporary housing to the homeless
in the Greater Oroville area (Table II-22). Appendix D includes the 10-Year Strategy to End
Homelessness, adopted in 2014 by the Butte Countywide Homeless Continuum of Care
(Butte CoC). Butte CoC is a network of local homeless services organizations and
interested individuals. The 10-Year Strategy is a recipe book of solutions that the
community has prioritized as most needed and appropriate for our localities. A key
element of the 10-Year Strategy is community participation. Over a 5-month period, 10

public meetings were held throughout the county in which participants explored the
causes of homelessness, identified gaps in services, suggested potential solutions, and
prioritized solutions most needed and appropriate for our community. 10-Year Strategy
aims to provide a better understanding of what is required to realize meaningful solutions
to homelessness in Butte County.

Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 amended state housing law to strengthen the planning
requirements for emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. SB 2 requires
that shelters be allowed “by-right” (i.e., without a conditional use permit or other
discretionary approval) in at least one zoning district. In accordance with SB 2, the City
amended the Municipal Code during the previous planning period to allow emergency
shelters in the R-3 and R-4 zones. In addition, transitional and supportive housing are
considered residential uses that are subject only to the same standards and procedures
as other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.

The inventory includes all multi-family rental units assisted under federal, state and/or
local programs including federal and state grants, bond programs, redevelopment
projects, local in-lieu fees, housing trusts funds, inclusionary housing and density bonuses.
As shown in Table II-23 there are 11 assisted projects in the City with a total of 845 units.
None of the properties is at risk of conversion within the 2024 time horizon.
G.          Regional Housing Growth Needs
Cities must consider projected population growth and plan for the housing needs of new
residents. The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process is a key tool for local
governments to plan for anticipated growth. The Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP)
                                                                      24                                             June 2014
City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                          II. Housing Needs Assessment
was adopted by the Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG) in 2013 and
covers the projection period of January 2014 to June 2022.
The future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted growth in
households in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of a
parent's home, by a family moving to a community for employment, and so forth,
creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new households is then
adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing choice and
mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost due to
demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors –
household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the new
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories 6 on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
The total housing growth need for the City of Oroville during the 2014-2022 projection
period is 1,793 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table II-24. A
discussion of the City’s resources for addressing this growth need is provided in
Chapter III.

                     **210 of these are assumed to be extremely-low units
6  Although AB 2634 requires Housing Elements to consider the needs of extremely-low-income households,
   the RHNP does not quantify the need for this category. State law allows jurisdictions to establish the
   extremely-low-income need as one-half of the very-low-income RHNP allocation.

A.       Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed analysis of sites with potential for
housing development during this planning period is provided in Appendix B. The results of
this analysis are summarized in Table III-1, below. The table shows that there are sufficient
sites with appropriate zoning to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation. The Housing
Action Plan (Chapter V) contains programs to encourage and facilitate development of
housing for all economic segments of the community.

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section IV.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are no known service
limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior
to or concurrent with development.
B.       Financial and Administrative Resources
         1.           State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) – CDBG funds received during
2009-2013 totaled approximately $2.87 million and are summarized in Table III-2. CDBG
funds were primarily used for housing rehabilitation, public services, economic
development and code enforcement activities.

HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) - Federal HOME funds can be used for a
variety of activities that promote affordable rental housing and homeownership for low-
and very-low-income households. Funds may be used for building acquisition, new
construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer
assistance, and tenant-based assistance. Grant recipients must provide a local match
ranging between 25% and 50% depending on program activity.
HOME funds received during 2009-2013 totaled $2.2 million, which were used for the First
Time Homebuyer (FTH) program. The City also received $3 million in CalHome funds
during 2009-2013, which were also used for the FTH program.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
Program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of
funding low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based
upon population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits
are then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the LIHTC
program include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income.
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) administers a
variety of housing loan and grant programs. Program availability changes over time, and
HCD publishes a directory of available program on its website at
http://www.hcd.ca.gov/fa/Program_Directory_June%202012.pdf.

        2.       Local Resources
Housing Successor Agency - The City of Oroville Community Redevelopment Agency
(“RDA”) was established in 1981 to address deteriorating property conditions and
economic blight. It successfully implemented many revitalization and affordable housing
projects until its dissolution in 2012. All California redevelopment agencies were
eliminated as of February 1, 2012 by the adoption of Assembly Bill (“AB”) x1 26, as
modified by California Supreme Court case California Redevelopment Association v.
Matosantos and Assembly Bill 1484 (collectively referred to as the “Dissolution Act” and
codified in the California Health & Safety Code). Pursuant to the Dissolution Act, the City
elected to become the Successor Housing Entity in order to retain the housing assets and
functions previously performed by RDA. All rights, powers, duties, obligations, and housing
assets of the former RDA were transferred to the City. However, this did not include any
balances remaining in the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund.
There is no significant source of ongoing revenue for Successor Housing Entity activities.
Whereas the former RDA set aside 20 percent of gross tax increment revenues for
affordable housing activities, funding for the Successor Housing Entity is restricted to loan
repayments, rents and interest. These are deposited into a Low and Moderate Income
Housing Asset Fund (“Housing Asset Fund”). Funds in this account are subject to housing-
related provisions of Community Redevelopment Law.
The State legislature enacted Senate Bill (“SB”) 341 on October 13, 2013 to provide
clarification on the functions to be performed by successor housing entities. Under SB 341
successor housing entities face more restrictive limitations on and obligations related to
expenditures of moneys from their newly established Housing Asset Fund. Major changes
relate to proportional expenditure requirements, expenditure compliance periods,
annual reporting requirements, and excess surplus.
C.      Energy Conservation Opportunities
Two basic and interrelated approaches to creating energy conservation opportunities in
residences are conservation and development.
Conservation. Conservation can be accomplished by reducing the use of energy-
consuming items, or by physically modifying existing structures and land uses. The
California Energy Commission first adopted energy conservation standards for new
construction in 1978. These standards, contained in Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code, contain specifications relating to insulation, glazing, heating and
cooling systems, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several other items. Specific
design provisions differ throughout the state depending upon local temperature
conditions.
The California Energy Commission revised the standards for new residential buildings in
1981. These "second generation" standards were then delayed until 1983 when AB 163
was passed which provided options for complying with the standards.
Although the energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy efficiency, they
do not ensure that all available conservation features are incorporated into building
                                             29                                     June 2014

design. Additional measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads,
and overall energy consumption. While it is not suggested that all possible conservation
features be included in every development, there are often a number of economically
feasible measures that may result in savings in excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Currently, the City of Oroville complies with Title 24 for new construction and
rehabilitation of residences. The City will continue to encourage homeowners to take
advantage of energy-saving techniques through retrofitting of existing homes. The City
will continue to publicize the availability of the Community Action Agency of Butte
County (CAA) weatherization program, which provides energy audits and energy-
efficient home repairs for low-income families.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and electric service to Oroville residents.
PG&E offers a variety of energy conservation programs and information services that are
available to residents to help them save energy and money. Local water purveyors also
assist with conservation efforts by providing water conservation devices to help retrofit
older homes and facilities.
The Housing Action Plan includes efforts to publicize the availability of energy
conservation programs and assistance.
Development. Major opportunities for residential energy conservation include insulation
and weatherproofing, landscaping, maximizing solar orientation and lowering appliance
consumption. With the energy crisis of 2001, and the continuing escalation in energy
prices, many new residential structures are incorporating energy conservation
equipment and design, as well as technological advances (such as automatic timers to
control air conditioning, lighting, etc.) to help reduce energy use.

IV. CONSTRAINTS
In planning for the provision of housing, constraints to the development, maintenance
and improvement of housing must be recognized, and jurisdictions must take
appropriate steps to mitigate them where feasible. Local government cannot control
many of these constraints, such as those related to general economic and market
conditions, but others can be addressed. Potential constraints to housing are discussed
below, and include governmental constraints and non-governmental constraints.
A.      Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations, while intentionally controlling the quality of development in
the community can also, unintentionally, increase the cost of development and thus the
cost of housing. These governmental constraints include land use controls, building codes
and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of
developers, and local development processing and permit procedures.
Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, thus increasing the
cost per unit. On-site and off-site improvements such as roads, traffic signals on adjacent
streets, or sewer systems may increase an individual project’s costs of development.
Processing and permit requirements may delay construction, increasing financing and/or
overhead costs of a development. The following describes potential governmental
constraints, which may affect the supply and cost of housing in Oroville.
        1.       Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the City’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Land Use Element provides for seven residential land use designations and a mixed-
use designation, as summarized in Table IV-1 and described below.
Residential areas provide locations for various types of housing throughout Oroville.
Maximum densities for residential uses are expressed in numbers of units per net acre of
developable land, provided that at least one housing unit may be built on each existing
legal parcel designated for residential use. Second units permitted by local regulation
and State-mandated density bonuses for provision of affordable housing are in addition
to densities otherwise permitted. New residential projects shall meet or exceed the
minimum density specified in the land use designation for that given area and shall not
exceed the specified maximum density.

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                      IV. Constraints
Rural Residential Density – This designation provides a transition between sparsely
developed areas and the agricultural areas surrounding the community. This designation
allows for a maximum of 0.2 units per net acre (one unit for every 5 acres) and
encourages large lot development with a rural character, generally on the urban edge.
Very Low Density – This designation provides for sparsely developed areas surrounding
the community. This designation may be either rural in character or developed as
clustered lots if permanent open space is maintained and the overall density does not
exceed 1.0 net unit per acre. This designation allows for 0.2 to 1.0 units per net acre.
Low Density – This designation provides a transition from lower densities at the edges of
town to the higher densities in the center of the community. This designation allows for
the development of land with a quasi-rural character. This designation allows for 1.0 to
3.0 units per net acre. Clustered lots as permitted in the Very Low Density category may
be substituted, as long as the overall gross density does not exceed 3.0 units per acre.
Medium Low Density – This designation applies to more typical development patterns in
areas that consist of single-family detached homes on ¼-acre lots. This designation
applies to a significant portion of the area within the Sphere of Influence. This designation
allows for 3.0 to 6.0 units per net acre.
Medium Density – This designation provides opportunities for small-lot single-family
attached homes, duplexes and townhouses in the more urban areas that are found
primarily within the City limits. Development patterns in these areas allow for 6.0 to 14.0
units per net acre.
Medium High Density – This designation provides opportunities for townhouses, garden
apartments and apartment buildings that would typically be located in urban areas with
major roads, adequate infrastructure and amenities to support higher densities. This
designation allows for 14.0 to 20.0 units per net acre.
High Density – This designation provides opportunities for townhouses, apartments, and
condominiums that would typically be found in specifically urban areas with major roads,
adequate infrastructure, and amenities to support higher densities. This designation
allows for 20.0 to 30.0 units per net acre.
Mixed Use – Mixed use development allows and encourages different but compatible
uses to be located in close proximity to each other. A common example is a single
structure or a group of physically integrated structures that combine residential uses with
commercial, public, entertainment and/or office uses. In multistory mixed use
developments, the ground floor uses are predominantly nonresidential with the purpose
of creating pedestrian activity. Since this designation allows for both residential and
commercial uses a wider residential density range is established along with an
appropriate floor area ratio (FAR).
This designation applies to urban areas with major roads, adequate infrastructure and
amenities to support higher densities. Townhomes, garden apartments, apartments and
condominiums would typically be found in this designation. Single use commercial
development may also be allowed by approval of the Planning Commission. Single use
residential development is prohibited under this designation. This designation allows for
10.0 to 30.0 units per net acre and a maximum FAR of 0.40.

b.       Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The Zoning Code (Chapter 26 of the Oroville Municipal Code) establishes 12 residential
zoning districts and 3 mixed-use districts. Allowable uses within each district are shown in
Table IV-2. All types of residential development except for mobile home parks and
boardinghouses are permitted by-right subject only to zoning clearance.
Zoning for Low- and Moderate-Income Housing. Due to relatively low housing cost in Oroville,
affordable housing can be provided in most residential zoning districts. As noted in the
discussion of assisted housing in Chapter II, deed-restricted affordable housing includes
single-family detached homes as well as multi-family units. Density is often an important
factor that affects the feasibility of low-income housing development. State law establishes
“default densities” that are assumed to be appropriate to facilitate lower-income housing. In
Oroville the default density is 20 units/acre.
The allowable density in residential districts is determined by the General Plan. The R-3 and R-
P districts are consistent with the MHDR General Plan category and allow a density up to 20
units/acre, while the R-4 district is consistent with the HDR General Plan category and allows
up to 30 units/acre. All mixed-use zoning districts currently allow up to 30 units/acre, and a
Zoning Code amendment is currently in preparation that would encourage residential use
by allowing increased density in the Mixed Use-Downtown zone. Since all of these districts
allow development at or above the default density, they are considered suitable for lower-
income housing. The R-2 district is consistent with the MDR General Plan category, which
allows up to 14 units/acre and may also be suitable for lower-income housing, although for
purposes of the sites inventory this district is conservatively assumed to support moderate-
income housing.

Development Standards. The Zoning Code establishes development standards for each
zoning district. These standards can affect the cost and feasibility of housing development.
In addition to density, the allowable building height and required off-street parking are two
of the most important factors that affect lower-income housing development feasibility.
Height Limits – The height limit in the R-2 district is 35 feet, which can accommodate 3-
story development. The R-3 and R-P districts allow 45 feet and the R-4 district allows 50
feet. In the mixed-use districts, the allowable height is 40 feet (MXD and MXN) or 60 feet
(MXC). These height limits do not act as a constraint to achieving the allowable densities
established by the General Plan and Zoning Code.
Off-Street Parking Standards – Off-street parking requirements are summarized in Table IV-3.
Single-family homes are required to provide two spaces per dwelling unit. The required
parking ratio for multi-family units is determined by unit size and project density. Small
multiple-family dwellings (studio and 1-bedroom) must provide one space for each
dwelling unit, multiple-family with 2 or more bedrooms at 14 dwelling units per acre or less
must provide 2 spaces per unit, and multiple-family with 2 or more bedrooms at densities
greater than 14 units per acre must provide 1.5 spaces. Guest parking is required at a
ratio of one space for each four dwelling units. The City of Oroville’s parking requirements

development.

Any single-family residential use located within the Downtown Historic Overlay (DH-O)
District is also located within the City’s Downtown Parking Assessment District, and is
therefore exempt from the City’s off-street parking standards.

c.      Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements, and single room occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall under
the category of extremely low-income households. The City’s provisions for these housing
types are discussed below.
Definition of “Family” – The Municipal Code defines “family” and “household” as “One or
more persons, whether or not related by blood, marriage or adoption, sharing a dwelling
unit in a living arrangement usually characterized by sharing living expenses, such as rent
or mortgage payments, food costs and utilities, as well as maintaining a single lease or
rental agreement for all members of the Household and other similar characteristics
indicative of a single Household.” This definition is consistent with state law and does not
pose a constraint to fair housing.
Residential Care Facilities – In accordance with §1502 of the Health and Safety Code,
“residential care facility” means any family home, group care facility or similar facility for
24-hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision or
assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the
individual. Small residential care facilities for 6 persons or fewer are permitted by-right as
a residential use in any residential zone. Larger facilities for 7 or more persons are
conditionally permitted in the R-3 and R-4 zones. These regulations do not pose a
constraint to persons in need of residential care.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities – Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to
                                                              35                                                      June 2014

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                      IV. Constraints
make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws
and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford
disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Building Codes
adopted by the City of Oroville incorporate accessibility standards contained in Title 24
of the California Administrative Code. In addition, an amendment to the Municipal Code
to establish procedures for ensuring reasonable accommodation was adopted in 2014
(Ordinance 1804). Reasonable accommodation requests are reviewed and approved
administratively by the Zoning Administrator with no public hearing required.
Farm Worker Housing –Housing for agricultural employees occurs in two types of settings:
housing accommodations located on farmland that is exclusively for farmworkers; or
traditional housing that is intended for lower-income households but is not restricted to
farmworkers.
The housing needs of permanent resident farmworkers are addressed through the
provision of affordable housing such as apartments, lower-cost single-family homes, and
mobile homes.
The state Employee Housing Act 7 regulates farmworker housing and generally requires
that facilities with no more than 36 beds (as group quarters) or 12 separate units be
treated as an agricultural land use that is not subject to any conditional use permit that is
not required of other agricultural uses in the same zone. In accordance with state law, a
Municipal Code amendment to permit agricultural employee housing consistent with
state law was adopted in 2014 (Ordinance 1804).
Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing – An emergency shelter is a
facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or homeless individuals on a limited
short-term basis. Transitional housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing
for a homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Supportive
housing has no limit on length of stay and includes a supportive services component
(e.g. job skills training, rehabilitation counseling, etc.) to allow individuals to gain
necessary life skills in support of independent living.
Senate Bill 2 of 2007 strengthened the requirements for local government regulations
regarding emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Unless a city has
sufficient existing shelter facilities to accommodate its need, land use regulations must
identify at least one zoning district where shelters are a permitted use (i.e., do not require
a conditional use permit or other discretionary review). In 2014 the Municipal Code was
amended (Ordinance 1804) in conformance with state law to allow emergency shelters
for up to 30 persons by-right in the R3 and R4 zones subject to the following standards:
              1. Each resident must be provided a minimum of 50 gross square feet of
                  personal living space, not including space for common areas. In no case
                  can occupancy exceed 30 residents at any one time.
              2. Before commencing operations, the emergency shelter provider must have
                  a written management plan, which must be approved by the Zoning
                  Administrator. The management plan must at a minimum include:
                  requirements for staff training; resident selection process; pet policies;
  California Health and Safety Code Sec. 17021.5 and 17021.6

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                       IV. Constraints
                 scheduling of outdoor activities; temporary storage of residents' personal
                 belongings; safety and security; management of outdoor areas; and
                 counseling and social service programs for residents, if any.
            3. Not more than one emergency shelter is permitted within a radius of 300
                 feet from another emergency shelter.
            4. Individual occupancy in an emergency shelter is limited to six months
                 during any 12 consecutive month period.
            5. Each emergency shelter must have an on-site management office staffed
                 by at least one employee at all times that the emergency shelter is
                 operating.
            6. Each emergency shelter must have on-site security, with at least one
                 person present at the emergency shelter while it is operating.
            7. Facilities must provide a refuge collection area large enough to
                 accommodate the number of bins that are required to provide the facility
                 with sufficient service so as to avoid the overflow of material outside of the
                 bins provided.
Based on the most recent point-in-time survey, the City’s emergency shelter need is
approximately 579 beds (see Table II-21). With a shelter size of 30 beds, approximately 20
shelters would be required to accommodate this need. The R-3 (High Density Residential)
and R-4 (Urban Density Residential) zones encompass over 76 acres with more than 130
parcels ranging in size from 2,000 square feet to over 17 acres. These zones include
vacant and underutilized sites with sufficient capacity to accommodate 20 shelters, as
well as access to transit and commercial services required by shelter occupants.
The Municipal Code also permits transitional and supportive housing as residential uses
subject to only those requirements that apply to other residential uses of the same type in
the same zone.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing – SRO housing is conditionally permitted in the R-
3 and R-4 zones. SRO units must contain either food preparation or sanitary facilities (and
may contain both) if the project consists of new construction, conversion of non-
residential space, or reconstruction. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing
residential structure or hotel, neither food preparation nor sanitary facilities are required
to be in the unit. If any unit does not contain food preparation or sanitary facilities, the
building must contain those facilities in a common area shared by tenants.
d.       Second Units
Second units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure.
Zoning Code Sec. 26-16.010 permits the development of an attached or detached
second unit on any residential parcel that contains a single-family home. The maximum
size of second units is 1,200 square feet on parcels less than 5 acres, or 2,000 square feet
on parcels of 5 acres or more, not to exceed 30% of the main dwelling floor area. One
                                                  37                                   June 2014

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
additional off-street parking space is required for second units. These provisions are
consistent with state law and do not pose a constraint to second unit development.
e.      Mobile Homes and Manufactured Housing
There is an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on site,
thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
The Municipal Code allows mobile homes and manufactured housing on permanent
foundations as a single-family residential use in any residential zone. Mobile and
manufactured homes not on permanent foundations are permitted by-right in the UR-10
and UR-5 zones. Mobile home parks are a conditionally permitted use in all residential
zones. These provisions are consistent with state law and do not pose a constraint to
development of manufactured housing or mobile home parks.
f.      Density Bonus
Pursuant to state law (Government Code Sec. 65915 et seq.), cities and counties must
provide a density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential
density under the zoning regulations and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or
bonuses of equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing
developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Section 26-
22 of the Municipal Code establishes regulations for density bonus in conformance with
state law.
g.      Building Codes
State and local building codes and regulations govern the construction of all buildings,
and apply to plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems. The purpose of these codes
is to ensure safe, energy efficient structures. Uniform building standards also help
moderate costs by standardizing construction techniques and materials. This creates
certainty for the developer, the City, and the homeowner and tenant. Finally,
enforcement of codes helps preserve the livability, community appearance, and
property values, as well as help maintain social and economic stability.
The City of Oroville currently utilizes the 2013 California Building Standards Code with no
local amendments. Compliance with Building Code standards often adds to the cost of
construction, however, the City of Oroville, as do all cities in California, requires
compliance to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens.
Building code standards are most effectively applied through a cooperative effort
between the City’s code enforcement activities and the Building Official. The City also
maintains open lines of communication between code enforcement staff and Housing
Development Department staff for referrals for possible residential rehabilitation work.
Code enforcement activity includes both reactive inspections (in response to
                                               38                                   June 2014

complaints) and proactive inspections of rental units. The City will continue to pursue
funding sources that will allow more activity on a proactive basis.
The City of Oroville Code Enforcement Department is managed by the Oroville Police
Department. The Department currently consists of two Code Enforcement Officers, one
Community Redevelopment Economic Development Officer (CREDO) officer and one
Staff Assistant. Code Enforcement Officers respond to reported code violation
complaints, conduct annual neighborhood and multi-family inspections and follow-up
visits, issue administrative citations if needed, promote Neighborhood Watch Groups,
work diligently with the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement Program and assist the Oroville
Fire Department with the annual Weed Abatement Program.
Code Enforcement duties generally consist of the following:
     •    Performing inspections;
     •    Receiving reports of possible violations and relaying that information to the correct
          Code Enforcement Officer;
     •    Sending out Courtesy Notices or Notice of Violation letters to the property owner
          and tenants asking for compliance to correct code violations;
     •    Logging and tracking all code violations in a data system that generates reports
          which detail: addresses visited, code violations found, and compliance. The data
          is used to produce various reports for the Housing Department, Abandoned
          Vehicle Abatement quarterly reports, and Code Enforcement’s monthly reports.
          2.     Residential Development Processing Procedures
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
a.        Overview
Article IV, §§26-50, 53, and 56 of the City’s Zoning Ordinance contain administrative
provisions governing permitting processes in Oroville. According to subsection §26-56.060,
the Zoning Administrator is the designated official responsible for the enforcement of the
zoning provisions. The City Planning Commission and the City Council have review
authority over discretionary permits such as Use Permits, Zoning Amendments, Subdivision
Maps, and General Plan Amendments. The Planning Commission acts in an advisory
capacity in matters involving the Zoning Ordinance and General Plan, with final
decisions made by the City Council; however, for Variances, Use Permits and similar
“minor” discretionary permits, the Planning Commission is the decision-making body.
Applications for building permits, amendments of the code, land divisions, and other
Zoning Ordinance matters, such as Specific Plan applications must be filed with the City
on the appropriate City application. Table IV-4 identifies the most common entitlement
applications along with the typical timing requirements for each type of entitlement. In
                                                 39                                   June 2014

carrying out the provisions of the Administrative Code Sections, the City strives to deliver
high quality development services to the development community, and minimize delays
and actions that would unnecessarily increase costs.
All development applications submitted to the Planning Department are given an initial
review and screening by Planning staff. Based on the outcome of the initial review, some
project applications, depending on their location in the City or on the type of project
(discussed in more detail below), will require supplemental discretionary review by either
the Development Review Committee, the Planning Commission, the City Council, or all
three. A select number of projects will also require review by the Historic Advisory Board.
Most projects, including residential building additions, tenant improvement, and other
minor work involving a single structure are approved ministerial at the staff level. Planning
approvals by staff are usually completed within 10 days to two weeks after submission.

 Development Review             2-3 Months    Development Review Committee Review
b.        Specific Plans
Specific Plans are approved as a General Plan overlay, consistent with the General Plan.
Specific Plans are reviewed by the Planning Commission, which then makes a
recommendation to the City Council, which decides either for approval, denial, or
modification. Since Specific Plans are treated as a General Plan amendment, the City
Council is the approving body. As long as General Plan consistency is maintained,
applicants have the flexibility to propose development standards that differ from
otherwise applicable Zoning Ordinance regulations; property setbacks, allowed height,
density, street widths, open space standards, and landscaping are all items that can
deviate from regular Zoning Ordinance requirements through the Specific Plan process.
In making a decision on a Specific Plan application, the City Council must determine
and make findings that the project adequately meets the City’s performance standards
and review guidelines, as follows:
The proposed project is consistent with the General Plan;
The proposed project carries out the City’s General Plan goals for high quality growth
and development;
                                                    40                                                     June 2014

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
The design and layout of the proposed project will not unreasonably interfere with the
use and enjoyment of existing or future neighboring developments, and will not result in
vehicular and/or pedestrian hazards;
The design of the proposed project is compatible with the character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
c.       Use Permits and Variances
Generally, a similar review process is performed on projects where a Use Permit or
Variance is required, such as when a project requests a reduced front yard setback
because of a physical site constraint, but otherwise meets all applicable Zoning
standards. In such a case, the Planning Commission review and approval process would
typically take 30 to 60 days. For projects where City Council approval is required in
addition to Planning Commission review, such as for Tentative Maps, Annexation and
General Plan Amendments, another 40 days is usually required, for a total processing
time of approximately 100 days, with a maximum review time of 150 days. It should be
noted that required CEQA review, discussed in more detail below, can add to this
processing time. The completion of an EIR may add as much as one year to 18 months to
the overall approval time.
d.       Development Review Committee (DRC)
Development Review is the City of Oroville’s equivalent of architectural or design review.
The Development Review Committee (DRC) is a committee consisting of three members
of the Planning Commission, as well as the Zoning Administrator, the Building Inspector,
and the Director of Parks and Recreation. The DRC reviews the architectural,
landscaping, signage, circulation, grading and similar features of a project. DRC review is
intended to promote orderly, attractive and harmonious development with the City. The
Committee operates as an extension of staff with no discretionary review; its approval is
strictly ministerial and not considered a constraint on residential development.
All new development projects that require a building permit as well as any projects
involving building construction as part of an entitlement application, such as a Use Permit
or Variance, are required to submit for DRC review and approval. No project may be
awarded building permits until the project has received development review approval.
Development review applicants are required to submit for review on a standard City
application and to pay the required fee at the time of submission. Projects requiring a
Conditional Use Permit or a CEQA clearance must obtain Historic Review Board, Planning
Commission, or City Council review and approval. Such projects are subject to the
requirements discussed below. Only the following project types are exempt from DRC
approval:
     •   A project that includes two or fewer single-family dwellings or a single duplex on
         the same parcel; this includes private garages and other incidental, or accessory
         structures.
                                              41                                   June 2014

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                     IV. Constraints
    •   An alteration, remodel, reconstruction, or modification/repair of any building that
        does not increase its gross floor area by more that 10 percent within any two-year
        period.
For residential projects, DRC review and approval is required when a project involves
three or more units on a single parcel. Other than review by the DRC, there are no other
discretionary reviews necessary for multi-family residential projects; therefore, the review
process for both single-family and multi-family residential is the same, except for DRC
review. For non-residential projects also involving a Use Permit or other discretionary
action where the Planning Commission has review authority, DRC and Planning
Commission approvals are conducted at the same time. At a minimum, an application
for either DRC, Historic Review Board and other entitlement applications involving
construction of a building must include the following, submitted to the Planning
Department at the time application is made:
    •   Site plans;
    •   Architectural drawings showing proposed building elevations
    •   Landscape plans showing trees and other landscape material, including the
        quantity, the location of the material, and supplied irrigation
    •   Parking and site circulation plans
    •   Plans showing the location and type of all exterior on-site lighting
    •   Representative drawings of proposed signs and advertising
At the conclusion of the Design Review meeting, the DRC makes design-related
recommendations to ensure the project maintains the City’s standards for a high level of
aesthetic quality.
The DRC meets monthly, and projects requiring DRC review typically take no more than
30 to 60 days to complete the process and render a decision back to the applicant.
Although monthly DRC meetings are held, more frequent meetings can be scheduled to
shorten the review process. Projects involving review by an additional body, such as
Historic Advisory Board or Planning Commission, but short of City Council review, take
approximately 105 days to complete the review process. If DRC and Planning
Commission approvals are combined, as in the case involving a Use Permit, the total time
for approval is approximately 90 days, since both reviews are conducted simultaneously.
DRC approvals are advisory approvals only; the DRC does not have the authority to deny
a project based on the proposed land use or proposed development standards.
e.      Historic Advisory Commission
In order to protect the City’s historic resources, the City has established a Downtown
Historic Overlay (DH-O) District. Within the residential portions of the historic district, the
DH-O allows increased building height to 45 feet or two stories and an increase in floor
area ratio to 70% when such modifications are necessary to preserve or enhance the
historic character of the district. The Historic Advisory Commission advises the City Council
on matters involving the preservation of landmarks and landmark sites that are historic in
                                                 42                                  June 2014

nature and have historic value. Both commercial and residential projects are potentially
subject to review; the issue is not the land use, but rather how the proposed project may
impact the historic resource, i.e. the structure, by virtue of its architecture, the building’s
place in history, or other historic elements of the site. The Historic Advisory Commission
membership is the same as the Planning Commission.
Prior to alteration or demolition of a designated historic structure, applicants are required
to obtain a permit from the Zoning Administrator. Only designated historic structures
within the DH-O district are subject to the historic review requirements for demolition and
modification permits. Cost and review time associated with historic review is considered
necessary to ensure the important historic assets in Oroville are protected and
maintained for the enjoyment of future generations. Though additional time is required
for review and approval for modifications to designated historic projects in the
downtown historic overlay district, the additional cost and time involved do not present
an undue burden on project applicants, nor does it constitute a constraint on
development.
f.      Environmental Review Procedures
Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) may take many forms
depending on whether the project is exempt or may have an effect on the environment.
CEQA compliance may take the form of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), a
Negative Declaration (ND) or a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND). For example, the
construction of individual single-family dwellings is Categorically Exempt from CEQA
requirements (CEQA Guidelines §15303), while many multi-family residential projects can
be approved with the issuance of a Negative Declaration. Conditional Use Permits and
Second Dwelling Units may also be exempt from CEQA, depending on whether
individual projects are classified as infill development.
The amount of time required to process CEQA environmental review documents in the
City of Oroville is comparable with other jurisdictions across the state, and is not
considered a significant constraint to the development of housing.
The City will continue to encourage and support concurrent processing of project
applications that require several different entitlements to help expedite the process.
Generally, processing requirements and schedules do not present an undue constraint
on development. In order to ensure that processing does not become an impediment to
the construction of affordable housing, the City will continue to take constructive steps to
help facilitate new development and improve the efficiency of the review process.
        3.       Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
a.      Development Fees
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and off-site
improvement requirements are levied by the City (as well as other agencies) to cover
processing costs, provide services, and construct facilities such as utilities, schools and
                                                43                                    June 2014

After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development
impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
                                                                               44                                                                June 2014

project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
b.      Improvement Requirements
In order to maintain a high standard of development in the City of Oroville, all land
divisions, i.e. subdivision maps, parcel maps, etc., must conform to the City’s design
standards for infrastructure improvements and other engineering standards, as
appropriate. For residential projects, the City typically requires both on- and off-site
improvements as conditions of approval. Infrastructure improvements, including
roadways and underground utility infrastructure, are required as a condition of the
subdivision map, or as part of the building permit if a subdivision map is not required.
The City maintains overall standards for roadway development to accommodate traffic
levels, vehicle movement and public safety access requirements. For example, all interior
travel lanes must be a minimum of 25-feet. The City also maintains a standard for
residential streets (local collectors) with a minimum right-of-way width of 60-feet.
All maps filed with the City must provide sufficient information about the following items
to allow the City to make appropriate recommendations:
    •   Street paving, curb, gutter, sidewalk, street lights and street trees and
        landscaping;
    •   Bus turnout lanes;
    •   Bicycle and pedestrian access;
    •   Perimeter walls and site landscaping;
    •   Utility services, including sewer, water, and storm runoff connections and method
        of conveyance;
    •   Provision for fire service, including emergency access, adequate fire flow, and fire
        hydrants;
    •   The need for public services, including fire and police;
    •   Undergrounded utilities (electricity, gas, cable television);
    •   Schools and school facilities; and
    •   Parks and open space
Because residential development cannot take place without adequate infrastructure,
on-and off-site improvement requirements are not a constraint to the development of
housing within the City of Oroville.

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
B.       Non-Governmental Constraints
         1.      Environmental Constraints
Some constraints to housing development are related purely to the topography of the
region. Generally, these constraints will not preclude the construction of housing, but the
cost of site preparation could be affected. Physical constraints vary from area to area.
The City’s southern and western areas are primarily flat river basin lands. The eastern
portion of the City is located in an urban-wildland interface adjacent to the Sierra
Nevada foothills. Development in the eastern area of the City occurs in and around
tracts of oak woodlands and chaparral. Through the center of the City, sites may be
impacted by the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way and noise constraints.
The City of Oroville lies within a seismically active region and is subject to hazards
associated with earthquake fault activity. According to the 2030 General Plan, the
Cleveland Hills Fault was a previous seismically active fault classified as Alquist-Priolo
Special Studies Zone located within the Oroville Planning Area. Areas within the Federal
Emergency Management Agency 100-year flood zone along the Feather River and other
drainages with high groundwater levels are susceptible to liquefaction due to saturated
soils. Several areas of steep slopes are prone to landslides within the Planning Area due
to earthquakes, weak soils, erosion, and heavy rainfall. Many of these areas are located
on hillsides and bluffs in the northern part of the Planning Area. However, areas subject to
such events due to steep slopes are not planned for residential development in the
General Plan. Growth is anticipated to occur in relatively flat areas that are not subject
to many of the hazards associated with ground shaking. Potential geologic hazards are
mitigated through the development review and plan check process to ensure that all
new developments comply with current grading and building code requirements.
         2.      Infrastructure Constraints
The City’s ability to provide infrastructure to serve new development, primarily water,
wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure, is a key component of the local
development framework. The City of Oroville works with other service agencies to ensure
that sufficient urban infrastructure, both resource availability and transmission and
treatment capacity are in place prior to development approval. The City, through its
relationship with regional agencies, maintains a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) for the
provision of wastewater treatment & discharge services; other agencies provide water
services.
a.       Water
The California Water Service Company, the South Feather Water and Power Agency,
and the Thermolito Irrigation District provide water service in Oroville. These agencies
derive water from both groundwater sources, deep wells, and from surface water
sources, including Thermalito Power Canal, Lake Concow, and the South Fork of the
Feather River. According to the 2030 General Plan, each of these agencies has the
ability to meet expected demand during the General Plan timeframe.

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
The City will continue to work with these agencies to ensure that water supplies are
acquired as necessary and that distribution facilities and storage facilities are provided
to serve future growth. Measures that may be considered by the outside water agencies
could include the following:
Purchase additional water supplies
Percolation of surface water to replenish underlying aquifers
Monitoring groundwater levels and the quantities of water recharged to and extracted
from the underlying sub-basins
Sharing water resources data between the agencies to allow for responsible decisions
regarding water supply development and land use planning
Developing policies regarding the provision of service to community water systems and
small local water systems.
b.      Wastewater
Three wastewater service providers (collection entities) in the Oroville area participate in
a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) with the Sewerage Commission-Oroville Region, or SC-
OR, for the handling and processing of wastewater. The City of Oroville currently provides
collection services for approximately 13,550 customers in the City, the Thermolito Water &
Sewer District (TWSD) provides collection services for approximately 2,000 customers, and
the Lake Oroville Area Public Utility District (LOAPUD) provides collection services for
approximately 12,000 customers. Only a small percentage of LOAPUD’s customers are
currently located in the City limits, with the remaining customers located in
unincorporated areas surrounding the City. All three of the collection agencies convey
wastewater to SCOR west interceptor pipe for treatment at the SCOR plant.
The Sewerage Commisssion-Oroville Region (SCOR) Regional Wastewater Treatment
Plant is the sole provider of sewage treatment for Oroville and surrounding areas. The
SCOR plant is located at 2880 South 5th Avenue, between Oroville Dam Boulevard and
Georgia Pacific Way. The treatment plant and three interceptor lines that collect
wastewater discharges from the three member entities are generally in good condition.
The member collection entities are independently responsible for the preparation and
periodic update of their sanitary sewer master plans, and the annual or periodic
adjustment of user rates and connection fees to plan for and fund necessary
improvements that will provide the needed capacity for each of the entities collection
systems.
The City will continue to function as a member entity under the SC-OR JPA in order to
ensure adequate collection capacity for future growth. New development will be
required to pay for necessary upgrades (either expansion or new installation) to the
collection system and to future improvements in treatment capacity, to maintain
adequate service levels. The City will continue to implement a long-term program of
phased improvements and upgrades in advance of anticipated development, and
wastewater treatment is not expected to constrain housing development during the
2014-2022 planning period.

City of Oroville 2014-2022 Housing Element                                       IV. Constraints
        3.       Land and Construction Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market.
Land and housing values declined significantly after the 2008 economic crash, but have
slowly begun to recover. The typical value of vacant residential land in Butte County is
currently estimated at $100,000 to $200,000 per acre depending on location, which is
substantially lower than more urbanized areas of the state.
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Oroville are not substantially
different from other cities in the region. Estimated construction costs range from $130 to
$200 per square foot depending on type and quality of construction.
        4.       Cost and Availability of Financing
The cost and availability of residential financing in Oroville is similar to other communities
in California. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real
estate loans, although for those homebuyers who can qualify, interest rates are very low
by historic standards. Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to
discriminate against entire neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical
or economic conditions in the area (“redlining”). Based on available information, it does
not appear that redlining is occurring in the city.
C.      Fair Housing
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act: (i) prohibits discrimination and
harassment in all aspects of housing including; (ii) requires housing providers to make
reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities; and (iii) prohibits retaliation
against any person who has filed a complaint with the State. In furtherance of these
provisions and anti-discriminatory practices, the City promotes equal opportunity for all
residents through programs described in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V). The City
also facilitates reasonable accommodation in housing for persons with disabilities in
conformance with state law.

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
Chapters II, III and IV of the Housing Element evaluate the City’s housing needs,
opportunities and constraints, while Appendix A presents a review of the previous
element. This Housing Action Plan sets forth the City’s goals, policies, and actions to
address the identified housing needs and issues for the 2014-2022 planning period.
Quantified objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and conservation are also
identified.
A.      Goals
The City of Oroville has established the following six goals to enhance, increase, improve,
and preserve the housing stock for all economic segments of the City in a fair and
equitable manner.
Goal 1: Expand Housing Opportunities and Accessibility. The City of Oroville maintains a
goal to concentrate and focus efforts and resources on increasing the availability of
permanent housing for all community residents.
Goal 2: Remove Constraints to Housing. The City of Oroville maintains a goal to remove
constraints that could hinder the provision of housing.
Goal 3: Facilitate Development of New Housing to Meet the Needs of the Community. The
City of Oroville maintains a goal to facilitate development of a range of housing that
varies sufficiently in terms of cost, design, size, location, and tenure to meet the housing
needs of all economic segments of the community at a level which can be supported
by the utility, water and street infrastructure
Goal 4: Preserve, Rehabilitate, and Enhance Existing Housing and Neighborhoods. The
City of Oroville maintains a goal to initiate all reasonable efforts to preserve the
availability of existing housing opportunities and to conserve as well as enhance the
quality of existing dwelling units and residential neighborhoods.
Goal 5: Promote Fair Housing. The City of Oroville maintains a goal to ensure that all
existing and future housing opportunities are open and available to all members of the
community without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin
or ancestry, marital status, age, household composition or size, or any other arbitrary
factors.
Goal 6: Encourage Residential Energy Conservation. The City of Oroville maintains a goal
to encourage energy conservation in residential neighborhoods, which can reduce
energy bills and enhance housing affordability.

                                   Residential Land Inventory
State law requires the Housing Element to include an inventory of vacant or underutilized
sites with the potential for residential development during the planning period. The
assumptions and methodology for the residential land inventory are provided below and
summarized in Tables B-1 through B-3. The 5th cycle RHNA projection period began
January 1, 2014 therefore units completed after that date are credited toward the City’s
inventory of sites.
1.        Density and Affordability Assumptions
The following assumptions were used in the land inventory analysis to estimate the
capacity and affordability levels for residential sites.
Realistic Capacity. For purposes of estimating the realistic capacity of vacant residential
sites zoned for high density, the low end of the allowable density range has been used
(20 units/acre). For other land use categories, the midpoint of the allowable density has
been used.
                                                     Table B-1
                         Assumed Density and Affordability by Land Use Designation

        Land Use Designation            (units/acre)              (units/acre)              Level
  Rural Residential                        0 – 0.2                    0.1               Above Moderate
  Very Low Density Residential            0.2 – 1.0                   0.6               Above Moderate
  Low Density Residential                 1.0 – 3.0                    2                Above Moderate
  Medium Low Density Residential          3.0 – 6.0                   4.5               Above Moderate
  Medium Density Residential             6.0 – 14.0                    10                  Moderate
  Medium High Density Residential        14.0 – 20.0                   17                  Moderate
  High Density Residential               20.0 – 30.0                   20                   Lower
  Mixed Use                              10.0 – 30.0                   10                   Lower
Affordability. Completed units and projects with approved entitlements are assigned to
affordability categories based on the actual or estimated price or rent (see Table II-14 in
Chapter II). Sites without project entitlements as assigned to income categories based on
allowable density according to the table above. Under state law 8 the lower-income
“default density” for Butte County is 20 units/acre, which means that sites allowing a
density at or above that level are assumed to be appropriate for lower-income housing.

Table B-3 shows vacant parcels designated for residential development along with the
realistic development capacity of each site. Figures B-1 and B-2 show the location of the
R-4 sites to accommodate lower-income housing. Those sites have a minimum density of
20 units/acre. There are no infrastructure capacity issues or environmental constraints
that would preclude the level of development assumed for these sites during the
planning period.

                                 Public Participation Summary
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Oroville, and this
update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for involvement. Public notices of all workshops and hearings were distributed in
advance of each meeting, published in the local newspaper, and posted on the City’s website.
The draft Housing Element was also circulated to housing advocates and nonprofit
organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and special needs groups (see
Table C-1 containing a list of organizations notified of opportunities for participation). After
receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing and Community
Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared and made
available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing
Element update. Public meetings were televised on Channel 10, the local public access
channel.

10-Year Strategy Goals and Objectives
 Community Action
 Goal Statement: The citizens of Butte County will take ownership of the homeless problem by creating a
 Volunteer Support Network, engaging the community in a public awareness campaign, and supporting
 formation of a homeless court.
 Objectives:
 1.	 Create a Volunteer Support Network to encourage positive interactions among volunteers, and to mentor
      and assist people that are homeless.
 2.	 Engage the community through a public awareness campaign to educate people about the homeless
      crisis and put a human face on the issue.
 3.	 Form a Homeless Court that will direct homeless offenders to programs that help them rehabilitate their
      lives, using an approach of restorative justice rather than punitive justice.
 Funding
 Goal Statement: The communities of Butte County will identify and develop a sizable, sustainable source of
 funding for all new and existing programs and services to address homelessness in our region through the
 North Valley Housing Trust, a Nonprofit Resource Center, and a community-wide Marketing and Education
 program.

 Objectives:
 1.	 Support the North Valley Housing Trust (NVHT), an endowment that will provide a locally generated
     source of revenue targeted to meet local affordable housing and services needs.
 2.	 Develop a Nonprofit Resource Center to supplement local nonprofit homeless service providers’
     fundraising efforts, and to provide grant seeking and writing, marketing, and technical assistance free
     of charge.
 3.	 Implement a community-wide, multi-media marketing and education campaign to harness the concern
     and energy of the community, dispel myths about homelessness, share the stories of homeless residents
     (including success stories), and show people how they can become active.
 Housing
 Goal Statement: Butte County housing and service providers will create safe and secure housing options for
 homeless persons that address gaps in the homeless “continuum of care” and build community.
 Objectives:
 1.	 Institute a Homeless Camp that will provide a safe and secure place for chronically homeless individuals
     to build community and access services.
 2.	 Develop a Wet Shelter that will provide safe and secure overnight shelter for persons that cannot enter
     emergency shelters due to sobriety rules.
 3.	 Create a Housing-First Program that will proactively outreach to homeless individuals and immediately
     place them in a home with comprehensive supportive services.
 Services
 Goal Statement: Community partners will strive to create a network of services, under one roof, that are
 quick and easy to access, are coordinated between service providers, offer earlier intervention to break the
 cycle of homelessness, and accommodate pets in services and shelters.
 Objectives:
 1.	 Create a One-Stop Opportunity Center, a place where all homeless individuals and families can go to
     access a variety of services under one roof.
 2.	 Strengthen and develop Homeless Prevention Programs – prevent episodes of homelessness by providing
     short-term assistance with rent and utility bills, offer mediation between tenants and property owners to
     prevent eviction, increase housing stabilization, and make referrals to community-based services.
 3.	 Provide Pet Veterinary and Shelter Services – find ways to accommodate pets in shelters and in our
     network of services; identify low-cost or no cost veterinary services to ensure the pets are healthy and
     that vaccinations are current.
 Jobs
 Goal Statement: Community partners will work together to establish a centralized employment resource
 center, increase employment programs customized to assist the homeless, and develop social enterprise
 businesses.
 Objectives:
 1.	 Develop a centrally located employment resource center to provide quick and easy access to a network
     of employment and job training services.
 2.	 Provide job training tailored to the specific needs of homeless people, specifically soft skills training, such
     as communication, interviewing, teamwork, problem solving and critical thinking, and programs that
     provide participants with a certificate or a degree after completion.
 3.	 Create social enterprise businesses that generate revenue to support shelters and provide jobs for clients
     – a “double bottom line” business that gives equal importance to income generation and social services.

Below are some key countywide findings from
the 2013 Point-In-Time Homeless Census:
•	   1,553 homeless individuals were counted in
     Butte County on the day of the census. This was
     a 12% decrease from the number of homeless
     individuals counted on the day of the 2011
     census. A possible reason for this decrease
     may be a result of funding cuts and dwindling
     resources, which reduced outreach. Another
     reason for the decrease may be an improvement
     in the economy and significant reduction in the
     unemployment rate since 2011.
•	   35% of homeless individuals were “chronically
     homeless,” meaning that they were
     continuously homeless for longer than one
     year, or experienced four or more episodes of
     homelessness in the past three years, and had
     a disabling condition. This was a significant
     increase from 18% of homeless individuals
     surveyed in the 2011 census.

       Public Outreach Process / Methodology

articles and announcements.                           solutions that could be implemented in the future.
We spent considerable energy developing a
comprehensive list of stakeholders, trying to ensure
that the voices of our community, including policy
makers, social service organizations, faith based
organizations, business owners, law enforcement,
interested citizens, homeless residents themselves,
and others had the opportunity to hear and be heard.
Based on this careful outreach, attendance at most
of the public outreach forums, summit, and strategy
team meetings was high. Over a 5-month period,
we held 10 public meetings that took the form of
community forums, focus groups targeting homeless
residents and service providers, a Countywide
Summit, and strategy team working groups. The

of the meetings and published three articles about
the process, and included announcements about the
meetings.
Personal Communication (email, phone, etc.): To
ensure participation by as many stakeholders as
possible, the Butte CoC made personal phone calls
and emails to encourage participation, specifically for
the Strategy Team Meetings, described in more detail
below.
Collaboration with Homeless Task Forces: In
advance of the forums, a member of the consulting
team attended Paradise and Chico Homeless Task
Force meetings to invite its members to participate
and share information about the upcoming events. A
representative of the Oroville Homeless Task Force
is a Butte County CoC Council member and regularly
informs the OHTF about upcoming 10-Year Strategy
meetings. In addition, Homeless Task Force members
are included in the overall e-mail blast list and receive
updates on a regular basis.
Forums: The goal of the forums was to understand
the causes of homelessness and what resources are
missing to address these causes from the perspective
of Butte County’s four largest community centers:

Outreach to Homeless
Individuals
Although we strove to conduct the forums at locations
where homeless individuals obtain services in our
communities (in Chico the forum was near the Jesus
Center, which is a major food and service provider for
the homeless population and in Oroville the forum
was at the Hope Center, a multi-service provider that
also provides meals) representation at the forums
by homeless residents was limited. Therefore, we
scheduled four focus groups at shelters and service
centers during the meal services. Working with the
staff of these centers, facilitators set up a table with
the two main questions (What are the causes of
homelessness? What resources are missing?) written
on large signs. As people came in for meals they were                Debbie Villasenor, James Coles, and
invited to talk to the facilitator and write down their              Meagan Meloy posting community

       10-Year Strategy Goals
     The public outreach process resulted in
     identification of goals and objectives in the
     subject areas of community action, funding,
     housing, services and jobs. The next chapter
     includes an overarching goal for each subject
     area, and three top objectives for each goal.
     For each objective, sections detail: how it
     works; the need for it; an applicable best
     practice; available resources; challenges to
     implementation; and action steps.
     It is important to note that this 10-Year
     Strategy document does not prescribe who
     will implement the objectives, nor does it
     spell out step-by-step instructions. To do
     so would prematurely restrict the potential
     collaborations and creative ideas that
     evolve through relationships and dialogue.
     Instead, this document is a starting point
     for more focused discussion and action on
     homelessness. The goals and objectives are
     intended to present a recipe book of solutions.
     The community has identified these as
     the right ingredients for the job of ending
     homelessness in Butte County. How and when
     the recipes are used will be determined by
     circumstance and context.

      Statement
      The citizens of Butte County will take
      ownership of the homeless problem by
      creating a Volunteer Support Network,
      engaging the community in a public awareness
      campaign, and supporting formation of a
      homeless court.

   Action Steps
   Major action steps required for Volunteer Support Network implementation follow.
   Step 1— Identify a coordinator. An entity with a countywide footprint and relationships will need to act
   as coordinator. The coordinating entity may be the Volunteer Training Institute, or a new entity supported
   by a group of organizations that have successfully worked with volunteers.
   Step 2— Form nonprofit partnerships. Identify and enter into working agreements with nonprofits that
   can refer homeless individuals and families to volunteer groups. The nonprofits should also be able to
   provide some support and guidance to volunteers. The level of volunteer support will depend on the
   nonprofit’s resources and Volunteer Support Network financial assistance.
      Step 3— Establish Volunteer Gateways in each major city. These locations will most likely be service
      centers that are centralized, accessible and familiar to volunteers. Preferably they will be homeless
      service centers, such as the Opportunity Center proposed in Chapter VIII: Services. This will provide
      a place for volunteers to register, receive training, meet other volunteers, and engage with homeless
   persons.
   Step 4— Develop coordination tools. The program will need to connect volunteer groups with homeless
   individuals as efficiently as possible. This will involve procedures, screening standards and an orientation
   program. Volunteer coordinators will be assigned to direct these processes. The program would benefit
   from an interactive website and mobile application that notifies volunteer groups of mentorship
   opportunities, and provides other information online.
   Step 5— Develop an outreach campaign. A comprehensive campaign to find volunteers and donors will be
   key to the Volunteer Support Network’s success. This will include marketing materials, such as brochures,
   promotional videos and advertising, and venues, such as the Volunteer Gateways, a website and special
   events. The future growth of the program will depend on steadily increasing volunteer participation, as
   positive experiences are shared with other community members.

        Action Steps
        Below are some major action steps that would be involved in setting up the public awareness
        campaign.
        Step 1— Develop messaging. Ask service and housing providers, citizens, and political and business
        leaders what the central messages of the campaign should be, and how the messages should be
        conveyed. Reach general consensus after broad input.
        Step 2— Raise funds. Identify and solicit funding sources to support the campaign.
        Step 3— Hire a marketing consultant. A marketing consultant will give the campaign proven
        strategies and a professional and polished look.
        Step 4— Develop branding. With the help of the marketing consultant and graphic designers, develop
        branding that includes a logo, typeface, artwork and photography. The branding should be consistent
        across all communication mediums.
        Step 5— Lay out a schedule and strategy. A campaign coordinator will need to lay out a schedule and
        strategy prior to launching the campaign. This will consider the appropriate timing of press releases,
        website launches, advertisements and special events

      Action Steps
      Below are key action steps necessary to make the public awareness campaign happen.
      Step 1— Present the homeless court concept to County leaders. Share best practices and outcomes
      from other California counties.
      Step 2— Form a partnership with the Butte County Court System. This partnership will obviously be
      critical. Strong commitment from the County, from the Board of Supervisors to administrators, will
      make the homeless court possible.
      Step 3— Form partnerships between the Butte County Court System and service providers. The
      program will only be successful with the full involvement of service providers. Determine if courts
      case managers are necessary, how they will be funded, and how they will coordinate between parties.
      Step 4— Draft, approve and implement policies and procedures.

substantial tax benefit for investors in housing trust     in Butte County.
    Action Steps
    The community must ensure that the NVHT will become a viable source of revenue for housing and
    services for the homeless population as well as prevention of homelessness. To do this, the fund must
    receive substantial investment from all sources, great and small. Increasing the fund’s visibility through
    a public outreach and marketing campaign is a must, and needs volunteer support to make this happen.
    The NVHT has developed a Business Plan with the following Action Steps aimed at growing the Fund:
    Step 1— Establish NVCF account and seek contributions. Establish initial account with North Valley
    Community Foundation (NVCF). Work with NVCF to invite financial contributions from local businesses,
      civic groups, churches and individuals.
      Step 2— Offer State tax credits to COIN investors. Use 3CORE’s Community Development Financial
      Institution (CDFI) designation to offer state tax credits to COIN investors, such as banks and insurance
      companies.
    Step 3— Convene a Startup Board to establish policies, procedures, and budget.
    Step 4— Raise funds to qualify for matching State grant. Raise $500,000 as necessary to provide a local
    match for a $500,000 grant from the State Local Housing Trust Fund Program, to capitalize the NVHT with
    $1 million.
    Step 5— Apply for a $100,000 CDFI capacity building grant from the U.S. Department of Treasury.
    Step 6— Provide loans and grants to community-based organizations for development of affordable
    housing and supportive services to assist persons who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness.

     Action Steps
     A committee should be formed to brainstorm funding options, determine specific services (based
     on the needs of homeless and housing service providers in the region), conduct further research
     on best practices and models, and determine whether an existing entity can take on this role or if a
     new organization must be formed. Specific action steps for development of the Resource Center may
     include:
     Step 1— Network with service providers. Meet with local service providers and community members
     already providing some services to determine their interest or level of involvement and assistance.
     Step 2— Develop a Business Plan, including further research best practices and models, and
     community needs.
     Step 3— Identify site location. Explore location within the One-Stop Opportunity Centers, or within
     an existing service agency.
     Step 4— Funding strategy. Develop and implement a start-up funding strategy.
     Step 5— Community Promotion. Promote the Resource Center to the community.

    Action Steps
    The following are action steps that will be necessary to establish the Homeless Camp.
    Step 1— Complete a feasibility study. Research other homeless camps to determine what works and
    what doesn’t. Establish the primary goal (i.e. simply a safe place to camp, or an entryway to services and
    re-integration). Lay out an implementation plan.
    Step 2— Enter a partnership with a camp operator. The Homeless Camp will only function effectively with
      a capable operator, which will set campground rules, ensure compliance with community standards,
      provide staffing and maintenance, and coordinate with service providers.
      Step 3— Secure a site and use permit. The campground site will need to be of adequate size for campsites
      and programming. Residents should have some minimum of space for privacy. In addition, the site will
    need to be accessible to service providers and homeless individuals. Finally, the campground will need
    to be accepted by the community. The site will likely have development and management stipulations
    attached to its use permits.
    Step 4— Develop partnerships with service providers. The Homeless Camp will operate under a
    philosophy of breaking down barriers between homeless individuals and services. This will be followed
    by bringing services to where homeless individuals reside and feel most comfortable. It will require
    sustained relationship building in order to engender trust.

       Action Steps
       Development of the Wet Shelter will include the key steps listed below.
       Step 1— Enter into a partnership with an operator. The operator will need to have extensive
       experience with the target population, and be respected in the community. The operator will need to
       receive the community’s trust that the Wet Shelter will be well-managed.
       Step 2— Identify an appropriate building. The Wet Shelter location should be convenient to services
       and accessible by chronically homeless individuals. Optimal location will be near or adjacent to a
       service provider, preferably the operator. After identifying the potential building, acquisition and
       capital costs can be estimated.
       Step 3— Raise funds. Funds will likely need to be raised from public and private sources. CDBG funds
       are the primary public source, particularly in Chico and Paradise.
       Step 4— Engage in a public relations campaign. Throughout the process, and especially just prior
       to operation, the public needs to be made aware of the community benefits associated with the Wet
       Shelter and the resources and methods that will be employed to mitigate potential problems. The
       central message will be that chronically homeless individuals and the community at large will be
       safer with the Wet Shelter, and that the investment will save taxpayer money in the long run.

      Action Steps
      The Housing-First Program will involve the following steps:
      Step 1— Secure funding sources. These sources could potentially include Butte CoC, HOME, Section
      8, and NVHT.
      Step 2— Designate a lead agency. This agency will develop procedures, administer contracts and
      manage the budget.
      Step 3— Form housing and service partnerships. Various community organizations can play roles in
      the Housing-First Program based on their expertise and experience. Roles will include outreach and
      assessment, case management, housing placement and administration of rental assistance payments.
      Step 4— Develop landlord and housing provider relationships. These may include the housing
      authority, affordable housing nonprofits, and private property owners.

   Action Steps
   This is a complex undertaking and requires forming a committee made up of multiple partners from
   public agencies, volunteers, homeless persons, lenders, and community-based programs. The key is
   to design a comprehensive program and identify a network of service providers to implement the
   programs. Integrating multiple service providers under one roof will require a detailed memorandum
   of understanding, preparing an operation budget, and agreeing on a secure system to share client
   information between agencies.
   Step 1— Form a committee with a broad stakeholder representation from public agencies, volunteers,
   homeless persons, lenders, and community-based programs.
     Step 2— Investigate other examples of One-Stop Centers to learn how they overcame obstacles to
     develop a project.
     Step 3— Reach out to service providers to identify if any existing program might be able to expand and
   use their facility. If not, outreach to private property owners and public partners to help identify a site.
   Step 4— Design a comprehensive program, which includes working through details of services, funding,
   and sharing information between agencies.
   Step 5— Select a lead agency and prepare a memorandum of understanding describing each other’s
   roles, responsibilities, and financial commitments.
   Step 6— Identify and apply for funding from a variety of sources such as public programs (Federal, State,
   and local), philanthropic individuals and families, private foundations, and the newly created North Valley
   Housing Trust.

    Action Steps
    The following actions steps are necessary to implement a comprehensive homeless prevention program.
    Step 1— Reach out to existing service agencies and evaluate if they are able to expand an existing program
    to include homeless prevention services or to develop a new program.
       Step 2— Investigate the possibilities of community-based agencies adding homeless prevention in
       their public relation campaigns.
       Step 3— Outreach and educate property owners about the objectives of a homeless prevention
    program. Persuade property owners to participate in mediation meetings with tenants to avoid or delay
    eviction procedures.
    Step 4— Research public programs and private foundations for operation funds to support countywide
    homeless prevention programs.

     Action Steps
     This is a complex undertaking and requires forming a committee made up of multiple partners from
     public agencies to community-based programs. The key is to design a comprehensive program and
     identify a network of service providers to implement programs. Integrating multiple service providers
     under one roof will require a detailed memorandum of understanding, preparing an operating budget,
     and working out a secure system to share client information between agencies.
     Step 1— Form a committee with broad stakeholder representation from the community, public
     agencies, and community-based programs.
      Step 2— Design a comprehensive program, which includes working through details of services,
      funding, and sharing information between agencies.
      Step 3— Select a lead agency and prepare a memorandum of understanding describing each other’s
     roles, responsibilities, and financial commitments.
     Step 4— Research and select a site, preferably near public transportation. Evaluate if any existing
     service site can expand to incorporate a center. If an existing site is not available, an extensive search
     will be required to identify an appropriate location. In both cases, it is a good idea to review zoning and
     use permits with planning staff from the local government.
     Step 5— Identify and apply for funding to support initial start-up and on-going operating costs. A good
     place to begin is with the North Valley Housing Trust. The NVHT, a local resource, may be able to provide
     a flexible source of funds.

    Actions Steps
    The recommended action steps are:
    Step 1— Establish a committee. The group will need to recruit and coordinate partners (public and
    private) to sponsor and administer employment programs.
      Step 2— Design programs. This may include hiring a consultant to prepare an analysis of jobs requiring
      certificates, and availability of jobs in the market place.
      Step 3— Accreditation. The sponsor agency will need to complete accreditation programs to be able
    to award certificates to graduates.
    Step 4— Location. Identify appropriate program locations, and review zoning and allowable land uses
    with local planning departments.
