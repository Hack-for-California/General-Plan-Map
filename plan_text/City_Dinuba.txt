Chapter 1 Introduction
                                           CHAPTER 1
                                        INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element of the General Plan is one component of the City's overall long-range
planning strategy. The California Government Code requires that the General Plan contain an
integrated, consistent set of goals and policies. The Housing Element directs residential
development and provides for housing preservation consistent with the overall development and
economic goals, and social values of the City of Dinuba. The Housing Element is an official
municipal response to a growing awareness of the need to provide housing for all economic and
demographic segments of the community. It establishes policies that will guide City decision-
making and sets forth an action program to implement housing goals. An effective housing
element provides the necessary conditions for preserving and producing an adequate supply of
affordable housing. Among other things, the housing element provides an inventory of land
adequately zoned, or planned to be zoned, for housing, certainty in permit processing procedures,
and a commitment by the City to assist in housing development through regulatory concessions
and incentives.
The City’s General Plan includes other elements, including Land Use, Safety, Noise,
Transportation/Circulation, Open Space and Conservation. The policies included in the Housing
Element must be consistent with the policies outlined in other elements. The policies contained
in other elements of the General Plan affect many aspects of life that residents enjoy - the
amount and variety of open space; preservation of natural, historic and cultural resources;
permitted noise levels in residential areas; and safety of the residents in the event of a natural or
man-made disaster. Many of the policies contained in the Housing Element coincide particularly
with those of the Land Use and Circulation elements, as well as the City’s zoning ordinances.
In addition, to this fundamental framework, the housing element update process provides an
avenue for establishing and updating housing and land-use strategies reflective of changing
needs, resources and conditions within the community. For example, the housing element update
process can provide the mechanism to adopt new strategies to promote infill, mixed-use, or
downtown revitalization.
The housing element update process can also provide a vehicle for local governments to adopt
housing and land-use strategies to address climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions. Most of the housing and land-use strategies adopted by local governments to meet
their existing and projected housing needs also serve to effectively address climate change
concerns. For example, promoting higher density, infill housing for low-income workers and
housing along transit corridors can also significantly contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions. Government Code Section 65580 et.seq., which pertains directly to housing
elements, states, in part, “The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance and the
early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian,
including farm workers, is a priority of highest order.” This Section also states, “Local and state
governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement
and development of housing to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic
segments of the community.”

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015

Chapter 1 Introduction
This draft housing element update has been prepared to satisfy the State’s mandate by evaluating
and addressing housing needs within the City of Dinuba for the December 31, 2015 through
December 31, 2023 planning period. It is an update of the City’s State-certified housing
element, which was adopted by the City in 2010, and then revised and readopted by the City in
2011 after addressing the State’s comments.
This is the fifth cycle of the Housing Element, and the first to be based on an 8-year period. The
Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG) was tasked by the State to determine a
method to appropriately allocate housing among four income categories within each of the eight
incorporated cities and the unincorporated area of Tulare County. As explained in the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Plan, “An underlying principal of the RHNA Methodology
is to ensure that affordable housing is equitably distributed throughout the region. The
Methodology applies an adjustment factor based on disparities in household income across the
TCAG region. The adjustment factor assigns a higher proportion of units affordable to lower-
income households to jurisdictions that currently have a lower proportion of affordable
households compared to the regional average and assigns a lower proportion of affordable units
to jurisdictions that currently have a higher proportion of affordable households than the regional
average. The Methodology is intended to help [the] region achieve income parity (the same
proportion of affordable units in each community) by 2050.”
1.1     State Policy and Authorization
The Housing Element is one of seven General Plan Elements mandated by the State of
California. The California State legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and
suitable living environment for every Californian as the State’s major housing goal. To assure
that local planning effectively implements this statewide housing goal, the legislature has
mandated that all cities and counties prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive
General Plan.
Sections 65580 through 65589 of the California Government Code contain the legislative
requirement for a Housing Element. Article 10.6 was added to the Government Code in 1980 and
incorporates into law Housing Element Guidelines established by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD). Article 10.6 also required an update of the
Housing Element every five years. Per SB 375, requirements for updating the housing element
now vary from four to eight years, depending on the when the document is adopted by the
jurisdiction. If the document is certified by the State and is then adopted by the jurisdiction
within 120 days of the due date (December 31, 2015), the housing element need not be revised
for a period of eight years (e.g., until year 2023). However, if the housing element is not adopted
by the City within 120 days of the due date, it must be revised again after four years (e.g., 2018).
1.2     Changes in State Law
There have been several changes in State laws that effect housing elements since the last
planning period (2009 – 2014). These changes are summarized below:

City of Dinuba                                                                    November 2015
2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                        Page 1-3
Chapter 1 Introduction
Revised Default Density Standards
Since 2003, jurisdictions have been permitted to determine a “default density” that
“demonstrates density standards to accommodate a jurisdiction’s regional need for all income
levels, including lower-income households.” In the incorporated cities within Tulare County,
that default density was determined to be 20 units or greater per acre. The default density was
revised based on the 2010 U.S. Census data (Amendment of State Housing Element Law – AB
2348). However, the only city affected by this change in Tulare County was Visalia. The default
density for Dinuba remains at 20 or greater units per acre.
SB 375 (Steinberg)
Approved by the Governor on September 30, 2008, the Sustainable Communities and Climate
Protection Act of 2008, Senate Bill 375 or SB 375, extends the housing element planning period
from five years to eight years in order to link the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process
with the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNA Plan) and housing element process. Once a
jurisdiction receives its RHNA objectives, it has 18 months to prepare its housing element and
submit it to HCD. For those jurisdictions that meet statutory deadlines for adopting their housing
elements, this will have the effect of changing the housing element planning period to an eight
year cycle.
The intent of SR 375 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging jurisdictions to
coordination housing and transportation land use planning. The Housing Element can implement
efficient land-use strategies such as infill, mixed-use, and/or downtown revitalization strategies,
promote and incentivize a variety of housing types affordable to the workforce and households
with lower incomes, and address climate change by reducing vehicle trips and greenhouse gas
emissions.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities - SB 812 (Ashburn)
Approved by the Governor on September 29, 2010, this law amended State housing element law
to require the analysis within the document to include an evaluation of the special housing needs
of persons with developmental disabilities, separate from those with other disabilities. This
information and an analysis are included in Section Five, Special Needs, Persons with
Disabilities.
Alternative Adequate Sites - AB 1103 (Huffman)
Government Code 65583.1(c) provides flexibility to jurisdictions by allowing up to 25 percent of
the adequate sites requirements to be met by making available affordable units through
rehabilitation, conversion, and/or preservation. Approved by the Governor on September 1,
2011, this law allows, under specific conditions, foreclosed properties converted to housing
affordable to lower income households by acquisition or purchase of affordability covenants to
qualify under the alternative adequate sites requirement. The housing element must demonstrate
these units meet the same requirements as converted multifamily rental units. To qualify, local
governments can meet the up to 25 percent of the site requirement by providing “committed

2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                       Page 1-4
Chapter 1 Introduction
assistance” to make existing units affordable through rehabilitation, conversion and/or
preservation. “Committed assistance” is defined as a legally enforceable agreement which
obligates sufficient available funds to provide the assistance necessary to make identified units
affordable and available of occupancy within two years of the execution of the agreement. AB
720 amended the law to allow jurisdictions to expand the allowable time period by which the
local government must enter into a legally enforceable agreement to from the beginning of the
jurisdiction’s RHNA projection period to the due date of the housing element update. In Tulare
County, the period to enter into a legally enforceable agreement for committed assistance would
begin January 10, 2014 and extend until December 31, 2015.
Disadvantaged Communities – SB 244
Approved by the Governor on October 07, 2011, this law (Wolk, 2011) requires cities and
counties to identify the infrastructure and service needs of unincorporated legacy communities in
their general plans at the time of the next housing element update. An unincorporated legacy
community is defined as a place meeting the following criteria:
       Contains 10 or greater dwelling units in close proximity to one another;
       Is within a city Sphere of Influence (SOI), is an island within a city boundary, or is
        geographically isolated and has existed for greater than 50 years; and
       Has a median household income that is 80 percent or less than the statewide median
        household income.
One community adjacent to Dinuba formerly met the criteria of an unincorporated legacy
community, but was annexed into the City in 2008. This is the Western Sky Mobile Home Park
(42873) Road 80 on the northwestern end of the City. The El Monte Mobile Village, which, as a
disadvantaged community must be considered when analyzing available utilities and services,
lies outside the City’s SOI, but inside its 10 and 20-year Urban Development Boundaries (UDB).
Therefore, although it does not need to be considered under SB 244, it may be necessary for the
Local Agency Formation Committee (LAFCo) to consider this community in the future if the
City increases its SOI.
Transitional and Supportive Housing – SB 745 (Committee on Transportation and
Housing)
On January 1, 2014, SB 745 took effect. Approved by the Governor on August 27, 2013, this
law amends Section 65582 of the Government Code to replace prior health and Safety Code
definitions of “supportive housing,” “target population,” and “transitional housing” with
definitions now more specific to housing element law. The terms now used are included in
Section Five, Special Needs, Families in need of Emergency Housing. Supportive housing was
revised to remove the time limits of occupancy.

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.3      Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
California Government Code Section 65300.5 requires that General Plans contain an integrated,
internally consistent set of policies. The Housing Element is affected by all elements, with the
Land Use and Circulation Element having a particularly close relation.
The Housing Element is affected by policies contained in other elements of the General Plan,
however, it is most intricately related to the Land Use Element. The Land Element sets the
framework for development of housing by laying out the land designations for residential
development and indicating the type and density permitted by the City. In designating the
location and density of residential development, the Land Use Element has a significant effect on
the number, type, and location of future housing units that can be constructed. The acreage
designated for industrial, commercial, and office uses also effects potential employment
opportunities. Working within this framework, the Housing Element identifies priority goals,
objectives and program actions for the next eight years that directly address the housing needs of
Dinuba’s existing and future residents.
The Circulation Element established policies for providing streets and their associated design
specifications to all housing that is developed. In addition, the Circulation Element contains
policies that encourage particular traffic patterns; may influence where public transportation
routes and bus stops are located; and may include provisions for bicycle and pedestrian routes in
neighborhoods, near schools, and in downtown areas. These policies are important when
considering the location of housing in relationship to services, schools, and jobs. Policies
contained in other elements of the General Plan affect the quality of life, the amount and variety
of open space, acceptable noise levels, programs to ensure the safety of residents, and public
facilities.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City's other General Plan
Elements and the policies and programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained in
other parts of the General Plan (See Appendix A, Housing Element and General Plan
Consistency Matrix). As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, this Housing
Element will be reviewed annually to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
1.4      Relationship to Other City Plans and Policies
The Housing Element identifies priority goals, objectives, policies and action programs for the
next eight years that directly address the housing needs of Dinuba. The City’s codes, ordinances,
and policies are briefly described below.
Dinuba Municipal Code
The Dinuba Municipal Code (DMC) consists of all the regulatory, penal and administrative
ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to the provisions of Sections 50022.1 through 50022.8
and 50022.10 of the Government Code. The DMC includes the City's Subdivision Ordinance
(Section 16 of the DMC) and Zoning Ordinance (Section 17 of the DMC).

City of Dinuba                                                                      November 2015
2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                         Page 1-6
Chapter 1 Introduction
       Subdivision Ordinance
        The Subdivision Ordinance regulates the design, development and implementation of
        land division in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Sections
        66410-66499.38). It applies when a parcel is split into two or more parcels; a parcel is
        consolidated with one or more parcels; or the boundaries of two or more parcels are
        adjusted to change the size and/or configuration of the parcels.
       Zoning Ordinance
        The Zoning Ordinance is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan and is
        designed to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
        people. It includes a zoning map designating various districts that are described in the
        text of the document and outlines the permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited
        uses for each zone district. Finally, the Zoning Ordinance provides property development
        standards for each zone district and overall administrative and legislative procedures.
       Zoning for a variety of housing types
        Dinuba’s zoning code encourages a variety of housing types, including second units,
        manufactured housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, emergency
        shelters and transitional housing. The City made efforts in the last planning period to
        ensure that it was compliant with State requirements for these special needs groups. In
        addition, the City has committed to making changes to its zoning code in the current
        planning period, as follows:
        Boarding or Renting Rooms (Single Room Occupancy (SRO))
        The Zoning Ordinance (Section 17.26) permits boarding or renting rooms which are
        considered the equivalent of single-room occupancy (SRO) units. SRO units are allowed
        in the RA, R and RM zoning districts. Currently, the RA Zone allows single-family
        dwellings to rent to not more than two paying guests, while the R and RM Zones allow
        renting rooms and boarding provided that not more than two rooms in a dwelling are
        rented to not more than a total of six persons.
        (While there are no SROs currently in Dinuba, the existing Housing Element for 2009-
        2014 includes [Program 3-10] to prioritize appropriate funds for the development of at
        least one SRO development within the previous planning period.)
        Off-street Parking Restrictions
        The City will amend its off-street parking requirements as specified in the Zoning
        Ordinance and will reduce off-street parking requirements for certain developments,
        including those designed and intended for special needs groups such as persons with
        disabilities, the elderly, or families with 4 or more persons, from 1.0 to 0.75 off-street
        parking spaces per dwelling unit.

City of Dinuba                                                                       November 2015

Chapter 1 Introduction
Specific Plans
        Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide focused guidance and
        regulations for a particular area. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan,
        infrastructure plan, zoning classifications, development standards, design guidelines,
        phasing plan, financing plan and implementation plan. Dinuba has four approved Specific
        Plans as follows: The Northwest Dinuba Specific Plan, the Northeast Dinuba Specific
        Plan, the Southwest Dinuba Specific Plan and the West Dinuba Specific Plan.
1.5     Housing Element Organization
Section 65583 of the California Government Code requires specific components to be contained
in the Housing Element. These components are:
        1.      A review of the previous element’s goals, policies, and programs to determine the
                overall effectiveness of the element.
        2.      A housing needs assessment, and an inventory of resources and constraints that
                are relevant to meeting these needs.
        3.      A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative
                to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
        4.      A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government
                is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the
                goals and objectives of the Housing Element through the administration of land
                use controls, provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the
                utilization of federal and state subsidy programs.
Therefore, to comply with Housing Element requirements as specified in the California
Government Code, this document consists of the following chapters:
Chapter 1, Introduction, describes the organization of the Housing Element, State policy and
authorization, the relationship to other General Plan Elements, maps showing the Plan Area and
Market Area, and organizations, agencies, or individuals who participated in the update process
of this document
Chapter 2, Evaluation of the Housing Element, describes the City of Dinuba’s efforts in
achieving the objectives stated in its prior, 2009-2013 Housing Element. It provides an
evaluation of the appropriateness of Housing Goals, Objectives, and Policies in contributing to
the attainment of the previous planning period’s RHNA, the effectiveness of the Housing
Element in attaining the community’s housing goals, and the progress or lack of progress of the
City in implementing the Housing Element.
Chapter 3, Community Profile, provides an overview of Dinuba’s recent growth in terms of
population and economic development. Information found in the 2014-2023 Tulare County
RHNP, the City of Dinuba 2002 Community Profile, the 2007 General Plan Update Background
Document, and the 2007 Dinuba General Plan is incorporated into the Housing Element as
appropriate, and also contains additional, detailed information. This chapter provides the basis

Chapter 1 Introduction
of information from which the City can determine its housing needs and then establish new
housing Goals, Objectives, and Policies to meet those needs.
Chapter 4, Housing Profile, contains an overview and comparison of the City’s existing housing
stock. Analysis of past trends provides a basis for determining future housing needs. It should be
noted that the data contained in the tables throughout the document are not always reflective of
Year 2014 as much of the data were gathered during the 2010 decennial U.S. Census, or annual
State of California Department of Finance data, the 2014-2023 Tulare County RHNA Plan, or
annual local data.
Chapter 5, Housing Needs, discusses three major housing components: housing affordability (the
ability of someone to pay for a house), housing quality (the size, material, and other features that
increase or decrease the cost of a house), and housing quantity (the number and types of housing
available) and the difficulty that certain segments of the population, such as the elderly, the
disabled, female heads of household, large families, and farm workers have in obtaining
adequate housing.
Chapter 6, Residential Land Resources, contains an inventory of undeveloped lands available for
housing within existing urban boundaries and within the General Plan planning area, which also
includes unincorporated areas under the current jurisdiction of the County of Tulare. Chapter 6
also provides a discussion of approved and proposed residential projects within the City, mixed
uses in the Central Business District, unincorporated lands designated for residential
development, total residential capacities, availability of public facilities, and suitability of sites to
accommodate residential development.
Chapter 7, Development Constraints, discusses constraints, including policies, standards, or
actions that are imposed by various levels of government or other factors on housing
development. Among items discussed are land use controls, such as the residential provisions of
the zoning ordinance, building codes, site improvements (e.g., off-street parking, new
landscaping and irrigation ordinance, walls, sewerage, drainage and water systems), permit
processing, and on-/off-site improvements.
Chapter 8, Goals, Policies, and Objectives, establishes the new general policy guidelines for
Dinuba to accomplish the Housing Element’s vision for future housing opportunities. These
goals, objectives, and policies are consistent with State and national housing goals and reflect a
commitment by the City to provide a decent home and suitable living environment for
individuals and households residing in Dinuba.
Chapter 9, Five Year Action Plan, sets forth a five-year program of actions necessary to achieve
the stated goals. Many of these actions can be accomplished at the local level, while others
require State and Federal government action, including the funding of various housing programs.
This chapter contains sections that present the individual actions and programs necessary to
achieve plan goals. Each goal contains an overview, an identification of existing and potential
actions and programs to meet state goals, a five-year Action Plan, and identification of
responsible agencies and funding sources.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.6      Plan Area
The City of Dinuba is located within Tulare County as shown in Figure 1-1. The area within the
City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) is shown in Figure 1-2.
These two areas are of significance in housing provision and location determination. The Market
Area, which includes all of Tulare County, was established based on socioeconomic linkages that
influence the quality and quantity of housing. The SOI area is important in that it determines the
extent of potential development within the City, and establishes limits for annexation. The third
map of the City’s UDBs establishes the provision of public services. The 2014-2023 RHNP,
developed by the Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG), should be referenced for
a detailed description of the regional market concept.
1.7      Public Participation
The California government Code requires that local government make a diligent effort to
facilitate public participation during development of the Housing Element.
Task Force
For the City’s preparation process, public input has been encouraged through a Task Force
comprised of both City staff and representatives from other agencies and non-profit groups that
were open to the public as well as through questionnaires distributed throughout the community
at events and set locations.
The first meeting was held at the City’s Public Works Department office. Subsequent meetings
were held at the City Council Chambers and were open to the public. Participants included:
         Ed Abair: Dinuba Senior Center
         Jayne Anderson: City of Dinuba - Assistant City Manager/City Clerk

Chapter 1 Introduction
The Task Force met on four occasions to discuss the Housing Element, including input from
members concerning their various areas of expertise. The Task Force represented all special
needs groups, as well as the building industry, Chambers of Commerce, Self Help Enterprises,
and the local public school district. They provided valuable information on numbers of homeless
residents present within the community which included school aged children; data comparing
impact fees; units constructed for various income groups; and ideas on goals and actions for the
planning period. Minutes from Task Force meetings are provided in Appendix B.
Survey Questionnaire
The Task Force provided input on a questionnaire which was made available to the public (see
Appendix B). The questionnaire was revised from the last planning period. One hundred twenty
hard copies (half in English and half in Spanish) were made available at the City’s Transit
Center; another 40 (half in English and half in Spanish) were available at the City’s Senior
Center. The questionnaire was also available in electronic format on the City’s website. Several
of the Task Force members forwarded the link to the City’s website to their professional
members/colleagues as well.
In order to provide time to discuss the results of the questionnaires and incorporate them into the
draft Housing Element, the questionnaires were collected on April 10, 2015. The electronic
survey was open through April 17, 2015. Results are summarized below and provided in detail
in Appendix B below:
A total of 53 surveys were submitted by individuals and three by representatives of groups. A
total of 30 paper forms were returned, primarily from the City Senior Center, and their responses
are apparent in the high rankings for housing for seniors, as described below.
Of the individual surveys, 26 were seniors over age 65, 17 were singles or couples, two were
agricultural workers, two were from large households of over five people, four were single
parents, and five had at least one disability.
Fifteen of the respondents were in the extremely low-income group, four were in the very-low
income group, nine were in the low income group, and 17 were in the moderate or above
moderate-income group. Approximately 52.8 percent were therefore in the lower-income
groups, and 47.2 were in moderate- or above moderate-income groups.
When asked about current living conditions, respondents indicated that 29 own a house or condo,
six live in rented homes, five live in rented mobile homes in a community, three lived in rental
apartments, and two lived in substandard housing while another two were homeless.
In addition to questions about their actual and preferred housing, respondents were asked to rank
the following issues from least important to most important, on a scale of one to three (Bulleted
items occur in the same order as on the questionnaire):
       Maintain character of the neighborhood
       Public Transportation

Chapter 1 Introduction
       Access to services, shopping and schools close to home
       Safety (lighting, sidewalks, security, etc.)
       Healthy home (utilities work property, water is clean and available, etc.)
       Emergency and temporary housing
       Affordable housing for seniors
       Affordable housing for those with disabilities
       Affordable housing for single parents with minor children
       Affordable housing for large families
       Affordable housing for veterans
       Affordable housing for single persons
       Affordable housing for agricultural worker
The issues that ranked the highest (e.g., were the most important) were affordable housing,
particularly for large families; maintaining neighborhood character (score of 2.73); access to
services (score of 2.67); safety (score of 2.86); and healthy homes (2.82). These were followed
closely by affordable homes for seniors (score of 2.63 – almost half of responses were from
seniors), and affordable housing for those with disabilities (score of 2.58).
The issues that ranked of lowest importance were public transportation (score of 2.15),
affordable housing for agricultural workers (score of 2.33), and affordable housing for single
individuals (score of 2.39).
This information was incorporated into the other information provided by the Task Force,
particularly in those actions addressing housing needs for special needs groups.
Additionally, a number of local and state agencies were notified of the availability of the
Housing Element as follows:
        Tulare County Resource Management Agency
        Tulare County Local Agency Formation Commission
        Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency
        Tulare County Association of Governments

Additional Comments
In addition to the questionnaire and discussions with the Task Force, the City and HCD received
the following information on June 19th, 2015. This information has been included in full. A
memo to the City Planning Commission on the subject of Development Impact Fees has also
been included below. The issue of Development Impact Fees has been further addressed in
Chapter 7 – Constraints and in Chapter 9, which includes Actions that the City will consider to
reduce constraints to development of lower income housing.
        Recently I sat on the Advisory Committee for the City of Dinuba’s Housing Element
        update. During that process I became aware that Dinuba’s Development Impact Fees
        for residential development are very much higher than other jurisdictions in Tulare and
        Kings County.
        In Table 7-5 of the Housing Element the single family residential Development Impact
        Fee is shown as ranging from $26,169 to $27,998 after the school fees are subtracted.
        Compare that cost to the Development Impact Fees for single family residential projects
        in other cities in the area:
                 City                       Approximate SFR DIF
                 Visalia                       $15,523
                 Hanford                              $12,935
                 Tulare                               $12,661
                 Exeter                       $9,682
                 Porterville                          $6,957
        Dinuba’s Development Impact Fee is about 1.7 times higher than Visalia’s fee and is
        about 4 times higher than Porterville’s fee.
        The City of Dinuba staff insists that the fees are based on objective analysis driven by
        plans with high standards. That may be true, but the Dinuba fees are a much greater
        burden on affordable and entry level market rate housing than high priced housing that
        some people in Dinuba prefer.
        I attended both Planning Commission and City Council meetings to give testimony
        regarding the Development Impact Fee’s negative impact on housing affordability.
        Copies of my correspondence with the City are attached.
        The Dinuba Multi-family Development Impact Fee of $18,376 per unit is the highest in
        Tulare and Kings Counties. Just because Dinuba has enough land zoned for multi-family
        development it does not mean Dinuba has complied with the intent of Government
        Code 65580 (et. seq.)

City of Dinuba                                                                             November 2015

        405 E. El Monte Way
        Dinuba, Ca 93618
        Ref: Housing Element
        Mr. Chairman and Members of the Planning Commission:
        When comparing Dinuba’s residential Development Impact Fees to other cities in Tulare
        and Kings Counties it is evident that Dinuba’s Development Impact Fees are much higher
        than every other local community. Dinuba’s single family development fees are
        approximately 1.7 times higher than Visalia’s, which are the next highest single family
        fees in both Tulare and Kings Counties.
        Dinuba’s Development Impact Fees present a serious impediment to residents wanting
        to buy a new home. Dinuba’s median annual household income is less than $55,000.
        Based on that number the median income family would only be able to qualify for a
        home mortgage in the low $200,000 range. That equates to the lowest cost entry level
        home in Dinuba. Lower income families that cannot qualify for a mortgage of that
        amount rely on subsidized or government sponsored housing assistance as provided
        through Self-Help Enterprises, Habitat for Humanity or similar organizations. As a result,
        many families in Dinuba are forced to remain renters. Even for rental housing, the
        Impact Fees for a multifamily dwelling unit amounts to about 10% of the cost of the
        unit. To cover the cost, rent must increase proportionally.
        Dinuba’s higher cost for development fees certainly presents a challenge to satisfying
        the requirements for viable Housing Element and for providing for the housing needs of
        a growing population in Dinuba.
        For a city with a median household income of less than $55,000 per year and a chronic,
        double digit unemployment rate, supporting a robust affordable housing industry would
        produce greater benefits for everyone. Additional rooftops provide the basis for a
        healthy expansion of commercial growth. Affordable housing encourages new
        employers to locate where their workers can afford to buy their own homes. Home-
        ownership provides for greater neighborhood stability and pride of ownership in the
        community. By implementing Development Impact Fees for residential projects that are
        excessive by local standards, The City is falling short of complying with the intent of
        Government Code Section 65580 (et. seq.) Local governments have a responsibility to
        facilitate the improvement and development of housing for all economic segments of
        the community. Dinuba’s Development Impact Fees impede rather that facilitate
        housing development.
        Sincerely,

        Building Industry Association of Tulare/Kings Counties

                     EVALUATION OF THE 2009 HOUSING ELEMENT
Pursuant to Section 65588 of the California Government Code, the City of Dinuba has reviewed
its 2009 Housing Element and has evaluated the appropriateness of its Housing Goals,
Objectives, and Policies in contributing to the attainment of the RHNA, the effectiveness of the
Housing Element attaining the community’s housing goals, and the progress or lack of progress
of the City in implementing the Housing Element.
The City understands that a number of changes and additions to the zoning ordinances had not
been implemented earlier in the planning period as scheduled. The City will begin the process of
updating its zoning ordinances in May 2015, with the goal of completing the adoption of these
changes by August 31, 2016. The Actions germane to the zoning ordinance update are listed
below:
Review of the Results of the Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions of the Previous Housing
Element
The 2009 Dinuba Housing Element established eight Goals to facilitate the development of
needed housing during the 2009-2014 planning period. The 2009 Housing Element was
incorporated by reference into the 2007 Dinuba General Plan Update until the 2015-2023
Housing Element could be adopted.
The Goals, Policies and Objectives listed below provided the broad basis for the establishment of
an on-going housing program within the City of Dinuba. Following each set of Goals,
Objectives, and Policies is an analysis of the Actions intended to be taken in support of that Goal
during the last planning period. The analysis includes not only an evaluation of each Action, but
also recommended modifications, revisions, or elimination of those Goals, Objectives, Policies,
and Actions that did not achieve desired results. Actions are numbered with the Goal and Policy
each is intended to support, so that, for example, number 1.3.5 is Action number 5, intended to
support Goal number 1, Policy number 3.
2.1     Goal 1:
Develop through public and private channels sufficient new housing to insure the availability of
affordable housing for all households in Dinuba.
        Objectives
        1.      Facilitate the construction of non-market rate dwellings by 2014 which is the City
                of Dinuba’s Regional Share.
        2.      Facilitate the construction of market-rate dwellings by 2014 which is the City of
                Dinuba’s Regional Share.

City of Dinuba                                                                       November 2015

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        Policies
        1.      Advocate and support proposed Federal and State actions which will create a
                positive, stable climate for housing production.
        2.      Wherever appropriate, facilitate the use of Federal or State programs which can
                assist in development of new housing consistent with identified City-wide
                housing needs and adopted local plans and programs.
        3.      Support efforts which serve to coordinate and improve the ability of the housing
                delivery system to effectively respond to local housing needs.
        4.      Accommodate and encourage development of a full range of housing types within
                the City.
        5.      Maintain a sufficient inventory of developable land to accommodate timely
                development of needed new housing supplies.
        6.      Encourage and participate in efforts designed to achieve economies and
                efficiencies which will facilitate the production of quality, affordable housing.
        7.      Promote balanced, orderly growth to minimize unnecessary development costs
                adding to the cost of housing.
Associated Actions
1.1.1   (Formerly Action 9.1.6) The City’s 2026 General Plan includes Urban
        Growth/Annexation policies to encourage infill of existing vacant land and to discourage
        premature annexation and idling of agricultural land in its Open Space, Conservation
        and Recreation Element. The policies allow increased residential densities and/or
        modified development standards for development of bypassed parcels. The City will
        continue to take into consideration the number and availability of adequate sites within
        the city limits prior to making a recommendation for annexation. Amendments will occur
        as appropriate during the planning process.
        The City annexed approximately 260 acres of land on its northern boundary in 2006 and
        2007. This land is zoned accordingly to allow a potential 835 units to be constructed on
        the properties. Per Tulare County LAFCO, it has been determined that the City contains
        more than an adequate supply of land available for development. Therefore, the City will
        not pursue new annexations within the timeline of the 2014-2023 Housing Element.
        Instead, the City will continue to encourage development of infill areas and areas already
        within city boundaries. The City will not include this Action in the current Housing
        Element.
1.1.2 (Formerly Action 9.1.9) The City will continue to annually update an inventory that details
        the amount type, and size of vacant and underutilized parcels to assist developers in
        identifying land suitable for residential development and that also details the number of

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015
2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                         Page 2-3
Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income units constructed annually. If the
        inventory indicates a shortage of available sites, the City shall rezone sufficient sites to
        accommodate the City’s RHNA. The City will develop and implement a formal ongoing
        (project-by-project) evaluation procedure by January 31, 2012 pursuant to GC Section
        65863. Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity below the
        residential capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower-income
        households, the City will identify and zone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall.
        At present the City does not maintain an inventory of properties with site information.
        However, the City currently maintains enough residentially zoned properties to meet 10-
        year supply standards. This Action will be continued in the next planning period.
1.1.3 (formerly Action 9.2.2.8) The City will continue to support and participate in any
        additional rental housing programs that are intended to provide non-market-rate housing
        in market rate rental projects. This project is seeking funding in part by bond monies
        from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Further, this project will consist
        of 100% low-income units.
        The City supports rental housing programs for low-income rental projects. No funding
        was provided for this purpose in the last planning period. This Action will be continued
        in the next planning period.
1.2.1 (formerly Action 9.1.5) The City will continue to maintain and update its reference maps
        including zoning, infrastructure, and other thematic maps to provide information for
        review and analysis of proposed development and to assist developers in locating
        appropriate sites for housing.
        City land use maps are continually updated as infrastructure is added, areas are annexed,
        and changes are made to zoning and general plan designations.
        The City of Dinuba also continually provides land use information to its consultants
        (Quad Knopf) for updating of an online GIS system. As this is a part of the City’s
        processes, this Action will not be included in the 2014-2023 Housing Element.
1.3.1. (formerly Action 9.3.6) The City will investigate the feasibility of implementing a
        program that would require developers who remove a residential structure from the
        housing market through demolition to replace that lost housing unit or pay an in-lieu
        replacement fee. This fee would be deposited into a fund to be used for affordable
        housing construction. Initiating this program will depend upon the ability of the housing
        market to recover thereby generating possible fees to deposit into an affordable housing
        construction fund.
        This Action was not feasible during the last planning period because of economic
        conditions and the associated lack of development. As housing market conditions are just
        now improving, the above program has not been investigated or implemented. This action
        will not be continued in the next planning period.

City of Dinuba                                                                    November 2015

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
1.4.1. (formerly Action 9.3.7) The City will continue to review its policies relating to housing
        conservation and will adopt new policies and procedures where appropriate. This will
        include, but will not be limited to, new standards for apartment and mobile home park
        construction as well as conversions of apartments and mobile home parks into
        condominiums.
        The City reviewed its policies on housing conservation, although new policies concerning
        housing conservation were not formulated. This Action will be continued in the next
        planning period, and will be implemented as staff time allows.
1.4.2 (formerly Action 9.5.1.2) The City will continually review its development standards in
        order to identify those areas that could result in impediments to the development of new
        housing opportunities.
        The Dinuba Zoning Ordinance is continually reviewed for deficiencies. Regulations that
        impede development, or that pose other issues, are noted throughout the year, to be
        changed through zone amendments which are conducted annually. This Action will be
        continued in the next planning period.
2.2     Goal 2:
Manage housing and community development in a manner which will promote the long-term
integrity and value of each new housing unit and the environment in which it is located.
        Objectives
        1.     Maintain community design and improvement standards that will provide for the
               development of safe, attractive, and functional housing developments and
               residential environments.
        2.     Maintain and update public service master plans, including water, sewer, and
               drainage.
        Policies
        1.     Provide that new housing be constructed in accordance with design standards that
               will ensure the safety and integrity of each housing unit.
        2.     Encourage application of community design standards.
        3.     Manage new residential development within the context of a planning framework
               designed to minimize adverse impacts on the area’s natural resource base and
               overall living environment.
        4.     Manage neighborhood environmental factors such as traffic flow, school
               locations, parks, and open spaces and other public uses to stabilize and upgrade
               neighborhoods and dwellings.

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
Associated Actions
2.1.1. (formerly Action 9.3.7) This Action is the same as Action 1.4.1. The City will continue to
        review its policies relating to housing conservation and will adopt new policies and
        procedures where appropriate. This will include, but will not be limited to, new
        standards for apartment and mobile home park construction as well as conversions of
        apartments and mobile home parks into condominiums.
        The City reviewed its policies on housing conservation, although new policies concerning
        housing conservation were not formulated. This Action will be continued in the next
        planning period, and will be implemented as staff time allows.
2.3.1 (formerly Action 9.2.2.10) To encourage development of affordable housing in multifamily
        housing with units available to rent by lower income families, the City shall consider
        reducing front, rear, and side setbacks, minimum distance between buildings for
        multistory units, and increasing total site area covered by roofed structures for
        multifamily dwelling units as an incentive to the development of affordable housing when
        a minimum of 10% of units will be available to those earning 60 percent or less of Area
        Median Income (AMI). The City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance by reducing front,
        rear, and side setbacks, minimum distance between buildings for multistory units, and
        increasing total site area covered by roofed structures for multifamily dwelling units
        when a minimum of 10 % of units developed to housing for households who earn 60
        percent or less of the AMI. If a development proposal is adjacent to existing or future
        single-family residential uses, adequate and permanent screening in the form of
        landscaping shall be installed and maintained to ensure the privacy of single-family
        residents. Priority will be given to extremely low-income households.
        No action has yet been taken by City Staff to consider reducing setbacks for multi-story
        units or increasing coverage limitations. However, should a development proposal be
        submitted for property adjacent to existing or future single-family residential uses, it will
        be considered by the City, as higher density development is a cornerstone of the Valley
        Blueprint Initiative. This Action will be addressed during the 2015 zoning ordinance
        updates.
2.3.2 (formerly Action 9.2.2.11) Regarding mixed-uses, current zoning allows “any residential
        use existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title” by right in the C-
        1 (Neighborhood Commercial), C-2 (Downtown Commercial), C-3 (Community
        Commercial) and C-4 (General Commercial) districts, and with an administrative plan in
        the PO (Professional Office) district. The City also has a “residential overlay” district
        that encourages mixed use in the C-2 district within the downtown area. The City shall
        consider allowing, with a use permit, residential use in future projects developed in not
        only the C-2 district, but also the PO districts to further encourage mixed use in the
        downtown and neighborhood commercial areas, provide opportunities for residents to
        have immediate access to services, and encourage less automobile traffic in
        neighborhoods and the downtown areas.

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        City Staff completed a Zone Text Amendment that would permit residential above
        commercial uses in the C-2 Zone, and would allow residential use to continue in the PO
        zone if it was present prior to the Amendment.
        The PO zoning consideration to allow, with a use permit, residential use in future projects
        will be included in the next planning period.
2.3.3. (formerly Action 9.5.1.2) The City will monitor site improvement standards, such as
        setbacks and lot coverage requirements, and formulate appropriate modifications, if
        required, that remove unnecessary constraints to development of affordable housing.
        Existing site improvement standards do not currently pose issues to new site proposals.
        Should issues arise, the City provides a number of avenues to ease standards, including
        density bonuses and Variances. This Action will be continued in the next planning
        period.
2.4.1 (formerly Action 9.5.1.4) Current zoning allows second units to be constructed on
        residentially zoned lands where parking access is either from an existing alley or is
        located behind the front unit with access limited to a maximum of a 16-foot wide, paved
        driveway. One additional off-street parking space must be provided for the secondary
        unit. Per Government Codes 65852.2(a)(1)(A) and (B), the City will consider restricting
        construction of second units to those residential lots where access does not impact traffic
        flow or restrict parking for the residents of the primary or secondary dwelling unit.
        At this time, the City has not considered restricting second unit construction in ways
        other than what is prescribed in the Zoning Ordinance. Issues related to traffic flows and
        parking are considered when reviewing applications for new secondary units. This
        Action will be reviewed during the 2015 zoning ordinance updates.
2.5.1 (formerly Action 9.1.4) The City will consider revising its Zoning Ordinance to provide
        for “smart growth,” including incentives and housing density bonuses adequate to meet
        housing needs for Target Income Group households if the goals, objectives and policies
        contained in the 2007 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance Amendments are not realized.
        Also, the City will allow at least one site zoned either R-M 2 or R-M 1.5 with a minimum
        6,300 square feet site (which represents a 10% site area reduction as stated in the Zoning
        Ordinance) to accommodate new multiple-family residential development to meet the
        Low Income housing needs determined in the RHNA. Candidate sites that are currently
        vacant and would be eligible for the 10% site area reduction include 1500 Greene Ave
        (2.33 acres; possible 33 units), 600 Euclid (4.14 acres; possible 60 units), APN 014-033-
        017 (1.55 acres; possible 23 units), APN 014-080-091 (5.36 acres; possible 80 units),
        and APN 017-173-004 (30,361 square feet; possible 17 units). “Smart growth” generally
        refers to development and planning standards that promote consolidation of services,
        convenient location of recreation and commercial facilities (“walkability”), and “new-
        urbanism,” which is essentially a return to planning principles from the mid-20th
        century. These principles include narrow residential streets that may or may not provide
        on-street parking, reduced front setbacks, parking at the rear of buildings (primarily off
        of alleys), shared parks or common areas, wide sidewalks, and traditional architecture.

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        The City’s 2007 General Plan includes an Urban Design Element which incorporates
        many of these concepts. The Zoning Ordinance was also updated concurrently with the
        General Plan. To assure that net loss of density will not occur, zone changes from a
        higher density to a lower density will be permitted only in extreme circumstances.
        The City has participated in the Valley Blueprint program, which encourages smart
        growth principals. The City has received a General Plan Audit from Collins & Schoettler
        and will consider adopting some of the recommendations within the document. The audit
        did determine that the Dinuba General Plan was in conformance with most smart growth
        policies.
        The City currently has numerous RM-2 zone sites ready for development. Of those listed
        in the above Goals, 600 N. Euclid has already been developed. It currently contains a 57
        unit apartment complex run by the Tulare County Housing Authority.
        A 4.68 acre site not listed in the above Goal (1000 Rosemary) also saw completion of a
        48 unit apartment complex, in RM-2 Zone. The project was led by Self Help Enterprises.
        In addition, there is a potential complex between Davis and Sequoia, near Alta Avenue,
        and another potential site for 48 units on 5.36 acres at David and Crawford. The City
        will consider additional zone changes to support smart growth, as described above,
        during the 2015 zoning ordinance updates.
2.3     Goal 3:
Provide for a choice of housing locations for all residents.
        Objective
                Continuously maintain at least a 10-year supply of residential-zoned land at
                various densities within the City Limits, ensuring that any future proposed
                development can be accommodated.
        Policies
        1.      Review and update the Dinuba General Plan on a regular basis to ensure that
                growth trends are accommodated as needed.
        2.      Encourage the development of various types of housing opportunities in all
                residential areas.
        3.      Continue to promote the use of the City’s density bonus procedures, such a
                Planned Unit Developments and/or 10% density bonus allowed by the
                Subdivision Map Act, which encourage the provision of affordable housing.

Associated Actions
3.1.1 (formerly Action 9.1.1) The City will continue to pursue an agreement with Tulare County
        to plan and zone all territory within Dinuba’s Sphere of Influence consistent with
        Dinuba’s General Plan.
        City Staff has been in discussions with the Tulare County Resource Management Agency
        to formalize a process for development within the areas outside of the City, but within the
        limits of the Sphere of Influence. The City has worked toward ensuring that all territories
        within the above areas are zoned to be consistent with the Dinuba General Plan. A Memo
        of Understanding was signed in 2011 between the cities and the County, and
        formalization of the actual process remains under development between them. The City
        completed this action and it will not be continued as an Action under the housing element
        in the current planning period.
3.1.2 (formerly Action 9.1.2) The City will actively pursue annexation of unincorporated areas
        within the City’s Sphere of Influence to provide a 10-year reserve of residentially-zoned
        land to accommodate housing needs as they arise.
        Approximately 260 acres of land were annexed between 2006 and 2007 and is currently
        zoned for residential use. Tulare County LAFCO has determined the City of Dinuba
        currently contains within its boundaries more than enough residentially zoned land to
        meet its State required 10-year reserve. As such, the City will not be pursuing
        annexations within this Housing Element period. This Action will not be included in the
        next planning period.
3.1.3 (formerly Action 9.1.3) Dinuba will update its 2007 General Plan as needed to account
        for changes in land use designations, General Plan amendments, and to be consistent
        with adopted Specific Plans. The 2007 General Plan, a 25-year plan, was adopted in
        October, 2008.
        City Staff will continue to update the General Plan as needed to accommodate changes in
        land use plans. Recent changes include zone changes from residential to commercial
        along the E. El Monte Way and N. Alta Avenue arterials. This Action is included in the
        City’s processes, and will not be included in the 2014-2023 planning period.
3.1.4 (formerly Action 9.2.2.7) The City will amend the 2007 General Plan as needed and will
        utilize specific plans to ensure that sufficient land is provided to meet future multifamily
        residential needs through the planning period. The City will maintain a land reservation
        of at least a 10-year supply in order to allow sufficient land and site choices and to
        minimize inflated land values typically associated with insufficient growth areas.
        Per the 2009 City of Dinuba Housing Element, there is more than enough residentially
        zoned property within the City planning area to fulfill a 10-year supply. The City will
        continue to maintain at minimum enough property to comply with State mandated limits.
        This Action will not be included in the next planning period.

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
3.1.5 (formerly Action 9.2.2.9) To further encourage housing for its extremely low- and very-
        low income households, the City will analyze recent changes in the General Plan and the
        Zoning Ordinance that allow mobile homes on single-family lots and continue to provide
        density bonuses for lower- and moderate-income housing, allow secondary residential
        units on single- and multifamily lots; identify the impacts these changes may have on
        lower- and moderate- income housing availability and affordability; identify problems
        that limit these programs; and formulate proposed changes that would remove barriers
        that adversely affect the ability to meet housing needs. Priority will be given to extremely
        low-income households.
        The City of Dinuba continues to provide density bonuses for low income housing, as well
        as provide processes for the placement of mobile homes and secondary units. As of now,
        City Staff time and resources have been severely restricted which has not allowed for an
        analysis to be conducted to identify if any problems exist with these programs.
        Therefore, this Action will be continued in the current planning period.
3.2.1 (formerly Action 9.5.1.1) The City will continually review its Zoning Ordinance to identify
        those obstacles to timely development of all housing types.
        City Staff continually review the Zoning Ordinance for deficiencies. Zone Text
        Amendments are regularly conducted, the latest occurring in 2014, which brought
        residential care home standards into compliance with State requirements, allowing
        residential in C-2 as a permitted use. This Action is a part of the City’s standard
        processes, and will not be included in the current planning period.
3.2.2 (formerly Action 9.1.8) The City will continue to identify government-owned land within
        the City and its SOI for possible housing development. If appropriate sites are identified,
        the City will approach potential developers and funding agencies to facilitate
        development of the sites with assisted housing.
        Because the City annexed sufficient land during the planning period, no additional lands
        need to be identified, although much of the City holdings are zoned for industrial use.
        However, the City has used some of its land for development of lower income housing,
        such as Emperor Estates. The City will continue to identify government-owned land
        within the City and SOI for potential development.
3.2.3 (formerly Action 9.5.2.3) The City will continue to grant density bonuses, which can
        amount to a 35 percent increase in the number of units permitted, and additional
        incentives for projects providing lower-income and other special needs housing.
        The City is committed to continuing the availability of density bonuses for housing
        developments. The City also provides support for developments looking to secure State
        funding for qualifying housing projects. This Action will be continued in the current
        housing element.

2.4     Goal 4:
Maintain and improve the quality of existing neighborhoods and housing stock.
        Objectives
        1.     Conserve existing dwellings for very low and low-income households through
               the planning period (2014) and where practicable, beyond the planning period.
        2.     Encourage and facilitate the participation of Self-Help Enterprises (SHE), the
               Central Valley Coalition for Affordable Housing and other non-profit developers
               to assist in the rehabilitation and conservation of housing within Dinuba.
        Policies
        1.     Monitor housing stock quality to maintain a current inventory of all substandard
               housing units.
        2.     Provide for removal of all unsafe, substandard dwellings which cannot be
               economically repaired.
        3.     Encourage development of new housing on vacant land within existing
               neighborhoods which have the necessary service infrastructure.
        4.     Support and encourage all public and private efforts to rehabilitate and improve
               the existing housing stock.
        5.     Promote public awareness of the need for housing and neighborhood
               conservation.
        6.     Manage public housing projects to ensure proper maintenance of the area’s public
               housing inventory.
        7.     Support actions which foster and maintain high levels of owner-occupancy,
               particularly in those neighborhoods in which housing quality is declining.
        8.     Promote development of public policies and regulations which provide incentives
               for proper maintenance of owner-occupied and rental housing.
        9.     Manage development of land within and adjacent to existing neighborhoods to
               avoid potentially adverse impacts on the living environment.
        10.    Encourage proper maintenance of essential public services and facilities in
               residential development.
        11.    Encourage available public and private housing rehabilitation assistance programs
               where such action is needed to ensure preservation of the living environment.

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015

        12.     Facilitate maximum utilization of Federal and State programs which can assist
                lower income homeowners to properly maintain their dwelling units.
        13.     Rehabilitate an annual average of ten dwellings for extremely low-, very low-, or
                low income households through 2014.
Associated Actions
4.1.1 (formerly Action 9.3.8) The City will maintain an inventory of those units in need of repair
        or demolition and will provide for the removal of all unsafe, substandard dwellings that
        cannot be economically repaired.
        While City Staff do keep records of units that have been reported as being unsafe for
        habitation, an inventory of units needing repair is not currently kept. Due to the
        limitations of staff time, the City is unable to keep track of all substandard in need of
        repair or removal. The City will consider revising this program during the current
        planning period to better track units in need of repair.
4.1.2 (formerly Action 9.3.9) The City will develop a program for monitoring housing units that
        are at risk of conversion to market rate. The City will, as necessary and feasible, provide
        financial and technical assistance both to existing managers of low-income housing
        projects and to prospective purchasers of low-income projects to assure that the units are
        preserved. The City will proactively seek funding resources and partnerships with non-
        profit organizations to preserve units in danger of converting to market rates at their
        current levels. The City will also directly contact tenants of these developments and
        provide information regarding potential conversion dates, rental subsidies, and other
        assistance available through City of Dinuba and County of Tulare agencies as well as
        non-profit organizations.
        There are currently no units at risk of becoming market rate. Because there is a well-
        established demand for low-income rental property, property owners have not considered
        conversions or sales. Although the City is fortunate to have reliable, lower income
        housing, this Action will be continued in the current planning period.
4.1.3 (formerly Action 9.2.2.12) To address at-risk units, the City will add a program to monitor
        these units, ensure compliance with noticing requirements, establish partnerships with
        entities qualified to acquire and manage at-risk units to have staff and action plan ready
        to move forward upon notice of conversion, and provide assistance and education to
        tenants.
        The City of Dinuba has previously had a program to address at-risk units, but because of
        funding shortfalls in the last planning periods the program was cancelled. The City
        maintains a relationship with Self Help Enterprises, a non-profit housing organization,
        and refers owners to them to obtain assistance. Although the City is fortunate to have
        reliable, lower income housing and a long-standing relationship with Self Help
        Enterprises, this Action will be continued in the current planning period.

4.1.4 (formerly Action 9.3.4) All housing units being constructed, rehabilitated, expanded, or
        relocated will be inspected by the City Building Official, who enforces the Uniform
        Building Code and several related sub-codes, such as the Plumbing and Electrical
        Codes, pursuant to the State Housing Law (California Administrative Code, Title 25,
        Chapter 1).
        Building inspection by the Building Official and Building Inspectors is ongoing. The
        City is currently looking to hire a new inspector to replace the one that left on medical
        leave. Newly occupied units are also inspected prior to move in. This Action has
        become part of the City’s processes and will not be included in the current planning
        period.
4.6.1 (formerly 9.3.4) This Action is the same as 4.1.4. All housing units being constructed,
        rehabilitated, expanded, or relocated will be inspected by the City Building Official, who
        enforces the Uniform Building Code and several related sub-codes, such as the Plumbing
        and Electrical Codes, pursuant to the State Housing Law (California Administrative
        Code, Title 25, Chapter 1).
        Building inspection by the Building Official and Building Inspectors is ongoing. The
        City is currently looking to hire a new inspector to replace the one that left on medical
        leave. Newly occupied units are also inspected prior to move in. This Action has
        become part of the City’s processes and will not be included in the current planning
        period.
4.7.1 (formerly Action 9.3.2) The City will support Housing Authority administration of the
        Housing Choice Voucher Program Moderate Rehabilitation Program, which provides for
        improvements to existing housing units as well as rental assistance payments on behalf of
        lower-income families. The Housing Authority will solicit proposals from owners who
        have units that do not meet minimum quality housing standards and are interested in
        putting their units in the program. If rehabilitation is deemed feasible, the property
        owners will be responsible for making all required improvement, and when completed,
        will execute a 15-year contract for rent subsidies for qualified renters. The rents for
        these units will be higher than for the regular Housing Choice Voucher Program in order
        to provide additional income for repaying the cost of rehabilitation.
        The City participates in the HCD's housing rehab programs generally funded with
        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships
        Program (HOME) or CalHOME funds. However, this program is available only to
        owner-occupied dwellings and persons renting cannot participate at this time. This
        Action will be included in the current Housing Element.
4.11.1 (formerly Action 9.3.10) The City will enact a program to assist in the preservation of at-
        risk units. When at-risk units and/or projects are identified through the monitoring
        program, the City will assist in the securing of grants or other sources of funding that
        can be used to maintain the low-rent status of the units and/or projects. The City

        participates in the HOME and CDBG programs annually, and can use funds from these
        sources to provide security from conversion.
        No at-risk units were identified in the last planning period, and it is unlikely that there
        will be in the current planning period. If any should be, the City will work within the
        available funding sources and with the Housing Authority to avoid conversion. This
        Action will be continued in the current planning period.
2.5     Goal 5:
Promote equal access to safe and decent housing for all income groups.
        Objectives
        1.      Facilitate the provision of homeowner and rental assistance to very-low and low-
                income households.
        2.      Research and apply for housing assistance from applicable federal and state
                housing programs.
        Policies
        1.      Encourage enforcement of fair housing laws throughout the City.
        2.      Support programs which increase employment and economic opportunities.
        3.      Encourage development of a range of housing for all income levels in proximity
                to existing and planned employment centers.
        4.      Encourage full utilization of Federal and State assistance programs which can
                enable those persons with unmet housing needs to obtain decent housing at prices
                they can afford.
        5.      Support the development of housing plans and programs, including new
                government subsidized housing, which maximizes housing choices for minorities
                and lower-income households commensurate with need.
        6.      Wherever possible, implement adopted land development and resource
                management policies without imposing regulations which have the effect of
                excluding housing for lower income groups.
        7.      Develop record keeping methods to track the City’s accomplishments in meeting
                its non-market rate housing needs allocation.

Associated Actions
5.1.1. (formerly Action 9.4.12) The city will revise the definition of “Family” to be in
        compliance with State Fair Housing Law.
        The intent of this Action is to ensure that those seeking rental housing are not
        discriminated against because they are not related by blood or marriage to others living in
        unit, and that household size is not limited. This includes the elimination of the “limit of
        six unrelated persons in a household” and instead, defining “family” as a “household unit
        of at least two persons. Family shall also not be limited to those persons related by blood
        or marriage.” No action has been taken by City Staff to change the definition of
        "Family" within the Zoning Ordinance. This will be done when the Zoning Ordinance is
        next reviewed in the current planning period. (The current City Zoning Ordinance defines
        “Family” as “an individual, or two (2) or more persons who are related by blood or
        marriage, or a group of not more than six (6) persons not necessarily related by blood or
        marriage, living together in a dwelling unit; full-time domestic servants of any such
        persons may reside on the same premises, and shall not be counted with respect to the
        foregoing definition.”)
5.1.2 (formerly Action 9.7.1) The City will direct residents with discrimination complaints to the
        State Department of Fair Employment and Housing (FEH). Commencing in 2005, the
        City will began active advertisement of fair housing policy. This includes reference to
        such policies on the City’s website, http://www.dinuba.ca.gov, posting of information at
        City Hall, the Parks and Community Services Recreation Center, the Dinuba Police
        Department, and other public locales. The City will also make available at City Hall
        pamphlets describing the mandates of FEH.
        Residents with discrimination complaints will be referred to the State Department of Fair
        Employment and Housing. Fair Housing policy is not currently referenced on the City
        Website or at City offices. This Action will be included in the current planning period,
        with the intent to update the website with this information within six months of the
        adoption of the 2014-2023 Housing Element.
5.2.1 (formerly Action 9.2.1) The City, through the Redevelopment Agency, will continue its
        programs assisting low-and moderate-income households to become homeowners. The
        Agency will also continue to work with non-profit organizations to build houses in
        Dinuba for sale to eligible households. The City has a close working relationship with
        Self-Help Enterprises (SHE) in Visalia, CA, which administrates the City’s HOME and
        CDBG Rehabilitation programs. During the previous planning period, no affordable
        single-family units were accomplished. During the housing boon during 2004-2007, land
        for residential development was “priced out” of range for affordable single family
        homes. Land values skyrocketed so that lower income housing developers could not
        financially compete with the private developers. Since that time, land prices have
        decreased significantly. If opportunities present themselves, the City will make efforts to
        secure reasonably priced land to purchase thereby lowering housing costs within grasp
        of affordable housing pricing. In the event opportunities present themselves, the City will

        engage SHE to construct a subdivision in a similar fashion to the 83 units constructed
        during the 1997-2003 planning period.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion were unable to be fully met. This Action will be revised in the current
        planning period to reflect the current relationships with Self-Help Enterprises and
        funding sources they administer.
5.2.2 (formerly Action 9.2.12) The City and the Redevelopment Agency will continue to work
        with developers on urban infill projects that will provide low- and moderate-income
        housing opportunities. As added incentive for developers of infill projects, nearly all
        necessary infrastructure is already accounted for, greatly reducing the cost of
        development, subsequently resulting in a reduction of home prices. Further, the City can
        coordinate private development in conjunction with projects identified in the City’s
        Capital Investment Program, also potentially reducing the cost of housing development.
        The Development Services Department will continually update its maps showing all
        vacant land with the potential to accommodate infill housing. The maps will depict those
        sites with a minimum lot size that can accommodate at least one single family home.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing Element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion were unable to be fully met. The City of Dinuba maintains a
        Development Master List and Map providing information on approved and tentatively
        approved subdivisions. The List is updated on a monthly basis by City Staff. This
        Action will be continued in the current planning period.
5.2.3 (formerly Action 9.2.13) The City will encourage developers to make application from
        FmHA Interest Subsidy programs and will work with and assist those developers. The
        City will take all actions necessary to expedite processing and approvals for such
        projects, and will make available fee credits and density bonuses for developers agreeing
        to provide lower-income housing.
        Due to limited staff resources, the City has not become familiar enough with the scope of
        the FmHA Interest Subsidy programs to be able to assist developers with their
        applications. City staff will work with other agencies to ensure that this action can be
        successfully completed during the current planning period. This Action will be continued
        in the current planning period.
5.2.4 (formerly Action 9.2.2.6) The City will work with the Housing Authority and seek an
        Article 34 approval within the City of Dinuba to facilitate the funding of housing for
        extremely low-, very low- and low-income families.
        The City completed an application for Article 34 approval by July 1, 2011. Article 34
        requires that in order for a state public body to develop, construct or acquire low-rent

        housing using 50% or more of HOME funds or other federal funding sources, “a majority
        of the qualified electors of the city…in which it is proposed to develop, construct, or
        acquire the same, voting upon such issue, approve such project by voting in favor thereof
        at an election to be held for that purpose, or at any general or special election.” The City
        has found that typically, those interested in developing lower income housing try to find
        funds other than federal funding sources. This Action will not be continued in the current
        Housing Element.
5.4.1 (formerly Action 9.2.2.3) The City will continue to support the Housing Authority’s
        implementation of the conventional Public Housing Rental Program and Housing Choice
        Voucher Program, which provide rent subsidies directly to participants’ landlords, and
        will support that Authority’s attempts to secure additional funding for expanded
        programs, particularly for extremely low-income households.
        The City continues to support this program which benefits lower income households.
        This Action will be continued in the current housing element update.
5.4.2 (formerly Action 9.2.2.13) The City will assist renters seeking affordable housing by
        providing written information (in the form of brochures or flyers in English and Spanish)
        about rental programs available through the Tulare County Housing Authority and other
        non-profit organizations. Information will be available at the City Hall and the
        Development and Engineering counter.
        Information on housing rehabilitation through Self Help Enterprises is currently provided
        at the Public Works Office. However, information on low income housing is not
        currently provided at either the City Hall or Public Works offices. City Staff has not yet
        contacted the Tulare County Housing Authority and other non-profit organizations to
        obtain brochures and other information for dissemination at City offices.        This Action
        will be continued in the current planning period.
5.4.3 (formerly Action 9.3.1) The City will continue to apply for CDBG and HOME funds for
        housing rehabilitation and to actively participate in outreach efforts to inform city
        residents that these programs are available. Self-Help Enterprises, Inc. (SHE)
        administers the City’s marketing and outreach for these programs. Marketing includes
        mailed notices to prospective developers and tenants, phone solicitations, and related
        strategies. SHE receives approximately $50,000 annually from the Dinuba
        Redevelopment Agency to manage the CDBG, HOME, and Cal-Home programs. This
        funding is separate from the approximately 18% funding SHE receives for the activity
        delivery and administration of the grants. During the HE planning period, the City will
        target a total of 25-30 units, depending upon the availability of funding and costs per
        unit.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing Element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion are unable to be fully met. This Action will be revised to exclude the
        RDA component, and will be otherwise included in the current planning period. The City

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        has continued to work with Self Help Enterprises throughout the planning period. In
        recent years, SHE received $10,000 annually from the City’s General Fund – not the
        $50,000 noted above. In addition, SHE received $1,271,723 in CDBG funds, in the form
        of deferred payment loans, and assisted the city with rehabilitation of 27 single family
        units, including 11 for low income, nine for very low income, and nine for extremely low
        income households. This Action will be revised to exclude the RDA component, and will
        be otherwise included in the current planning period.
5.4.4 (formerly Action 9.5.2.1) The City will research alternative methods of financing for low-
        income and special needs households home ownership opportunities.
        The City actively participates in HCD housing programs (i.e. First Time Homebuyers)
        that enable first time homebuyers that are low income to secure a deferred loan up to 49%
        of a home's sales price. This Action will be continued in the current planning period.
5.6.1 (formerly Action 9.3.5) The City of Dinuba and Tulare County will continue to enforce
        the Housing Code, which provides minimum health and safety standards for the
        maintenance of the existing housing supply. These standards are intended to provide for
        safe and sanitary housing that are suitable for human habitation. The Tulare County
        Health and Human Services Agency has the authority to enforce housing violations. Due
        to limited resources, the enforcement of the Housing Code is handled on a passive,
        complaint-response basis.
        Housing violations continue to be taken on a complaint only basis. City Staff continue to
        follow up on complaints and enforce the Housing Code. Tools used to enforce
        compliance include citations, and liens on properties. This Action will be included in the
        current planning period.
2.6     Goal 6:
Promote energy conservation in all residential neighborhoods.
        Objective
        1.       Maintain local ordinances, and support federal and state regulations to promote
                 energy conservation.
        2.       Utilize regional, State, and federal opportunities to provide funding for energy
                 conservation.
        3.       Promote energy conservation through education programs

        2.      Promote public awareness of the need for energy conservation.
        3.      Promote development of public policies and regulations that achieve a high level
                of energy conservation in all new and rehabilitated housing units.
        4.      Encourage maximum utilization of Federal and State programs that assist
                homeowners in providing energy conservation measures.
Associated Actions
6.1.1 (formerly Action 9.6.2) The City will continue to enforce building code regulations (Title
        24, California Administrative Code) that require compliance with residential energy
        conservation measures for all new construction, remodeling, and rehabilitation.
        In its ongoing efforts to support State and local regulations regarding energy
        conservation, the City will continue requiring compliance of building code regulations.
        This Action will continue in the next planning period. In addition, the California Energy
        Commission has updated the Energy Codes along with other portions of the California
        Building Standards that were released in January 2014. The 2013 Building Energy
        Efficiency Standards, comprising Title 24, Parts 1 and 6, of the California Code of
        Regulations, is mandatory statewide. Local government agencies may adopt and enforce
        energy efficiency standards for newly constructed buildings, additions, alterations, and
        repairs provided the California Energy Commission finds that the standards will require
        buildings to consume no more energy than permitted by Title 24, Part 6. Such local
        standards may include adopting the requirements of Title 24, Part 6 before their effective
        date, requiring additional energy conservation measures, or setting stricter energy
        budgets.
6.1.2 (formerly Action 9.6.3) The City will strongly encourage the use of U.S. Green Building
        Council (USGBC) LEED® Programs and Services to promote residential development
        that is environmentally responsible, profitable and healthy places to live. Among the
        techniques used to achieve energy efficiency and conservation are window glazing,
        landscaping, building design, cooling and heating systems, weatherization techniques
        (such as insulation, caulking, and weather-stripping), energy efficient appliances, and
        efficient use of lighting through the use of fluorescent bulb fixtures instead of
        incandescent bulbs in average fixtures. Projects containing LEED compliant components
        will receive expedited review to provide as quick turnaround/approval as possible.
        The City does not actively encourage the use of U.S. Green Building Council LEED
        Programs. All developments are built to City and State Building Code requirements.
        When possible, the City encourages the use of energy efficient methods/equipment. This
        Action will continue in the next planning period.
6.2.1 (formerly Action 9.6.1) The City will support programs that promote residential energy
        conservation and public awareness by providing information at the Development and
        Engineering Services Department and on the City’s website.

City of Dinuba                                                                      November 2015

        Information on PG&E energy saving programs has been shared on City social media
        sites. However, energy conservation information has not yet been provided on the City
        website or Public Works office. This Action will be included in the current planning
        period, with the expectation that the website will be updated within the first six months
        after adoption of the Housing Element Update.
6.2.2 (formerly Action 9.6.7) The City will continue to provide information to residents
        regarding the availability of free or low-cost programs for weatherizing homes
        (including P&E program for free weatherization to eligible low-income home owners).
        Information will be posted at appropriate locations (e.g., at City Hall, at the City
        Development and Engineering Services Department, on the City’s website, etc.)
        Information on PG&E energy saving programs has been shared on City social media
        sites. However, energy conservation information has not yet been provided on the City

        period, with the expectation that the website will be updated within the first six months
        after adoption of the Housing Element Update.
6.3.1 (formerly Action 9.6.8) Better placement of and access to natural shading would benefit
        City residents of affordable, multifamily units. Shade trees in common areas allows
        tenants of affordable housing to conserve air conditioning usage by providing an option
        of spending time outdoors in a cool, shaded environment. This alternative to keeping cool
        would reduce household cooling costs by providing a minor cost reduction in the form of
        reduced energy consumption and subsequent energy use charges. The City shall consider
        alternative landscaping designs that allow more trees and shrubs in common areas, and
        fewer trees in parking areas and adjacent to streets, as is currently required by section
        17.24.160 of the Zoning Ordinance. Landscaping coverage of less than ten percent shall
        also be considered if the cost to landscape is proven to be a financial constraint to an
        otherwise affordable housing project. This does not preclude compliance with all new
        landscaping requirements of the State mandated Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance
        adopted by the City and effective January 1, 2010.
        Changes to existing landscaping standards have not been considered by the City.
        Landscaping is an important component of all residential developments. Efforts by City
        Staff will continue to be made to ensure that all rules provide for sufficient shading. The
        Zoning Ordinance is reviewed on a regular basis, and this Action will be continued in the
        current planning period, with the expectation that the issue of revising landscaping
        requirements will be considered during that period of time.
6.4.1 (formerly Action 9.6.4) The City will encourage energy savings through a number of
        means with new construction, including encouraging infill, promoting construction that
        incorporates Energy Star appliances, and providing information on tax breaks, credits
        and other incentives for developers (for both low income and moderate/above moderate
        income levels).      In addition, programs are available to encourage upgrades,
        weatherization, and replacement of high-energy consuming appliances in existing homes.
        The City will provide builders interested in construction of affordable housing a copy of
        the “Go Solar California: A Tool Kit for Affordable Home Developers,” as provided by

City of Dinuba                                                                        November 2015

Chapter 2 Evaluation of the 2009 Housing Element
        the California Energy Commission’s New Solar Homes Partnership. This includes a
        guide to assist developers in including photovoltaic systems in their developments, and
        describes incentives, tax credits, funding, and application processes. The Tool Kit also
        provides information on calculating utility costs, so that better estimates can be made to
        determine the final cost of the “housing burden” (rent + utility costs), that cannot exceed
        30 percent of each renter’s income. This will allow developers to determine how much
        can be spent per unit to realize a reasonable rate of return on their investment in energy
        efficiency and photovoltaic systems.
        The City does not conduct programs to encourage energy savings in new developments.
        Developers are often referred to infill sites when looking for potential areas to develop.
        However, no official programs that provide information on tax breaks, incorporating
        energy efficient appliances and incentives are in place. This Action will be continued
        into the current planning period, with information to be made available to builders within
        six months of certification of the current housing element.
6.4.2 (formerly Action 9.6.5) The City will encourage all who apply for a building permit,
        including affordable housing developers, as well as other developers, construction
        managers, and individuals to apply for incentives for photovoltaic systems from utility
        companies and others by providing a list of potential sources for rebates, tax credits,
        reduced prices and installation costs, and other incentives.
        The City does not currently provide developers with information on energy incentives at
        the time of building permit submittal. This Action will be continued in the current
        planning period, and may be revised to encourage outside sources to contribute to the list
        (e.g., developers, energy providers, State agencies, etc.)
6.4.3 (formerly Action 9.6.6) The City will encourage developers and individuals applying for
        building permits to consider electric appliances and windows with Energy Star ratings by
        providing website locations for Energy Star ratings, as well as utility companies offering
        rebates.
        The City does not currently encourage developers and individuals to consider using
        electric appliances and products with Energy Star ratings. Information has been provided
        on City social media sites, but not on the official City website. This Action will be
        continued in the current planning period and may be revised to encourage outside sources
        to contribute to the list (e.g., developers, energy providers, State agencies, etc.)

        2. Research and apply for housing assistance from applicable federal and state housing
            programs
        Policies
        1. Encourage enforcement of fair housing laws throughout the City.
        2. Support programs which increase employment and economic opportunities.
        3. Encourage development of a range of housing for all income levels in proximity to
            existing and planned employment centers.
        4. Encourage full utilization of federal and state assistance programs which can enable
            those persons with unmet housing needs to obtain decent housing at prices they can
            afford.
        5. Support the development of housing plans and programs, including new government
            subsidized housing, which maximizes housing choice for minorities and lower-
            income households commensurate with need.
        6. Wherever possible, implement adopted land development and resource management
            policies without imposing regulations which have the effect of excluding housing for
            lower income groups.
        7. Develop record keeping methods to track the City’s accomplishments in meeting its
            non-market-rate housing need allocation.
Associated Actions
7.1.2 (formerly Action 9.7.1) The City will direct residents with discrimination complaints to the
        State Department of Fair Employment and Housing (FEH). Commencing in 2005, the
        City will began active advertisement of fair housing policy. This includes reference to
        such policies on the City’s website, http://www.dinuba.ca.gov, posting of information at
        City Hall, the Parks and Community Services Recreation Center, the Dinuba Police
        Department, and other public locales. The City will also make available at City Hall
        pamphlets describing the mandates of FEH.
        Residents with discrimination complaints will be referred to the State Department of Fair
        Employment and Housing. Fair Housing policy is not currently advertised on the City
        Website or at City offices. This Action will be included in the current planning period,
        with the expectation that the website will be updated within the first six months after
        adoption of the Housing Element Update.
7.2.1 (formerly Action 9.2.1) Same as Action 5.2.1. The City, through the Redevelopment
        Agency, will continue its programs assisting low-and moderate-income households to
        become homeowners. The Agency will also continue to work with non-profit
        organizations to build houses in Dinuba for sale to eligible households. The City has a

        close working relationship with Self-Help Enterprises (SHE) in Visalia, CA, which
        administrates the City’s HOME and CDBG Rehabilitation programs. During the
        previous planning period, no affordable single-family units were accomplished. It is our
        belief that the housing boon during 2004-2007 “priced out” the ability of the City and
        non-profits in acquiring land to develop affordable housing. Land values skyrocketed so
        that lower income housing developers could not financially compete with the private
        developers. If opportunities present themselves, the City will make efforts to secure
        reasonably priced land to purchase thereby lowering housing costs within grasp of
        affordable housing pricing. In the event opportunities present themselves, the City will
        engage SHE to construct a subdivision in a similar fashion to the 83 units constructed
        during the 1997-2003 planning period.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion are unable to be fully met. This Action will be revised in the current
        planning period to reflect the current relationships with Self-Help Enterprises, and
        funding sources they administer.
7.2.2 (formerly Action 9.2.1.2) Same as Action 5.2.2. The City and the Redevelopment Agency
        will continue to work with developers on urban infill projects that will provide low- and
        moderate-income housing opportunities. As added incentive for developers of infill
        projects, nearly all necessary infrastructure is already accounted for, greatly reducing
        the cost of development, subsequently resulting in a reduction of home prices. Further,
        the City can coordinate private development in conjunction with projects identified in the
        City’s Capital Investment Program, also potentially reducing the cost of housing
        development. The Development Services Department will continually update its maps
        showing all vacant land with the potential to accommodate infill housing. The maps will
        depict those sites with a minimum lot size that can accommodate at least one single
        family home.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing Element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion are unable to be fully met. The City of Dinuba maintains a Development
        Master List and Map providing information on approved and tentatively approved
        subdivisions. The List is updated on a monthly basis by City Staff. This Action will be
        revised and continued in the current planning period.
7.2.3 (formerly Action 9.2.1.3) Same as Action 5.2.3 The City will encourage developers to
        make application from FmHA Interest Subsidy programs and will work with and assist
        those developers. The City will take all actions necessary to expedite processing and
        approvals for such projects, and will make available fee credits and density bonuses for
        developers agreeing to provide lower-income housing.
        Due to limited staff resources, the City has not become familiar enough with the scope of
        the FmHA Interest Subsidy programs to be able to assist developers with their

        applications. The City will make efforts to become familiar with FmHA Interest Subsidy
        Programs, so that they can be a resource for those interested in the program. Action will
        be continued in the current planning period.
7.2.4 (formerly Action 9.2.2.6) Same as Action 5.2.4. The City will work with the Housing
        Authority and seek an Article 34 approval within the City of Dinuba to facilitate the
        funding of housing for extremely low-, very low- and low-income families.
        The City completed an application for Article 34 approval by July 1, 2011. This Action
        will be continued in the current Housing Element.
7.2.5 (formerly Action 9.1.8) Same as Action 3.2.2. The City will continue to identify
        government-owned land within the City and its SOI for possible housing development. If
        appropriate sites are identified, the City will approach potential developers and funding
        agencies to facilitate development of the sites with assisted housing.
        No action was taken on this Action. The City has more than sufficient land available for
        potential residential development. This Action will not be included in the current
        housing element.
7.4.1 (formerly Action 9.2.2.4) The City will encourage developers to make application for
        California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) AB 333 Subsidized Rental allocations,
        which provide subsidized interest rates and operating subsidies to developers of rental
        housing projects.
        The City has not had the opportunity to facilitate the use of this program. CalHFA allows
        renters and homebuyers to make low interest rate loans, and works with HCD and other
        agencies to provide homes for those with disabilities, the elderly, the homeless, and
        others. The City will make additional efforts to provide an informational resource to
        developers during the current planning period.
7.4.2 (formerly Action 9.3.1) The City will continue to apply for CDBG and HOME funds for
        housing rehabilitation and to actively participate in outreach efforts to inform city
        residents that these programs are available. Self-Help Enterprises, Inc. (SHE)
        administers the City’s marketing and outreach for these programs. Marketing includes
        mailed notices to prospective developers and tenants, phone solicitations, and related
        strategies. SHE receives approximately $50,000 annually from the Dinuba
        Redevelopment Agency to manage the CDBG, HOME, and Cal-Home programs. This
        funding is separate from the approximately 18% funding SHE receives for the activity
        delivery and administration of the grants. During the HE planning period, the City will
        target a total of 25-30 units, depending upon the availability of funding and costs per
        unit.
        The Dinuba Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was dissolved in 2012, following budget
        reducing actions taken by the State of California. Funding provided by the State to the
        RDA consequently ceased. As such, Housing Element goals dependent on RDA funds
        for completion are unable to be fully met. This Action will be revised to exclude the

        RDA component, and will be otherwise included in the current planning period. The City
        has continued to work with Self Help Enterprises throughout the planning period. In
        recent years, SHE received $10,000 annually from the City’s General Fund – not the
        $50,000 noted above. In the last planning period, SHE assisted the city with
        rehabilitation of 29 units, including 11 for low income, nine for very low income, and
        nine for extremely low income households. This Action will be revised to exclude the
        RDA component, and will be otherwise included in the current planning period.
7.4.3 (formerly Action 9.2.2.4) Same as 7.4.1. The City will encourage developers to make
        application for California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) AB 333 Subsidized Rental
        allocations, which provide subsidized interest rates and operating subsidies to developers
        of rental housing projects. See discussion No. 2, above.
        The City has not had the opportunity to facilitate the use of this program. The City will
        make additional efforts to provide an informational resource to developers during the
        current planning period.
7.4.4 (formerly Action 9.2.2.5) The City will continue to encourage developers to make
        application to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, which issues bonds and
        provides tax credits to help fund development of multifamily development and
        rehabilitation. Developers are eligible to receive density bonuses if developers agree to
        provide certain levels of housing for special needs or lower-income groups.
        A new 62 unit apartment complex for Seniors (Emperor Estates) was constructed
        (dedication 2013) using funds from the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee.
        This Action will be continued in the current planning period.
7.4.5 (formerly Action 9.3.2) Same as Action 4.7.1. The City will support Housing Authority
        administration of the Housing Choice Voucher Program Moderate Rehabilitation
        Program, which provides for improvements to existing housing units as well as rental
        assistance payments on behalf of lower-income families. The Housing Authority will
        solicit proposals from owners who have units that do not meet minimum quality housing
        standards and are interested in putting their units in the program. If rehabilitation is
        deemed feasible, the property owners will be responsible for making all required
        improvement, and when completed, will execute a 15-year contract for rent subsidies for
        qualified renters. The rents for these units will be higher than for the regular Housing
        Choice Voucher Program in order to provide additional income for repaying the cost of
        rehabilitation.
        The City participates in the HCD's housing rehab programs generally funded with
        CDBG, HOME or CalHOME funds. However, this program is only available to owner-
        occupied dwellings and persons renting cannot participate at this time. This Action will
        be continued in the current planning period.
7.4.6 (formerly Action 2.2.2) The City demonstrated its willingness to work with and assist
        developers for both homeowners and renters during the 2003-2008 planning period. The
        City will continue to work with and assist developers who are willing to provide

        extremely low-income, very low-income and low-income rental housing. The City will
        take actions necessary to expedite processing and approvals for such projects, and will
        make available fee credits to offset improvement costs. The City will also continue to
        endorse the use of bonds such as those issued in conjunction with the California Tax
        Credit Allocation Committee. Developers of low-, very- low-, and extremely low-income
        units will also be eligible for the City’s density bonus, which will permit construction of
        additional units beyond code-specified maximums in exchange for providing those units
        at costs targeting lower- income households.
        The City is committed to assisting developers of extremely low-income, very low-
        income, and low-income rental housing. Processing actions that expedite processing and
        approvals for these types of project are still practiced, including providing density
        bonuses, processing projects in a timely fashion, and providing support for funding
        applications. However, due to the loss of the RDA, and general budget shortfalls seen
        recently, the City is not currently able to provide substantial fee credits to developers.
        This Action will be revised in the current housing element update to reflect the City’s
        current ability to offer fee credits or other incentives.
7.5.1 (formerly Action 9.3.3) The City uses CDBG funding to provide grants up to $7,500 to
        assist homeowners with emergency repairs such as roofing, windows, doors, electrical,
        and plumbing to meet the health and safety of the family and/or the community. During
        the HE planning period, the City will target a total of 20-25 units, depending upon the
        availability of funding and costs per unit.
        On July 12, 2011 the City Council approved an amendment to our existing Housing
        Rehabilitation Program Guidelines to include grants that address health and safety issues.
        The maximum allowed was included in the revised guidelines. In the last planning
        period, a total of 29 lower-income homes were rehabilitated, and eight received funding
        for rehabilitation. This Action will be included in the current planning period.
7.5.2 (formerly Action 9.5.2.2) The City will consider the use of a portion of its CDBG
        allocation and/or tax increment to write down infrastructure improvements and/or land
        costs, and will continue to use fee crediting to reduce development fees for all housing
        needs.
        The City is not an Entitlement City and must compete for CDBG funding. This funding
        is extremely competitive. The City applied for infrastructure funding with the 2012
        CDBG Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) but was denied. The City currently has
        an application under review for $500,000, of which half will be used for rehabilitation,
        and the other half for new construction. The City will work with lower income housing
        providers to be more successful in competing for this funding in the current planning
        period.

2.8     Goal 8:
Ensure opportunities for the development of housing intended for those with special needs.
        Objectives:
        1. Seek partnerships with non-profit and for-profit organizations to develop special
            needs housing
        2. Reduce governmental barriers to production of special needs housing
        Policies:
        1. Conduct proactive outreach to developers emphasizing the City’s desire to encourage
            construction of special needs housing
        2. Pursue grants and other forms of financial aid intended to reduce overpayment by
            large family households
        3. Seek funding through the Federal Emergency Shelter Grant Program to broaden the
            range of services available to the homeless or those at risk of losing their homes
        4. Identify sites for the potential development of farm worker housing
        5. Revise Zoning Ordinance requirements for group care facilities that reflect
            consistency with State law
        6. Revise development standards to allow reduced parking requirements for
            developments designed to accommodate those with special needs
Associated Actions
8.1.1 (formerly Action 9.2.2.6) Same as Action 5.2.1. The City, through the Redevelopment
        Agency, will continue its programs assisting low-and moderate-income households to
        become homeowners. The Agency will also continue to work with non-profit
        organizations to build houses in Dinuba for sale to eligible households. The City has a
        close working relationship with Self-Help Enterprises (SHE) in Visalia, CA, which
        administrates the City’s HOME and CDBG Rehabilitation programs. During the
        previous planning period, no affordable single-family units were accomplished. It is our
        belief that the housing boon during 2004-2007 “priced out” the ability of the City and
        non-profits in acquiring land to develop affordable housing. Land values skyrocketed so

        The RDA was dissolved in 2012, following budget reducing actions taken by the State of
        California. Funding provided by the State to the RDA consequently ceased. As such,
        Housing element goals dependent on RDA funds for completion were unable to be fully
        met. This Action will be revised in the current planning period to reflect the current
        relationships with Self-Help Enterprises, and funding sources they administer.
8.1.2 (formerly Action 9.4.1) The City will encourage non-profit sponsors to make application
        for HUD Section 202 allocations for construction of rental housing for seniors and those
        with disabilities, and will take all actions necessary to expedite processing and approval
        of such projects. Self-Help Enterprises acts as the City’s marketing and outreach
        consultant for assisted housing projects. Through use of mailings and phone
        solicitations, Self-Help contacts prospective tenants and developers who would benefit
        from this type of funding. In addition, should funding become available, the City will
        facilitate the project by assisting in locating appropriate sites and will consider the use of
        available resources to either write down the cost of the cite or fund infrastructure
        improvements.
        The City has not had an opportunity to encourage funding with HUD Section 202, which
        provides “capital advances to finance the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition with
        or without rehabilitation of structures that will serve as supportive housing for very low-
        income elderly persons, and provides rent subsidies for the projects to help make them
        affordable.” This Action will be revised in the current planning period to reflect the
        current relationships with Self-Help Enterprises so that Section 202 funding can be more
        successfully utilized.
8.1.3 (formerly Action 9.4.2) The City will continue to comply with all State and Federal
        statutes relating to those with disabilities and other special needs groups by making all
        efforts to accommodate processing of applications for developers whose products offer to
        these groups fair opportunity for housing of their choice. All necessary forms and
        applications are made available at the Development and Engineer Services Department
        counter.
        City Staff continues to process all development applications fairly, per existing rules, for
        all Applicants, regardless of the product proposed. All housing applications are
        considered based on compliance with the Dinuba Municipal Code and consistency with
        the Dinuba General Plan. The City of Dinuba remains committed to completing all
        projects in an efficient manner. Services, including applications, are available at the
        Public Works Department, which includes Planning and Development. This Action will
        be continued in the current planning period.
8.1.4   (formerly Action 9.4.3) The City, in cooperation with Tulare County, will apply to the
        State Department of Housing and Community Development for an HCD Farm Worker
        Housing Grant. Houses, to be funded with CDBG and with State HCD Farm Worker
        Housing Grant, will be sold at a subsidized cost to eligible farm workers.

        The City has not had the opportunity to apply for an HCD Farm Worker Housing Grant.
        The City will continue to work with HCD in the current planning period to make this a
        successfully funded project.
8.3.1   (formerly Action 9.4.5) The City will seek funding through the Federal Emergency
        Shelter Grant (ESG) program to assist service providers to expand available emergency
        shelter capacity in order to broaden the range of services available to clients who are
        either homeless or at risk of losing their permanent housing. ESG could fund activities
        such as conversion, renovation, and rehabilitation of facilities; operation of facilities;
        delivery of essential services; and homelessness prevention. ESG-funded entities may be
        either shelter or non-shelter providers. Non-shelter facilities and services can include
        sponsored health care and substance abuse treatment centers, served meals, or
        counseling. Grantees, such as the City, are authorized to reallocate funds to either
        government or nonprofit agencies that may deliver services directly. While states are
        required to distribute their entire allotment to local government, local governments
        receiving entitlement funds may distribute all or a portion of their ESG funds to nonprofit
        homeless provider organizations.
        The City has not had the opportunity to apply for any ESG funding, as no operators of
        facilities have expressed interest in expanding their services. However, the need for
        emergency, temporary, and transitional housing continues to increase. The City will
        continue this Action in the current planning period.
8.4.1 (formerly Action 9.4.3) Same as 8.1.4. The City, in cooperation with Tulare County, will
        apply to the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for an
        HCD Farm Worker Housing Grant. Houses, to be funded with CDBG and with State
        HCD Farm Worker Housing Grant, will be sold at a subsidized cost to eligible farm
        workers.
        To date, the City has not applied to HCD for an HCD Farm Worker Housing Grant.
        Although the City has a significant number of farm workers, the City has not separated
        this group from the housing needs of all lower income workers as a whole. However, the
        City understands that if funding for housing for farm workers because available, the City
        would enthusiastically apply to HCD for this housing. The City will continue this Action
        in the current planning period
8.4.2 (formerly Action 9.4.4) The City will encourage non-profit sponsors and/or the Housing
        Authority to make application for FmHA 514/516 allocations for rentals, which might
        provide a combination of grants and loans to finance the construction of Migrant Farm
        Worker Rental Housing. Public and private non-profit corporations, including state
        agencies and political subdivisions, are eligible for both grants and loans. The ability to
        achieve this goal is dependent upon the availability of County staff, interested profit and
        non-profit corporations, and the availability of funds from FmHA.
        The City has not had the opportunity to assist in making applications for FMHA 514/516
        allocations for rentals. Although the City has a significant number of farm workers, the
        economic conditions and drought have discouraged migrant workers to seek work in the

City of Dinuba                                                                       November 2015
2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                          Page 2-29

        local area, and the City has concentrated on housing for its more permanent farm
        workers. However, because fewer farm owners or managers provide housing for their
        workers, the City would be interested in seeking assistance for additional farm worker
        housing. The City will continue this Action in the current planning period.
8.4.3 (formerly Action 9.4.6) The City will identify sites that are appropriate for the
        development of farm worker housing facilities and will support developers by providing
        technical assistance and, where possible, regulatory incentives. If appropriate sites are
        identified and do not possess an appropriate zoning designation, the City will amend land
        to a zone classification that will accommodate farm worker housing. The City presently
        has two farm worker housing facilities on multi-family zoned sites and would permit such
        developments in the future.
        City Staff has not been able to devote staff time to identify sites appropriate for farm
        worker housing. In addition, no new proposals for farm worker housing have been
        received. However, Staff is available to provide technical assistance and support should
        new farm worker housing be proposed. Additionally, the City is currently working with
        HCD to identify other farm worker housing establishments in the City, to be approved
        through the State. This Action will be continued in the current planning period.
8.4.4 (formerly Action 9.4.7) In compliance with SB1802 and Health and Safety Code 17021.6,
        farm worker housing (farm employee housing) up to 36 beds in a group quarters or 12
        units or spaces designated for use by a single family or household would be “an
        agricultural land use,” and this use must be permitted by right. The current Zoning
        Ordinance allows farm worker housing by right for a maximum of six employees in the
        RA, R, and RM districts, and with a use permit in the AN district. Additionally, current
        zoning allows farm worker housing for seven or more farm workers with a use permit
        only in the AN, RA, R, and RM districts. Farm employee housing incidental to a
        permitted or conditional use is permitted in the AN district.
        No action has been taken by City Staff to amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow an
        increased number of units for farm worker housing as a permitted use in the AN Zone.
        This Action will be continued in the current planning period, with a goal to have it
        completed by December 2015.
8.5.1 (formerly Action 9.4.8) The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance within one year of
        adoption of the Housing Element to a) define “supportive housing” and b) permit
        supportive housing and transitional housing within residential zone districts. In
        compliance with Government Code Section 65583(D)(5) and (6), transitional housing
        and supportive housing shall be considered a residential use of property, and shall be
        subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type
        in the same zone. Additionally, the City shall identify a zone or zones where emergency
        shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary
        permit. In addition, the City will develop written, objective standards for emergency
        shelters to regulate the following, as permitted under SB2:
           The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly

City of Dinuba                                                                       November 2015

           Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking
            requirements for other residential or commercial uses in the same zone
           The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake areas
           The provision of onsite management
           The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not
            required to be more than 300 feet apart
           The length of stay
           Lighting
           Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
        No action has been taken by City Staff to amend the Zoning Ordinance to better facilitate
        the need for supportive, emergency, and temporary housing. This Action will be
        continued in the current planning period, with a goal to have it completed by December
        2015.
8.5.2 (formerly Action 9.4.10) In compliance with GC 65583(5), the City must remove
        constraints or provide accommodations for housing for persons with disabilities,
        including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements,
        fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit
        procedures. These must be allowed by right. Current zoning allows, “group homes
        serving six or fewer mentally disordered or otherwise handicapped persons where such
        homes provide care on a twenty-four hour basis” as a conditional use in the AN, RA, R,
        and RM districts. The City’s zoning allows use for a “group care facility” as a by-right
        use in the AN, RA, R, and RM districts. “Rest homes, nursing homes, family care homes,
        foster homes, or group homes for the mentally disordered or otherwise handicapped
        person, including state authorized homes” are permitted in the PO district with a use
        permit, and are not permitted in commercial districts. The City will amend the Zoning
        Ordinance to provide reasonable accommodation for housing for persons with
        disabilities. Amendments will include, but not be limited to, construction of new or
        retrofitting existing access ramps, handrails, and appliances. The City will also modify
        and/or allow administrative level deviations from setback requirements and a reduction
        of parking spaces and maneuvering areas for disabled persons. Other retrofit,
        maintenance, rehabilitation, improvements and developments, or other forms of
        improvements or accommodations for to existing or new homes for special needs persons
        will receive prioritized consideration and flexibility or relief from regular standards and
        will be determined at an administrative level by the Director and/or Building Official.
        The City will establish a written and administrative reasonable accommodation
        procedure in the zoning code for providing exception for housing for persons with
        disabilities in zoning and land use as a by-right use, without a conditional use permit or
        other restriction.
        In 2012, the City of Dinuba revised the Zoning Ordinance to allow twenty-four hour
        residential care homes in AN, RA, R and RM zones as a permitted use. Previously, the
        use was only allowed with a Conditional Use Permit. Zone Text Amendments are
        regularly conducted, the latest occurring in 2014. Although this allowed single-family
        residences in the C-2 zone, it did not bring residential care home standards into

        compliance with State requirements, as it did not allow residential care homes in C-2 as a
        permitted use. The additional actions will be included in the current planning period.
8.6.1 (formerly Action 9.4.9) The City will continue its efforts to install wheelchair ramps at all
        curb radii and complete the installation of sidewalks, curb, and gutters in older parts of
        the community that lack such facilities.
        The City effort to bring wheelchair ramps at all curb radial into ADA compliance is
        ongoing. The project is expected to be funded until 2018, and will be continued in the
        current planning period.
8.6.2 (formerly Action 9.4.11) The City will amend its off-street parking requirements as
        specified in the Zoning Ordinance and will reduce off-street parking requirements for
        certain developments, including those designed and intended for special needs groups
        such as persons with disabilities, the elderly, or families with 4 or more persons, from 1.0
        to 0.75 off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit.
        No action has been taken by City Staff to amend existing off-street parking requirements
        within the Zoning Ordinance. Currently, Variances and minor deviations from parking
        requirements are available in instances where special circumstances are involved.
        Downtown developments also are sometimes exempt from these requirements due to on-
        street parking availability with proximity to their site.

                                        INTRODUCTION
In order to establish housing Goals, Objectives, and Policies, the City’s housing needs for the
current planning period must first be determined. This chapter provides an overview of Dinuba’s
recent growth in terms of population and economic development, and is used to determine the
issues and special needs groups of greatest concern. The 2014-2023 Tulare County Regional
Housing Needs Plan (RHNP), the City of Dinuba 2002 Community Profile, the 2007 General
Plan Update Background Document, and the 2007 Dinuba General Plan were also referenced.
Housing element law requires a quantification of each jurisdiction’s share of the RHNA. The
RHNA is a minimum projection of additional housing units needed to accommodate projected
growth of all income levels by the end of the housing element’s statutory planning period. Each
locality’s RHNA is distributed among five income categories (Extremely Low-, Very Low-
Low-, Moderate-, and Above Moderate-Income) to address the required provision for planning
for all income levels.
The City of Dinuba is located approximately 15 miles north of Visalia on Road 80/Alta Avenue
or about 12 miles east of State Route 99 on Mt. View/Avenue 416/El Monte Way. Historically
an agriculturally-based community, Dinuba has undergone significant growth in the last two
decades, and has increased approximately 29.7 percent since 2000. The make-up of the
community has changed and the economic base now includes increased commercial and
industrial development. Dinuba now acts as a commercial and industrial center for the northern
part of Tulare County. This trend is anticipated to continue into the foreseeable future.
Additional commercial and industrial development, as well as major expansion of existing
industry, is proposed within the community while the dependence upon agriculture continues to
diminish.
The driving force behind community development has historically been the disposable income
from the farming community and its labor base. While increased automation has occurred in both
the agricultural and industrial sectors, and urban development has continued to encroach into
prime agricultural lands, the demand for farm workers and other “unskilled” laborers remains
high. Within recent years (2000-present), major commercial and industrial development has
driven the City’s economy, although agriculture and the processing of agricultural products
remain major sources of employment. No data are available to indicate the percentage of farm
workers as a percentage of the total City population. However, agricultural workers have made
up between 20 and 22 percent of the Tulare County population in the last 10 years.
With its central location, Dinuba’s residents are within a relatively short commuting distance of
Visalia, the cities of southeastern Fresno County, or the agricultural fields of Tulare and Fresno
Counties. In addition to the extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households,
above-moderate households are attracted to the community by its affordable housing prices and
the “small town” atmosphere.

Chapter 3 Community Profile
3.1      Population
The City of Dinuba’s population increased from 16,844 in 2000 to 23,666 in 2014. This
translates to an overall increase of 40 percent, and an average annual increase of 2.7 percent.
This rate of growth was slower than in the past: between 1990 and 2000, the City increased at an
annual rate of 2.9 percent. The trend in a slower growth rate was also true of Tulare County and
of the State of California as a whole. The Department of Finance had predicted that the
population in Dinuba would be 25,187 in 2014, while the actual population was 23,666. This
slower growth rate may be correlated to the slower rate of construction of new housing during
the last planning period. Existing population and projections are shown on Table 3-1:

Age groups as defined by the US Census are shown on Table 3-2. The median age contained in
the 2000 US Census median age for the City’s population was 25.9 while the median age
contained in the 2010 US Census was 27.2. Based on the median, the overall population of
Dinuba has grown younger by 1.3 years. This is due, in large part, to the fact that the percentage
of residents 65 years old and older decreased from 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent from 2000 to 2010.
During the same 10 year period, the percentage of those aged 0 to 20 years decreased slightly as
well, from 29.3 percent in 2000 to 38.5 percent in 2010. The percentage of those between ages
20 and 64 years of age increased from 51 to 53.6 percent. This would indicate that there was a
greater percentage of those of working age in 2010 than in 2000, with fewer minor dependents
and retirees.
3.2      Employment
According to the California Economic Development Department (February 2014, tularsub.xls
table), Dinuba had a total labor force of 9,300 in December 2014. Of those, the total employed
was 7,600 and the unemployment rate was 18.9 percent. Unemployment rates within the
incorporated cities of County of Tulare ranged from a low of 8.3 percent in Exeter to a high of
18.9 percent in Dinuba. However, unemployment in the unincorporated communities was as
high as 36 percent in Earlimart, with a low of 5.3 percent in Three Rivers. The average
unemployment rate in the County was 12.7 percent, with Dinuba’s unemployment rate
considerably greater than that. In nearby Fresno County, Reedley had an unemployment rate of
21.9 percent, and Sanger had an unemployment rate of 17.8 percent.

One year later, in February 2015, the unemployment rate in Dinuba had decreased from 18.9 to
13.9 percent. This decreasing trend appears to be continuing as unemployment has dropped from
a high of 22.8 percent in 2011. The lowest rate of unemployment since 2002 was 12.9 percent in
2007, which was before the economic recession.
One of the largest employment sectors in Tulare County is agriculture. Agriculture-related
employers in and around Dinuba include Enns Packing Company and Fruit Patch, Inc. Housing
for agricultural industry employees is not only significant because of the large numbers of
permanent and seasonal employees, but because seasonal migrant workers create a demand for
temporary housing.
As noted earlier, there is increased commercial and industrial activity occurring within the
Dinuba area. This development is primarily in the food processing and warehousing industries,
although commercial development is also of note. These trends are expected to continue through
the duration of the current Housing Element planning period. In addition to the adoption of the
1992 Southwest Dinuba Specific Plan and annexations during the previous planning period that
made possible a well-planned and readily accessible Industrial Park of more than 600 acres, the
2007 Dinuba General Plan update plans nearly 218.0 acres of additional industrial land use and
approximately 115.0 acres to the existing 292.0 commercial land use acres.
Tenants of the Industrial Park include Ruiz Food Products, Best Buy, and Patterson Logistics, all
of which have constructed major facilities in Dinuba. Ruiz Foods, which employs more than
1,500 workers, is a frozen-food manufacturing facility, while Best Buy and Patterson Logistics
maintain their West Coast distribution centers in the Industrial Park. All three companies have
expanded their facilities since the 2003 Housing Element but have not expanded since the 2009

Recent commercial developments have primarily been concentrated along the western El Monte
Way corridor, due to the construction of the Super Walmart development. New commercial
activity includes various shopping centers and fast food restaurants in the same shopping center
(Burger King, Starbucks, Panda Express, IHOP), service centers (Les Schwab Tire, Dinuba Tire,
Waterdrops Carwash), retailers (Big 5, Tractor Supply Co.), medical uses (Kaweah Delta,
Adventist Health clinics, and an upcoming Western Dental), and offices (the upcoming Farm
Credit West).
Alta Avenue experienced some development, primarily on the south side, with a new Arco
AM/PM service station and the redevelopment of the Dinuba Market to include two additional
units. Development has been limited in Downtown Dinuba, both in the commercial and
industrial sectors. The biggest success there was the occupation of an existing vacant industrial
building by the SeaCa Packaging Co.
During the previous planning period, the top six employers had a total of 3,847 employees. In
2015, those six businesses had a total of 3,777 employees. Ruiz Foods had 70 fewer employees,
and Wal-Mart and Odwalla also had fewer employees than in the last planning period, while
Dinuba Unified School, Family Tree Farms, and Best Buy had a total of 42 more employees.
Despite the overall decline in total employees by three of the largest employers, the City has
continued to see growth in the numbers and types of businesses since 2012. The unemployment
rate has decreased from 22.8 percent in 2011 to the current rate of 18.9 percent. This has
provided opportunities for full-time employment for members of households that were
previously constrained to only working seasonally. With a steady income that may become
available with year-round employment, more households may be able to purchase or rent
housing.

The primary agricultural activities in the area are the cultivation of grapes for table use or raisins,
the processing of raisins, the cultivation of deciduous fruit trees, and, to a lesser degree, dairy
farming and growing of alfalfa. Most of the activities are highly seasonal, with the demand for
the highest number of employees starting in the early summer and increasing into early fall when
grapes are harvested, signaling the end of the work season.
In addition to agriculture and industrial development, retail trade and education have large
numbers of employees as well. Table 3-4 shows employment by industry within Tulare County.
The table indicates that jobs in agriculture decreased from 17.3 percent to 15.8 percent of total
jobs as industry increased in the City. The Transportation and Public Utilities segment of
employment increased from 2010 to 2013, as companies like Best Buy continued using Dinuba
as a distribution center. As noted elsewhere, new businesses have provided opportunities for
full-time employment that are replacing seasonal farm work.

As discussed earlier in this chapter, Tulare County has one of the highest unemployment rates in
the state, due in large part to the agricultural base and the prevalence of seasonal employment,
and, to a lesser extent, to the national recession. Several factors, including poor farming
conditions, lack of water, and the resistance of banks to make home loans, have contributed to
high unemployment and a shortage of funding for affordable housing. Unemployment and the

lack of funding for affordable housing are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future,
thereby increasing the need for housing and housing assistance programs in the community for
extremely low- to moderate-income households.
With the increased automation of agricultural practices and the continuation of technological
advances, the need for farm workers will continue to diminish rather than increase. Also,
unpredictable natural events such as the hard freeze experienced in 2006 and below normal
rainfall years (“drought years”) during 2011-14 are affecting agriculture and agriculture-related
employment. These factors, along with the encroachment of urban development into agricultural
land, will have an effect on Dinuba’s farm worker housing needs. As the agricultural base of the
County changes and relocates farther from the Visalia area, the desirability of Dinuba as a
residential area for farm workers may diminish.
Conversely, during the last decade, increases in industrial and commercial development have
helped provide employment opportunities for a large segment of the community and will
continue to help provide a stable economic environment for continued housing growth.
Average wages vary according to employment sector. Higher paying jobs are generally in the
skilled labor sectors while lower paying jobs are typically in the agricultural and services sectors.

Dinuba’s economic base and low wages, the slow recovery from the economic recession, and the
high unemployment rate, affect the ability of persons to secure affordable housing. Dinuba, like
many other San Joaquin Valley communities, attempts to draw new employers to improve its
jobs/housing balance. The City formerly utilized its Vocational Technical center to train skilled
workers. Although this is no longer the case, the City continues to seek employment
opportunities, which when coupled with an abundance of residentially developable land,
provides the City opportunities to achieve a jobs/housing balance.

                                          HOUSING PROFILE
This section provides an overview and comparison of housing stock. Analysis of past trends
provides a basis for determining future housing needs. It should be noted that the data contained
in the tables throughout the document are not always reflective of Year 2014, as much of the data
are gathered during the decennial U.S. Census, annual State of California Department of Finance
(DOF) data, the 2015-2023 Tulare County RHNA data, or annual local data.
4.1     Housing Characteristics
Between 2001 and 2007, there was an increase of 887 housing units for an average of nearly 127
units per year. The Department of Finance estimated that there were 6,377 housing units within
the City. Using this figure, between 2007 and 2014, a total of 957 units were added to the City,
which is an average of 136.7 units per year. However, the total number of housing units
estimated by the Tulare Council of Governments (COG) when preparing the RHNA, estimated a
total of 6,258 housing units in 2014. Using this estimate, 878 units were constructed between
2007 and 2014; an average of 125.4 units per year. Because of the economic downturn, and
because figures utilized by the State Employment Development Department (on the number of
housing permits granted throughout the County annually) indicate that construction of homes
was lower after 2006 than before that year, the figure utilized by the COG was determined by the
City to be more realistic (6,258 units in 2014), and is the figure that will be used throughout the
housing element. Therefore, the average number of units constructed in each of the last seven
years is estimated to be 125, while the number of units constructed in the years 2000 to 2007 was
approximately 137 per year.
Additionally, the average number of persons per household increased from 3.72 to 3.87 during
the last planning period, and the vacancy rate increased from 3.8 percent to 4.7 percent. This
could indicate that some residents are less able to afford housing, and are instead living with
family or unrelated roommates, despite that fact that there are more vacancies than during the
2000 to 2007 period. This trend could also indicate that the birth rate has increased Table 4-1

The total of 279 extremely low, very-low- and low-income units comprised 49.7 percent of all
housing constructed. Moderate-income housing accounted for only 13 percent of all housing,
and above-moderate level housing was 37.4 percent.
Actual growth of the housing stock has been inconsistent over time. In the last planning period,
during the “housing boom” from 2004 to 2007, with interest rates at all-time low levels, the
demand for single-family, owner occupied dwelling units rose dramatically. Availability of
Federal and State assistance and subsidy programs also contributed to an increase in demand for
these units. The rapidly increasing availability of financing to a broader section of the market
has coupled with a much more slowly increasing housing supply, resulting in a general increase
in the cost of homes. Since 2007, when economic conditions changed, house values declined,
banks less readily made loans to individuals and developers, foreclosure rates increased, and the

number of new housing permits declined steeply. From 2008 through 2011, the number of
permits for single family homes dropped dramatically. Since that time, the number of permits
has steadily risen. At this time, interest rates remain low, although lenders have become more
stringent in the mortgage lending process, at it is much more difficult to qualify for a standard
30-year mortgage than it was before 2007.
4.2     Housing Quality
Dinuba has a substantial amount of housing that was built prior to 1990 (over 66 percent). There
appears to be a direct correlation between the age of the homes and the number of homes
requiring major rehabilitation or demolition. Table 4-4 shows the time period, number of units
built, and percentage of total units constructed during that period. Between 1990 and 2009,
approximately 31 percent of housing was constructed. However, as noted above, since 2010
(starting in 2008) the percentage of housing units constructed increased by only three percent.

According to the American FactFinder data, there were a total of 7,534 units, while the 2013
Department of Finance states that there were 6,258 units. The U.S. Census figure will be used
only for the purpose of analyzing Table 4-4. Of the 7,534 occupied housing units in the City in
2013, approximately 1.4 percent (106) were lacking complete plumbing facilities, while 2.4
percent (180) lacked complete kitchen facilities. No telephone service was available in 330 (4.4
percent) of the units (Selected Housing Characteristics: 2009-2013 U.S. Census Bureau

As part of the Housing Element Update, the City of Dinuba conducted a survey of housing stock
within the community in 2008. The City received a grant in the amount of $14,820 and retained
SHE to conduct a “windshield survey” of a sample of units in the City, using guidelines
established by the State of California Housing and Community Development Department; Table
4-5 shows the results of the housing quality survey. The standards utilized for the survey were
established by HCD, and reflect the corrective actions necessary to bring a residence to current
building standards. The major categories are:

The survey reveals that 43 percent of Dinuba’s housing stock is in sound condition. Of the
substandard units, the majority (79.49 percent) require minor to moderate rehabilitation. An
estimated 363 (12.47 percent) require substantial rehabilitation, while 237 units (8.1 percent) are
considered dilapidated. It should be noted that the above figures for repairs needed are estimated
based only on a random sample survey. The Housing Quality Survey was completed by Self-
Help Enterprises consistent with the methodology specified by State Housing and Community
Development guidelines. The intent of the survey was to gather information regarding the
number of housing units in need of some rehabilitation. The survey did not include housing by
type. As indicated earlier, the City regularly uses CDBG funding to rehabilitate homes in need of
major repair, and initiates the abatement process for dwellings that are beyond the scope of
repair.
It is the City’s belief that the sample survey conducted in 2008 still represents the housing
conditions in the City in 2014. The City has rehabilitated 32 units in the last planning period,
and constructed an additional 48 multifamily units. Only 3.6 percent of the housing in the City

was constructed in 2010 or later (American FactFinder, Table DP04). This source also indicates
that approximately 66 percent of the homes in the City are over 25 years old. Additionally,
according to the City, there have been an additional 278 housing permits issued for single family
units and 105 multifamily units permitted between 2010 and 2014. When these units are added
to the US Census total from 2010 of 7,926 total housing units (again using the US Census, not
Department of Finance figure used in Table 4-4), there were a total of 8,309 housing units in the
City at the end of 2014, of which 623 (7.5 percent) have been constructed in or since 2014.
Conversely, 803 units, or 13.4 percent of the homes constructed through 2013 were over 75 years
old. The largest percentage of homes was constructed between 1970 and 1980, and these homes
would be expected to show signs of their age and require minor to moderate repair.
4.3      Household Size
A “household” as defined by the US Census Bureau refers to “a person or a group of persons
(other than foreign residents) who occupy the same dwelling. It may consist of a family group
(census family) with or without other persons, of two or more families sharing a dwelling, of a
group of unrelated persons, or of one person living alone. For census purposes, every person is a
member of one and only one household.” The US Census considers two “major categories of
households, ‘family’ and ‘nonfamily.’” Unless otherwise specified, all data in household reports
are for private households only. Also, the US Census Bureau refers to a “family” as “a group of
two people or more related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together.” However, a
count of ‘family household members” also includes any non-relatives living in the household. A
couple may be of opposite or same sex. 'Children' in a census family include grandchildren living
with their grandparent(s) but with no parents present.
As with other cities in Tulare County, and with the state as a whole, household size increased
from 3.72 persons in 2009 to 3.81 persons in 2014 (see Table 4-6). This household size indicates
a continued trend toward housing units that provide larger living areas than were needed in the
past. The relatively high household size for the City of Dinuba could be attributed to a
combination of relatively low-paying jobs, moderate but rising housing costs, ethnic traditions
for large families, and perhaps other factors as well, such as an increase in the birth rate, and
multi-generational families. The City realizes that more four and five bedroom units are needed,
and will include programs (Actions) to encourage development of these larger units in affordable
housing projects. Table 4-6 also illustrates the estimated household size for Tulare County and
its cities, the State of California, and the United States as a whole. Note that the increase of .09
persons per household in Dinuba is similar to the increase throughout Tulare County as a whole,
and a greater increase than that of California (.03 persons per household increase).
As indicated in Table 4-6, the average household size in Dinuba is larger than most Tulare
County cities, and far above the state and national averages. This could be attributed to both
cultural phenomena (i.e., multiple generations of family residing in the same dwelling) and
economic situations, including lack of affordable housing.

4.4     Vacancy Rates
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a “vacancy rate” which establishes the relationship
between housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the
available supply, then the vacancy rate is low, and the price of housing will most likely increase.
A low vacancy rate suggests that households have difficulty finding housing within their price
range, while a high vacancy rate may indicate the existence of deficient units undesirable for
occupancy, an oversupply of housing units, or available housing units that are unaffordable. A
vacancy rate of five percent is considered equilibrium, or when the supply equals the demand.
HUD standards indicate that a vacancy rate of five percent is sufficient to provide choice and
mobility. Vacancy rates of less than five percent indicate a lack of availability or affordability of
rental units. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the overall vacancy rate in Dinuba was
approximately 3.06 percent: in 2014 this figure increased to 3.86 percent. The increase in
vacancy rate, along with the increase in household size could be indicative of a decline in
employment, which forced some residents to seek housing with relatives or friends. The
unemployment rate in February 2014 was 18.9 percent (Department of Finance), and, according
to American FactFinder (Table S2301), in 2013 the unemployment rate was 24.3 percent. See
Table 4.14 for more information on rental rates within the City.
The State Department of Finance estimated in 2014 that the vacancy rate in Dinuba was 4.7
percent (Table E-5), meaning that there were slightly fewer unoccupied units in 2014 than in
2010. Within the eight incorporated cities in Tulare County, the vacancy rate ranged from a low
of 4.7 percent in Dinuba to a high of 6.5 percent in Porterville and Visalia (the two largest cities
in the County). The vacancy rate in Dinuba is within the range that HUD considers within the
standard, so that supply is meeting demand. Table 4-7 shows there were 5,593 occupied units
and 275 vacant units in Dinuba in 2010. Note that the Department of Finance 2014 data use the
2010 U.S. Census Bureau information as the baseline.

4.5     Housing Tenure
Housing owner-occupants versus renters is shown in Table 4-8. Between 1990-2000, owner-
occupied housing as a percentage of total stock increased marginally (1.4 percent). However,
between 2000 and 2010, the percentage of owner-occupied units decreased 3.9 percent. Much of
this fluctuation can be attributed to a surge in prices of new and used homes, as well as the
availability of low-interest financing, which occurred during 2005-2007. Since that time,
economic conditions changed, and factors such as increased unemployment and stricter lending
polices made it more difficult for residents to purchase and/or continue to afford mortgage
payments.

4.6     Dwellings by Type
An examination of census data provides insight into the changing demand for different types of
dwelling units within the City. The three basic types of housing units for which data are
available are: single-family residential (SFR) detached units, multifamily residential (MFR) units
(ranging in size from duplexes to large apartment developments), and mobile homes.
Although the predominant type of dwelling continues to be the single-family residence, its
predominance has been declining. Purchasing a home typically requires two incomes and many

families have a parent who is not in the workforce or has minor children living at home who can
not contribute to the family’s income. Total dwelling units by type of structure are shown on
Table 4-9 and type of dwelling structures as a percentage of total dwellings are shown on
Table 4-10. In the period from 1990 to 2000, the percentage of SFR decreased slightly from 75.6
percent to 74.1 percent. However, from 2000 to 2014, the rate of SFR increased to 75.2 percent,
so that it is again very similar to the 1990 rate, according to the Department of Finance. This
pattern of predominant, single family housing indicates that Dinuba’s residents prefer this type of
housing, although SFRs are becoming less affordable than in earlier years. The trends toward
increasing household sizes and higher vacancy rates also indicate that greater numbers of
residents are moving in with relatives and friends living in single family residences. However,
because figures regarding the size and type of vacancies are not available, it would be
speculative to presume that there are too few large rental units to meet the needs of residents.

Like many communities, buyer demand and developer supply of housing options often do not
coincide. Other affordable alternatives to single-family housing include condominiums,
mobile/manufactured homes, and modular homes. However, the development community has
not offered these alternatives even though such housing types are allowed by the City’s Zoning
Ordinance within residential zones.

Chapter 4 Housing Profile
The number of mobile homes is relatively small in comparison to single- and multifamily
residential structures; the percentage rose from 4.2 percent in 2000 to 4.7 percent in 2014,
although with a very small number of mobile homes being added to the housing stock since
2000. Although State law changed in 2008 to allow manufactured homes in single family zoning
districts, the use of manufactured homes as an alternative has occurred primarily in “mobile
home parks” and not in districts zoned for single-family homes. It is anticipated that these units
will not become a significant housing sector in the coming years. Table 4-11 shows housing
units by type, while Table 4-12 shows housing permits issued during 2007-2014 for single-
family residential, 2-4 units, and 5+ units, as well as mobile homes and other types of housing.
These data indicate that neither developers nor residents were interested in multifamily housing,
except during the years 2010 and 2012. In each of these two years, one building permit was
issued for multi-family units: in 2010 the permit was for 57 units, and in 2012 the permit was for
48 units. 2010 was also the year in which the median cost of a single family home was at its
lowest during the planning period, at $125,000. Since that time, the total number of permits for
both single-family units and multi-family has not reached the number of building permits issued
in 2010. In fact, in 2014 a total of only 24 building permits were issued – all for single-family
units.

Between 2007 and 2014, the percentage of single family units decreased from 79.6 percent to
73.1 percent, while 135 duplex units were constructed (according to the State Department of
Finance data), and the number of 3-4 unit dwellings increased from 272 to 620 during that time
period. In addition, mobile (manufactured) homes in Dinuba increased from 207 to 258, in
November 2007 with the annexation of a 51-unit mobile home park in north Dinuba. Since that
time, an additional 39 mobile homes (or other units, including condos and modular units) have
been added.
4.7     Housing Costs and Affordability
One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to provide
housing to all economic levels in the community, a wide variety of housing opportunities at
various prices should be made available. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), the cost of housing, including utilities, should not exceed 30 percent
of gross monthly income. Table 4-13 describes the acceptable monthly payment for households
in the five major groups: extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate- and above moderate-
income. According to the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
(Memo of 2.28.2014, State Income Limits for 2014), the median income for the County of
Tulare in 2014 is $57,900 for a household of four persons. However, the US Census FactFinder
estimate of 2013 median income was significantly lower than that of the County as a whole, at
$39,328. The Tulare County Housing Authority considers the Area Median Income (for the
purpose of determine who qualifies for Section 8 assistance) to be $54,700. The highest median
income estimate from HUD ($57,900) is based primarily on wages earned in Visalia and
Porterville, and is therefore not as accurate as the US Census 5-year rolling estimate (2009 –
2013). For the purpose of determining housing affordability in compliance with State and
Federal housing law, the City will utilize the Tulare County Housing Authority estimate of
$54,700. Using the Federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definitions, the five
income groups are defined as follows:
Extremely low-income - maximum income of 30% of median
Very low-income - maximum income of 50% of median
Low-income - maximum of 80% of median
Moderate income - between 80 and 120% of median
Above moderate - above 120% of median

4.8     Single-Family Sales Units
Since 2007, the median single-family home sale price declined from $233,151 to a current
(1/2015) price of $169,000 (State Economic Development Department). During the same time
period in Tulare County as a whole, the average home price dropped from $231,000 to a low of
$125,000 in 2010, then rose slowly to the current price of $172,500. According to RealtyTrac,
there are currently 20 homes for sale in the City with 39 homes now in some phase of foreclosure
(default, auction, or bank owned). There are, however, 36 percent fewer homes in foreclosure
than this time last year. If the general principal were applied – that is, one can afford to purchase
a home priced at 5 times his or her annual salary, the buyer would need to earn at least $33,800
per annum to purchase a home at the median selling price of $169,000. This wage is within the
low-income range of $28,951 to $46,320, indicating that most residents in the low-, moderate-,
and above moderate-income levels could afford to purchase a home.
4.9     Rental Units
According to information on rental properties listed on local websites and in the Dinuba Sentinel,
median rent for multifamily dwellings ranged from $525 for a one bedroom to $727- $981 for a
three bedroom unit. Apartment rents included water/sewer and garbage, but did not include
electric or gas utilities. Single family homes ranged in price from $725 for a two bedroom home
to $900 for a three bedroom home. Home rentals typically did not include any utility costs. The
rental amounts remain almost identical to those from the last planning period, although the
purchase price of homes is approximately 30 percent lower than in 2009. The median rents of
those apartments financed through the Low Income Tax Credit Program, range from $575 for a
studio unit to $953 for a 4-bedroom unit. Table 4-14 includes the Median Tax Credits for both
the costs of all utilities and the housing rent, and the Median Market Rents (which may include
some utilities, such as electric, water, trash disposal, and/or natural gas).

Housing is unaffordable for many workers based on their type of employment and salaries
associated with their employment. A decline in employment will typically result in increases to
vacancy rates. When job growth is slow or negative, people seek ways to cut housing costs such
as residing with friends or relatives, or taking in or becoming roommates. Although rents in
Dinuba are consistently lower than the Visalia market, many of the same amenities are still

available. In addition, according to local real estate sources, the price of homes in Dinuba is
consistently $20,000 to $30,000 lower than comparable housing in Fresno or Visalia.
4.10     Affordability
Affordability of housing is defined by HUD as a household spending 30 percent or less of
household income for shelter and utilities, including water, sewer, gas and electricity. Shelter is
defined as gross rent or gross monthly owner costs. “Gross rent” is the contract rent, plus
utilities. “Gross monthly owner costs” includes mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities,
condominium fees, and site rent for mobile-homes
The National Association of Home Builders determines home “affordability” based on an area’s
median household monthly income, with a debt-to-income ratio of 28 percent. This is subject to
individual credit and budgeting conditions and those with less revolving loan-type debt can
generally find financing for a more expensive home. This means that a family earning the
median income of $54,700 could afford a 30-year loan with monthly payments equal to or less
than 28 percent of the monthly income, or $1,339. This calculation includes a conventional loan,
plus a ten percent home down payment. Although interest rates remain low, the National
Association of Home Builders estimates that the affordability rate will continue to decline
(nationwide), because home prices continue to increase, while wages are almost unchanged since
2012. Based on an average home purchase price of $172,000 in Dinuba, a 3.75 percent interest
rate, and a 30-year loan with a 10 percent down payment, monthly payments would be $896
including property taxes at 1.25 percent. This mortgage amount would be affordable for those
earning at least $39,000 per year (approximately 72 percent of the AMI), and would therefore
include some households in the lower-income bracket.
The City’s Homeowner Assistance Program is available to provide up to 49 percent down
payment assistance to qualified very-low- and low-income groups. For example, as noted above,
the median price of a home in Tulare County is currently $172,000. The Homeowner Assistance
Program would provide a qualified household up to $84,280 that can be used as a down payment
thereby reducing the $172,000 home to a more affordable $87,720.
4.11     Conclusions
Between 2000 and 2007, home prices and rents in the City increased at a faster rate than
household income. From 2008 through 2012 homes lost value, and in 2015, prices still have not
risen to the pre-2008 costs. Many households in the City spend more than a third of their income
on housing, and many households live in overcrowded conditions, as they can afford only a one
or two bedroom home. The number of households that can comfortably afford the median priced
home or apartment in the City declined from 2000 until 2009, and then rose until in 2012, the
rate began to decrease again. Programs to assist moderate-income first-time buyers and lower-
income renters could help narrow the affordability gap, as could zoning and funding to
encourage other alternatives to single-family homes as discussed above. Chapter 9, Five Year
Action Plan, contains details of efforts the City of Dinuba will undertake to provide assistance to
both potential home owners and renters during the 2015-2023 planning period of this Housing
Element.

                                       HOUSING NEEDS
5.1     Existing Housing Needs
Housing need is a complex issue, consisting of at least three major components: housing
affordability (the ability of someone to pay for a house), housing quality (the size, material, and
other features that increase or decrease the cost of a house), and housing quantity (the number
and types of housing available). Additionally, certain segments of the population have difficulty
in obtaining adequate housing. Difficulties experienced by the elderly, those with disabilities,
female heads of household, large families, and farm workers, those needing emergency housing,
and those with extremely low incomes are discussed as special housing needs in this section.
Allocation of Housing Needs
The 2014-2023 Tulare County RHNA Plan is a document prepared by the Tulare County
Association of Governments (TCAG) per Section 65584 of the California Government Code that
requires that a regional housing needs plan make allocations specific to jurisdictions within its
area of responsibility. Such allocations include: consideration of housing needs of all income
levels (market rate as well as non-market rate housing), the market demand for housing,
employment opportunities, the availability of suitable sites and public facilities, commuting
patterns, the type and tenure of housing, and the housing needs of farm workers.
This is the fifth cycle of the Housing Element, and the first to be based on an 8-year period.
TCAG was tasked by the State to determine a methodology to appropriately allocate housing
among the four identified income categories for each of the eight incorporated cities and the
unincorporated area of Tulare County. As explained in the RHNA Plan, “An underlying
principal of the RHNA Methodology is to ensure that affordable housing is equitably distributed
throughout the region. The Methodology applies an adjustment factor based on disparities in
household income across the TCAG region. The adjustment factor assigns a higher proportion
of units affordable to lower-income households to jurisdictions that currently have a lower
proportion of affordable households compared to the regional average and assigns a lower
proportion of affordable units to jurisdictions that currently have a higher proportion of
affordable households than the regional average. The Methodology is intended to help [the]
region achieve income parity (the same proportion of affordable units in each community) by
2050.”

Housing Affordability
The median cost of a single-family home decreased in the 2009-2014 planning period from
approximately $231,500 in 2006 to $125,000 in 2010, and then increased to $172,500 in 2014 as
the economy began to recover from the downturn. During the same period, unemployment rose
significantly to over 25 percent in 2010, and also began to recover, although it now hovers at
about 19 percent in late 2014. Therefore, the cost of a single-family home in 2014 is
approximately the same as it was in 2008 ($175,000 at that time). However, because interest
rates were high when housing costs were high, those who purchased homes during this time
period faced increased difficulty in paying mortgage loans as the economy fell which resulted in
foreclosures increasing significantly. Therefore, the challenges that homeowners and potential
homeowners faced changed during the last planning period.
Issues that homeowners faced during the 2009 – 2014 planning period included:
       Declining Rate of Home Ownership: As unemployment rose and the numbers of
        foreclosures increased from 2006 - 2009, economic conditions resulted in housing prices
        dropping. This meant that homeowners who could no longer afford their home
        mortgages (often with high interest rates) could not sell their homes for the amounts they
        had paid for them. The resulting gap in the value of the home versus the amount
        remaining amount owed on the mortgage left homeowners “upside-down” on their
        mortgages. So, although home prices fell, fewer people could afford to purchase homes
        due to the fact that they would take a significant loss financially from the sale of their
        home. Since then, mortgage lenders became more stringent in lending practices, only
        granting mortgages to individuals with excellent credit. In 2014, lending rates were low,
        home prices were low, and although wages had increased somewhat, unemployment was
        still high. The rate of home ownership had decreased from 60.7 to 58.8 percent from
        2000 to 2010, and to 53.3 percent in 2013. As a result, households with median and
        moderate incomes who had traditionally purchased or owned homes had to now compete
        for available rental housing with financially less-advantaged households. Although the
        vacancy rate for rental units had increased 4.7 percent, many households could afford
        rent only in smaller units, resulting in an increase in persons per household.

2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                        Page 5- 3
Chapter 5 Housing Needs
         As mentioned previously, this impact has been somewhat lessened by the availability of
         low-interest financing currently available.
        Overpayment: The cost of housing eventually results in fixed-income, elderly, and lower-
         income households paying a disproportionately higher percentage of their income for
         housing. This can cause a series of other financial problems, often resulting in a
         deteriorating housing stock because the costs of maintenance must be deferred or
         sacrificed for more immediate and essential expenses such as food, clothing, and utilities.
         Although rental rates have not increased significantly over the last planning period, and
         vacancy rates indicate that units are available, elderly residents’ and disabled persons’
         incomes (e.g., from Social Security) have not increased much, as elevated costs of living
         were not considered “inflation,” which is a determining factor that changes the rate of
         return of various financial benefit sources, such as Social Security or Disability. As
         noted elsewhere, wages have increased overall, but are tempered somewhat by rising
         unemployment, especially among farm workers and other unskilled workers. These
         factors result in continuing overpayment of housing by some special needs groups.
        Overcrowding: Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the
         condition of the housing stock and infrastructure. Overcrowding is strongly related to
         household size and the availability of suitably sized housing. While family size and
         tenure are critical determinants in overcrowding, household income also plays a strong
         role in the incidence of overcrowding. As a general rule, overcrowding levels tend to
         decrease as income rises, especially for renters (and particularly for small and large
         families). As with renters, owner households with higher incomes have lower rates of
         overcrowding. As housing prices climb and loans becomes more difficult to secure,
         lower-income households are forced to live within housing units that, because of cost
         constraints, are likely to be smaller in size or older in age. This can result in
         overcrowding as more persons are forced to pool their limited financial resources within
         the household in order to be able to afford a relatively acceptable dwelling unit. This
         situation then places a strain on the housing unit, does not provide a satisfying or
         enjoyable environment for members of the household, and eventually results in
         conditions which contribute to deterioration of both the housing stock and quality of
         neighborhoods.
The Tulare County Housing Authority provides assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher
program (previously known as Community Voucher Program rental subsidy program) within a
community and operates public housing in Dinuba. This program allows qualified households to
have a subsidy from the Housing Authority paid directly to the landlord, leaving the household to
pay the remaining rent directly themselves. It is provided to eligible applicants on a first-come,
first-served basis with one county-wide waiting list. To be eligible, a family of four must have
an annual income not greater than $45,500 to be considered low income; or $28,450 to be
considered very low income; or $24,250 to be considered extremely low income. The program is
also available to those over the age of 62 or those who are disabled.
In order for the Housing Authority to take a more active role in the development of housing
within the City, it would be necessary for the City to initiate, and the City voters to approve, a
referendum pursuant to Article 34 of the California Constitution. Article 34 requires approval of
the voters by simple majority before a “state public body” develops, constructs, or acquires a

“low-rent housing project.” While not every assisted housing opportunity is subject to this
provision (i.e., Community Housing Voucher Program), it has been determined by the Courts
that providing financing in the form of bonds or other vehicles could be construed as
“development.”
Rehabilitation
The rehabilitation of housing is a viable alternative to developing new housing. As most
infrastructure (e.g., sanitary sewer, water, storm water drainage, streets, etc.) is generally in
place, improvement costs of rehabilitation projects can be substantially lower than constructing
new units or infrastructure. A total of nine units were rehabilitated in the last planning period,
between 2009 and 2013. The City has Actions in place to encourage developers to help fund
development of multi-family development and rehabilitation, and for the City to work with Self-
Help Enterprises’ efforts to rehabilitate existing homes.
Overcrowding
The U.S. Census Bureau defines overcrowding as units with 1.01 persons or more per room
excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Units with 1.5 persons per room are
considered severely overcrowded. Overcrowding is usually reflective of one of three conditions:
     A household that occupies a dwelling with too few bedrooms;
     A dwelling housing too many occupants ( for example, extended family members such as
        grandparents or grown children and their families);
     A household that rents already occupied living space to non-family members (i.e.,
        families renting to family, friends, or seasonal workers).
Whatever the cause, there is a direct correlation to housing affordability, as follows:
     Homeowners/renters are unable to afford dwellings with sufficient living space;
     Older children wishing to leave home are constrained from doing so because they cannot
        afford separate housing;
     Grandparents and others on fixed incomes are unable to afford suitable housing or have
        disabilities that force them to live with their relatives;
     Households with low incomes tolerate overcrowding to derive needed, additional income;
     There is an insufficient supply of housing units to accommodate the demand.
The extent of overcrowding in Dinuba is shown in Table 5-2. Exact causes, however, can not be
determined without additional special studies.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
According to the 2010 Census, approximately 21.4 percent of Dinuba’s households live in
overcrowded conditions, compared to approximately 6 percent nationally. Of owner-occupied
units, 17 percent are considered overcrowded. The problem is more acute in renter-occupied
units, where 27 percent are considered overcrowded. These numbers are indicative of the rising
cost of housing and associated costs, compared with stagnating wages and high unemployment,
and that despite the recent availability of low-cost financing, costs of housing were increasing at
a faster rate than income. Although the average cost of housing has decreased somewhat since
2007, the unemployment rate has risen, so that the number of households that can afford to move
in to larger sized homes has not increased.
Overcrowding can be alleviated in a variety of ways. Remodeling and additions to existing
owner-occupied dwellings and the construction of larger apartment units are the most obvious
ways. To accomplish this, it is necessary to provide adequate financing and construction
opportunities for the homeowner and the apartment developer. Zoning within the City of Dinuba
also provides opportunities to accommodate housing needs. Second units that meet zoning
standards are allowed in all R (One Family Residential), RA (Residential Acreage), and RM
(Multi-Family Residential) zones. Manufactured homes are also permitted in residential zones
and can also be used as second units.
Most homeowners in an overcrowded situation do not possess adequate construction skills to add
extra living space without employing an outside contractor. Even then, homeowners are
restricted by their ability to pay or secure financing. In many cases, homeowners pledge equity
in their home as collateral for construction. If the homeowner defaults on the loan, it is possible
that the homeowner may lose the home. It is important that financing and self-help assistance
opportunities continue to be provided to assist the very-low and low-income homeowners. The
City continues to seek funding sources to assist lower income homeowners with financial
assistance for home rehabilitations and additions.
It is uncommon for renters to find affordable units of appropriate size, especially since higher
building costs require charging higher rents for larger units. Many households can not afford to
pay more for larger, rental dwelling units. Through subsidized housing programs provided by
the Housing Authority as assistance to developers, it may be possible to increase the number of
apartment units with more rooms at affordable rates to meet the need of persons requiring larger
units. The City of Dinuba’s Zoning Ordinance was updated in 2008 and included incentives
including a Density Bonus for development of lower-income housing that can include units for
large families, who are those most likely to be overpaying for housing. Developers can qualify
for a Density Bonus of up to 35 percent additional units, which would not only reduce
construction costs, but also provide more efficient economies of scale when installing
infrastructure (i.e., storm water drainage, potable water, and sanitary sewer systems, along with
streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks).
5.2      Special needs
Elderly Persons
Special housing needs of the elderly are important since this group is more likely to be on fixed
incomes or have low incomes. The elderly also often have special needs related to housing
construction and location. They often require ramps, handrails, or lower cupboards and counters

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
to allow greater access and mobility. The elderly also need access to facilities (medical care and
shopping centers) and public transit. In most instances, the elderly prefer to stay in their own
homes rather than relocate to a retirement community, but may need assistance to make home
repairs or conduct general household activities. 2010 Census data indicate that a population of
1,681 persons were over the age of 65 in Dinuba.
The 2010 Census figures indicated that there were approximately 44 million persons aged 65 and
older nationwide (or 14.1 percent of the U.S. population). The number of elderly persons as a
percentage of total U.S. population is expected to continue to increase due to the aging of the
"Baby Boom" generation, lower birth rates in recent years, and extended life expectancies. It is
expected that persons aged 65 years and older will comprise more than 22 percent by 2030 (or 65
million). Although the percentage of elderly increased from 1990 to 2000 (9.59 percent in 1990
to 11.6 percent in 2000) in Dinuba, the total elderly population of the City decreased to 7.8
percent of the population by 2010. The median age of a resident is 27 years, while the median
age of a California resident is approximately 35 years. This indicates that the City has a higher
percentage of young persons than does the State as a whole.
In order to maintain a satisfactory quality of life, residents of Dinuba must have access to
housing which suits their varying needs during each stage of their lives. As people age, they
often find themselves facing additional housing problems they may not have had to cope with
previously. Senior households have special housing needs primarily due to three major concerns:
physical disabilities/limitations, income and health care costs.
According to the 2000 census, 21.2 percent (944) of the City’s households were age 65 years or
older. In 2010, the number of elderly householders increased to 947, and the percentage of
elderly households to the overall population grew only slightly to 21.3 percent of total
households, with a difference of only three more elderly householders in 2010. As shown in
Table 5-3, an estimated 947 households, or 21.3 percent of the total households, were headed by
an individual 65 years of age or older.

The Annual Median Income (AMI) and ownership or renter status for those age 62 and over is
not available for the City of Dinuba. The data for Tulare County as a whole are shown on Table
5-5. This indicates that approximately 31.7 percent of elderly owner households were below 50
percent of the AMI, and 65.3 percent of the elderly renter households were at that income level.
Although there were fewer elderly renter households than owner households, elderly renters
were twice as likely as owners to be in the lower income groups. In general, the “sample group”
representing Tulare County as a whole includes only the Visalia and Porterville areas, which are
more affluent than the County’s smaller, agricultural areas. It is therefore reasonable to conclude
that over 65 percent of elderly renter households in Dinuba are in the lower income groups, and
need rental assistance. It is also reasonable to conclude that approximately one-third of elderly
owner households are also in the lower income groups, and may need assistance with
maintaining their homes, utilities, and or accommodations such as railings, wheelchair ramps,
lighting, and other health and safety equipment.

In addition to providing housing opportunities, the need to provide assistance to seniors for
housing rehabilitation is critical as this group typically has fixed incomes and, over time,
diminishing health. Currently, there is funding available for this type of assistance through
opportunities provided by Proposition 46, although this funding is not limited to housing for
seniors. Proposition 46 makes funding available through which the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) and the California Housing Finance Agency
(CalFHA) make funding available to be used explicitly for development and rehabilitation of
low-income and special needs housing, housing preservation, and first-time buyer down-payment
assistance. Proposition 46 is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, Residential Land Resources.
Persons with Disabilities
The 2010 Census included questions on disability to determine if respondents had long-term
visual or hearing impairment or physical, mental, or emotional conditions of at least six months

in duration that prevented them from performing essential tasks. Persons with disabilities often
require accommodations to dwellings to provide access not only within the dwelling, but also to
and from the site. Special modifications to provide access are vital and in some instances,
required. Title 24 of the California Administrative Code requires that public buildings, motels,
and hotels provide accommodations for wheelchair access. Ramps, larger door widths, and
restroom modifications enable access for disabled persons. Although such standards are
typically not mandatory for single-family dwellings, with the exception of condominiums, they
are mandatory for multi-family developments, with the exception of dwellings classified as
“town houses.”
Persons with disabilities in Dinuba face special problems in obtaining affordable and adequate
housing. This segment of the population, which includes individuals with mental, physical, and
developmental disabilities need affordable, conveniently-located housing which, where
necessary, has been specially adapted for wheelchair accessibility, or other accommodations.
Additionally, many desire their dwellings to be located near public facilities, services, and
especially near public transportation facilities that provide service to the disabled. Many
government programs that group seniors and persons with disabilities together (such as HUD
Section 202 housing) are inadequate and often do not adequately serve the needs of the disabled.
Description of Need
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life
activities. According to 2011-2013 American Community Survey (ACS) 3-year estimates (Table
5-7), there is a total of 514 Dinuba residents with independent living difficulty between the ages
of 18 and 64, and an additional 428 residents with independent living difficulty over age 65.
Although the ACS does not provide further information on the reasons for the difficulty, it is
reasonable to assume that for the majority of these 942 residents (6.3 percent of the total
population), the reasons for this difficulty in living independently are most likely physical and/or
mental disabilities that may or may not be related to age.
There are approximately 331 individuals in Dinuba who have difficulty with caring for
themselves at home, while another 1,342 have difficulty with functions outside the home, such as
shopping and medical appointments. These are not individuals that necessarily need institutional
or full-time medical care, but who may need special accommodations in the home, someone to
come to their homes to assist them there or with tasks outside the home. Those over the age of
65 with these disabilities may qualify for senior housing, based on their incomes. According to
the U.S. Census, Americans with Disabilities: 2010, Household Economic Studies,
approximately 18.7 percent of all Americans had a disability, and approximately 12.6 percent
had a severe disability. This does not include those living in institutional group quarters and
those living in military barracks. Generally, the percentage of those with disabilities increased
with age, so that at age 80, approximately 70.5 percent have at least one disability, with
approximately 25 percent in group aged 65 – 69 having a severe disability. Approximately 11.7
percent of those with severe disabilities over age 65 lived in poverty. Based on the percentages
for the U.S. as a whole, approximately 64.42 percent of those with a disability have a severe
disability. This population is more likely to be unemployed, live in poverty, and need assistance
at home in and outside the home. Although these data indicate the percentages of residents who
have serious disabilities, they do not specify the types of assistance that these residents may
need, and therefore, the City should offer a full range of services and facilities. This includes

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
facilities for those who need full-time medical care; accommodations to living facilities, such as
wheel chair ramps, hand rails in bathrooms, wide hallways and doorways; and personal
assistance with bathing, cooking, and dressing.
Based on this information, the City estimates that 64.4 percent of those with self-care and
independent living disabilities between ages 17 and 64 need housing to accommodate their needs
(595 x 64.4 = 383 individuals). An additional 390 seniors (age 65 and over) need
accommodations.
The City has a number of resources available to meet these needs. A records search of the State
Department of Social Services’ Community Care Licensing Division identified one adult
residential facility, Ever Board and Care, in Dinuba that provides 24-hour non-medical care for
adults ages 18-59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs.
Dinuba has two licensed senior facilities that are permitted by both the City and State: St.
Michael’s has a facility capacity of 49 individuals, and Ever Board and Care has a facility
capacity of 6 individuals.
In addition, Garden Estates is a 44-unit apartment complex managed by the Tulare County
Housing Authority. Housing at Garden Estates (44 units), College Park Estates (54 units), and
Empire Estates (62 units) is available to those who qualify for Section 8 housing. In addition
Grace and Laughter is available to seniors and those of any age who are disabled (40 units).
Other resources are discussed in the sections for those with physical disabilities, developmental
disabilities, and cognitive abilities. Policies and actions that will ensure that those with
disabilities have equal access to facilities, accommodations, and services are summarized below
(Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs) and are described in detail in
Chapter 9.
Physical Disabilities
According to 2013 ACS 3-Year Estimate, persons with disabilities in Dinuba comprised
approximately 10.8 percent of the entire City’s population, an increase from 10.2 percent of the
total population in 2007. Of those age 65 years and over, approximately 50.5 percent have at
least one disability, while for those individuals between 18 and 64 years, 11.3 percent have at
least one disability.
In order to accommodate the City's population with physical disabilities, there is a need to adapt
houses or apartments for wheelchairs and other special requirements. Both Federal and State
housing laws require certain features of adaptive design for physical accessibility in all multi-
family residential buildings with four or more units built for first occupancy starting March 13,
1991. However, numerous dwelling units built before that date were not subject to these
accessibility requirements. This, however, does not address the need of individuals – particularly
seniors – who choose to remain in their homes rather than move to assisted living facilities
and/or other newly constructed units.
Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require the
analysis of the disabled to include an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
developmental disabilities. The analysis of this group should include an estimate of the number
of persons with developmental disabilities, an assessment of the housing need, and a discussion
of potential resources.
A “developmental disability” is defined as a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that person. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
and autism. Data provided by the State Department of Developmental Services, Central Valley
Regional Center on the numbers of people served by their program indicate that a total of 150
persons aged five to 64, and three over age 64 in Dinuba were served by their program (Pers.
Comm. D Kaus, June 4, 2015). Of the 67 adults served by the program only two are employed.
One of the agencies’ goals is to move people from State development centers into the
community, and they provide assistance to increase each person’s ability to live independently.
The Department has 21 Regional Centers that serve all of the counties. Regional Centers,
including the Central Valley Regional Center, are required to conduct quarterly monitoring of all
their clients that are living out of the home. Persons under the age of 18 may live in a Small
Family Home or a Group Home. Persons over the age of 18 to age 59 may reside in facilities
licensed as an Adult Residential Care Facility. Persons age 60 and over may reside in facilities
licensed as an Elderly Care Facility. All of these are classified as “Community Care Facilities,”
which have age restrictions. Conversely, those with developmental disabilities who need
intermittent nursing care needs may live in a Health Care Facility, which does not have age
restrictions. Typically, the decision on whether to place someone in a Health Care Facility or a
Community Care Facility is based on the individual’s need for staff intervention, supervision and
medical needs. Those individuals with less severe developmental disabilities may live at home,
and may participate in Supported Living or Independent Living programs during the day.

Cognitive Disabilities
The 2010 U.S. Census collected information on individuals with various disabilities. Those who
have difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions are considered to have
cognitive disabilities. These types of disabilities were classified with mental disabilities in the

2000 Census. According to the 2012 American FactFinder data, there are 777 residents between
ages 5 and over with cognitive disabilities in Dinuba. Persons with cognitive disabilities are a
critically under-served population with respect to housing. There are a limited number of day
treatment facilities and programs, including drop-in socialization centers, to serve persons with
mental disabilities. These individuals do not have access to regional centers in Dinuba whereas
persons with physical disabilities do. Moreover, there is no respite care to families who are
responsible for their relatives with mental disabilities on a 24-hour basis within the City. Table
5-7 summarizes total disabilities by disability type for all age groups within Dinuba as provided
by the 2012 American FactFinder. Also, because some persons have more than one disability,
the total number of persons with disabilities is 2,461 (11.4 percent of the total City population),
while the total number of disabilities identified by the 2012 Census was 4,274.A records search
of the State Department of Social Services’ Community Care Licensing Division identified one
adult residential facility, Ever Board and Care, in Dinuba that provides 24-hour non-medical care
for adults ages 18-59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs.
Dinuba has two licensed senior facilities that are permitted by both the City and State: St.
Michael’s has a facility capacity of 49 individuals, and Ever Board and Care has a facility
capacity of 6 individuals.
It should be noted that approximately 23.1 percent of the total disabled persons over age 5 in
Dinuba have a disability (or combination of disabilities) that is categorized as an either “Self-
Care” or “Independent Living” disability. The City requires that all new construction and
extensive remodeling comply with both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California
Disabled Accessibility Guidebook.
According to the 2011-2013 ACS 3-Year Estimate approximately 11.4 percent of Dinuba’s
residents (2,461 persons) have one or more disabilities. Of the City’s senior population,
approximately 50.5 percent, or 781 individuals have one or more types of disabilities. Unlike in
previous years, the 2010 Census did not provide information on “Employment Disability” but
instead provided a breakdown of those with cognitive difficulty (difficulty remembering,
concentrating, or making decisions – formerly called “mental disability”), ambulatory difficulty
(walking or climbing stairs), self-care difficulty (bathing or dressing at home), and independent
living difficulty (doing errands outside the home alone). The 2012 data indicate that a total of
154 people between the ages of 18 and 65 have difficulty managing their own care at home,
while 177 over the age of 65 have this difficulty. Five hundred fourteen people between the
ages of 18 and 64 have difficulty with independent living (managing shopping or appointments
on their own outside the home), and 428 people over 65 have this difficulty. Based on the total
2012 population (22,852), approximately 6.7 percent of the senior population - of which
approximately 70.5 percent have a disability, qualify for senior housing. Disability data are
summarized in Table 5-7.

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
Appropriate housing for persons with cognitive, developmental, or physical disabilities include
very low cost units in large group home settings (near retail services and public transit),
supervised apartment settings with on- or off-site support services, outpatient/day treatment
programs, and inpatient/day treatment programs, crisis shelters and transitional housing.
Appropriate housing can also include other accommodations, such as modifications to
entryways, flooring, or kitchen counter heights, as well as special equipment for sight or hearing
impaired individuals.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
A number of goals and programs have been included in Chapter 9 – Eight Year Action Plan as
actions to assist in the City meeting the housing needs for the City’s disabled population. Policy
2.1.2 requires that the City review its current process for ensuring reasonable accommodations
for housing for those with disabilities. Action 2.2.5 commits the City to developing a Universal
Design Element that will govern construction or modification of homes using design principles
that allow individuals to remain in the their homes as their physical needs and capabilities
change. Action 1.1.5 commits the City to revising its permitting and recordkeeping process to
better track the types of housing permits for second units and other housing that will assist lower
income groups, including those with disabilities. Action 6.2.4 commits the City to encourage
non-profit sponsors to make application for HUD Section 202 allocations for construction of
rental housing for seniors and those with disabilities by identifying available sites in the Site
Inventory and communicating the information to the sponsors. The City will take all actions
necessary to expedite processing and approval of such projects. Action 6.2.12 and Goals 2 and 6,
also assist the City in achieving unmet housing needs for the disabled population.
In 1984, Title 24 of the State Uniform Building Code mandated that all multiple-family
residential construction projects containing in excess of five units under construction after
September 15, 1985, would conform to specific disabled adaptability/accessibility regulations. It
requires that at least 10 percent of ground floor apartments must be accessible to those with
disabilities. In 1988, the Federal government enacted the U.S. Fair Housing Amendment Act,
also with the intent of increasing the number of rental units being built that would be accessible
to individuals with a disability. In July 1993, the State of California issued “California Multi-
family Access Requirements” based upon the Act. The actual increase in the number of units
accessible to those with disabilities available on the current rental market has increased locally
by an estimated 65 rental units in the last 25 years but may not have kept up with demand.
A review of the City’s zoning ordinances, building codes and development standards indicates
that the City does not impede the construction, improvement, or conversion of housing for the
disabled by requiring special building codes or more detailed project review. Both the Federal
Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative
duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning and other land-use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For
example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the setbacks of
properties that have already been developed to accommodate residents with mobility
impairments. Dinuba allows homeowners to build ramps into single-family dwellings to allow
first floor access for physically disabled residents. Such ramps or guardrails are permitted to
intrude into the standard setbacks required under zoning, and are subject only to a building
permit. This provision eliminates the need to obtain a zoning variance, which is a discretionary
act. Although the Zoning Ordinance was revised to allow these accommodations in 2008, few
residents have requested permits from the City to make these changes. The number of residents
who may have made adjustments to the interior of their home to accommodate disabilities is
unknown as some may have not sought permits for these modifications.
“Family,” as defined in the zoning ordinance, does not preclude unrelated persons living together
as a group, but instead includes “a group of not more than six (6) persons not necessarily related
by blood or marriage, living together in a dwelling unit.” No spacing or concentration

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
requirements are included in any ordinance to distinguish or constrain living arrangements of
persons with disabilities. A program has been included to assure that codes, building
requirements, and approval procedures do not impose constraints on persons with disabilities.
The City also makes rehabilitation funds available to income qualified households for
accessibility improvements. The Emergency Repair Program (ERP) has been designed in part to
address these needs by providing affordable loans to assist disabled tenants to improve their
rental units to meet their physical needs.
In compliance with GC 65583(5), the City must remove constraints or provide accommodations
for housing for persons with disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local
processing and permit procedures. Instead, these accommodations for persons with disability
must be allowed by right. In 2012, the City revised its zoning ordinance to allow, “group homes
serving six or fewer mentally disordered or otherwise handicapped persons where such homes
provide care on a twenty-four hour basis” as a permitted use in the AN, RA, R, and RM districts.
These homes previously required a conditional use permit in these zones. The City’s zoning
also allows use for a “group care facility” as a by-right use in the AN, RA, R, and RM districts.
The City will continue to include Actions to ensure that unintended constraints on those with
disabilities are reviewed and revised in the Zoning Ordinance.
The City is confident that its set of procedures ensures that the disabled are offered equal
opportunity to housing of their choice and that these procedures provide developers with the
flexibility necessary to develop housing for the disabled. All necessary forms and applications
are available at the Public Works building counter.
Large Families and Households
Large families and households are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as households that have five or
more members. Large households generally require larger dwellings to avoid overcrowded
conditions, and are often challenged with proportionally lower incomes which subsequently limit
their ability to afford larger living quarters. Large households may be the result of multi-
generational families living in the same dwelling, sometimes with members (e.g., children,
grandchildren and the elderly) who are unable to work or unemployed and therefore unable to
contribute to the household income.
Description of Need
2010 Census figures, as shown in Table 5-8, Year 2010 Household Size By Tenure, report that
large family households account for 33.8 percent of all households in Dinuba (1,164
households). The number of households who own their homes is slightly larger than that of
renter households (i.e., 46.5 percent renter households vs.53.5 percent owner households).

The 2010 Census data figures show a slow but steady increase in the percentage of large
households over the last 20 years: 24.4 percent in 1990; 31.6 percent in 2000, and 33.8 percent in
2010.
Table 5-9 provides 2013 ACS data showing that 19.5 percent (or 289) of the 1,483 large family
households in Dinuba are from extremely low-, very low- or low-income families. This number
has decreased since the last planning period. However, almost 30 percent (29.9) of the families
with three or four members are below the federal poverty level. Further, 2010 Census data
estimate approximately 3.4 percent of the rental housing stock has four (4) or more bedrooms
resulting in a high percentage of lower-income large households which are forced to live in
overcrowded situations (See Table 5-10).

Table 5-10 provides a breakdown of the total number of units by bedroom size as reported by
the 2009-2013, 5-year American Community Survey. Of the 5,997 total number of units by
bedroom size, the combined one- and two-bedroom units equal 1,798 units, or approximately 30
percent of all units, while the combined three- and four-bedroom units equal 2,868 units or
approximately 47.8 percent of all units. As shown in Table 5-11, of the 1,200 total units with 4
or more bedrooms, the 2010 US Census indicated that zero units were occupied by renters thus
many large families continue to live in overcrowded conditions. In contrast, many older
households live in houses which are too large for their household, but are reluctant to move.

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
As with other special needs groups, large families would benefit from innovative multi-family
housing development such as co-housing units which may include child care facilities. Large
families should also have adequate recreational areas for children and adults near their
residences. Housing for large families should also be located near public transit. A program to
assist large families with homeownership would be advantageous.
Current parking ordinances which relate the size of the dwelling unit to the number of required
parking spaces have inadvertently established incentives for developers to restrict unit sizes in
order to reduce parking development costs. As a result, the City has a prevalence of 2-bedroom
units, presenting a problem for larger families. By reducing parking standards for units with 4 or
more bedrooms, the City may eliminate barriers and incentivize the development of much
needed larger units. There is an Action included to address this issue, described in Chapter 9.
Female Heads of Household
Families with female heads of household experience a high incidence of poverty with more than
42 percent of persons in female-headed households living below poverty levels. A high poverty
level often results in poorly maintained dwellings as these households do not have the financial
resources to maintain their homes. This may be further exacerbated as female heads of household

Table 5-12 indicates that the number of female-headed households with minor children within
the City of Dinuba is 690, or 12.3 percent; which is an increase from 10.7 percent from 2000. A
major obstacle encountered by single-parent, female-headed households is the inability to
provide for a dwelling because of inadequate income and/or the ability to provide childcare if
employed during the workday. As a result, many female-headed households are unable to break
free of the poverty level even if they can obtain full-time employment. There is a youth center
adjacent to Dinuba High School, and the Dinuba Recreation Center provides a low-cost day-care
alternative during the summer months, as well as after school programs. The availability of such
a program facilitates meeting the childcare needs of the female-headed household group while
also expediting their return to the work force.
Farm Worker Housing Needs
An important factor to be considered in the determination of regional housing needs is the
housing needs of farm workers. The State Department of Employment Development (EDD)
estimated that there were approximately 33,100 farm workers employed in agriculture in Tulare
County in 2002 and approximately 37,100 in 2008. HUD estimated that there were 39,100 farm
workers in Tulare County in fiscal year 2011-2012 (ending July 1, 2012). This amount reflects
an approximately 4.3 percent increase in agricultural employment from 2008. Additionally, the
number of farm workers is predicted to increase to 41,600 by 2020 (RHNA), an increase of 10.4
percent. This number includes farm workers who were unpaid, regular and seasonal hired
domestic workers, and/or agricultural workers brought to California under contract from outside
the United States. In Tulare County, the 2012 level of agricultural employment was higher than
any one non-farm employment sector. Additionally, agricultural production is important to the
manufacturing segment of employment, providing approximately 55 percent of the
manufacturing jobs. This includes employment with companies such as Ruiz Foods in Dinuba.
As is the case with most low-income households, the housing needs of farm workers far exceed
the government’s ability to provide assistance. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), Rural Development Program, is the most important provider of permanent housing for
farm workers. Other providers of farm worker housing include the State Department of Housing

Services of the EDD which operates migrant centers throughout the state.
Because most farm workers earn low annual wages and their employment status changes
frequently, they are often unable to compete for housing on the open market. Even among the
broader farm worker population, there are different groups, each with its own housing
difficulties. “Regular” or “year-round” farm workers are defined by EDD as those working 150
or more days per year for the same employer. Regular farm workers comprise about 25 percent
of the County’s farm worker population. Their incomes are generally higher than “seasonal”
workers (who work fewer than 150 days annually for the same employer), although most are still
unable to obtain affordable home ownership or standard rental housing.
Seasonal and migrant seasonal workers represent about three-quarters of the County’s farm
worker population. Seasonal workers are generally local residents who depend heavily on
finding employment in the agricultural industry to support their families. Migrant seasonal
workers are those who travel more than fifty miles across county lines to obtain agricultural
employment. The housing needs of the migrant seasonal category are most severe because of
constant travel. These workers often settle for whatever type of housing they can find, which
often results in living in substandard, overcrowded conditions.
The 2008 RHNA estimated that there were 178 regular farm worker households in Dinuba in
1990, and 533 seasonal farm worker households. Data for 2010 or later were not available.
Within the City, there is a privately-operated farm worker housing project called Collegeville
Farm Workers, which provides housing for approximately 40 to 50 workers. There is also other
farm worker’s housing outside of the city limits that provides year-round and seasonal housing.
Further, the Dinuba Municipal Code permits up to six unrelated individuals to reside in the same
single-family dwelling as renters or boarders; this is likely the most popular arrangement for
seasonal workers, although it is difficult to estimate the number of farm workers with this living
situation. In addition, the City will apply for funding from HCD and FmHA to increase farm
worker housing. The City will also review available, vacant lands to ensure that 1) there are
sufficient properties that allow for farm worker housing, 2) will increase the number permitted
from six to 36, and 3) will consider rezoning areas where constraints on farm worker housing
exist.
Identification of Needs
Farm workers are generally considered to have special housing needs because of their limited
income and the often unstable nature of their employment (i.e., having to move throughout the
year from one harvest to the next). While no local surveys are available which document the
specific housing needs of farm labor community in Tulare County, Statewide surveys provide a
broader insight into the demographic characteristics and housing needs of farm workers. Among
the major findings are:
       Limited Income: Farm workers typically fall within the extremely low-incomes group.
        According to the Rural Community Assistance Corporation, three-fourths of California's
        farm workers earned less than $10,000 a year in 2000. Only one out of seven earned more
        than $12,500 annually.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
     Overcrowding: Because of their very low incomes, farm workers have limited housing
         choices and are often forced to double up to afford rents. No local surveys have been
         taken of farm worker housing, but a statewide survey indicates that overcrowding is
         prevalent and a significant housing problem exists among farm workers (California
         Institute for Rural Studies, 1997).
Substandard Housing Conditions: Many farm workers live in overcrowded conditions and
occupy substandard housing, including in formal shacks, illegal garage units, and other structures
generally unsuitable for occupancy (California Institute for Rural Studies, 1997).
Existing Resources for Farm Workers
Historically, many migrant agricultural workers resided in farm labor camps throughout the
County. However, similar to other areas throughout the State, many farm operators have shifted
away from hiring their own workers, and instead use farm labor contractors to provide needed
agricultural labor, particularly for migrant or seasonal labor. The supply of farm worker housing
remains inadequate, largely because area growers offer only limited housing facilities and
supportive services to employees. Based on discussions with local community members, the
number of units provided by privately held companies has declined in recent years. Labor
contractors are not required to provide housing or to assure that their employees have decent,
safe housing. The reduction in on-site or local housing, especially for seasonal and migrant farm
workers, has resulted in farm workers living in substandard conditions such as garages, cars,
fields, sheds, and other areas not intended for habitation.
Currently, farm worker housing in Dinuba is permitted only in the AN Agricultural District,
provided that the housing is a use incidental to the primary use of the property (i.e., farming).
There are no AN zoning districts within the city limits. The previously mentioned Collegeville
Farm Workers project is located in the RM-1.5 district, as it was in existence prior to adoption of
the current Zoning Ordinance. In 2004, the City of Dinuba amended the Zoning Ordinance
pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 17021, providing for up to six employees residing in
a single-family residence as a use permitted by right in all residential zones. The City of Dinuba
Zoning Ordinance currently allows the renting of rooms and boarding for not more than two
rooms per dwelling and no more than a total of six persons. The City will also make an inquiry to
the State Office of Migrant Services, which provides monies for construction, operation, and
maintenance of seasonal farm worker housing.
Families and Persons in Need of Emergency Housing
Transitional and Supportive Housing
January 1, 2014, SB 745 took effect. It amends Section 65582 of the Government Code to
replace prior health and Safety Code definitions of “supportive housing,” “target population,”
and “transitional housing” with definitions now more specific to housing element law.
Supportive housing was revised to remove the time limits of occupancy.
“Supportive housing” is defined as housing with no limit of stay, that is occupied by the target
population, and that is linked on an onsite or offsite service that assists the supportive housing

resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. “Target population” means persons
with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS,
substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided
pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, and may include, among
other populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young
adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans,
and homeless people.
“Transitional housing” means buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated
under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the
assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that
shall be no less than six (6) months from the beginning of the assistance.
There are a variety of families and persons in need of emergency, supportive, and temporary
shelter. This group includes the chronically homeless, those in need of emergency shelter, those
threatened with homelessness, and those needing transitional housing.
A representative from the Kings/Tulare Homeless Alliance stated that according to the 2014
Point in Time (PIT) survey, there was one person sleeping on the streets and 13 people staying at
emergency shelters in Dinuba on the night of January 29th. Of course, this does not reflect a
representative sample of the overall homeless population within the City of Dinuba. At the
present time, there is no reliable statistical data regarding the homeless within the city limits. A
detailed study would be likely to produce a greater homeless population number, and reflect the
true number of individuals experiencing homelessness within the city.
Because the City is located in a rural area and there are many surrounding orchards and
vineyards, it is thought that persons without shelter will spend their evenings at these locations
and then migrate back into the City during daylight hours. Others will stay with relatives or
friends in the evening and then spend daylight hours in the City.
In addition to the information provided by the Kings-Tulare Counties Continuum of Care
regarding homeless in the City, the Dinuba Public Schools maintain data on the students that
they regard as “homeless.” They use the definition required by the California Department of
Education which defines homeless children and youth to be “individuals who lack a fixed,
regular, and adequate nighttime residence.” This definition also includes:
       Children and youth who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing,
        economic hardship, or a similar reason
       Children who may be living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, shelters, or awaiting foster
        care placement
       Children and youth who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private
        place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human
        beings
       Children and youth who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings,
        substandard housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings, or

     Migratory children who qualify as homeless because they are children who are living in
        similar circumstances listed above
Within the City, there are:
       10 students at Dinuba High School
       6 students at Grand View Elementary
       13 students at Jefferson Elementary
       38 students at Kennedy Elementary
       40 students at Lincoln Elementary
       1 student at Ronald Reagan Independent Study
       12 students at Roosevelt Elementary
       2 students at Sierra Vista Continuation
       20 students at Washington Intermediate
       40 students at Wilson Elementary
Of a total of 6,580 students, 182, or 2.7 percent are considered homeless. This figure does not
include parents or siblings under school age, or other related or unrelated persons considered to
make up the household.
A private faith-based provider, Open Gate Ministries, serves families and single women who are
homeless and who meet their strict criteria. It is the only facility that provides overnight
accommodations for the homeless in Dinuba. The organization does not offer residency to those
who are chronically homeless or those who have alcohol or chemical addictions. The
organization does not accept single men. Its facility has space for a maximum of 34 persons and
there is no maximum length of stay. Open Gate Ministries estimates that its facility serves
approximately 15 Dinuba families per day, for a total of 750-900 shelter nights. Overall, Open
Gate Ministries serves about 100 families a year, and is utilized for approximately 5,000 to 6,000
shelter nights per year. An estimated 15 percent of families they serve are from the Dinuba area.
Another 15 percent are from the unincorporated community of Culter-Orosi (located
approximately 5 miles east of Dinuba) or other Tulare County locations, 50 percent from Fresno
County, and the remaining 20 percent come from other areas of the U.S. In addition to providing
overnight accommodations, Open Gate Ministries distributes food to about 400 families on a
weekly basis in Dinuba and another 400 families in Cutler-Orosi. In addition to Open Gate
Ministries, Cristo Es La Vid Verdadera provides meals, free food, and other assistance to those
with low incomes in the community.
Open Gate Ministries of Dinuba, CA is a private nonprofit corporation that has served the needy
of Northern Tulare and Southern Fresno Counties since 1974 (website, March 9, 2015). The
purpose of Open Gate Ministries is to assist and support the homeless and hungry with
emergency services. They serve Dinuba and the surrounding communities with regular food
distribution. It receives weekly deliveries of food from Wal-Mart through its Community Giving
program. Starting July 1, 2014, they became the only USDA food distributor in Northern Tulare
County. This means that they receive USDA food every month, instead of every-other month,
and there is more available than in the past. They anticipate that the number of households
requesting food will rise because of the increased availability, but cautions that USDA food,
while nourishing and helpful, does not supply all of the nutritional needs of the individuals it
serves.

The nearest emergency shelter outside of Dinuba is the faith-based Visalia Rescue Mission
located in Visalia (322 N.E. 1st Street) approximately 15 miles south/southeast of Dinuba. Its
Men's Facility residential program can accommodate 36 men. The Overnight Men's Shelter can
house 60 men. The Men’s Shelter provides overnight emergency services that include dinner,
attendance at chapel, shower, overnight bedding accommodations, and morning breakfast. After
breakfast, guests leave the premises. Visalia Rescue Mission as has an apartment for transitional
housing. The “Alpha House” can accommodate seven men for up to six months for those who
participate in a six-month program and are either going to school and working part time, or
working full time or have some type of income such as Social Security Insurance or Social
Security benefits. The Rescue Mission’s women's residential program, the House of Hope, can
accommodate 12 single women. The Shelter of Hope can house up to 26 women and children
and, in addition to providing housing, also provides spiritual, emotional and physical needs of
single women. The House of Hope is a “Christ-centered residential recovery program focusing
on improving the mental, physical, and spiritual health of women struggling with chemical
dependencies. The program is a nine-month commitment with an option for 12-18 months of
extended care. Once the women complete the program, they can move into the Transitional
House. Emergency and transitional services for homeless single women and women with
children include accommodations up to 30 days for homeless single women, and 45 days for
women with children. Three meals per day are provided as well as faith-based evening services
and case management to assist them in reaching a level of self-sustained living.
Dinuba’s current Zoning Ordinance allows emergency shelters and transitional housing with a
conditional use permit in the R and RM zoning districts. The City recognizes the necessity for a
permanent, year-round facility to serve those individuals and families who are homeless, at risk
of becoming homeless, or are in transition, and will amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit these
in the RM district as a by right use. Additionally, as required by State code, “Supportive
Housing” will be defined and included in the amended ordinance.
In order to provide incentive for private developers to produce housing specifically intended for
special needs groups, the City will adopt modified standards, including, but not necessarily
limited to decreased parking requirements, variances to setback and yard requirements, increased
densities, and will proactively seek potential developers to accommodate special needs groups.
5.3     Projected Housing Needs
Information presented in Chapters 3 and 4 documented the recent growth that has occurred in the
population and housing stock in Dinuba. Between 2000 and 2014, the population increased by
10.3 percent, while housing stock increased by only 6.6 percent. This is a trend that has
continued for at least 15 years. This is consistent with the increase in persons per household
from 3.39 in 2000 to 3.72 in 2008 to 3.87 in 2014. Using projections provided by DOF, Dinuba’s
population as of January 1, 2014 was 23,966 or an increase of 2,213 persons since the 2010
Census. This is approximately a 10.3 percent growth in population. Correspondingly, there has
been an increase of approximately 390 units housing units between 2010 and 2014. Long-range
projections contained in the 2003 Dinuba Housing Element indicated that the total population of
Dinuba will increase to approximately 27,953 (18.1 percent) by 2023, the duration of the
planning period.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
Market Demand for Housing
Housing element law required cities and counties to plan for, and accommodate their share of,
regional housing needs for all income levels. Most of the housing element requirements,
however, focus on the needs of low- and moderate-income households. The Legislature and the
Governor have declared that the lack of affordable housing is among the State’s most critical
problems. As a consequence, local governments are required to place special emphasis in their
housing policies on meeting low- and moderate-income housing needs.
It is imperative that a clear understanding is established regarding the definition of these
segments of the population. According to HUD, the 2013 median income in Tulare County was
$54,700. Although this varies from other sources, and is likely to be high for the City of Dinuba,
it is the figure that is used by federal and State agencies when determining eligibility for housing
assistance, and will be used throughout this document.
         Very-Low (0% to 50% of median)                       $0-27,350
         Low (51% to 80% of median)                           $27,351 to $43,760
         Moderate (80% to 120% of median)                     $43,761 to $65,640
         Above Moderate (Above 120% of median)                More than $65,641
         Source: 2014 Tulare County RHNA and HUD.
The City of Dinuba has sufficient land available for households with moderate and above-
moderate incomes, and will, therefore, concentrate on providing sufficient and appropriate land,
and otherwise encouraging development of housing for lower income groups. It is assumed that
market forces are capable of meeting the needs of those households with moderate and above-
moderate incomes. The market (private sector) cannot, or has not, met the needs of those
households that fall below those income levels. As with any market driven industry, the building
industry is driven by many financial considerations and market fluctuations. Although funding is
available at the state and federal level, those agencies do not have the tools to become deeply
involved in the local housing process. With this in mind, cities and counties then have the
responsibility of facilitating the construction of affordable housing. Incentives, such as housing
density bonuses, offering buildable land at reduced rates to keep land costs down, delaying
payment of urban infrastructure improvements, and providing fee credits are tools that the City
of Dinuba has successfully used in assisting developers to complete their projects.
Table 5-13 shows the projected housing need for the City of Dinuba during the 2009-2013
planning period, while Table 5-14 shows the projected housing need for the City of Dinuba
during the 2014-2023 planning period. In the 2009-2013 planning period, it was estimated that
approximately 63 percent of homes in each income group were owner occupied, and 37 percent
were renter-occupied. However, the 2010 American FactFinder data indicate that in 2010,
approximately 54 percent of housing was owner-occupied and 46 percent was renter occupied.
These percentages are averages only, and do not take into account income levels of owners and
renters. CHAS data for the 2007–2011 period were used to determine the ratio of owner-
occupied to renters for each income type for the current planning period, as shown in Table 5-14.

During the 2009-2013 planning period, Extremely Low, Very Low- and Low-Income groups
represented approximately 29.65 percent (322 units) of new construction need while the
remaining 764 units were allocated to moderate and above-moderate income groups. The
percentage of housing for those in lower income groups decreased markedly from the 47 percent
required in previous planning period. In the current planning period, approximately 38.75
percent (374 units) must be committed to those in lower income groups, of which 54.3 percent
(204) must be for renters.
Since the 2003 Housing Element, the City of Dinuba has added a significant number of new
housing units to its housing stock. However, as the table above illustrates, there will be
continual pressure on the City to better meet the needs of all income levels during the life of the
current plan. This change from the last planning period is at least partially the result of the
changes in the economic conditions in the City, the County, and throughout the State since 2007
when the last RHNA Plan was developed.
Table 5-15 shows the City’s total new housing accomplishments from January 1, 2009 through

accomplished from January 1, 2009 through the last planning period that are owner occupied,
total units that are renter occupied, and exclusively renter occupied multi-family units (that is,

Overall, the City accomplished 51.7 percent of its housing needs, based on the numbers of units
constructed, and not the total number of permits issued in the planning period. In regards to
Extremely Low-, Very Low-, and Low-Income groups, the City accomplished 278 units, or 86
percent of its need, while achieving 37 percent of its Moderate- and Above Moderate Income
need. It should be noted that the total number of units allocated in the last planning period
(1,086) was higher than it had ever been historically, and was based on Department of Finance
predictions of significant growth regionally and throughout the State. Because economic
conditions in the first half of the planning period were worse than predicted and the economy has
been slow to recover, the addition of 561 housing units (and permits for 690 units) through 2013
was in some ways better than expected.
Although the City has homeowner assistance programs available and has provided sufficient land
to meet all of its housing needs, the new housing market and prices of homes dictated the ability
of Extremely Low-, Very Low-, and Low-Income groups to acquire or have available the
housing to meet the allocated need. Renter-occupied units were primarily constructed through a

Table 5-17 shows the dwelling valuations used to categorize the housing units into the varied

In addition to private developer provided new housing unit construction, the City used $874.2
thousand in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to rehabilitate nine single-
family dwellings between 2009 and 2013. The City currently has an additional $500,000 in
CDBG submitted for consideration, of which $250,000 will be for rehabilitation of single family
residential rehabilitation.

                            20-percent down payment, a 30-year mortgage, and an average
                            4.36% interest rate. They also assume that the household does
                            not spend more than 30% of its income on housing.
During the last planning period, interest rates varied from a high of slightly over 5.0 percent in
2010 to a low of 3.54 percent in 2013. Median house prices for all homes types (single-family,
duplex, condo, etc.) varied from a high of $239,000 in 2009 to a low of $120,000 in 2010, with
the median for single-family homes averaging $152,000 over the planning period.
Unemployment levels were highest when home prices were high, and very few new building
permits for single-family homes were issued during that time. As the economy slowly recovered
and unemployment rates lowered, interest rates for home mortgages remained lower than in the
previous the planning period and home prices went down. Therefore, homes became
significantly more affordable during 2013 and 2014 than they were earlier in the planning period.
Using the information from Table 5-17, a household with a moderate income would have been
able to afford a house from $150,801 to $180,800, which would be well within the median house
price of $152,000.
In the period from 2009 through 2014, Dinuba residents received permits for 690 housing units,
with 561 units constructed over the period. This was an average of 115 units per year, although
the actual number of permits ranged from 24 in 2014 to a high of 302 in 2010. Except for two
permits for a total of 102 apartment units, and two permits for second units, all permits were for
single family homes.
In comparison, Dinuba realized an average of approximately 99.5 new housing units (72.1
single-family and 27.4 multi-family) per year between 2001-2008. Within that timeframe
between 2003-2007, Dinuba realized a higher average of approximately 112.8 new housing units

(80.3 single-family and 30.5 multi-family per year) new housing units, with a boon year of 247
units (166 single-family and 81 multi-family) in 2006.
Regardless of the on-going financial and new housing markets conditions, the City could not
sustain an average of 181 new housing units per year that would have been needed to meet the
new construction need identified in the 2009-2013 timeline. It is the City’s belief that
consistently high unemployment levels, low salary jobs, the range of housing types and costs
marketed by homebuilders, homebuilders reluctance to develop lower end or entry level housing,
and doubts in the financing and housing markets, did not provide enough incentive to developers
of low-income housing for the City to meets its RHNA. The difference between the projected
new construction need (approximately 181 units/year) and the actual new construction
accomplished (approximately 112 units/per year) was an additional 69 units per year. Table 5-
18 shows the 2009-2013 housing needs compared with and units actually constructed during that
period by total units, owner-occupied units, and renter-occupied units. As can be seen, the City
constructed more owner-built units for low-income households than was required by the 2003
RHNA, but did not build the number of renter-occupied units for any income level that were
estimated in the 2003 RHNA.

5.4     Housing Needs Assessment Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low-income is defined as households with income less than 30 percent of area median
income. The area median income for the Dinuba is $54,700 for a household of four. For
extremely low-income households, this results in an income of $16,410 or less for a four person
household. Households with extremely low-income include a variety of housing situations and
needs. For example, most families and individuals receiving public assistance, such as social
security insurance (SSI) or disability insurance are considered extremely low-income
households. Table 5-19 shows the Housing Needs for Extremely Low-Income Households in
Dinuba.

Existing Needs
These percentages increased approximately by 10 to 20 in each category included in Table 5-19
compared to the last planning period, except that owners with “Any Housing Problems” dropped
approximately 10 percent. As further indication that those in the extremely low-income group
struggle with adequate housing, 83.8 percent of ELI households had a cost burden of over 30
percent of income, but only 2.0 percent of renters and 19.2 percent of owners who have median
incomes or greater overpaid for housing. However, the percentage of owners in all income
groups who overpay for housing increased significantly from the last planning period. This is
due, at least in part, to the fact that many people purchased homes during the years when home
values were high. Since that time, the homes have lost value, but the home owners have not
increased their incomes proportionately, resulting in high mortgage payments.
In 2010, approximately 800 extremely low-income households resided in Dinuba, representing
nearly 25 percent of the total households, an increase from 15 percent of total households in the
2009 to 2013 planning period. Of this income group, most (67 percent) are renters and
experience a high incidence of housing problems. For example, 83.8 percent of extremely low-
income households faced housing problems (defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of
income and/or overcrowding without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities) and 83.8 percent
were in overpayment situations. Even further, 73.1 percent of extremely low-income households
paid more than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs, compared to 20.4 percent for all
households.
Projected Needs
To calculate the projected housing needs, the City assumed 50 percent of its very low-income
regional housing needs are extremely low-income households. As a result, from the very low-
income need of 211 units, Dinuba has a projected need of 105 units for extremely low-income
households. Many extremely low-income households will be seeking rental housing and most
likely facing overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing conditions. Some extremely
low-income households could be with mental or other disabilities, the elderly, farm workers, and
other special needs groups.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
To address the range of needs, the City of Dinuba will continue to:
      Work with developers on urban in-fill, mixed use, and higher density projects that will
         provide extremely low and low-income rental housing opportunities,
      Update its maps showing all vacant land with the potential to accommodate infill housing
         to accommodate extremely low and low-income groups,
      Encourage developers to make application for HUD Housing Choice Voucher Program –
         New Construction allocations and will work with and assist those developers,
      Continue to endorse the use of bonds such as those issued in conjunction with the
         California Tax Credit Allocation Committee,
      Take all actions necessary to expedite processing and approvals for such projects, and
      Will make available fee credits and density bonuses for developers agreeing to provide
         lower-income housing.
Although the City has more than sufficient land available for housing of all income groups, the
City will amend the 2007 General Plan or other applicable Specific Plans as needed to ensure
that sufficient land is provided to meet future multi-family residential needs through the planning
period.
5.5     At-Risk Units
The California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) has identified one assisted multi-family
projects as being at-risk for conversion to market-rate housing (Garden Estates). Table 5-20 lists
these projects. These data demonstrate that, with the exception of the one project, the City is not
at risk of losing any other of its affordable multi-family units within the 2015-2023 planning
period. Since the beginning of the 2009 Housing Element planning period, the City has realized a
growth of 48 additional low rent units for a total of 559 units (an increase of 9.4 percent). The
contract for Parkside Village was renewed in December 2003, and is now valid through 2035.
The Grace & Laughter complex, which provides senior-only housing, renewed its contract in
October 2003 through 2033. Another lower income apartment complex with a total of 44 units,
Dinuba Village Apartments, is at the permitting stage. According to the property management
company that oversees Garden Estates, its current Community Housing Voucher Program
contract was entered into in 1987 for a 30-year term.
The City understands that economic climates may affect the future availability of Community
Housing Voucher Program and similar projects. The City will continue to work closely with
agencies such as Self-Help Enterprises, the Central Valley Coalition for Affordable Housing, and
others to monitor the status of assisted projects and ensure that at-risk units are preserved.
Currently, the Public Works Department, using Building and Transit Center staff monitors at-risk
units.
In order to provide a cost analysis of preserving at-risk units, costs must be determined for
rehabilitation, new construction or tenant-based rental assistance.

1) Rehabilitation– The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving low income
housing include: acquisition, rehabilitation and financing. Actual acquisition costs depend on
several variables such as condition, size, location, existing financing and availability of financing
(governmental and market). Although the City does not have an example of rehabilitating at-risk
multi-family units, it is our belief that rehabilitation of existing units instead of new construction
is the most cost effective approach toward the preservation of at-risk units. It should be noted
however, that at-risk units may also be preserved through tenant-based rental assistance.
2) New Construction/Replacement – New construction implies construction of a new property
with the same number of units and similar amenities as the one removed from the affordable
housing stock. Cost estimates were prepared by using local information and data. The
construction of new housing can vary greatly depend on factors such as location, density, unit
sizes, construction materials and on-site and off-site improvements. A typical garden style
apartment in the City of Dinuba constructed in 2015 on a 5.0 acre site with 80 units would have a
total project cost of approximately $15,180,000 (including land acquisitions, construction,
financing, etc.) resulting in a cost of approximately $189,750 per unit. Over a 30-year period,
this results in an annual cost of approximately $6,326 or about $527 per month (Note: this figure
is not adjusted for inflation). The typical rent for a two-bedroom unit at this complex is $695 per
month.
3) Tenant-based Rental Assistance – This type of preservation largely depends on the income of
the family, the shelter costs of the apartment and the number of years the assistance is provided.
A typical family that requires rental assistance based on income limits 50 percent to 60 percent
of the AMI would result in a maximum of monthly payment of $740 for a 2-bedroom unit. The
difference between the $695 and the typical market-based rent for a two bedroom apartment of
$740 is $45 a month, so that the remaining amount would go toward utilities. Providing tenant-
based rental assistance is estimated at approximately $3 million for a 30-year period. To address

at-risk units, the City will add a program to monitor these units, ensure compliance with noticing
requirements, establish partnerships with entities qualified to acquire and manage at-risk units to
have staff and action plan ready to move forward upon notice of conversion, and provide
assistance and education to tenants (see Chapter 9 for Action). Further, the City of Dinuba is
strongly committed to the preservation of affordable housing units and therefore has identified
the following resources in an effort to save such at-risk units.
Efforts by the City to retain low-income housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of
preservation resources: organizational and financial. Qualified, non-profit entities need to be
made aware of the future possibilities of units becoming at risk. Groups with whom the City has
an ongoing association are the logical entities for future participation. According to information
provided by State HCD, Self-Help Enterprises which is local, regional, national entities, may be
interested in acquiring and managing at-risk units in Dinuba.
Strategies to Retain Affordable Units
The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the City’s overall
financial plan to deal with retaining affordable units. The number and availability of programs to
assist cities and counties in increasing and improving their affordable housing stock is limited
and public funding for new projects is unpredictable. The following programs are local, State and
federal programs. Some are managed locally by the City through funds accessed directly from
HUD.
        1) HOME Program: This Program was created under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzales
        National Affordable Housing Act enacted on November 28, 1990. For Dinuba, HOME
        funds are made available on an annual, competitive basis through HCD’s HOME
        Investment Partnerships Program. Approximately $500,000 or more is available to
        develop and support affordable multi-family rental housing, owner-occupied housing
        rehabilitation, and home ownership affordability. Dinuba uses HOME funds primarily
        for first-time homebuyers (down payment assistance), owner-occupied rehabilitation and
        rental-rehabilitation. The City has also done some multi-family acquisition/rehabilitation.
        2) Tulare County Housing Authority (TCHA) — The TCHA administers two programs:
        a) Conventional Housing or Low Rent Public Housing and, b) Section 8 Certificate and
        Voucher Program. The Conventional Housing Program includes housing developments
        that are managed and maintained by TCHA. The Section 8 Certificate Program is a
        tenant-based rental subsidy administered by TCHA. Qualified families are selected and
        certified from a waiting list. The qualified family can utilize the Certificate for any
        “decent, safe and sanitary housing.” The tenant’s portion of the rent is based on 30
        percent of the adjusted family gross income. TCHA subsidizes the difference between the
        tenant’s portion and the rent. The actual rent is restricted by Fair Market Rents (FMR), as
        determined by HUD. The Section 8 Voucher Program is basically the same as the
        Certificate Program, except the tenant’s housing choice is not restricted by the Fair
        Market Rents.
        .
        3) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds - The City is considered a non-
        entitlement city, as it has a population of under 50,000, a criterion defined by HUD for

        agencies seeking assistance with CDBG funds. The City received approximately
        $540,541 from the State administered HUD funds in 2012. Dinuba utilizes CDBG funds
        for rental and owner housing rehabilitation activities, infrastructure, public facilities and
        public services. Proceeds from those activities are deposited into a revolving loan fund
        established from low interest loans for rehabilitation and could be a resource for
        preservation activities.
        4) Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) - Federal law requires that Banks, Savings and
        Loans, Thrifts, and their affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries, annually evaluate the credit
        needs for public projects in communities where they operate. The City knows of no CRA
        Act fund availability. Although an unpredictable resource, it is important to establish a
        working relationship for future problem solving.
        6) Low-income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) - This program provides for
        federal and State tax credits for private developers and investors who agree to set aside
        all or an established percentage of their rental units for low-income households for no
        less than 30 years. Tax credits may also utilized on rehabilitation projects, contributing to
        the preservation program.
5.6     Analysis of Overpayment
The United States Census Bureau defines overpayment as a household that pays more than thirty
percent of its gross income for housing costs. Table 5-21 outlines the number and percent of
income by households used to pay for owner and renter-occupied housing, and Table 5-22
contains a subset applying to low-income households that are overpaying for owner and renter-
occupied housing while Table 5-23 shows housing problems for all households as contained in
the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) Data Book prepared by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The 2010 Census indicates that overpayment remains a critical problem for low and moderate-
income households, who are disproportionately affected by this burden compared to other
households. Affordability problems occur when housing costs become so high in relation to
income that households have to pay an excessive proportion of their income for housing, or are
unable to afford any housing and are homeless. Housing overpayment refers to spending more
than 30 percent of income on housing; severe overpayment is spending greater than 50 percent.
The prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by income, tenure, household type, and
household size. The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) provides detailed
information on housing needs by income level for different types of households. Detailed Census
and/or CHAS data based on the 2010 Census is displayed in the Tables 5-24 through 5-26,
below. In 2010, 43.7 percent of all households overpaid for housing with significant proportions
of renter households, 57.1 percent, overpaying. These are significant increases from the 2003 –
2008 planning period, when 31.8 percent of all households and 35.7 percent of rental households
were overpaying.

slightly differ for other U.S. Census estimates for Total Households.
As indicated on Table 5-21, Housing Cost as a percentage of household income, nearly 26
percent of households have annual incomes of less than $20,000. If a renter paid $525 per month
for rent, this would result in payment of nearly 31 percent of income for housing, without
including the costs for utilities. The overpayment rate is 41.7 percent for a rent of $695 per
month and 48.0 percent for a rent of $800 per month.
According to the CHAS data, Of the 3,185 households overpaying in the City (in the 2007-2011
period), 1,105 households or 34.7 percent were severely overpaying (that is, paying more than 50
percent of income for housing), and another 2,425 or 76.1 percent were paying at least 30
percent of income for housing. In total those overpaying were 58.7 percent of all households in
the City.

The 2010 CHAS data indicate that there were a total of 5,425 households in Dinuba. Of those, a
total of 800 were households earning less than 30 percent of the MFI, 765 earned between 30 and
50 percent of the MFI, and 1,135 earned between 50 and 80 percent of the MFI. The remaining
2,735 households earned at least 80 percent of MFI. Of the 2,700 households that had an MFI of
no more than 80 percent, the lower the income, the more likely that the household was to have at
least one of four housing problems, including incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing
facilities, more than one person per room or a cost burden greater than 30 percent.
Of the renters earning less than 30 percent MFI, approximately 92.5 percent had a cost burden
greater than 30 percent, while approximately two-thirds of home owners in this income bracket
had similar cost burdens.

 As shown on Table 5-27, the median home values in Dinuba have risen since 2000, but have
 decreased significantly over the high values in 2006. Dinuba’s values are currently greater than
 in Selma, and lower than in Reedley. Home values rose over 200 percent from 2000 to 2006,
 and declined from 2006 to 2014 by over 120 percent. Local housing values have not risen as
 dramatically as the nearby cities of Reedley (about 5 miles northeast) and Selma (about 12 miles
 west), but nonetheless they more than doubled between 2000 and 2007 and tripled between 1990
 and 2007.

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
These data indicate that, while in general a significant percentage of all households are
overpaying for housing, the problem is particularly evident among low-income households. This
is particularly burdensome on these households as it greatly reduces the amount of disposable
income remaining to purchase other necessities. Possible solutions to this cycle include
increasing the number of housing units made available to this segment of the population and
taking steps to increase qualifying households of that availability. Due to this constant need for
affordable housing, as evidenced by waiting lists maintained by local realtors, lower-income
housing units in Dinuba are typically sold, rented, or otherwise accounted for prior to completion
of construction.
To address overpayment, the City of Dinuba will pursue a variety of programs to expand
affordability. With a strong prevalence of overpayment in 2-to-4 person and large family renter
households, the City will focus available funding on new construction of multi-family units for
families and leverage these resources with existing State resources. Concurrently, the City of
Dinuba will continue its down payment assistance and single-family rehabilitation programs to
help address overpayment in owner households (see Chapter 9 for specific programs).
5.7      Energy Conservation Opportunities
The City has promoted energy conservation for residential uses on both educational and
regulatory levels. The City has included a number of programs to encourage construction of
energy efficient housing, water and energy conservation, and energy-reducing efforts, such as
weatherization of existing homes. Additionally, other elements of the City’s General Plan
include policies to encourage mixed use and infill development; increased density; dedication of
open space; alternative transportation including walking and bicycling; use of shade trees and
other plantings; placement of structures with respect to solar access; and other means to improve
air quality and promote energy savings. The City plans to provide information at the
Development and Engineering Services Department and on the City’s website to support
programs that promote residential energy conservation for both new construction and existing
residences in Dinuba.
On a regulatory level, the City enforces the State Energy Conservation Standards (Title 24,
California Administrative Code). These building codes provide a great deal of flexibility for
individual builders to achieve a minimum “energy budget” through the use of various
performance standards. These requirements now apply to all new residential construction as well
as all remodeling and rehabilitation construction. Subdivision and site plan review regulations or
policies that required compliance with specific energy conservation standards have not been
adopted by the City.
Establishment and enforcement of energy and water conservation standards and continuing
programs aimed at efficiency awareness are key factors in reducing energy and water
consumption. In addition to required compliance with the Building Code and Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations (C.C.R.) relating to energy conservation, the City sets forth goals
and policies which encourage the conservation of nonrenewable resources in concert with the use
of alternative energy sources to increase energy self-sufficiency. Some conservation measures
require a higher up-front cost, but result in net savings, over the life of the measures by reducing
energy and/or water consumption. In large part, utility bill reductions through energy and water

Chapter 5 Housing Needs
savings can be realized through design incorporating energy conservation features. Energy
conservation is, in effect, a resource to enhance the affordability of dwelling units.
“Smart growth” generally refers to development and planning standards that promote
consolidation of services, convenient location of recreation and commercial facilities (“walk-
ability”), and “new-urbanism,” which is essentially a return to planning principles from the mid-
20th century. These principles include narrow residential streets that may or may not provide on-
street parking, reduced front setbacks, parking at the rear of buildings (primarily off of alleys),
shared parks or common areas, wide sidewalks, and traditional architecture. The City’s 2007
General Plan includes an Urban Design Element which incorporates many of these concepts. The
City will consider revising its Zoning Ordinance to provide for “smart growth,” including
incentives and housing density bonuses adequate to meet housing needs for Target Income
Group households if the goals, objectives and policies contained in the 2007 General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance Amendments are not realized. Chapter 9, Five-Year Action Plan, includes,
Provision of Adequate Sites for Housing Development Actions that will allow least one site
zoned either R-M 2 or R-M 1.5 with a minimum 6,300 square feet site to accommodate new
multiple-family residential development to meet the Extremely low and Very low- income
housing needs determined in the RHNA. Candidate sites that are currently vacant and would be
eligible for the 10 percent area reduction are identified in this section.
The City will support public education programs that promote residential energy conservation
and public awareness; continue to enforce building code regulations (Title 24, California
Administrative Code) that require compliance with residential energy conservation measures for
all new construction, remodeling, and rehabilitation; and strongly encourage the use of U.S.
Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED® Programs and Services to promote residential
development that is environmentally responsible, profitable and promote healthier places to live.
Among the techniques used to achieve energy efficiency and conservation are window glazing,
landscaping, building design, cooling and heating systems, weatherization techniques (such as
insulation, caulking, and weather-stripping), energy efficient appliances, and efficient use of
lighting through the use of fluorescent bulb fixtures instead of incandescent bulbs in average
fixtures.
Additionally, the General Plan was updated in 2007 and included policies to the Circulation and
other Elements intended to address SB 375, Government Code § 65302.1, and other state
requirements for improving air quality. The Housing Element is consistent with these, and all
other policies, programs, objectives, and goals found throughout the General Plan.

                              RESIDENTIAL LAND RESOURCES
In order to properly plan for future housing needs, an inventory of undeveloped lands available
for housing within existing urban boundaries and within projected growth areas must be
completed. Both City and County policies encourage development to occur within incorporated
cities.
6.1       Available Land Inventory within the City Limits
Table 6-1 summarizes the City’s RHNA targets and the total land available to accommodate the
allocated units using “realistic capacity.” Table 6-2 itemizes properties reserved for City
growth. These properties include vacant and underdeveloped lands presently within the City of
Dinuba that are adjacent to or within reasonable distance of public sewer, water, drainage, and
street systems, and that are not currently associated with a proposed or approved residential
project. The City used GIS data based on Tulare County Assessor’s data, which contains layers
for parcels, General Plan designations, Zoning, infrastructure, and aerial photos, to assess the
vacancy and development potential of these properties. A summary list with detailed information
of all vacant and underdeveloped properties within the City is listed as Appendix C.

Based on the information provided in Appendix C, the City of Dinuba has sufficient available
land within the city limits that is currently suitable for residential development with readily
accessible infrastructure to accommodate 4,041 additional residential units, based on realistic
capacity (80 percent of maximum density allowed) as described below. It should be noted that
the density ranges defined in the Zoning Ordinance are less restrictive than those defined in the

City’s General Plan. For example, the Zoning Ordinance allows up to 24 DU/Ac in the RM-2
district. However, in the General Plan, the RM-2 zone may fall within either the “Medium High
Density” area, which allows 7.6 to15 DU/Ac, or within the “High Density” area, which allows
for 15.1 to 24 DU/Ac. Therefore, the maximum densities discussed below and included in Table
6-3 are those ranges allowed by General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance and General Plan densities
are:

Approximately 39.7 acres of multi-family zoned land could accommodate an estimated 501
units, which represents 134.6 percent of the 163 extremely low-, very low-, and low income
groups identified in the RHNA. The 683.6 acres of single-family zoned land could accommodate
an estimated 1,503 units which is over 12 times the number needed for moderate-income
households. Combined, land identified in Table 6-3 could account for about 318 percent of the
965 housing units needed for the extremely low-, very-low, low-, moderate, above moderate-
income groups identified in the RHNA for the planning period. It should also be noted that all
the lands identified in Table 6-2 are not hampered by environmental, topographic, flooding, or
agricultural constraints as they are within the developed urban environment of the City. Further,
the City Council certified an environmental impact report when it approved the comprehensive
2007 General Plan update.

The City reviewed the methods used to determine realistic capacity in the Draft Housing Element
2008 – 2013. Densities were originally calculated based on density of historical development,
also known as “traditional development” rates. However, this method alone was deemed as
inadequate for multi-family zoning as no multiple family housing units were constructed in the
last planning period, and therefore newer programs to encourage higher density development
were not implemented. The City determined that a more accurate realistic capacity could be
estimated as 80 percent of the maximum density allowed in each zoning district. This 80 percent
realistic density is reflected in the estimated number of units for which land is available, shown
in Table 6-1.

City of Dinuba                                                                        November 2015

Chapter 6 Residential Land Resources
These estimates do not incorporate additional incentives to higher density development such as,
allowing increased density for those including lower income housing (density bonus); infill,
utilizing properties with existing utility infrastructure in place; expedited processing and
approvals; and fee credits. As explained in Chapter 5, the City of Dinuba’s Zoning Ordinance
includes incentives, such as a density bonus. Developers can qualify for a density bonus of up to
35 percent additional units, which would not only reduce construction costs, but also provide
more efficient economies of scale when installing infrastructure (i.e., storm water drainage,
potable water, and sanitary sewer systems, along with streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks).
This estimate of realistic capacity does, however, take into consideration the need for land for
other uses, including landscaping, recreation, parking and setbacks. The City has incorporated
policies to review and consider revising parking and setback requirements to further encourage
higher density development. Maximum zoning density and realistic capacity are listed below for
each zoning district. It is not unlikely that, in those cases when a density bonus of up to 35
percent could be applied to a project, it would increase the realistic capacity of that project.
However, because a density bonus cannot be assumed, those figures were calculated separately
from the maximum realistic capacity estimates noted below. All of the areas contained in Table

therefore mitigation measures would not be necessary to develop these areas.

     Appendix C contains information (such as APN, ownership, allowable units per acre, General
     Plan and Zoning information, area, realistic unit capacity, and constraints) regarding all vacant
     and underdeveloped residential properties within the City Limits. Maps showing the site
     locations are included in Appendix C. Also, it should be noted that all properties are serviceable
     with City water and sewer services. Table 6-4 contains a list of approved projects, including
     tentative subdivision maps and upcoming multifamily developments. There are currently 26
     approved or recorded subdivision maps in process totaling 2,195 single-family units and 57
     proposed and/or approved multifamily units. A complete range of new housing types is included
     in the list, ranging from low- to above moderate-income units on 5,400 to 7,500-square-foot lots,
     or larger, to new multifamily units developed through incentives such as tax credits by Self-Help
     Enterprises. All projects have had tentative maps approved by the City Council with 19 of the
     proposed subdivisions still awaiting recordation of a final subdivision map. However, none of
     the approved tentative maps have expired and will still be active through 2015 and could receive
     additional extension of time through the State Legislature, which has approved extensions maps
     for an additional period of times ranging from 12 to 24 months in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013, or
     through discretionary extensions per the Subdivision Map Act.

REMAINING
      Source: City of Dinuba Development and Engineering Services staff, April 2015. * Although the GeneralPlan
      desisgnates the RM-1.5 zone district as “High Density” this subdivision was planned as “Medium Density.”
      There are 25 vacant lots in the Marquis Homes subdivision that are 0.1 acre or smaller in size.
      Homes have been constructed on other lots within this subdivision, and infrastructure has been
      completed throughout. These lots will not be consolidated and are anticipated for single family
      homes. Lots are in the RM-1.5 zone district, and although this is under the General Plan
      designation of “High Density,” the subdivision was planned as “Medium density.”
      Manufactured homes on a permanent foundation and second units are permitted with an
      administrative site plan in this zone district.
      During the approval process, each residential subdivision development proposal is required to
      connect to either available or readily accessible sanitary sewer, potable water, and storm water
      drainage facilities. The City requires all development to “pay as you go” as it does not have the
      resources to provide extensions of the infrastructure noted above. A more detailed explanation of
      improvements, fees, and other project related requirements is provided in Chapter 7, Constraints.
      Also, during the Planning Commission and City Council review/approval process, each of the
      proposed residential developments was evaluated for and determined to comply with the
      California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Therefore any environmental impacts that were
      identified during the City’s review and approval process have been assigned appropriate
      mitigation, where appropriate. The City’s 2007 General Plan contains many policies that
      encourage walkable communities, pedestrian facilities (such as paseos at cul-de-sacs to minimize
      walking distances to services), transit and biking facilities. The developments noted in Table 6-4
      were reviewed for consistency with these amenities and all included some, if not all, of these
      features. One feature that is difficult to accommodate is proximity to large employers. Due to the
      agricultural and industrial nature of these businesses, most of Dinuba’s largest employers are
      located in the north or southwest quadrants of the community. However, Dinuba’s transit system
      provides service to those worksites, bicycling to work is an option, and many newer
      developments are still within one mile of those worksites.
      Development of vacant, bypassed lands within the City’s jurisdiction is encouraged in order to
      protect against premature conversion of agricultural lands and provide greater utilization of

existing infrastructure. In order to encourage development of bypassed remnant parcels, the City
will consider higher densities given certain locational criteria and in circumstances when
development will not have significant adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Such criteria may
include properties that are contiguous to other higher density residential areas or other intensive
non-residential development, or properties that have a size and/or shape that makes it difficult to
be developed in a manner similar to other surrounding properties.
It is important to note that within the City core, there are no residential lots that are of sufficient
size to subdivide. A major source of increased density could be utilization of a Planning Unit
Development (PUD). A PUD requires discretionary approval by the Dinuba Planning
Commission which would allow residents an opportunity to participate in the decision-making
process for this type of project that has greater density than the existing neighborhood. There is
also the potential for developers to purchase vacant properties and construct homes for lower-
income households. In these instances, the City can work with the developers to mitigate
development and impact fees, possibly through the use of fee credits. As the downtown area
further develops, the City will investigate the feasibility of soliciting developers for residential
redevelopment to augment the growing commercial aspect of that area.
Additional density may also be accommodated through existing residentially zoned properties by
the allowance of secondary residential units. Secondary units are already permitted under the
City Municipal Code. Any resident may construct a secondary unit with obtainment of a
building permit and compliance with the development standards outlined in Dinuba Municipal
Code, Chapter 17.70.024. If all setbacks and floor area ratios are met, which is typical of all
development, the only constraint is the ability of the property owner to extend the appropriate
utilities (water and sewer service) to the proposed secondary unit. No other entitlements or
review by the Planning Commission or City Council is required for a secondary dwelling.
6.2      Mixed-Use in the Central District
Chapter 17.61 of the Dinuba Zoning Ordinance contains provisions for mixed-use (residential
over commercial) within the City’s C-2 (Downtown Commercial) zoning district. The Mixed-
Use Overlay District permits up to 24.0 dwelling units per acre as second- and third-story uses
above downtown businesses. Residents and business owners have not taken advantage of the
Overlay District. Much of this may be attributed to the expense of seismic retrofitting of the
largely brick-and-mortar structures that dominate the downtown area. No mixed use has occurred
since 2009, although the business community has continued to rehabilitate some existing
structures for use as restaurants, convenience stores, and similar uses, and an outdoor soccer field
has been installed. Although likely to develop gradually, the 32.5 acres of Downtown
Commercial could support more than 700 mixed-use residential units, most likely falling within
the low- and very low-income ranges. Their central location could reduce residents’ dependency
on driving to work, thus reducing living expenses and making the units suitable for lower-
income or elderly households. In addition, this option would reduce vehicle trips, thus reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in support of AB 32 and SB 375. There are very few vacant, non-
residential sites that would be considered suitable for residential uses. The City has been very
deliberate in designating land uses and zoning commensurate to adjacent planned and existing
uses. A careful balance has been achieved by adhering to the land use patterns adopted in
previous and existing City’s general plan land use maps and zoning maps. If requested, the City

would entertain any proposal that would require a General Plan amendment, change of zone, or
conditional use permit to accommodate viable residential development.
6.3      Unincorporated Lands Designated for Residential Development within the Sphere
         of Influence
In October 2008, the City adopted a comprehensive update to its General Plan, including the
Land Use Element, which designated lands within the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI). These
lands, outside the current City Limits, are intended to be annexed by the City as demand
warrants. Prior to annexation, parcels are pre-zoned consistent with the General Plan
designation.
Between 2003 and 2008, the City of Dinuba responded to developer requests to undertake an
extensive annexation process to provide developable lands that were previously outside the
City’s limits. Approximately 1,000 acres were annexed into the City exclusively to provide land
for commercial and residential development.. Many tentative and/or final subdivision maps were
approved during this timeframe resulting in the availability of approximately 2,000 potential new
single-residences. Since 2008, no new lands have been annexed to the City; therefore, no new
units have been constructed within the previous planning period to lands that were previous in
the County that were not previously discussed in the 2009-2013 planning period. Consequently,
it is the City’s belief that there is an abundance of developable residentially zoned land that will
remain available when the financing and housing markets recover and once again become active
in the community.
Development potential can be determined based upon the average allowable density of each
residential designation. Low-, Medium-Low-, Medium-, Medium High-, and High-density
residential will ultimately translate into densities of approximately 2.0, 6.0, 7.25, 15.0, and up to
24.0 dwelling units per acre; respectively.
Table 6-5 estimates the holding capacity of unincorporated, undeveloped land within the City’s
SOI that is designated for residential use by the Dinuba General Plan and the corresponding
zoning classification. This table is included for informational purposes only, because the City has
sufficient land for development, and therefore does not need to include the areas outside the city
limits. As these areas are not within the City’s jurisdiction, the City is using “pre-zoning” to
declare its intent upon annexation into the City’s jurisdiction. The “Zoning” column in Table 6-5
indicates the proposed zoning classification. Since all of these sites are outside of the City’s
jurisdiction, water, sewer, and storm water drainage facilities are not available and would have to
be installed at the time of construction at the expense of the developer.

The estimates contained in Table 6-5 assume some parcels will be consolidated prior to
development to allow the maximum potential of units for the residential designation in which
they will be located. Prior to annexation into the City, these areas will receive their specific pre-
zone classification and upon annexation will be subject to the particular zone’s requirements.
Until such time, there is always the possibility that some land use designations and/or zoning
classifications may change. However, as of this writing, the estimates contained in Table 6-5 are
consistent with the Dinuba General Land Use designations and Zoning Map.
6.4     Total Residential Capacities
Table 6-6 shows the total estimated holding capacity for Dinuba based upon vacant
residentially-zoned land in the City Limits and land planned for residential development that is
outside of the city limits but within the City’s Sphere of Influence (based upon land use and
zoning designations contained in the Dinuba General Plan and Zoning Maps). The table shows
the development potential for each dwelling type based on existing zoning or anticipated future
zoning. Information regarding approved and tentative residential developments can be found in
Table 6-4.

                     the 2007 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, Tulare County GIS.
            * “Realistic” is defined as 80% of undeveloped land will accommodate buildings and
                yards with the remaining 20% dedicated to public rights of way (e.g., streets, curbs
                gutters, sidewalks, etc.)
At an average household size of 3.72 persons, these units could accommodate an estimated
population of 43,345 persons during the 20-year life of the 2007 General Plan. It is noted that
although condominium units are considered a basic housing style, a specific zoning district has
not been established for their construction. They are permitted, however, within areas zoned for
single-family or multifamily residential use.
6.5     Availability of Public Facilities
City policies require that community sewer, water, stormwater, and adequate street facilities be
provided by all new development. Government Code also requires that utility services be
available for lower income housing. Extension of existing facilities can usually be
accommodated, and much of this infrastructure presently exists or is within 600 feet of most
vacant lands. Currently, the City’s Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WWRF) has sufficient
capacity to meet the City’s needs through 2030. Expansion of treatment capacity of the WWRF
by replacing obsolete equipment with modern equipment and improving the way wastewater is
treated is planned to serve anticipated growth through 2030. No expansion of the facility
occurred in the last planning period.
The Dinuba water system includes two elevated and one ground-level storage tanks, one of
225,000 gallons, one of 1,000,000 gallons, another of 2,000,000 gallons, and a water distribution
system. Water is supplied by nine active wells. The system has a capacity of approximately
11,000,000 gallons per day (7,600 GPM), and average daily demand is 4,200,000 gallons per day
(or 2,900 GPM). A Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SDWSRF) Loan was secured in
2005 through the Department of Water Resources in the amount of approximately $6,200,000,
which was used for construction of two additional wells, a 2,000,000 gallon reservoir and
booster pump, construction of new and replacement mains, and numerous other water system
improvements since 2003.
6.6     Suitability of Sites
With very few exceptions, all of the sites identified are suitable for development. As with many
small Valley cities, the most recurring obstacle to development of lands such as these is the
presence of agriculture. Within the City limits, most current agriculture consists of vineyards or
deciduous fruit trees. With the exception of two properties, the sites identified in the land
inventory are not currently within Williamson Act Preserves or Farmland Security Zones.
Outside the City Limits and Sphere of Influence, many properties that are on the unincorporated
fringe are under Williamson Contracts or in Non-Renewal.
The topography in Dinuba is generally flat, sloping approximately seven feet per mile from
northeast to southwest. There are no wetlands or other protected areas within Dinuba, and only
historical instances of endangered or threatened species. The nearest natural waterway is the
Kings River, which flows northeast-southwest approximately two-and-a-half miles west of
Dinuba city limits near the Ridge Creek Dinuba Golf Course. A large portion of the area within

City of Dinuba                                                                    November 2015
2015 – 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                      Page 6-10
Chapter 6 Residential Land Resources
the City’s Sphere of Influence is within a floodplain. To minimize or eliminate potential
drainage from flooding, all new development must be elevated above base flood levels. The City
participates in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Also, the City of Dinuba jointly constructed a regional stormwater detention and groundwater
recharge facility with Alta Irrigation District in the southwest quadrant of the City to provide
space for storm water flows to be detained and to replenish groundwater supplies. This facility is
approximately 35.0 acres in area and was completed in December 10, 2010.
To a lesser extent, availability and proximity of public utilities are of concern. As mentioned,
the City has received loans and grants that help to provide new services and improve existing
services. Typically, it is a developer’s responsibility to extend services to the property under
development. This works well as a tool to reduce sprawl and leap-frog development, as it is in
developers’ best interests to build adjacent to existing development. While many of the vacant
properties are of substandard size for their zoning district, variances or minor deviations from
code provide modified development standards to facilitate development of otherwise unusable
land.
6.7      Quantified Objectives
Based upon past results and anticipated build-out of current proposed and approved projects, the
City has determined an approximation of the maximum number of housing units that can be built
during the upcoming planning period as illustrated in Table 6-7. In the last planning period 561
units were constructed. As noted earlier, the housing construction slump hampered the City’s
ability to achieve the 1,086 units then comprising Dinuba’s Fair Share of Regional Housing
Needs. The RHNA has identified Dinuba’s Fair Share as 965 new housing units during the 2015-
2023 planning period. As noted in Table 6-4, the City has land available for construction of up
to 4,041 new housing units during the 2015-2023 planning period. As of the drafting of this
document, 44 new lower-income, multi-housing units are planned for construction, and 26
permits for single family units had been issued through May 2015. The construction of housing
coupled with the potential moderate and above-moderate housing construction allowed within
the existing General Plan should provide the City with enough housing to satisfy its Regional
Housing Needs Allocation, and sufficient variety to make quality housing available to all
segments of the community.

6.8     Rehabilitation
The City will continue to seek funding for rehabilitation of both single and multi-family housing
through CDBG, HOME and other sources. In May 2015 the City had $250,000 in CDBG
monies set aside for rehabilitation of single family homes.

                               DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
Local ordinances and policies are enacted to protect the health and safety of citizens and further
the general welfare. As part of this update to the Housing Element, the City will examine local
ordinances/policies to determine whether, under current conditions, they are accomplishing their
intended purpose or if in practice constitute a barrier to the maintenance, improvement or
development of housing for all income levels. Such an examination is important as it may reveal
that certain policies have a disproportionate or negative impact on the development of particular
housing types (e.g., multifamily) or on housing developed for low- or moderate-income
households. Ordinances, policies or practices which have the effect of excluding housing
affordable to low- and moderate-income households and may also violate state and federal fair
housing laws that prohibit land-use requirements that discriminate or have the effect of
discriminating against affordable housing. A number of factors affect the ability of the private
sector to respond to the demand for housing. Development constraints fall into two basic
categories: governmental and non-governmental.
7.1      Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints are policies, standards, or actions imposed by various levels of
government on development. Although federal and state programs and agencies play a role, they
are beyond the influence of local government. Conditions applied to residential development in
the City of Dinuba focus on public health and safety. Potential local governmental constraints
are discussed below.
Land Use Controls
Land use controls are minimum standards within the City’s Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances.
Zoning regulations control such features as height and square footage of buildings, lot area, yard
setbacks, population density, and building use. If zoning standards are too rigid and do not allow
land use flexibility, development costs can increase and/or unintended discrimination can result.
The Subdivision Ordinance governs the process of converting raw land into building sites. For
the purpose of this discussion, the emphasis is on residential subdivisions. It allows the City to
control the internal design of each new subdivision so that its pattern of streets, lots, and public
utilities will be safe and economical to maintain. Overly restrictive standards result in greater
land development costs and/or lack of development interest.
Among the existing residential provisions in the City of Dinuba Zoning Ordinance are:
Density Bonus
Per Government Code Section 65915-65918, a density bonus is an incentive provided to
developers who agree to include at least some units for lower-income or senior households. This
incentive allows a higher density than is otherwise permitted in a residential zone. Developers
may qualify for a density bonus when they agree to construct a housing development for a

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
minimum of five units that contain at least one of the following: A) 10 percent of the total units
are for lower-income households; B) five percent of the units are for very low-income
households; C) a senior citizen housing development or mobile home park; or D) 10 percent of
the units in a common interest development for moderate-income households, provided that all
the units in the development are offered to the public for purchase. A density bonus can range
from 20 percent to 35 percent, depending on the number of units included in the development.
Additionally, when an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential
development donates land to the City, he/she is entitled to a 15 percent density bonus to be added
to other density bonus incentives, up to a maximum of 35 percent. The density bonus may also
apply when the project is the substantial rehabilitation and conversion of a commercial building
to residential use.
RA Residential Acreage Zone
This zone sets a minimum size of one-half acre per lot. Public improvement standards,
particularly those relating to street improvements, may vary in the RA zone compared to the
other residential zoning districts. Subject to conditional use review, horses are permitted in the
RA zone. This zone is intended for “estate” sized residential development and is more suitable in
accommodating above average income groups or areas recently annexed into the City that do not
meet requirements for development for affordable housing because of a lack of urban services
such as sanitary sewer, potable water, and storm water drainage facilities. The RA zone housing
density ranges from 0-2.0 units/gross acre.
R Single-Family Zone
Within the zone, lots may vary in size from 6,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet. The
minimum size is based upon the sub-zoning of the property, R-1-6, R-1-7.5, or R-1-10. Lots
have front setbacks averaging 25 feet, side setbacks of five to ten feet, and rear setbacks of 20
feet. Provided that these requirements can be met, secondary residential units are permitted in all
R zones. Typically, the larger the lot, the larger or greater footage each residential unit can be
developed. The R-1-6 zone has a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet with densities ranging
from 4.6 to 7.5 units/gross acre. The City encourages all new developers to consider taking
advantage of the housing density bonus allowed by the Subdivision Map Act. In the R-1-6 zone,
this would allow a minimum lot size of 5,400 square feet. These smaller lots typically
accommodate smaller homes thus they are better suited to first time home buyers, lower income
groups, “down-sizing” buyers (such as “empty-nesters”), and possibly, special needs groups.
The R-1-7.5 zone has a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet and similar to the R-1-6 zone, the
City encourages all new developers to consider taking advantage of the housing density bonus.
This would allow a minimum lot size of 6,750 square feet in the R-1-7.5 zone. Densities in the
R-1-7.5 zone range from 2.1 to 7.5 units/gross acre. These lots are suited to first time home
buyers with low, moderate, and above moderate incomes, “move-up” buyers, and possibly
special needs groups.
The R-1-10 zone has a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet which can be reduced to 9,000
square feet with a density bonus. These lots are suited for moderate and above moderate incomes
groups and “move-up” buyers. Densities in the R-1-10 zone are 2.1 to 4.5 units/gross acre. In

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
addition to the 10 percent housing density bonus, developers have the option of still greater
densities if they receive a conditional use permit for their project to develop under the
requirements of the City’s Planned Unit Development (PUD) standards. The following density
bonuses are allowed in PUDs:

Second-Unit Ordinance
Since 1993, the City has had a Second Unit Ordinance in effect and complies with Government
Code section 65852.2. This ordinance contains guidelines for residents who wish to construct a
second-unit on their property. In accordance with State law, these applications are reviewed
ministerially, and approved at the staff level. The ordinance set forth criteria for the application
of second units including the definition of a second-unit, the maximum allowable square footage,
and the development standards for these units. Criteria for second units include:
        No more than one additional dwelling unit is allowed on any one legal lot or parcel;
        The second unit may be a manufactured home;
        The total floor area of the second-unit can not exceed the area of the primary residence or
         1,200 square feet;
        Second units must conform to yard requirements of the zoning district applicable to
         primary residence;
        The second dwelling unit shall incorporate the same or similar architectural features as
         the primary residence; and
        One on-street parking space (carport on the minimum) is required for a second unit; the
         carport may be built on an area normally used as a side or rear yard.
RM Multifamily Zone
Within this zone, densities of up to 24 units per acre are permitted. Again, this zoning district
contains sub-categories, RM-1.5, RM-2, and RM-3. Development densities in the RM zones
vary between one unit per 1,500 square feet of gross lot size to one unit per 3,000 square feet of
lot size. The RM zones require 350 square feet of open or community space per unit, as well as
recreation facilities such as a swimming pool, children’s play areas, and outdoor barbeque
facilities. Parking requirements vary from 1.5 spaces per unit for a studio apartment (no
bedroom), to 2 spaces for a one-bedroom, and 2 spaces for two-bedroom and larger units.
Height limits in all RM districts are confined to the shorter of two stories or thirty feet.
Additional pertinent zoning information for the RM districts is as follows, from the Dinuba
Zoning Ordinance:

City of Dinuba                                                                    November 2015
2015– 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                        Page 7-4
Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Lot coverage varies by subcategory as follows:
        RM-3            50 percent
        RM-2            55 percent
        RM-1.5          60 percent
All residential districts permit the construction of manufactured homes, provided that they are
placed on permanent foundations. The RM districts conditionally permit mobile home parks,
subject to development standards that are intended to beautify the park and provide a quality
living recreational environment. There are two existing mobile home parks within the City
limits: Dinuba Downs Mobile Home Community and Western Sky Mobile Home Park, as well
as Alta Trailer Park 370 Whitney with eight units, and one park located just outside the City
limits but within the Sphere of Influence (El Monte Mobile Village). The City annexed a mobile
home park north of the community in November 2007 (Western Sky Mobile Home Park).
Although not planned at this time, any future annexations would allow the City to correct health
issues stemming from ground water contamination to eventually provide other urban services
such sanitary sewer and storm water drainage.
Mixed Uses
In addition to “traditional” single- and multiple-family zones, the City’s C-2 (Downtown
Commercial) zone allows the use of a “Downtown Residential Overlay District” to encourage
residential development as part of a mixed use development throughout the downtown area.
New residential development and the rehabilitation of existing structures are encouraged to meet
housing needs and to provide support for the growth of downtown businesses. Residential uses
are allowed on ground floors and second or third stories of buildings, there are no yard
requirements, and off-street parking requirements can be relaxed if necessary or off-street
parking can be shared.
Off-Street Parking Requirements
Excessive parking standards can pose a significant constraint of housing development by
increasing development costs and reducing the potential land availability for project amenities or
additional units and are not reflective of actual parking demand. Following is a summary of the
City’s parking standards by residential and mixed use zones:
Type of Zone                                  No. of Spaces
Single Family Residences                      2.0
Multi-Family Residences
        One Bedroom                           1.5
        Two Bedrooms                          2.0
        Two or more Bedrooms                  2.0
Mixed Use
        Studio or One Bedroom                 1.0
        Two Bedroom                           2.0; or with a Variance, ½ the requirement if
                                              approved by the Planning Commission; or shared
                                              parking

2015– 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                           Page 7-5
Chapter 7 Development Constraints
It is the City’s belief that parking standards would not impede a developer’s ability to achieve
maximum densities, and that provisions are in place to provide parking reductions where less
need is demonstrated, particularly for persons with disabilities, the elderly, affordable housing,
and infill and transit-oriented development. Developers may get reduced parking though
Variances, or by benefitting from Downtown parking districts. PUDs and CUPs also allow
developers to submit proposals with reduced parking if they can show that the overall proposal
accommodates the development and the spirit of the Municipal Code. Self Help Enterprises has
indicated that more compact development (higher densities) is an important factor in continuing
to build affordable housing. The Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities program
requires a density of at least 20 DU/Ac. In order to meet this requirement, Self Help Enterprises
has requested reductions in the total number of parking spaces required in other cities and
anticipates needing to do so for future development in the City of Dinuba as well.
Height Limits
Height limits of two stories or fewer in multifamily districts are one example of development
standards that may sometimes constrain achieving maximum densities. A Conditional Use
Permit can be used to allow higher building heights if the Planning Commission makes certain
findings: for example, when the granting of a height variance will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the
vicinity. The City recognizes the need to provide RM zones in order to accommodate higher
residential densities, which typically provide housing opportunities for very low- and low-
income groups. The City believes there are sufficient lands available to meet all RM-type needs
without exceeding the typical height limitation. Although the City believes there are appropriate
avenues for requesting a greater height, such as a density bonus, an Action to increase the height
to 35 feet or three stories has been included in the next zoning code update for 2015.
For applicable standards, the following is excerpted from Chapter 17.71.030 of the Dinuba
Zoning Ordinance:
         A. Height of a building shall be measured along the vertical distance from the average
            level of the highest and lowest point of that portion of the lot covered by the building
            to the highest point of the roof.
         B. Roof structures for housing elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans or similar
            equipment, and fire or parapet walls, skylights, towers, flagpoles, chimneys, antennas
            or similar structures may be erected above the height limit but shall not be allowed
            for the purpose of providing additional floor space.
Building Codes
Building codes regulate the construction of dwellings and include plumbing, electrical, and
mechanical divisions. The City complies with the 2013 California Building Codes, California
Code of Regulations Title 24.

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Site Improvements
Site improvements are regulated by the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances and by conditions
and standards imposed through the City permit process. Site improvements will include off-
street parking, landscaping, walls, sewerage, drainage and water systems. It is typically
suggested that cities not attempt to require any improvements other than those that are deemed
necessary to maintain the public health, safety, and welfare in order to reduce housing costs.
Permit Processing
The City of Dinuba provides the full range of services relating to the development of property
within its Sphere of Influence. Subdivision maps, parcel maps, conditional use permits, and
building plans are all processed by the City. The City encourages all developers to meet with its
development staff prior to the formal submittal of an application as a means to facilitate the
timely processing of the application. While building permits are approved ministerially for all
single-family dwellings within established subdivisions, site plan approval (specifically for
multifamily proposals) or entitlements can lengthen the approval process.
The City initiated a Development Review Committee (DRC) process in 2005 to ensure that all
City departments have an opportunity to review and discuss development proposals including all
subdivision maps. This process involves staff from public works (e.g., sanitary sewer, potable
water, storm water drainage, and streets), parks and community services, the police, and fire
departments to meet and discuss any site concerns or issues they may have pertinent to their
areas of responsibility. Alta Irrigation District, Dinuba Unified School District, and Pena’s
Disposal also participate in the DRC as these agencies may be impacted by development. The
City believes this process provides an opportunity to give feedback to a developer prior to
submittal of a formal application. The developer is given an opportunity to address any issues or
concerns prior to investing in design costs of a subdivision. Thus, when the project is ready for
consideration by the Planning Commission, any outstanding design issues would have been
addressed and resolved at an informal level.
The initiation of a development proposal begins with the filing of an application and payment of
appropriate fees. The application is reviewed by City staff and the environmental review process
under CEQA is initiated. The project is evaluated for potentially adverse environmental impacts
to determine which level of environmental review is necessary. Depending upon potential effect,
City staff determines if a categorical exemption, negative declaration, mitigated negative
declaration or environmental impact report (EIR) is appropriate. Should the project fit into any
of several pre-defined exempt categories, a notice of exemption may be filed which subsequently
expedites project clearance of environmental concerns allowing the project to move forward to
construction.
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly
related to the size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed
to complete the process. Table 7-1 identifies the typical processing time most common in the
entitlement process. It should be noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete
each step in the process (i.e., small scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning
designations do not generally require EIRs, General Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances).

 City of Dinuba                                                                       November 2015

 Chapter 7 Development Constraints
 Also, certain review and approval procedures may run concurrently. For example, a ministerial
 review for a single-family home would be processed concurrently with the design review. Since
 the majority of CEQA documents (i.e., EIRs and Negative Declarations) are prepared in response
 to a General Plan Amendment request, they are typically processed simultaneously. The City
 also encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single project. As an example, a
 rezone petition may be reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, a tentative tract map,
 and any necessary variances. Such procedures save time, money, and effort for both the public
 and private sector and could decrease the costs for the developer by as much as 30-50 percent.

* Depending on entitlement and significance of impact
 Depending on the complexity of the project, for example, a single-family project is typically
 approved in three to four weeks from date of plan submittal if no variances, exceptions, or zone
 changes are needed. After the project is approved, the building division performs plan checks
 and issues building permits. Other projects requiring a minor deviation approval are sent to the
 Development and Engineering Services Director and can be approved within two weeks.
 Throughout construction, the building division performs building checks to monitor the progress
 of the project. This process does not appear to put an undue time constraint on most
 developments because of the close working relationship between City staff contractors/builders,
 and developers. Table 7-2 outlines typical approval requirements for one single-family unit infill
 project, a 60-unit residential subdivision, and a 108-unit multifamily residential project.

Processing Time
 Source: Dinuba Development and Engineering Department staff
 For multifamily projects, provided that the zoning of the property in question is appropriate for
 such development, all review is completed at the staff level. Although the Planning Commission
 and City Council are briefed as to the scope of the project, site plan review is a ministerial
 process. However, concerns, comments, suggestions, and other insightful suggestions raised by
 the Commission and Council are considered during site plan review. Multifamily projects with
 over 24 units per gross acre or Planned Unit Developments (PUD) may take an average of three
 to four months to process, usually because of variance requests and the requirement for a
 Conditional Use Permit. We believe this time frame would not pose a constraint to the
 development of multifamily or PUD projects. Table 7-2 shows the typical process procedures
 and time needed to review and approve residential projects.
 On- and Off-site Improvements
 The typical improvements required by the City for development of property include curb, gutter,
 sidewalk, and street improvements. Extension of necessary utilities is also generally required as
 new subdivisions are developed. The City provides and operates water, sanitary sewer, and
 stormwater drainage services. Electricity, gas, communications and garbage services are
 provided by outside entities. However, the City requires concurrence from the entities that they
 can provide these services to new subdivisions. Public improvement standards and approximate
 values are listed below.
         Local Street – 60-foot right-of-way, including 36 feet of pavement with two travel lanes
         and two parking lanes. 2 inches A.C. over 6 inches compacted aggregate. Value: range
         between $4.00 to $6.00/sf.
         Curb and Gutter – 30 inches from asphalt pavement to back of curb, 7 ½ inches concrete
         over compacted native soil. Value: $15 to $25 per linear foot, dependent upon
         method of construction.

City of Dinuba                                                                    November 2015

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
        Sidewalk – 48 inches from back of curb, 4 inches concrete over compacted native soil.
        Value: range between $4.00 to $5.00/sf.
        Sewer Lateral – 4 inch PVC (dependent upon depth) with minimum slope of ¼-inch per
        foot. Value: range between $3,000 to $4,000/ea.
        1-inch Water Service – 1 inch CTS polyethylene pipe, meter boxes, bronze saddles,
        straps, and bolts. Value: range between $2,000 to $4,000/ea.
Additionally, if services are not available adjacent to the proposed building site, developers are
responsible for extension of services across the frontage of their property. This may include
construction of water, sewer, and storm water facilities, or the undergrounding (through piping)
of open-air ditches/canals operated by Alta Irrigation District, as well as construction of other
items. Approximate costs of these facilities ranges as follows:
        12-inch Water Main - $50-$100 per lineal foot
        10-inch Sewer Main - $40-$60 per lineal foot
        15-inch Storm Drain Main - $50-$100 per lineal foot
        Manhole - $3,000 to $6,000/ea.
        Fire Hydrant - $7,500 to 10,000/ea.
        Street Light - $8,000 to $9,000/ea.
        Wheelchair Ramp - $3,500-$4,500/ea.
As is indicated in Table 7-6, these improvement costs, however necessary, can have a
significant, cumulative impact on development. The City is not in a financial position to pay for
these improvements and is dependent upon the developer to accommodate his/her project by
constructing the necessary infrastructure. It should be noted that once the improvements are
completed, they are typically granted to the City which will be responsible for operating,
maintaining, repairing, and replacing the improvements in perpetuity.
Zoning Code Enforcement
The City of Dinuba provides code enforcement on a complaint basis. When the City is made
aware of violations or health and safety concerns relating to a residence, an inspection will be
made and a violation notice issued as appropriate. The City will respond to enforcement issues
by utilizing its Building Inspector and Building Official. Where appropriate, the Dinuba Police
Department will provide assistance as needed.

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
As noted earlier, the City complies with the 2013 California Building Codes, California Code of
Regulations Title 24. The City adjusts to modifications whenever they are made to applicable
sections of the code.
Fees and Other Exactions
In 1992, the City of Dinuba engaged a consultant to analyze its development fee schedule. The
study determined that the City’s fees did not cover the actual costs of the services provided.
Since then, the City has continued to modify its development and building fees pursuant to the
new fee schedule. The City has insisted on high standards, including the development of parks
and other legal requirements, which has resulted in the City’s fees being significantly higher than
in neighboring small cities. These modifications typically include annual increases consistent
with the Consumer Price Index. With the adoption of SB 975 by the California Legislature, it is
no longer possible for the City to waive development fees as a means to expedite the availability
of housing for very-low- and low-income housing groups. Participation by the City in activities
such as writing down the cost of land, providing gap funds, or construction of necessary public
infrastructure may trigger prevailing wage requirements.
The City recently completed a review of its impact fees (summer 2015), and fees for multifamily
housing remained about the same or increased in some cases. However, overall fees for single
family dwelling units decreased from the previous fee schedule, from $29,488 to $26,960 – a
decrease of over $2,500. Although fees have greatly reduced the City’s ability to provide
monetary incentives to prospective developers of multi-family housing, impact fees may be paid
over a five-year period, with 20 percent down at the time of issuance. In these cases, a lien is
required on the property to allow recovery of the fees in the event of a default.
These impact fees have been in place since 2005, and do not apply to older areas of the City, or
in the case of infill where existing structures are rehabilitated or converted to residential use.
They do apply in cases of infill when a structure is demolished, but only on the square footage in
excess of the original building size, when an addition exceeds 500 square feet, or when new
construction occurs. Additionally, when CDBG funds are used for new housing construction or
reconstruction of existing homes, consideration may be given to use a portion of the funds to
“write down” fees, land or infrastructure costs. Table 7-3 describes some fees associated with
both single- and multifamily development.

As evidenced by the variety of fees listed above, planning fee impacts on residential
development may range from a nominal amount to several thousand dollars. However,
particularly in the case of subdivisions, these fees have a very small impact on per-unit/dwelling
prices. The bulk of fees associated with residential development originate from System
Development Charges (SDC) which apply separately to land and buildings and associated fees.
Table 7-4 illustrates these fees.

City of Dinuba                                                                     November 2015

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Although the City has no influence over the fees exacted by Dinuba Unified School District
(DUSD), those fees are discussed to illustrate their potential impact on housing prices. The 2015
fee rates for DUSD are $7.39/square foot for a typical single-family residence and $0.54/square
foot for an exclusively senior single-family residence, or for commercial development. For a
1,500 square foot home, this would amount to $11,085 or $810 additional fee for a typical
single-family residence or senior single-family residence, respectively. During the 2009-2013
planning period, DUSD fees for a typical new single-family residence were $10,890, up from
$3,360 in the 2003-2008 planning period.

There are other fees that are associated with the number of water, gas, electrical, and other
fixtures. Table 7-5 provides an example of fees for an average 1,500-square-foot single-family
residence in Dinuba’s R-1-6 zoning district. It assumes a 10-acre parcel (gross area of 435,600
square feet or a net area of 360,000 square feet) subdivided into 60 single-family units occupying
360,000 square feet in area (assumes each lot contains 6,000 square feet in area). A single, sixty-
foot right-of-way runs east-west, with thirty lots to the north and thirty lots to the south. See
Table 7-5 below.

Regarding single-family development, these fees have a clear impact on the selling price of the
home. Factoring in the cost of public and other improvements further affects this, as shown in
Table 7-6. This table is based upon the same hypothetical subdivision as the previous section.

 When combined with the per-unit fees from the previous table, a total of $49,588 to $59,437 is
 added to the cost of each lot. This represents a significant increase from the 2000-2013 planning
 period which estimated a cost of $44,000. In some instances, the costs of improvement can be
 applied as a credit to reduce development fees, particularly in the event that a developer is
 willing to provide housing for the low- and very-low income groups. However, fee crediting can
 not be assumed and may not apply to all projects.
 Estimated fees for a 108-unit multifamily development in the RM-2 zoning district are shown in
 Table 7-7. This example includes the following assumptions:
        A five-acre parcel for which all off-site improvements, including street, water, and sewer,
         are existing.
        Placement of features such as buildings, landscaping, open space, and parking without
         regard to location within the project.
        2.2 parking spaces per unit are provided; seventy percent are nine by twenty feet, the
         remaining spaces are eight by seventeen feet.
        A single thirty-foot-wide travel lane provides access to all parking spaces.
        350 square feet of open space is provided per unit.
        109,219 square feet remain for structures – 1,011 square feet per unit.
        All units have two bedrooms.

Building Permit Fees Summary
Prior to 2007, building permit fees for residences were calculated by the types of improvements a
residence would have. A fee was given for each individual improvement (fixtures, bathrooms,
heaters, etc.). The total of these fees would be the total of the building permit. Commencing in
July, 2008 building permit fees for residences are now calculated by square footage. The square
footage is multiplied by a flat fee, which itself is determined by various factors (the size of the
house, whether it is part of a subdivision, etc.).
The City typically collects all appropriate fees at the time of final map approval or building
permit issuance. This process imposes potential financial impacts upon the developer since the
developer’s recovery of those costs does not occur until such time as the individual lots are sold.
In certain cases, postponement of collection of these fees until a Certificate of Occupancy is
issued may help facilitate development of additional housing. Also, the Dinuba Muncipal Code
allows full payment of fees to be deferred for up to five (5) years for commercial projects. The
developer pays 20 percent of the fees each year for 5 years, including interest, which divides

payments into smaller, more manageable amounts. This option is attractive to smaller, local
developers that do not have the financial capital to pay development fees at the onset of a project.
This provides an opportunity for smaller developers to compete with larger developers thereby
allowing competitiveness in the market for new housing location, size, and ultimately, pricing.
The City will explore expanding this option to homebuilders during the current planning cycle.
Constraints Affecting Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As noted in the Special Needs section 5.2 of this Housing Element, persons with disabilities and
the elderly have a number of housing needs related to accessibility of dwelling units; access to
transportation, employment, and commercial services; and alternative living arrangements that
include on-site or nearby supportive services. The City of Dinuba ensures that new housing
developments comply with California building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations) and federal requirements for accessibility.
The Dinuba Zoning Ordinance currently permits, without a conditional use permit, group homes
and similar uses in the RA, R, and RM Residential Zoning Districts and the PO Professional
Office District. The City’s Zoning Ordinance was amended in the last planning period to comply
with State law by allowing, by right, group homes for six or fewer persons in all residential
zones.
As with development of lower-income and other special needs projects, the City may be able to
accommodate fee credits and similar assistance in exchange for construction and maintenance of
care facilities. As an on-going portion of its Capital Investment Program, the City is replacing
standard curbed corners with ADA-compliant wheelchair ramps. However, the cost of
reconstructing corners precludes the City from a comprehensive City-wide replacement of all
curbed corners. Chapter 2 contains a discussion of many public benefit projects including
reconstruction of corners with ADA ramps. Within buildings, the City requires that all
developers comply with the applicable standards of both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act, whether within new structures or during
remodeling or retrofitting of existing structures.
The City has not adopted a specific process for making reasonable accommodations relating to
housing development. However, the Building Division of the Development and Engineering
Services Department reviews all applicable projects for compliance with all State and Federal
laws relating to the disabled, and requires that developers make modifications to their projects
where appropriate to provide compliance with these laws. Following careful review of similar
standards adopted by other municipalities, the City will enact a specific process for making
reasonable accommodations.
While current code does not apply any standards that serve to hinder the development of housing
for any special needs group, the Zoning Ordinance does not provide relief from parking
requirements compared to standard residential requirements.             However, the Planning
Commission may grant relief from parking requirements during hearings for the necessary
Variances and Conditional Use Permits. The City will pursue adoption of modified standards
that will permit reduced parking requirements under certain circumstances, including
development of housing for special needs groups.

City of Dinuba                                                                        November 2015

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
To provide zoning and land-use exceptions for housing for persons with disabilities, the City of
Dinuba currently utilizes either a minor deviation or encroachment permit processes to
accommodate requests such as special structures or appurtenances (i.e., access ramps or lifts)
needed by persons with physical disabilities. While both minor deviation and encroachment
permit applications may be handled through an administrative procedure, the standard used to
evaluate variances conflicts with laws applicable to housing for persons with disabilities. As a
result, the element includes an action (see Chapter 9) to establish a written and administrative
reasonable accommodation procedure in the zoning code for providing exception for housing for
persons with disabilities in zoning and land use.
Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The City process requests discretion for review of small group homes for persons with
disabilities (six or fewer residents) on a ministerial basis. The City does not impose additional
zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than those allowed by State law. There are
no City initiated constraints on housing for persons with disabilities caused or controlled by the
City. The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons
with disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Such retrofitting is permitted
under the California Building Code. Further, the City works with applicants who need special
accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code requirements does not
create a constraint. Finally, a program is included to amend the zoning code and clarify that
retrofitted access ramps are permitted in setback areas.
Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and Building
Codes
The City of Dinuba implements and enforces the California Building Code. The City provides
information to all interested parties regarding accommodations in zoning, permit processes, and
application of building codes for housing for persons with disabilities.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
As part of this update, the City conducted a comprehensive review of its zoning laws, policies
and practices for compliance with fair housing laws. The City has not identified any zoning or
other land-use regulatory practices that could discriminate against persons with disabilities and
impede the availability of such housing for these individuals. However, Chapter 9 includes
actions to waive, deviate, expedite or other administrative tools to facilitate locating all housing
types in all R zones in the City.
The City permits group homes of all sizes in all residential districts. All of the City’s commercial
zones also allow group homes. The City ministerially processes group home requests of six or
fewer people, while still requiring compliance with building code requirements, which are also
governed by the State. Group homes with 7 or more people are required to undergo the
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) process.

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
The City does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in group homes and does not
restrict the term “family,” or enforce a definition in its zoning ordinance.
The City permits housing for special needs groups, including for individuals with disabilities,
without regard to distances between such uses or the number of uses in any part of the City. The
Land Use Element of the General Plan does not restrict the siting of special need housing.
Permits and Processing
The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the
retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits and
inspections are the same as for other residential projects and are straightforward and not
burdensome. The City is unaware of any instances in which an applicant experienced delays or
rejection of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
As discussed above, the City allows group homes of six of fewer persons by right, as required by
State law. No CUP or other special permitting requirements apply to such homes. The City does
require a CUP for group homes of more than six persons in all residential and commercial zones
that allow for residential uses. The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements
or business licenses for the establishment or retrofitting of structures for residential use by
persons with disabilities. If structural improvements were required for an existing group home, a
building permit would be required. If a new structure were proposed for a group home use,
design review would be required as for any other new residential structure. The City design
review process has not been used to deny or substantially modify a housing project for persons
with disabilities to the point where it is no longer feasible. All residential projects in the City
require the same level of design review; however, the element includes an action to convene a
task force with pertinent stakeholders and organizations to evaluate this process and pursue
appropriate changes based on the task force’s findings.
Building Codes
The City of Dinuba provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the
enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits through its flexible
approaches to retrofitting or converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings that
meet the shelter needs of persons with disabilities. The City adopted and implements the 2013
Uniform Building Code (UBC) and 2013 California Code, which incorporates and amends the
1997 UBC. The State has adopted various updates to the California Building Code (Title 24)in
every year during the past planning period (2008-2013). The City will implement the provisions
of the Code in the near future. Until that time, the 2013 UBC/2013 California Code will be the
applicable Code the City is required to enforce under State law. The only additions to the
Uniform Code that the City has adopted are (a) requiring multifamily housing to be fire
sprinkled; and (b) requiring Class “A” roof materials due to high fire hazard.

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Universal Design Element
The City of Dinuba has not adopted a universal design ordinance governing construction or
modification of homes using design principles that allow individuals to remain in those homes as
their physical needs and capabilities change. The City has added the development of a Universal
Design Element as an action during this planning period. The City will refer to the HCD website
to develop guidelines and a model ordinance consistent with the principles of universal design.
HOME and First Time Homebuyer Funds
In smaller communities, there are often a limited number of qualified HOME administrative
subcontractors and non-profit affordable housing developers. In a situation where an
organization acts as the Administrative Subcontractor to a State Recipient in the State HOME
program for a first-time homebuyer (FTHB) assistance program, and also develops affordable
housing in the same community, HCD restricts homebuyers participating in a development
program (ex. mutual self-help housing) from utilizing HOME FTHB funding to purchase their
homes. This causes not only an impediment to the ability to develop new single family
affordable homeownership opportunities, but also impacts the State Recipients (City of Dinuba)
ability to spend FTHB funds in a community with limited affordable housing inventory. The
City will include an Action to work with HCD to remove constraints on low-income households’
ability to participate in multiple affordable housing assistance programs, including the FTHB
program, mutual self-help housing program, youth build, infill housing programs, etc.
7.2      Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints are those generated by the private sector, and are usually beyond
the control of local government. A few of the impacts of non-governmental constraints can be
mitigated to a minimal extent by local government actions, but usually the effects are very
localized and have little influence on the total housing need within the jurisdiction or market
area.
Availability and Cost of Financing
Until about 2007, getting a mortgage loan was not too difficult, as lenders were willing to work
with those with moderate-to-good credit scores. For example, balloon payments and higher
interest rates were used by lenders as ways to protect their assets while encouraging larger loans
that were unrealistic for some borrowers. These issues, combined with plummeting home values,
resulted in a high rate of foreclosures beginning in 2006. Since that time, lenders have gotten
stricter about approving loans. To qualify now, a borrower typically must have a credit score of
at least 600 – and sometimes as high as 720. The borrower must also have cash as a down
payment and proof of an income that will support the amount of the loan.
Interest rates for both construction financing and “take-out” financing (i.e., short-term
construction loans) have more impact on the affordability of housing than any other factors. A
take-out loan or take-out financing means short-term permanent financing. While a borrower
normally secures a commitment from a lender to receive permanent financing following
construction of a planned project, the take-out commitment is generally predicated upon specific

City of Dinuba                                                                      November 2015
2015– 2023 Draft HOUSING ELEMENT                                                          Page 7-20
Chapter 7 Development Constraints
conditions, such as a certain percentage of unit sales or leases, for the permanent loan to take-out
the construction loan. Most construction lenders require take-out financing before agreeing to
finance the construction loan.
Historically, high interest rates, coupled with the limited availability of financing, were
responsible to a large extent for an increasing number of households that could not afford home
ownership. To lessen the impact of financing as an obstacle, local governments considered
options such as subsidizing interest and financing rates for builders and/or home buyers. This
was accomplished through the sale or mortgage revenue bonds, but changes in federal law
governing the issuance of these bonds makes this alternative more difficult, particularly for the
purchase of single-family housing.
During the 2003-2008 planning period, home mortgage interest rates fell dramatically, in some
cases to the 4 to 5 percent range. While this appeared to be a boon to both home buyers and
home builders, its effects were more far-reaching. Availability of affordable financing prompted
more people to qualify for purchasing new single-family dwellings, in many instances builders
were unable to meet this unanticipated demand. As with any product based on supply and
demand, this inability to keep up with demand in turn drove up the prices of housing. New
housing prices soared and lending institutions implemented more liberal lending practices to
previously unqualified and minimally qualified applicants. As the economic situation worsened
in 2007, jobs losses began in all sectors and many could no longer afford to make their monthly
mortgage payments. As new housing demand declined, new housing prices stabilized and also
began to decline. However, because developers could not sell new homes, many subdivisions
saw sales drop dramatically and in some instances became non-existent. After the economic
downturn, interest rates decreased and were sometimes as low as 1.5 percent. In late 2014, they
were in the 3.5 to 4.5 percent range. During the period from 2007 through 2011, home values
dropped significantly, which created a high foreclosure rate on homes where lenders were
“upsidedown” on their mortgages. The economy began to recover in 2011, so although interest
rates remained low, unemployment rates remained high and relatively few people could afford to
purchase homes. By 2013, developers were only starting to begin to construct new homes.
Accomplishing the housing needs allocation was not possible until the economic downturn began
to reverse. Although the economy has stabilized, unemployment rates in Dinuba and the
surrounding area have decreased but remain high. Consumer confidence is beginning to recover
and financing is only slightly more readily available to new home builders and buyers than in the
past several years. The new housing market is slowly returning to more robust sales.
Price of Land
According to the California Building Association, the cost of land represents a high proportion of
total housing development cost. Small communities such as Dinuba still have reasonably-priced
land with typical single-family land prices in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. There are two prices
of land associated with new homebuilding: the price paid by the developer for unimproved land
and the price of developed (improved) land. During the last planning period, unimproved land
values were between $30,000 and $40,000 per acre, and decreased by 200 to 300 percent since
that time. Because of land value fluctuations, staff determined an average cost of $15,000 per
acre divided by 5.8 lots per acre or about $2,586 per lot. The Land (Improved Lot) column in

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Table 7-8 includes the average cost per lot and almost $50,000 in impact fees and improvement
costs. The price of land, though, is usually taken as the finished cost per lot, which includes off-
site improvements and development fees. In 2010, this improved lot cost represented an average
of 24 percent of the cost of new homes in Dinuba, and in 2014, improved lot costs are about 25
percent of the cost of a new home, as shown below.

It is of great importance to note that the cost of a new home as listed above is an estimation
based upon a single active subdivision in Dinuba. Within recent years, other subdivisions have
been completed in which the average price was significantly less.
Cost of Construction
Rising costs of labor and materials have contributed to non-governmental constraints on housing
development. These costs were a substantial part of the increased housing costs during the
1980’s. Builders passed those increases along to the home buyer or renter.
Additionally, one of the most important results of Proposition 13, passed by the voters of
California in 1978, was the severe limitation imposed on the development of infrastructure.
These costs can no longer be passed on to the taxpayer by the local jurisdiction. They must be
borne by the developer, who then must pass them on by increasing the cost of housing.
The City can take additional positive steps to reduce the impact of rising construction costs on
housing prices. Several examples are shown in Table 7-9.

                                                   consider density bonus incentives
While the implementation of the above measures could increase the housing stock within the
City, some measures might not produce the desired results. The reduction in lot size could create
unsafe street conditions due to the reduction in front yard and play area. It may be necessary to
consider providing additional park space or requiring developers to make up for the loss of
recreational area.
Utilization of Self Help and other non-profit entities can provide substantial savings in the cost
of developing new housing. Through the use of these organizations, not only is the actual cost of
development reduced, but the “pride of ownership” is increased through “sweat equity” provided
by the household. In addition, non-profit housing entities are typically quite adept at identifying
and utilizing alternative funding sources and result in more households qualifying for housing.
Lifestyle
Part of the increase in housing costs during the 1970’s and 1980’s was due to consumer
preference and lifestyle expectations. The size of the typical single-family house increased and
other services included in the housing package changed, such as lot size, amenities, and number
of bedrooms. All of these choices have costs associated with them. The trends emerging now,
due to governmental and non-governmental constraints and the resulting increase in housing
costs, are towards smaller units, smaller lots, and alternatives to the single-family detached
dwelling.
Over 50 percent of the questionnaire responses indicated that residents would prefer to live in
single family homes, and another 21 percent preferred a gated community. Although this may
not fully reflect the preferences of the community as a whole, it is realistic to conclude that the
consumer preference is for single family homes. However, households are now more willing to
accept alternatives to that lifestyle mostly out of necessity, including apartments and mobile
homes. Local government can assist this change by permitting higher densities, and innovative
approaches such as zero lot-line housing, smaller lots, and “smart growth” policies.

Chapter 7 Development Constraints
Drought
The region and the State as a whole are in the fourth year of the worst drought in history.
Although the current drought conditions are not generated by the private sector, as are other non-
governmental constraints, the drought conditions will almost certainly impact the City. As
surface water has become less available, farmers have had to resort to the use of groundwater.
Many places in the Central Valley have groundwater considered to be in overdraft, so that the
water levels continue to drop. This forces all groundwater users, including cities, farmers, and
commercial operations, to drill deeper wells which lower the groundwater levels further and
eventually cause subsidence. Water in the City is supplied by nine active wells that currently
provide more than enough capacity for residents and businesses. The system has a capacity of
approximately 11,000,000 gallons per day (7,600 GPM), and average daily demand is 4,200,000
gallons per day (or 2,900 GPM).
An Executive Order by Governor Brown in April 2015 required that all residents reduce their
water usage, with a statewide goal of 25 percent reduction. The City has been ordered to reduce
water consumption by 35 percent from 2012 usage in 2015. The City will implement “Stage 3”
Water Restrictions in June 2015, which will restrict water usage for residents. With this
reduction in water use and the City’s capacity for water storage, the City does not anticipate
further water use restrictions that will affect the rate of residential development. However,
residents will continue to be affected by the drought in other ways. For example, because so
many residents are dependent in some way on local agricultural production, these conditions will
affect their ability to earn an income. Additionally, the price of food (including fruits, vegetable,
grains/breads, dairy products, eggs, and meat) will increase. The cost of water and wastewater
services may increase. All of these factors will impact residents’ ability to afford housing rents
or mortgages.

                                   EIGHT-YEAR ACTION PLAN
This chapter sets forth an eight-year program of actions necessary to achieve the stated goals,
objectives and policies required by State HCD, as they specifically pertain to the housing needs
in the City of Dinuba. Many of these actions can be accomplished at the local level, while others
require state and federal government action, including the funding of various housing programs.
The following sections present the individual actions and programs necessary to achieve plan
goals. Each goal contains an overview, and identification of existing and potential objectives,
policies, and actions to meet state goals, an eight-year action plan, and identification of
responsible agencies and funding sources. Actions are numbered with the Goal and Policy each
is intended to support, so that, for example, number 1.3.5 is Action number 5, intended to
support Goal number 1, Policy number 3.
Goal 1:
Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-, very
low-, low, and moderate-income households.
In the past 50 years, private industry has encountered various obstacles in producing affordable
housing for extremely and very-low-income families. Although wages have remained flat over
the last several years, the costs of rental units has not increased significantly, and rents remain
affordable to many residents within the last planning period. Housing costs were highest in
2007, and have been on the rise slowly since 2012. However, those with the lowest incomes,
and those with larger households continue to struggle to find safe, affordable housing.
As housing costs rise without an appreciable increase in wages, future housing needs will
increasingly be translated into a greater demand for less-costly housing types like multiple-
family units, second units, mixed use, and mobile homes. While existing community land use
plans provide for a full range of housing types and densities, future decisions regarding public
improvements, zoning, and development standards will determine the extent to which multiple-
family housing, mixed use, mobile homes and other lower cost housing and higher density
alternatives will be successfully utilized in meeting anticipated housing needs.
Housing assistance provided by federal and state programs falls into two categories: assistance to
homeowners and assistance to renters. Within each of these categories, programs address either
construction of new housing units or use (including rental costs) of existing units. Some
programs assist the individual or family, while others assist the owner or developer.
It is the City’s intent to use its limited resources to provide housing opportunities for all income
groups. This can be accomplished by encouraging development of additional housing for all
lower income groups, by allowing a greater variety of housing throughout all residential zones,
and by making efforts to maintain and recondition older housing. Priority, however, will be
given to extremely low- and very-low income groups as these groups face the most difficult
challenges in securing housing to meet their needs using one or combination of resources

identified below. If other funding or program opportunities arise that are not identified in this
Housing Element, the City will also consider said opportunities as part of its efforts to assist in
the provision of housing.
        Objectives:
        1.1     Facilitate the construction of both market and non-market rate dwellings by 2023
                to meet the City’s 2023 RHNA.
        1.2     Work as team members with our partners to find and utilize funding sources that
                will result in meeting the housing needs of the lower and moderate income
                residents of the City.
        Policies:
        1.1.1   Wherever appropriate, facilitate the use of federal or state programs that can assist
                in the development of new housing consistent with identified City-wide housing
                needs and adopted local plans and programs.
        1.1.2   Advocate and support proposed federal and state actions that will create a positive
                and stable climate for housing production
        1.2.1   Work closely with Self Help Enterprises and other partners to identify and apply
                for funding and locate appropriate lands for development of a variety of housing.
        Actions:
        1.1.1   The City will facilitate developers making application from FmHA Interest
                Subsidy programs, and will work with and assist those developers. The City will
                facilitate this by providing the necessary information for the application on the
                City’s website or in pamphlets, noticing and holding the required public hearing,
                and preparing a staff report to the City Council. The City also takes all actions
                necessary to expedite processing and approvals for such projects, and will make
                available fee credits and density bonuses for developers agreeing to provide
                lower-income housing.

        This program provides direct loans to individuals of extremely-low, very-low, and low-
        income for the purchase of newly-constructed homes. The interest rate varies according
        to the applicant’s adjusted family income and may be from as low as 1 percent to market
        rate. The ability to achieve this is contingent upon the market conditions during the plan
        period, interested developers, and congressional authorization to issue such bonds.
        Although no individuals participated in this program during the 2009-2014 planning
        period, the City will continue to keep this loan option available.

               with gathering information. When a proposal for a new rental project is accepted,
               HUD enters a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contract with the owner, which
               guarantees rent assistance payments to qualified renters for a specified period of
               time up to 20 years.

               California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, which issues bonds and provides tax
               credits to help fund development of multifamily development and rehabilitation.
               Developers are eligible to receive density bonuses if developers agree to provide
               certain levels of housing for special needs or lower-income groups. The City will
               facilitate developers by providing information needed for the application, noticing
               and holding the required public hearing, and preparing a staff report to the City
               Council.

        1.1.5 The City will revise its permitting and recordkeeping process to better track the
               types of housing for which permits are sought. In particular, the City will record
               requests for permits for second units and other housing that will assist lower
               income groups, those in need of temporary housing, those with disabilities, and
               other special needs groups.

Goal 2:
Address and remove governmental and non-governmental constraints that limit the access
to fair, affordable, and appropriate housing, including housing for those with disabilities.
Many factors affect the ultimate cost of housing to the consumer, be it rental or home ownership.
Some of these constraints are the result of government actions, regulations and standards, and
some are the results of non-governmental factors. However, governmental and non-
governmental constraints are interrelated and each affects the other, so that action programs that
affect one group can affect the other. To address governmental constraints, the City needs to
carefully analyze fees, land use controls, building codes and site improvement standards.
Non-governmental constraints are beyond the control of local government and generally cannot
be impacted by any action of the City or County. However, certain actions of local government
can mitigate some of the adverse impacts of market constraints on a very localized basis.
        Objectives:
        2.1    Reduce government and non-government barriers to production of special needs
               housing
        2.2    Review City policies, ordinances, and fees that may limit access to appropriate
               housing and other facilities and services
        Policies:
        2.1.1  Review General Plan and zoning ordinances that restrict some types of
               development (e.g., second units, use of modular/mobile units, density bonus)
        2.1.2  Review the City’s current process for ensuring reasonable accommodations for
               housing for those with disabilities
        2.2.1  Review and revise fee schedule for City services and Impact fees, and consider
               long-term fee deferrals for development of lower income housing by our partners
        2.2.2  Review processing times for reviews, maps, permits, and other approvals
        2.2.3  Promote infill housing development in areas annexed prior to 1988, which would
               be exempt from most impact fees
        Actions:
        2.1.1  “Smart growth” generally refers to development and planning standards that
               promote consolidation of services, convenient location of recreation and
               commercial facilities (“walk-ability”), and “new-urbanism,” which is essentially a
               return to planning principles from the mid-20th century. These principles include
               narrow residential streets that may or may not provide on-street parking, reduced
               front setbacks, parking at the rear of buildings (primarily off of alleys), shared
               parks or common areas, wide sidewalks, and traditional architecture. The City

               will consider revising its Zoning Ordinance to provide for “smart growth,”
               including housing density bonuses, reduced setbacks, and smaller lots located
               close to services, schools, and jobs. The City will allow at least one site zoned
               either R-M 2 or R-M 1.5 with a minimum 6,300 square feet site (which represents
               a 10 percent site area reduction as stated in the Zoning Ordinance Section
               17.24.050) to accommodate new multiple-family residential development to meet
               the Low Income housing needs determined in the RHNA.

               Ordinance by reducing front, rear, and side setbacks, minimum distance between
               buildings for multistory units, and increasing total site area covered by roofed
               structures for multifamily dwelling units when a minimum of 10 percent of units
               developed to housing for households who earn 60 percent or less of the AMI. If a
               development proposal is adjacent to existing or future single-family residential
               uses, adequate and permanent screening in the form of landscaping shall be
               installed and maintained to ensure the privacy of single-family residents. Priority

               developers who are willing to construct extremely low-, very low-, and low-
               income rental housing with expedited processing and approvals for such projects.
               The City will also continue to endorse the use of bonds such as those issued in
               conjunction with the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Developers of
               low-, very low-, and extremely low-income units will also be eligible for the

               development in areas annexed prior to 1990. SDCs were not applied to land
               before this date, and were applied only to buildings when 1) new construction
               occurred, 2) building additions exceeded 500 square feet, or 3) a structure was
               demolished, in which case the fee applied only to the square footage that
               exceeded that of the original building. These 61 parcels are indentified in the land
               inventory (Appendix C), and this information will be made available to interested

Goal 3:
Identify a variety of adequate sites for all income levels through appropriate zoning and
development standards to meet the City of Dinuba’s 2023 RHNA.
The City annexed land during the last planning period, and has more than sufficient land
available to meet the needs of the RHNA during the current planning period. However,
particularly with the passage of SB 375 and its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
through higher density residential development, some of this land must be considered for
construction at a higher density to provide opportunities for lower-income housing. Zoning and
development standards must also be reviewed to ensure that needs for second units, modular
homes, emergency housing, and housing for other special needs groups can be accommodated.
Additionally SB 375 places additional requirements on jurisdictions to provide housing in close
proximity to services, employment, and schools, as well as encouraging alternative transportation

        Actions
        3.1.1  Dinuba will update its 2007 General Plan as needed to account for changes in land
               use designations, General Plan amendments, and to be consistent with adopted
               Specific Plans. The 2007 General Plan, a 25-year plan, was adopted in October,
               2008, with the intention to review it periodically during that time.
               More specifically, in order for the City of have a consistent range in density for
               residential development within the RM-2 zoning density and the Medium High
               Density Residential (MHR) General Plan designation, the City will amend the
               General Plan MHR designation to allow 7.6 – 20.0 units/gross acre, and will
               include all lands zoned as RM-2 under this MHR designation. This amendment
               will allow the zoning and general plan designations to have the same range of
               density for development, and will allow the City to meet State density
               requirements for residential development.

               subsequently resulting in a reduction of home prices. Further, the City can
               coordinate private development in conjunction with projects identified in the
               City’s Capital Investment Program, also potentially reducing the cost of housing
               development. The Development Services Department will continually update its
               maps showing all vacant land with the potential to accommodate infill housing.
               The maps will depict those sites with a minimum lot size that can accommodate at
               least one single family home.
        Year: Working with developers and coordinating private development in conjunction
               with the City’s CIP will be on-going during the 2015-2023 planning period. The

Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock and the
quality of the existing neighborhoods.
Although the assessment of current housing needs indicates that the majority of Dinuba’s
population is adequately housed, it also clearly illustrates that a certain segment of households
are currently experiencing housing quality (that is, upkeep and maintenance) difficulties. Based
on the inventory of housing quality contained in Chapter 4, greater than 2,030 households within
Dinuba are currently living in housing that needs some repair or rehabilitation. Part of this
problem stems from the fact that many dwellings were built prior to local building code and
planning regulation. Special needs groups that may be particularly affected by older housing
includes the elderly and large families, who are most likely to live in aging, single family homes.
The extremely low-income and farm worker groups may also live in unsafe or unsanitary
housing conditions because of a lack of available affordable housing. These groups include both
the very young and the elderly, who are most at risk of health problems that occur more
frequently in older housing as the result of aged plumbing, electrical, and heating/cooling
systems, leaking roofs, and similar problems.
Housing conservation is necessary to not only improve health and safety conditions, but also to
protect the existing housing stock and to enhance and maintain existing neighborhood quality.
The City has a very aggressive housing rehabilitation program funded by CDBG monies. Since
2003, the City has secured eight grants and allocated no-interest or low-interest loans for the
rehabilitation of nine units. Active grants total $4,591,541. Current applications are expected to
provide financing for the rehabilitation and construction of additional units. Additionally, the
City’s SDCs were put in place in 2005, so that dwellings built before then are not usually subject
to these fees.
Objectives:
        4.1     Encourage rehabilitation and conservation of housing units for households of all
                income levels to maintain and improve neighborhoods for the long term.
        4.2     Encourage and facilitate the participation of Self Help Enterprises and other non-
                profit developers and partners to assist in the rehabilitation and conservation of
                housing within the City of Dinuba.

        4.1.1  Support actions that foster and maintain high levels of owner-occupancy,
               particularly in those neighborhoods in which housing quality is declining.
        4.1.2  Facilitate maximum utilization assistance programs where such action is needed
               to ensure preservation of the living environment
        4.2.1  Support public and private awareness and efforts to rehabilitate and improve the
               existing housing stock and neighborhood conservation
        Actions:
        4.1.1  As a non-entitlement City, Dinuba will continue to apply for CDBG and HOME
               funds for housing rehabilitation and to actively participate in outreach efforts to
               inform city residents that these programs are available. Self-Help Enterprises
               (SHE) administers the City’s marketing and outreach for these programs. SHE
               receives administrative funds (grant start-up, environmental reviews, public
               hearings, guideline management, marketing, draw requests, reporting and
               closeout) through CDBG and HOME program grants; while the City provides
               funding to support the administration of the Cal-Home program. In addition, each
               program provides activity delivery funds as a part of the grant to the City that
               covers SHE’s time for program implementation (eligibility determination,
               verifications, loan processing, initial inspections, work write-ups, construction
               monitoring, pay releases, etc.) The City uses CDBG funding to provide grants up
               to $15,000 to assist homeowners with repairs such as roofing, windows, doors,
               electrical, and plumbing to meet the health and safety of the family and/or the
               community. These funds used to be utilized for “emergency” repairs, but are now
               usually designated for first-time homebuyers and rehabilitation of homes. During
               the HE planning period, the City will target a total of 25-30 units, depending upon
               the availability of funding and costs per unit.
        Year: Annually, continuing throughout the planning period

        4.1.2  The City has an existing Housing Rehabilitation Program through HUD, and will
               continue to support rehabilitation of housing through this program. The City will
               solicit proposals from owners who have units that do not meet minimum quality
               housing standards and are interested in putting their units in the program. If
               rehabilitation is deemed feasible, the City will work with property owners to have
               the rehabilitation project funded.

        4.2.1 The City of Dinuba and Tulare County will continue to enforce the Housing
               Code, which provides minimum health and safety standards for the maintenance
               of the existing housing supply. These standards are intended to provide for safe
               and sanitary housing that are suitable for human habitation. The Tulare County
               Health and Human Services Agency has the authority to enforce housing
               violations. Due to limited resources, the enforcement of the Housing Code is
               handled on a passive, complaint-response basis.
        Year: Update information on the website within six months of certification of the 2015-

        4.2.2  The City of Dinuba will ensure that utilities can be provided by the developers to
               areas recently annexed, as housing or other development projects are initiated. In
               compliance with SB 244, the City seek to identify the infrastructure and service
               needs of unincorporated legacy communities in their general plans during the
               planning period (none were identified in 2015 when the housing element update
               occurred). An unincorporated legacy community is defined as a place meeting
               the following criteria:
       Contains 10 or greater dwelling units in close proximity to one another;
       Is within a city Sphere of Influence (SOI), is an island within a city boundary, or is
        geographically isolated and has existed for greater than 50 years; and
       Has a median household income that is 80 percent or less than the statewide median
        household income.
        Year: On-going on a continuous basis. Also, participate in MSR process with LAFCo
               every 5 years to review the SOI and identify the location(s) of these communities.

Goal 5:
Conserve assisted housing developments at-risk of conversion to market rate.
According to HCD, “One of California’s foremost housing problems is the potential loss of
affordability restrictions on a substantial portion of the government-assisted rental housing stock.
Much of this stock is ‘at-risk’ of conversion from affordable housing stock reserved
predominantly for lower-income households, to market-rate housing.” Fortunately, in the City of
Dinuba, contracts for government assisted rental housing are renewed as scheduled, and none of
this housing was lost to market rate housing in the last planning period. The City will continue
to maintain records, and otherwise encourage the development and continued availability of this
housing.
        Objectives
        5.1     Ensure that the City maintains records on the locations of all assisted housing, and
                is involved in discussions/negotiations for avoiding at-risk conversions to market
                rate.
        Policies
        5.1.1 Maintain records of assisted housing within the City, and assist in the preservation
                of these units
        Actions:
        5.1.1   The City will continue to work with Self Help Enterprises and the Central Valley
                Coalition for Affordable Housing to address at-risk units should they become a
                concern, the City will communicate with HCD and managers of affordable
                housing, so that they will be informed when a property owner is considering
                converting housing to market risks.

        5.1.2 The City will proactively seek funding resources and partnerships with non-profit
                organizations to preserve units in danger of converting to market rates at their
                current levels. The City will also directly contact tenants of these developments
                and provide information regarding potential conversion dates, rental subsidies,
                and other assistance available through City of Dinuba and County of Tulare
                agencies as well as non-profit organizations. See discussion in Chapter 5, At Risk

                low-rent status of the units and/or projects. The City participates in the HOME
                and CDBG programs annually, and can use funds from these sources to provide
                security from conversion. See discussion in Chapter 5, At Risk Units.

Goal 6:
Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons, including those in special needs
groups.
This goal, and the associated objectives, policies, and actions are intended to ensure housing for
all special needs groups, including the elderly and those with disabilities, large families, farm
workers, those with the lowest incomes, single heads of household, and those who either are
homeless or may become homeless. It also addresses housing to avoid discrimination based on
age, race, religion, or other groups covered by law. Although inadequate distribution of
affordable housing within a community or region is an important constraint to choice,
discrimination due to race, religion, or ethnic background is an equally significant factor
affecting the rental or sale of housing. Discrimination violates State and Federal laws and should
be reported to the proper authorities for investigation. The agency responsible for investigation
of housing discrimination complaints is the State Department of Fair Employment and Housing.
Individuals and households with “special needs” are those whose housing requirements go
beyond just a safe and sanitary dwelling at an affordable price, and may include unique physical
or sociological requirements, or both. Included in this category are:
       Senior citizens living on fixed incomes
       Persons with Disabilities, especially those who need accommodation(s)
       Large families, who may need four, five, or more bedrooms in a dwelling
       Farm workers, who move from one location to another for all or part of the year
       Families with female heads of household, who suffer a unique form of discrimination as
        well as having needs relating to location and size of unit.
       Families and Persons in Need of Emergency, Supportive, or Transitional Housing
Large households living in overcrowded conditions must be considered a group with special
needs. Although there is limited information regarding the extent of overcrowding, the average
number of persons per household did increase during the last planning period. This indicates that
the birth rate may be increasing, or that fewer people can afford to live apart. In either case, the

City of Dinuba                                                                      November 2015

Chapter 9 Eight-Year Action Plan
result is that more housing is needed with three, four, or more bedrooms to accommodate these
households.
Statistics from the 2010 U.S. Census indicate that farm workers, seniors (and especially seniors
with disabilities), large families, and female heads of households are the special needs groups
most in need of equal housing opportunities in the community. The questionnaire distributed to
residents throughout the community indicate that affordable housing for seniors, and large
families were the groups that community members believed needed the most assistance with
housing.
Not all persons and households with “special needs” are in the lower-income groups, but it can
be safely assumed that with sufficient income available, these special needs can be
accommodated. Special needs groups with low or limited incomes are those targeted by this
action plan. All programs listed in the prior section also assist those individuals and households
with special needs.
         Objectives:
         6.1    Maintain programs and processes that discourage and address discrimination
         6.2    Support programs and processes that encourage accommodation for all/any
                special needs groups.
         Policies:
         6.1.1  Encourage enforcement of fair housing laws throughout the City
         6.2.1  Support the development of housing plans and programs, including new
                government subsidized housing that maximize housing choices for minorities and
                other special needs, lower-income households commensurate with need.
         6.2.2. Review zoning ordinances and other City policies and fees that may expressly
                discriminate against a group protected by the fair housing laws or have the effect
                of discriminating against a protected group.
         Actions:
         6.1.1  The City will assist renters seeking affordable housing by providing written
                information (in the form of brochures or flyers in English and Spanish) about
                rental programs available through the Tulare County Housing Authority and other
                non-profit organizations. Information will be available at the City Hall and the

               diverse populations. In most cases, development or redevelopment of property in
               older parts of the City is exempt from most impact fees, especially SDCs. SDCs
               typically apply only on the additional square footage in excess of the original

Goal 7:
Promote energy and water conservation in all residential neighborhoods.
The City has promoted energy conservation for residential uses on both educational and
regulatory levels. The City plans to support educational programs that promote residential
energy conservation for both new construction and existing residences in Dinuba.
On a regulatory level, the City enforces the State Energy Conservation Standards (Title 24,
California Administrative Code). These building codes provide a great deal of flexibility for
individual builders to achieve a minimum “energy budget” through the use of various
performance standards. These requirements now apply to all new residential construction as well
as all remodeling and rehabilitation construction. Subdivision and site plan review regulations or
policies that required compliance with specific energy conservation standards have not been
adopted by the City.

Chapter 9 Eight-Year Action Plan
Establishment and enforcement of energy and water conservation standards and continuing
programs aimed at efficiency awareness are key factors in reducing energy and water
consumption. In addition to required compliance with the Building Code and Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations (C.C.R.) relating to energy conservation, the City sets forth goals
and policies which encourage the conservation of nonrenewable resources in concert with the use
of alternative energy sources to increase energy self-sufficiency. Some conservation measures
require a higher up-front cost, but result in net savings, over the life of the measures, from
reduced energy and/or water consumption. In large part, utility bill reductions through energy
and water savings can be realized through design incorporating energy conservation features.
Energy conservation is, in effect, a resource to enhance the affordability of dwelling units.
        Objectives:
        7.1    Maintain local ordinances, and support federal and state regulations to promote
               energy and water conservation.
        7.2    Utilize regional, state and federal opportunities to provide funding for energy and
               water conservation
        7.3    Promote energy and water conservation through educational programs
        Policies:
        7.1.1  Promote development of public policies and regulations that achieve a high level
               of energy and water conservation in all new and rehabilitated housing units.
        7.2.1  Encourage maximum utilization of federal, state, and utility company programs
               that assist homeowners and renters in providing energy conservation measures.
        7.3.1  Provide information to the public about available programs on the City’s website
               and social media page
        7.4.1  The City will continue to enforce building code regulations (Title 24, California
               Administrative Code) that require compliance with residential energy
               conservation measures for all new construction, remodeling, and rehabilitation.

               (USGBC) LEED® Programs and Services to promote residential development
               that is environmentally responsible, profitable and healthy places to live. Among
               the techniques used to achieve energy efficiency and conservation are window
               glazing, landscaping, building design, cooling and heating systems,
               weatherization techniques (such as insulation, caulking, and weather-stripping),
               energy efficient appliances, and efficient use of lighting through the use of
               fluorescent bulb fixtures instead of incandescent bulbs in average fixtures.
               Projects containing LEED compliant components will receive expedited review to
               provide as quick turnaround/approval as possible.

        7.1.2  Better placement of and access to natural shading would benefit City residents of
               affordable, multifamily units. Shade trees in common areas allows tenants of
               affordable housing to conserve air conditioning usage by providing an option of
               spending time outdoors in a cool, shaded environment. This alternative to keeping
               cool would reduce household cooling costs by providing a minor cost reduction in
               the form of reduced energy consumption and subsequent energy use charges. The
               City shall consider alternative landscaping designs that allow more trees and
               shrubs in common areas, and fewer trees in parking areas and adjacent to streets,
               as is currently required by section 17.24.160 of the Zoning Ordinance.
               Landscaping coverage of less than ten percent shall also be considered if the cost
               to landscape is proven to be a financial constraint to an otherwise affordable
               housing project. This does not preclude compliance with all new landscaping
               requirements of the State mandated Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance
               adopted by the City and effective January 1, 2010, or with Executive Order

        7.1.3  The City, in accordance with the Executive Order signed by Governor Brown in
               April 2015, will explore ways in which to reduce water use throughout the City.
               For example, the Governor has directed the creation of a rebate program to
               replace old appliances with more water and energy efficient models, and has
               prohibited new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless
               water-efficient drip irrigation systems are used. The City’s efforts may include,
               but would not be limited to, reduction in water use for landscaping for existing,
               new, and rehabilitated housing; installation of low-flow toilets, shower heads, and
               appliances as required by revised State Building Code; better utilization of
               recycle water as appropriate; and encouraging retention of rainwater for
               residential use.
        Year: The City will review its standards within six months of adoption of the 2015-2023

               developers in including photovoltaic systems in their developments, and describes
               incentives, tax credits, funding, and application processes. The Tool Kit also
               provides information on calculating utility costs, so that better estimates can be
               made to determine the final cost of the “housing burden” (rent + utility costs), that
               cannot exceed 30 percent of each renter’s income. This will allow developers to
               determine how much can be spent per unit to realize a reasonable rate of return on
               their investment in energy efficiency and photovoltaic systems.

    I.     Introductions
    II.    Ginger gave a brief overview of the Housing Element and its relationship to the City’s
           General Plan and other planning documents. She went through the current housing element
           table of contents to give the task force an idea of what’s contained in a housing element.
    III.   Ginger mentioned the relationship to AB 375 and discussed the timeline for completion of
           the housing element update. She discussed the benefit of completing the housing element by
           the specified deadline and the disadvantage if that deadline isn’t met.
           a. Advantages include the opportunity for qualifying for grants with a HE certified by HCD
               (State Housing and Community Development Department), and the need to update the
               HE every 8 years, as opposed to every 4 years.
    IV.    Discussed the potential reasons for the increase in Persons per Household. Currently have
           3.87 persons per household. Possible reasons could be:
           a. More minor children per household (higher birthrate),
           b. Multi-generational households (that include grandparents and other relatives),
           c. Children staying at home longer because they can’t afford to go away for college, and

          d. Individuals being unemployed and needing to move in with other family members
  V.      Ginger discussed the role of the Task Force as well as the following items:
          a. Ginger White and Steve Brandt discussed the Population, Housing, and Land Availability
              parts of the housing element
          b. Discussed the need for input from Special Needs Groups
          c. Discussed the current progress with Cristobal reviewing and making revisions to Goals,
              Objectives, and Programs
          d. Discussed the variance of the City’s medium income between American FactFinder and
              Tulare County Housing Authority. QK concluded that $54,700 would be the median
              income used for this housing element update, as it is the figure determined by Tulare
              County to be used to determine eligibility for housing assistance. There was consensus
              among the task force that they agreed with that.
  VI.     Ginger discussed the status report on work completed to date. This included information
          about Constraints, which could include zoning, burdensome fees, or other issues outside the
          City’s control. Dean U. also mentioned that the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) had
          actually decreased after conversations with the LAFCo revealed that the City had “more than
          enough” land available for residential development in the next 10 years.
  VII.    Options for community outreach were discussed. Some potential opportunities could be:
          a. Open up task force meetings to the public
          b. Hold a separate meeting at the Senior Center or other venues
          c. Provide a questionnaire to be distributed at the Spring Fling, Rummage Sale, or other
              community events, and be available at the Senior Center or other locations
          d. Post the on-line survey through Facebook or the City’s website

VI. Constraints
    a. Constraints the City can improve:
             1. Representatives from Self Help Enterprises discussed the desire for the City to
                consider a fee deferral or fee waiver programs for low-income housing. They
                stated that rent payments don’t even cover operational costs. They
                recommended that deferral program be changed from 5 year to a 30 year
                deferral program. Self Help Enterprises to send Ginger White more information
                on fee deferral programs that are adopted in other jurisdictions.
             2. Self Help Enterprises indicated that Impact Fees are significantly higher in
                Dinuba than surrounding towns. Armondo asked why the cost difference
                between impact fees in the City of Dinuba vs. other small city jurisdictions.
             3. Dean explained how the nexus study depicts the costs of the impact fees and
                how the nexus study is currently being updated.
             4. Impact fees include fire and park fees but not fees for police. This is being
                considered during this impact fee nexus study.
             5. Building requirements
    b. Other constraints outside the City’s ability to control
             1. Housings units doesn’t determine the need for more schools. Even with no
                increasing in number of housing units, schools have experienced an increase in
                student enrollment.
             2. Drought could impact housing. This wasn’t a constraint during the last H.E.
                cycle.
             3. Discussed the effects of the real estate market crash. It was noted that price for
                land went up drastically once the school district started buying up land in a
                given area.
             4. SB75

                   5. Lenders being more flexible – the Housing Element Update needs to address the
                       changes in the market over the next 8 years, since they are bound to change
                       within this longer planning period.
  VII.    Schedule of tasks:
          a. Development of revised and new programs: April 7
                   1. Ginger discussed strategy for condensing goals/objectives/actions within excel
                       spreadsheet.
          b. Approval by Task Force and stakeholders, and recommendation to Planning Commission
             to send document to HCD: April 21
  VIII.   Additional Comments:
          a. Representative from Self Help Enterprises suggested that there be a goal added regarding
             Consolidated plans and the benefits of this type of funding. They will help to draft this
             goal.
          b. Sandy agreed to pass out the surveys at church.

 The meeting was called to order at approximately 8:05 AM
    I.     Welcome
    II.    Public Comment period (to allow members of the public to comments to the Task Force on
           issues related to the City’s Housing Element update)
           a. No public comment
    III.   Special Needs Groups information sheet
           a. Schools have a broader definition of homelessness
           b. Disabilities – physical vs. mental/cognitive
           c. Homeless (1) day survey is not representative of total Dinuba population
    IV.    Update on Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
           a. Ginger W handed out Chapter 2 and went over it
           b. Ginger W pointed out that zoning amendments, as specified as action items to get done
               per the last HE round, should be completed this year to show HCD that the City has taken
               action on meeting HE goals from the last round

    c. Discussed the importance of being realistic in the goals that are set so that they are
       attainable and to make sure that the goals, objectives and actions are specific to Dinuba
       and are not too general
    d. Ginger W asked if anyone had experience reviewing goals, objectives. Jayne Anderson
       stated that Dinuba staff has experience from previous HE round.
    e. Ginger W handed out a condensed version of Chapter 8 and stated that she had changed
       wording within the chapter to better match HCD language
    f. Ginger W will be reviewing the chapters with Cristobal within the upcoming weeks.
    g. Ginger W discussed potential action items from the last HE round that can be completed
       now, instead of carried through to later in the planning period.
    h. Ginger W discussed the importance of giving HCD a very thorough document so that
       there is not a lot of back-and-forth with the document like last time. She explained
       timing obstacles/constraints with the last HE for the City
    i. Ginger W explained how the HE update will address the senior population. For example,
       with 50% of the senior population having at least one disability, the HE should provide
       for additional one-story units versus two-story, and require fewer parking stalls since it is
       less common for senior citizens to be own more than one car per unit.
V.  Ginger W explained discrepancies with actions not corresponding with goals from the last
    HE cycle. Goals and actions will be adjusted to better meet the recommendations of HCD,
    and to better align Goals, Objectives, and Policies with the Actions needed.
VI. Additional Comments
    a. Jayne Anderson set up a meeting with Kings/Tulare Homeless Alliance to discuss
       Homeless needs/statistics
    b. Susan Atkins mentioned an upcoming conference in Sacramento regarding homelessness
    c. Ed Abair asked how Dinuba was going to recoup businesses and housing units that were
       lost by the recession
    d. Discussion on current water restrictions and how that will affect current city zoning
       requirements and HE text
    e. Armondo Apodaca mentioned that the Visalia City Council recently discussed possible
       incentives for residents who remove grass turf in their city and replace with drought-
       tolerant landscaping
    f. Ginger W will be picking up questionnaires on Friday, April 10th from Cristobal
          g. Sandy Sills volunteered to send the online questionnaire out to her Chamber, church and
              service clubs network

 The meeting was called to order at approximately 8:05 AM
    I.     Welcome
    II.    Public Comment period (to allow members of the public to comments to the Task Force on
           issues related to the City’s Housing Element update)
           a. No public comment
    III.   Review and Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes
    IV.    Update on Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
           a. GW gave a status update on the condition of the chapters
           b. GW noted that one action has the potential of supporting many goals
           c. GW reiterated that many actions did not get accomplished during the last planning period
               due to reasons such as lack of funding or availability of City staff
           d. GW stated that there are approximately 6-8 actions related to zoning text amendments
               carried over from the last planning period that can be considered in August when the City
               completes its annual Zoning Ordinance review. It is reasonable to think that at least
               some of these can be incorporated into the revised document this year before the Housing
               Element is approved by the City Council

   e. GW discussed new goals and actions to possibly be included in this updated Housing
      Element. Mentioned the language will need to be reviewed by the City, and for the City
      to provide any necessary feedback, and make any adjustments or additions.
   f. Mike Lane discussed impact fee calculations he did to show an impact fees comparison
      between the City of Dinuba and similar surrounding cities. He reiterated that Dinuba has
      some of the higher impact fees and that this should be discussed in the Constraints
      Chapter.
      Dan Meinert, Interim City Manager discussed the City’s impact fees and how they were
      calculated. The fees are collected to pay for the necessary improvements to existing
      infrastructure and for new infrastructure. He mentioned they are currently updating the
      impact fees and that the Park fee will be close to tripling in order to meet the needed park
      space quota for the next 20 years. Single-Family Development impact fees will be
      decreasing but Multi-Family Development will be increasing. There is a 5-year payment
      plan for developers to pay the impact fees, and in some situations fees can be deferred for
      10 years.
   g. Trinidad Rodriguez asked if there would be an issue with re-using the old goals?
      GW stated that it’s important to include the goals and actions that weren’t accomplished
      during the last planning period and to show that they will be re-visited during this
      upcoming planning period. Each goal and action is reviewed and summarized in
      Chapter 2, and describes why/how the City will be accomplishing the actions this time
      around.
   h. GW explained that there’s a new goal added to address the Governor’s most recent
      Executive Order relating to water-reduction. Dinuba has a 32% required water reduction
      rate
   i. GW explained a goal regarding parking reduction for multi-family developments.
      Requested again that the City will need to review all of the new goal/action language and
      provide any feedback as necessary
V. Discussion on Questionnaire Results
   a. GW went over the survey results for surveys received via hard copy and on-line.
      Mentioned those that responded are a fairly representative sample of the City’s
      population
   b. Made note that there were twice as many respondents than the last housing element
      cycle.
   c. A majority of those respondants said that the most important things to them were:
      healthy/safe neighborhoods, and maintaining neighborhood character

           d. Discussed some of the comments received on the questionnaires such as the want for
               more mobile housing availability and the wish for no more affordable housing units in
               the city because they thought it attracted an undesired population.
   VI.     Overall Document and Next Steps
           a. GW mentioned the chapters that still have holes and that QK is working with staff and
               other agencies to close those gaps.
           b. GW went over project schedule
            1. May 12 – Draft to City staff for review
            2. June 2 – Document goes to Planning Commission
           c. It’s important that the document is adequately reviewed now and not after it has gone to
               HCD or local approving bodies
           d. Brief discussion on larger household sizes
            1. No new census data until 2020 but American Community Survey updates their data
                more frequently.
VII.   GW thanks the members of the Task Force for their participation. Various members with
       expertise in their areas provided information for the Housing Element, such as data regarding
       homelessness, numbers of units constructed or rehabilitated, and background research on impact
       fees, and growth rates of various groups.
Meeting ended at approximately 8:50 AM

CITY OF DINUBA
                                     Housing Element Update
                                          Information Sheet
General Plan: Every city and county in California is required by law to have a general plan, which
includes goals, policies and related programs that act as a guide for future land use.
Housing Element: The general plan must include at least seven elements, one of which is the
Housing Element. The Housing Element is updated every five years, using information provided by
the Tulare Council of Governments, the U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources.
RHNA Plan: The Tulare County Council of Governments prepares a report that evaluates
expected growth in each of the cities, and determines the number of homes that will be needed in
each of five income levels to meet the needs of that city in the next planning period (2015 – 2023).
This is called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan (RHNA Plan).
Median Income: The 2014 median household income for the City of Dinuba was $54,700.
Income levels are:
        Extremely low income:           <30% of median                         < $16,410
        Very low income:                30 – 50% of median                     $16,411 to $27,350
        Low income:                     50-80% of median                       $27,351 to $43,760
        Moderate income:                80-120% of median                      $43,760 to $65,640
        Above moderate:                 > 120% of median                       > $65,641
Land for Affordable Homes: The RHNA Plan determined that the City will need to have
sufficient land available to build a total of 965 homes (dwelling units), with 374 homes affordable
by those with lower incomes by 2023. Specifically, they will need:
         105 dwelling units for those with Extremely Low Income
        106 dwelling units for those with Very Low Income
        163 dwelling units for those with Low Income
        121 dwelling units for those with Moderate Income
Housing Element Update: The City of Dinuba is currently updating its Housing Element. The
update will consist of:
       A review of the City’s current and expected population from 2015 through 2023, including
        those with special housing needs (i.e., seniors, large families, agricultural workers)
       A review of the City’s employment trends: the median income and cost of living, largest
        employers and typical wage ranges for jobs
       A review of the City’s current housing and housing values: vacancy rates, rent and sales
        prices, ages of homes, numbers and sizes of apartments
       An assessment of the goals, policies, and programs from the current Housing Element
       An evaluation of City land available and suitable for affordable housing
       A review of constraints that may prohibit/delay/not encourage housing affordable to those
        earning less than 80% of the median wage
       New/revised goals, policies, and programs to encourage planned growth and access to
        affordable housing

   What the Housing Element Update Means for the City of Dinuba
          The City of Dinuba is expected to grow 18.1% in the next eight years
          Approximately 38.8% of the housing needed by 2023 will be for the City’s low income
           residents (earn less than $43,760 in 2014 dollars)
          Many of the City’s residents have special housing needs. These include:
               o Seniors
               o Agricultural workers
               o Those with disabilities
               o Large households (with at least 5 people in the home)
               o Single parent households
          The City will need available land for at least 374 new affordable homes
               o Land must have water and other utilities available
               o Land should be close to services, businesses, and schools
               o Typically, the more dwelling units (apartments or homes) built on a parcel of
                   land, the lower the cost of land per unit. If two homes are built on an acre of
                   land, the land is valued at $50,000 per unit: if 20 homes are built on that land,
                   the land value is $5000 per unit.
Why Does This Matter to Me?
Housing for the City’s residents directly effect:
              Quality of life and the character of neighborhoods
              Number and location of schools
              Types of businesses and services offered
              Locations for parks and recreational facilities
              Ability of the City to support productive, gainful employment
              Safety/crime/health
This process is an opportunity to provide your input on topics such as:
            Options for affordable housing, including:
                   o Rehabilitation of existing homes/apartments
                   o Manufactured homes
                   o Second units (Granny Flats or In-law quarters)
                   o New, higher density homes/apartments on land close to services
            The need for housing for groups with special housing needs:
                   o Seniors
                   o Those with disabilities
                   o Agricultural workers
                   o Large households
                   o Single parent households
                   o Those who need emergency or temporary housing

                                      Hoja de Información
Plan General: Cada Ciudad y Condado de California requiere por ley un plan general, que
incluya objetivos, polícas y programas relacionados que actúan como una guía para

Que significa el Elemento de la Vivienda para la Ciudad de Dinuba
          La Ciudad de Dinuba espera creser 18.1% en ocho años
          Aproximadamente 38.8% de los residentes de la ciudad son considerados de bajos
           ingresos (sus ingresos fueron menos de $43,760 en el 2014)
          Muchos de los residentes de la Ciudad tienen necesidades especial de vivienda. Estos
           incluye:
               o Mayores (65 años y mas)
               o Los Trabajadores de Campo y Agricultura
               o Las personas con descapacidades
               o Familias numerosas (con al menos 5 personas en el hogar)
               o Hogares de Padres solteros
          La Ciudad tendrá disponible terrenos para al menos 374 nuevas viviendas asequibles
               o El terreno debe tener agua y otros servicios públicos disponibles
               o El terreno debe estar cerca de los servicios, negocios y escuelas
               o Típicamente, el más unidades de vivienda (casas o apartamentos) construidos
                  en una parcela reduce el costo por unidad en el terreno. Si dos casas se
                  construyen sobre un acre, El terreno tiene un valor de 50,000 dólares por
                  unidad: 20 hogares son construidos,el valor del teerreno es de $ 5000 por
                  unidad.

                                  GENERAL PLAN REQUIREMENTS
                                  While they allow considerable ﬂexibility, state planning laws do establish some
                                  requirements for the issues that general plans must address. The California
                                                                                                                                          INTRODUCTION
                                  Government Code establishes both the content of general plans and rules for
                                  their adoption and subsequent amendment. Together, state law and judicial
                                  decisions establish three overall guidelines for general plans.
                                  •   The General Plan must be comprehensive. This requirement has two
                                      aspects. First, the General Plan must be geographically comprehensive.
                                      That is, it must apply throughout the entire incorporated area and it should
                                      include other areas that the City determines are relevant to its planning.
                                      Second, the General Plan must address the full range of issues that affects
                                      the City’s physical development.
                                  •   The General Plan must be internally consistent. This requirement means
                                      that the General Plan must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them
                                      to each other without conﬂict. The internal consistency requirement has ﬁve
                                      dimensions: equal status among elements, consistency between elements,
                                      consistency within elements, area plan consistency and text and diagram
                                      consistency.
                                  •   The General Plan must be long-range. Since the General Plan affects the
                                      welfare of current and future generations, state law requires that the plan
                                      take a long-term perspective (§65300). The General Plan projects condi-
                                      tions and needs into the future as a basis for determining objectives. It also
                                      establishes long-term policies for day-to-day decision-making based upon
                                      those objectives.

                                  5.8 In designing new streets, consideration should be given to trafﬁc calm-
                                      ing mechanisms, such as bulb-outs at intersections, strategically placed
                                      roundabouts or trafﬁc circles, pedestrian refuges, and textured cross
                                      walks, among others (reference Table 2-1 in the Circulation Element for a

                                  5.9 Setbacks from the public street should be minimized to bring structures
                                      close to the street to encourage neighborhood interaction.
                                  5.10 Street orientation must be considered for optimum energy efﬁciency, with
                                       respect to solar access. As many homes as possible should be oriented                   b. All dwellings should feature a useable front porch that dominates the

                                  5.11 Utility services should be located underground.                                         c. Garages should be set back behind the front plane of the dwelling or
                                                                                                                                  should be set back and detached entirely.
