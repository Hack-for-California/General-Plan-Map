PURPOSE
The Natural Resources and Open Space Element, a legally required element, is included in this
General Plan to address and establish policies addressing the issues of natural resource con-
                                   servation and open space preservation within the City limits.
    Open space land is any         Open space in Pinole includes lands that are formally designat-
    parcel or area of land or      ed as open space by the General Plan, and lands that are des-
  water which is essentially       ignated for Parks and Recreation by the General Plan but are
   unimproved and devoted          largely undeveloped. Pinole’s natural resources and open
    to an open space use…          spaces are some of the City’s greatest assets. They serve to
    and which is designated        strengthen community identity, create a sense of place, and en-
      on a local, regional or      hance Pinole’s quality of life. This Element addresses resource
  state open space plan as:        conservation concerns within Pinole, including enhancement of
     (1) Open space for the        the environment through resource conservation and preserva-
     preservation of natural       tion of biological resources. Policies addressing water and
       resources, (2) Open         energy conservation are included in the Community Services
     space used for the ma-        and Facilities Element. This Element identifies the need to pro-
    naged production of re-        tect and preserve existing open space and natural recreational
   sources. (3) Open space         areas, the need to maintain those areas and create additional
   for outdoor recreation, or      open space and natural recreation areas for the enjoyment of
  (4) Open space for public        residents and the protection of the environment. It also ex-

       ment”1 and conservation practices provide for the needs of existing residents and businesses
       while preserving choices for future generations. Of particular importance to the Pinole Commu-
       nity is the preservation and enhancement of the Pinole Creek and Watershed, access and use
       of the Shoreline along San Pablo Bay, protection of the ridgelines around Pinole and the addi-
       tion of a portion of the Bay Trail in Pinole. The goals, policies, and implementation actions in this
       Element will foster the preservation of Pinole’s many valuable natural resources, including wild-
       life, habitat, water resources, soils, and mineral resources.
       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
       The goals, policies and implementation actions in the Natural Resources and Open Space Ele-
       ment highlight and complement those in other elements of this General Plan:
       Chapter 3:         The Community Character Element contains goals and policies to maximize pre-
                          servation of Pinole’s identity, public buildings, services and programs.
       Chapter 5:         The Land Use and Economic Development Element contains goals and policies
                          related to natural and man-made hazards, development constraints, conservation
                          policies that affect the potential siting of land uses, open space policies, and poli-
                          cies that integrate parks and open space into development are all addressed
       Chapter 7:         The Circulation Element addresses pedestrian trails, linkages for Pinole and
                          movement throughout the community.
       Chapter 8:         The Community Services and Facilities discusses open space trails in Pinole
                          Chapter
       Chapter 9:         The Health and Safety Element contains goals and policies related to water
                          quality.
       ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
       During public workshops and discussions with the Steering Committee and City Staff, many is-
       sues were raised regarding Natural Resources and Open Space. The goals, policies and im-
       plementation actions in this Element attempt to address these issues.
            1. Existing public access to Pinole Creek and the Shoreline is limited. Efforts to restore Pi-
                 nole Creek, implement the Bay Water Trail launch and the San Francisco Bay Trail will
                 help to maximize recreational opportunities in Pinole’s natural areas.
            2. Long-term strategic protection of resources, including additional open spaces, is needed
                 to ensure that Pinole’s high quality of life is maintained. Additional coordination with re-
       1
         Sustainable development practices refer to the use of architectural and planning methods that address the needs of
       the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Specific examples include
       the use of solar panels for energy conservation, placing jobs near housing to reduce vehicle trips, and infill develop-
       ment in urban areas to reduce the consumption of agricultural land. Policies related to Sustainability are identified
       with a     symbol.

    particularly the Sustainability,            restoration. Cooperation with other agencies and

                                                the impact of new development near sensitive re-
                                                sources.
    5. Ridgelines should be protected from development so they may serve the residents of Pi-
        nole as recreational and open space resources, community buffers and visual resources.
    6. Pinole’s wetlands are threatened by impacts from development.
    7. Open space areas are challenged by lack of adequate funding to assure that they are
        properly maintained.
    8. Both passive and active recreation needs should be addressed in open space areas.
NATURAL RESOURCES SETTING
Located on the edge of San Pablo Bay, Pinole’s natural resources include the San Pablo Bay
shoreline, creeks and ridges. These open spaces provide environmental protection and conser-
vation to numerous biotic resources. Pinole’s open space
is dispersed throughout the City, but is also fragmented
and discontinuous. A more contiguous system of pro-
tected open space and habitat for natural communities is
a desirable outcome of this General Plan.
PLANT AND ANIMAL HABITAT
The geography and climate of Pinole result in a number
of distinct habitat types, ranging from tall riparian forest
and well established coast live oak-bay forest to open
grassland and salt marsh. A total of 8 habitat types exist              View of Pinole Creek
within the plan area including annual grasslands, saline
emergent wetlands (salt marsh), coastal oak woodland, and coastal scrub (see Figure 10.1).
The Characteristics of these observed plant and animal habitats can be found in the Back-
ground Report. The acreages of habitat types mapped within the City are detailed in Table 10.1.
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 10.0-3

       Special-Status Species’ Habitats and Wetlands in Pinole
       Because the vegetation of Pinole ranges from highly disturbed annual grassland to coastal oak
       woodland and saline emergent wetland (salt marsh), it is likely that the City supports one or
       more of the special-status species known to occur in the region.
       The steep slopes of the surrounding hillsides appear to be well drained and are not likely to
       support wetlands or other features which would fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps
       of Engineers. The lower slopes and valley floor are largely developed and landscape does not
       appear to support any areas where water is ponded or where jurisdictional features may occur.
       Pinole Creek, which drains through the middle of the city, is a perennial creek and is likely to
       support wetlands or other jurisdictional features along the channel and its tributaries.
       Threatened and Endangered Species
       The California Department of Fish and game have determined that the San Pablo Bay wa-
       tershed is home to more than ten threatened or endangered species. The San Pablo Bay wa-
       tershed (Reference Number 18050002) is grouped in the highest category, Priority I (Impaired),
       by the State of California. The San Pablo Bay watershed is home to over 10 threatened or en-
       dangered species.
       Invasive Species
       The City of Pinole is home to several invasive species. Invasive plant species such as giant
       reed (Arundo donax), Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitia-
       lis), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor) and many others are established in segments of Pi-
       nole Creek.

       NATURAL RESOURCES AN D OPEN SPACE
Soils Resources
There are 23 mapped soil series within the City of Pinole. These soil units can be seen on the
map presented as Figure 10.2. The soils themselves are described in the Background Report.
OPEN SPACE SETTING
Open spaces, trails, and natural resources provide active and passive recreation opportunities
for residents and visitors. Providing a protected open
space network for the future of Pinole is a cornerstone of
sustainable community development. Pinole’s existing
open spaces include lands held by the City of Pinole as
parkland and trails, and lands held by the East Bay Re-
gional Park District as regional parklands. These lands
provide City residents with an array of recreational op-
portunities, complemented by City-owned and main-
tained neighborhood parks.
The City intends to add to its open space system over
time to accommodate future recreation needs and pro-
tect natural resources as opportunities arise and long-
term land management and maintenance partnerships
                                                                        Part of the Bay Trail in Pinole
can be formed.
Please refer to the Community Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8) for a full discussion
on parks, trails and recreational facilities.
Existing Open Space
Residents of Pinole benefit from substantial open space and natural resources in various forms
of ownership. The City itself has large holdings, while other parcels are held by homeowners
associations, the West Contra Costa Unified School District, and the Contra Costa County Flood
Control District, EBMUD, as well as private landowners. There is also an extensive array of re-
gional open space lands in and adjacent to the City. These, combined with marsh and wetland
                                           sites along San Pablo Bay add to the availability of recr-
                                           eational open space in Pinole.
                                           Despite the abundance of parks and open space in and
                                           adjacent to the City, the current system is fragmented
                                           and does not function as an integrated community-wide
                                           open space and recreation system or contiguous wildlife
                                           habitat. Policies contained in this Plan provide an orga-
                                           nizing framework for Pinole’s open space resources.

       Regional Open Space Preserves
       City-Owned Unimproved Parkland
       Residents in Pinole use existing open space areas to walk, appreciate the area’s natural beauty,
       hike, bird-watch, jog, and to socialize with friends.2 There are several unimproved park and
       open public space areas in the City of Pinole. These preserves cover approximately 343.5 acres
       in the City limits (see Table 10.2).

       Additional land has been preserved in Pinole Valley Park and the Crown Ridge Subdivision
       (Marsten Ranch).
       The Fire and Public Works Departments are jointly responsible for the maintenance of open
       space and parks in Pinole. The Fire Department’s maintenance responsibilities include vegeta-
       tion control for fire prevention and safety. The Public Works Department is responsible for all
       other maintenance activities.
       The Recreation and Facility Master Plan identifies three park categories, including undeveloped
       parks. Undeveloped parks are defined as open space with no amenities. The Recreation Park
       and Facility Master Plan does not provide standards, guidelines or management plans for the
       undeveloped parks. Without standards, guidelines or management plans for undeveloped parks,
       Pinole’s City-owned open spaces may not be permanently protected. Additionally, the lack of
       management plans makes it difficult for the City to appropriately balance the competing needs
       of natural resources, people and varying recreational uses in open spaces. Policies contained in
       this element provide a framework for beginning to protect open spaces independent of other
       City park lands, and balance the needs of habitat and people on open space lands.

        Regional and Local Trails
        City of Pinole Trails
        Residents in Pinole use the City’s trails to run, bike, walk,
        and to find solitude. The City of Pinole Recreation Depart-
        ment maintains both regional and local pedestrian and hik-
        ing trails for recreational use by residents and visitors. Pi-
        nole’s paved pedestrian trails include:
                 Pinole Creek Trail (from I-80 to Bayfront Park);
                 Portions of the Bay Trail (1/6 of a mile) located at the
                 end of Pinole Shores Drive;
                 (1/4 of a mile) around Bayfront Park; and
                 Sarah Drive Trail (1/6 of a mile) leading to Hoke Court and Stewart Elementary School.
        The City of Pinole Recreation Department does not maintain an inventory or map of trails in un-
        improved parks, but plans to prepare an inventory of trail facilities and develop a list of trails with
        a map of and directions to each trail.
                                               Trails, including the San Francisco Bay Trail, are discussed
                                               further in the Circulation Element, (Chapter 7) and the Sus-

                                               The diverse open space system in Pinole contributes to the
                                               community’s unique visual qualities. The City’s San Pablo
                                               Bay shoreline, creeks (particularly Pinole Creek), ridgelines
                                               and other areas, as well as the historic qualities of Old
                                               Town, are focal points recognizable from many locations in
        the City. Preservation of existing and future open space areas will ensure the continuation of the
        City’s unique visual qualities.
        The Community Character Element (Chapter 3) discusses built visual resources in Pinole and
        their contribution to the community’s character.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS
What follows are the goals corresponding policies and implementation actions of this element.
GOALS
       Goal OS1: Ensure the preservation of natural resources by determining appropriate land
       use and compatibility with natural resources and open space.
       Goal OS2: Sustain, protect, and enhance natural communities, including special-status
       plants, special status wildlife, and comply with all applicable Federal, State and local
       regulatory and trustee agencies.
       Goal OS3: Protect, preserve, and restore open spaces.
       Goal OS4: Provide a network of trails linking open spaces and recreation opportunities.
       Goal OS5: Provide community stewardship of open spaces.
       Goal OS6: Protect scenic visual resources that help define and distinguish Pinole as a
       unique and desirable community.
       Goal OS7: Secure adequate funding for on-going open space preservation and steward-
       ship.
       Goal OS8: Ensure Excellent Water Quality and Secure Water Supply for Human and
       Natural Communities.
POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS
GOAL OS.1      Ensure the preservation of natural resources by determining appropriate land use
               and compatibility with natural resources and open space.
POLICY OS.1.1     Habitat Preservation. The City shall protect and preserve open space and
                  remaining natural areas. Preserve oak/woodland, riparian vegetation, creeks,
                  fisheries, saltwater and freshwater marsh, native bunchgrass grasslands,
                  wildlife corridors and sensitive nesting sites. Loss of these habitats should be
                  fully offset through creation of habitat of equal value. Compensation rate for

Action OS.1.4.1     Consider developing a Wetland inventory that identifies the location and
                    extent of wetlands within the City of Pinole.
Action OS.1.4.2     Explore establishing development standards that can be used to avoid
                    and protect wetland resources.
Action OS.1.4.3     Continue to coordinate with Federal and State Agencies to ensure that
                    necessary permits are issued for work in or near to identified wetlands.
Action OS.1.4.4     Continue to employ mitigation measures to reduce potential wetland im-
                    pacts to a less than significant level.
Action OS.1.4.5     Continue to incorporate passive surface runoff management into project
                    design in order to protect water quality and preserve natural drainage
                    functions.
Action OS.1.4.6     Continue efforts to restore natural waterway functions within the Pinole
                    Watershed.
POLICY OS.1.5   Integrated Management. Work toward integrated management of tidal areas
                and drainages within the City limits.
Action OS.1.5.1     Require new developments to minimize the amount of off-site drainage,
                    maintain natural drainage channels, and avoid alteration of off-site drai-
                    nage courses and impacts on downstream resources and tidal areas.
POLICY OS.1.6   Access to Wetlands. Provide appropriate access to wetlands.
Action OS.1.6.1     Explore developing guidelines and standards that will ensure visual
                    access to Pinole wetlands while establishing limits on physical access in
                    order to protect wetlands resources.
POLICY OS.1.7   Transitional Zones. The City will condition or modify development approvals
                to ensure that natural transitions along the edges of different habitat types are
                preserved and enhanced because of their importance to wildlife. Maintain
                proper buffers between sensitive habitat and conflicting land uses. Habitat
                types of particular concern are those along the margins of riparian corridors,
                marshlands, and oak woodlands. Preserves and areas with special conserva-
                tion status must have compatible surrounding land uses.
Action OS.1.7.1     Establish development standards that protect upland areas surrounding
                    riparian habitat, and buffer areas adjacent to oak woodlands and other
                    resources. These policies may include:

                                 c. Tree protection measures.
        POLICY OS.1.8       Habitat Restoration. The City shall implement a re-vegetation plan which
                            aims to identify and prioritize areas planned for habitat restoration. Areas
                            planned for restoration may provide special-status species habitat, connec-
                            tivity of wildlife corridors, transitional zones in between natural areas and in-
                            compatible land uses, or expansion of ecological functions such as flood
                            management and water quality.
        Action OS.1.8.1          Support restoration objectives for local habitat types identified in regional
                                 environmental planning documents. Where reasonably possible, attempt
                                 to restore lost or damaged habitat.
        Action OS.1.8.2          Establish riparian and stream restoration programs that include erosion
                                 control measures, stream clean-up projects, and revegetation plans for
                                 denuded areas.
        GOAL OS.2       Sustain, protect, and enhance natural communities, including special-status
                        plants, special status wildlife, and comply with all applicable Federal, State and
                        local regulatory and trustee agencies.
        POLICY OS.2.1       Protection of Native Vegetation. Protect, preserve and create the conditions
                            that will promote the preservation of significant trees and other vegetation,
                            particularly native to California and the region.
        Action OS.2.1.1          Periodically evaluate the tree preservation zoning regulations to ensure
                                 that adequate tree protection is provided.
        Action OS.2.1.2          The City will continue to implement tree protection programs to preserve
                                 significant trees or groves of trees as part of the City’s heritage.
        POLICY OS.2.2       Invasive Species. The City shall attempt to prevent further expansion of inva-
                            sive species and protect against noxious weeds through public education and
                            development review of projects that occur adjacent to natural areas. These
                            efforts shall include requiring the planting of native vegetation that supports
                            native terrestrial and aquatic animal species.
        POLICY OS.2.3       Invasive Species. Consider adopting guidelines and standards to help protect

                erty; and support efforts that enhance habitat by replacing invasive, non-
                native vegetation with native California plant species over time within the City.
Action OS.2.3.1 The City shall work with local agencies to develop an approach to controlling
                the spread of non-native invasive species and reducing their extent on both
                public and private land, including developing an invasive species removal
                program.
Action OS.2.3.2 New development should incorporate native vegetation into landscape plans
                and discourage the use of invasive, non-native plant species.
Riparian Areas
POLICY OS.2.4   Riparian Areas and Creek Setbacks. Lands adjacent to riparian areas shall
                be protected as public or private permanent open space through dedication
                or easements. Riparian vegetation outside the setback should also be pro-
                tected. Riparian areas within the City include but are not limited to: (1) Pinole
                Creek (2) Catty Creek (3) Duncan Canyon/Cole Creek; (4) Shady Draw; (5)
                Faria Creek and (6) Roble Creek and shall be protected from further degrada-
                tion and enhanced during review of adjacent proposed development.
Action OS.2.4.1     Continue implementing the Pinole Creek Watershed Vision Plan and pur-
                    sue related riparian and stream restoration programs.
Action OS.2.4.2     Establish minimum separation between creeks and adjoining develop-
                    ment.

                getation to the extent feasible, projects shall mitigate impacts to wetlands
                consistent with Federal and State policies to ensure that there is no lest loss
                in a regional context.
POLICY OS.2.6   Riparian Mitigation. Impacts to riparian habitats shall be mitigated at a no net
                loss of existing function and value based on field survey and analysis of the
                riparian habitat to be impacted.
POLICY OS.2.7   Integrated Creek Management. The City will encourage and cooperate with
                Contra Costa County and other responsible agencies to plan and implement
                an integrated management plan for the long-term conservation and restora-

        Wildlife Corridors
        POLICY OS.2.8       Maintain and Improve Wildlife Movement Corridors. Continuous wildlife habi-
                            tat, including corridors free of human disruption, shall be preserved and
                            where necessary created by interconnecting open spaces, wildlife habitat and
                            corridors.
        POLICY OS.2.9       Wildlife Movement Corridor Mitigation. The City will condition development
                            permits in accordance with applicable mitigation measures to ensure that im-
                            portant corridors for wildlife movement and dispersal are protected. Features
                            of particular importance to wildlife include riparian corridors, wetlands, bay
                            shorelines, and protected natural areas with cover and water. Linkages and
                            corridors shall be provided to maintain connections between habitat areas.
        Action OS.2.9.1          Consider adopting an Open Space Management Plan that includes crite-
                                 ria to ensure free movement of wildlife throughout the City.
        GOAL OS.3       Protect, preserve, and restore open spaces.
        POLICY OS.3.1       Continuous Open Space Planning. Plan for connectivity of open spaces and
                            wildlife habitat and corridors using species area plans, neighborhood plans,
                            subdivision maps or other applicable planning processes, consistent with
                            Open Space Guidelines.
        POLICY OS.3.2       Regional Planning. Coordinate with Contra Costa County and adjoining juris-
                            dictions, federal and state agencies to assure regional connectivity of open
                            space and wildlife corridors.
        POLICY OS.3.3       Cluster Development. Encourage cluster development and other creative site
                            planning techniques to preserve open space, trails and visual, habitat,
                            recreation and archaeological resources.
        POLICY OS.3.4       Conserve Sensitive Resources. The City shall direct development away from
                            “sensitive biological resource” areas, unless effective mitigation measures
                            can be implemented.
        Action OS.3.4.1          The City shall adopt policies to conserve and enhance the City’s biologi-
                                 cal resources in a manner which facilitates orderly development and re-
                                 flects the sensitivities and constraints of these resources.
        POLICY OS.3.5       Buffers for Sensitive Resources. When activities close to open space re-
                            sources within or outside the urban area could harm these resources, the City
                            will require buffers between the activities and the resources. The City will ac-

                policy. Buffers associated with new development shall be on the site of the
                development, rather than on neighboring land containing the open space re-
                source. Buffers provide distance in the form of setbacks, within which certain
                features or activities are not allowed or conditionally allowed. Buffers shall al-
                so use techniques such as planting and wildlife-compatible fencing. Buffers
                shall be adequate for the most sensitive species in the protected area, as de-
                termined by a qualified professional and shall complement the protected
                area’s habitat values. Buffers shall be required in the following situations:
                    Between urban development – including parks and public facilities – and
                    natural habitat such as creeks, wetlands, rocky outcrops and grassland
                    features to address noise, lighting, storm runoff, spread of invasive, non-
                    native species, and access by people and pets.
                    Between agricultural operations and natural habitat, to address noise,
                    chemical use, sediment transport, and livestock access.

                                    SUSTAINABILITY
INTRODUCTION
The role of local governments is becoming increasingly important in combating climate change
through setting policies for future community actions. The Pinole General Plan incorporates
sustainable policies and programs throughout all elements of the plan. The Sustainability
Element creates a framework within which the City will link these elements and identify
programs to implement sustainable policies and practices to improve the quality of life and
public health, increase energy efficiency and reduce waste by utilizing more sustainable and
compact development patterns, encourage alternative forms of transportation, and establish
programs to minimize the waste stream and improve water quality.
Pinole places high value on civic and economic self-sufficiency and maintaining a mix of
housing options to allow Pinole seniors to “age in place” without leaving their community and
support system, and to allow Pinole’s youth to remain in the community as they start families.
The Sustainability Element supports land use patterns and programs that will enhance
opportunities to improve ecological conditions, enhance the local economy, and provide equal
job, housing, education, recreation, and transportation opportunities. The Sustainability Element
is also the General Plan chapter that most allows Pinole to address local climate change issues
by setting goals and policies to guide Pinole’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
(GHGs), encourage renewable energy sources, expand local use of green technology, and
educate Pinole’s residents on how they can live fully while preserving Pinole for future
generations.
Below is a visual representation of the concept of sustainability in Pinole. The overarching
themes of fiscal health, community tapestry, and environmental stewardship shape the goals,
policies, and actions in this element, as well as the General Plan.
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 11.0-1

                                           SUSTAINABILITY FOR PINOLE
              A sustainable Pinole is a community where members meet their needs and express their
              greatest potential in the present and plan and act for the ability to maintain these ideals
              indefinitely.
              It is a place where people live, work and thrive in a healthy and vibrant community. In a
              sustainable Pinole,
                   the natural environment is protected and enhanced,
                   the community’s small-town character and history is celebrated and preserved,
                   there is economic opportunity and security for businesses and economic variety for
                   residents,
                   each member of the community’s needs are provided for,
                   the community is visually and physically connected,
                   opportunities to play and relax are abundant,
                   arts are encouraged and promoted, and
                   decision making takes a whole-systems approach and includes the entire community.
              Having a sustainable Pinole is a journey rather than a destination. The immediate and
              long-term well-being of the city and its citizens is protected and enhanced while providing
              the highest quality of life possible.
                 Since sustainability is at the core of the General Plan, sustainable policies are
                 described within each element. To make sustainable policies easier to recognize, they
                 are identified with a recognizable icon. The Sustainability Element describes existing
                 City programs and policies that support sustainable land use and describe new goals,
                 policies, objectives and programs that will keep Pinole sustainable in the future.
       SUSTAINABILITY IN PINOLE
       Given its small size and the built out nature of the community, Pinole is already practicing
       sustainable development in a variety of ways in order to optimize use of limited resources.
       Notable among the City’s recent programs are:
                Partnership with the County and other sustainability partners
                Acceptance of the Pinole Creek Vision, Master Plan and Restoration Project.
                Consideration of alternative sewage disposal and treatment.
                Waste management through an e-waste program and City-sponsored community garage
                sales and/or other recycling events.

        Completion of a Greenhouse Gas Inventory to establish a baseline level of greenhouse
        gas (GHG) emissions within Pinole.
        PDAs. All three of Pinole’s main corridors (San
        Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian
        Way) have been designated as Potential Priority
        Development Areas (PDAs) by ABAG. As part of
        a region-wide planning effort, Pinole seeks to
        focus housing development along with amenities
        and services to meet the day-to-day needs of
        residents in a pedestrian-friendly environment
        served by transit.
        Three Corridor Specific Plan – The City has
                                                               Moderate Density Housing on a Multi-
        prepared a draft plan for the three main                   Modal Transportation Corridor
        commercial corridors in Pinole (as discussed
        further in the Land Use and Economic
        Development Element and Circulation Element) and will adopt a Specific Plan to
        promote more compact development along these corridors, mixed housing types,
        alternative design guidelines, enhancement of the cultural resource of Old Town Pinole,
        alternative modes of transportation and an improved jobs/housing balance.
        Stormwater Management – Pinole has joined the State of California and Contra Costa
        County in implementing programs that reduce impervious surfaces and clean stormwater
        runoff before it enters San Pablo Bay.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
A Sustainability Element is not a State-mandated general plan element. The City of Pinole is the
first community in Contra Costa County to prepare a sustainability element to help guide future
land use within the City. The Sustainability Element of the Pinole General Plan is adopted
pursuant to the authority granted to local jurisdictions by Section 65303 of the Government
Code of the State of California, which states:
The general plan may include any other elements or address other subjects which, in the
judgment of legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.
Individual General Plan Elements must be consistent with each other. The General Plan
Elements that must be coordinated with the Sustainability Element to ensure consistency
include Land Use and Economic Development (density and location of land uses), Community
Services and Facilities (energy, conservation, green building, etc.), Natural Resources and
Open Space Element (man-made hazards, development constraints, and open space policies),
Health and Safety, Housing, and Circulation (movement through the community, including
bicycle and pedestrian circulation).
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 11.0-3

                                          SUSTAINABILITY
       The City of Pinole has previously established many
       sustainable policies and programs which are detailed in
       the Background Report.
       ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES
       The following issues reflect the values important to the
       residents of Pinole, as well as address the areas of
       concern. Each issue area defines an objective that
       Pinole will use to set goals that will lead the City to
       become more sustainable.
                                                                             Pinole Senior Center
                Social Sustainability: Fostering community
                participation (in the planning process and in the community itself), access to public
                resources/open space, physical access to the community (transportation), equal access
                to a variety of housing opportunities that are compatible with the City’s workforce,
                fostering a vibrant community that draws a mix of people from different age groups,
                cultural backgrounds, and interests.
                Economic Sustainability: Access to a variety of local jobs, fostering local green
                businesses and products (reduces need for transportation of goods that consumes fossil
                fuels), reliance on local businesses to serve local needs, promotion of home-based
                businesses, and community-supported agriculture.
                Environmental Sustainability: Protecting and conserving natural resources and habitats,
                promoting renewable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, reducing waste,

ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
The City will maintain a sense of environmental responsibility which entails living in balance with
the natural coastal, riparian and hillside environmental subsystems within Pinole. The city’s rich
and varied natural features, scenic vistas, ecosystems, and biodiversity should be protected
from further intrusion, disruption, consumption and fragmentation.
Pinole’s environmental responsibility covers several different areas: greenhouse gas emissions,
water resources, solid waste, transportation, compact development, open space,
environmentally sensitive lands.
        Promote sustainable energy, water, and resource use.
        Encourage energy-efficient “green buildings” as certified by the U.S. Green Building
        Council’s LEED Program or equivalent certification.
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 11.0-5

                                          SUSTAINABILITY
                Expand the use of green practices in both the public and private sectors.
                Address the City’s contribution to climate change while preparing for the potential
                impacts from climate change on the community.
                Establish a green building and environmentally preferable purchasing program for City
                operations and facilities.
                Support ongoing and expanded recycling efforts within the community.
                Reduce hillside erosion and threats to coastal ecosystem health, as discussed further in
                the Health and Safety Element (Chapter 9).
       Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The City will manage its own operations to be as pollution-free
       as possible. The City will work with other agencies and organizations to help educate citizens in
       ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and employ best available practices in City
       operations. “Best available practices” means behavior and technologies that produce the least
       air pollutants for a desired outcome, considering available equipment, life-cycle costs, recycled
       material content, social and environmental side effects
       and the regulations of other agencies.
       Sustainable Water Resources. The City will prudently
       manage water resources to sustain plant and animal life,
       support urban activities, and protect public health and
       safety. The City will manage water use and disposal to:
                Pursue long-term reductions in the volume of
                discharge to the San Pablo Bay (Bay) through
                reuse of wastewater and the increase of Low
                Impact Development.                                          Water Efficient Gardening
                Pursue long-term reductions of the mass discharge of each pollutant to the creeks and
                Bay through a combination of effluent reuse, pollutant decreases and stormwater
                pollutant decreases.
                Pursue long-term reductions of pollutant concentrations in the ecosystem (air, water and
                land) from the residuals generated by the water pollution control and treatment plants.
                Ensure a sustainable water supply to support the expected future growth of Pinole.
                Use natural systems to maintain and enhance environmental quality by having them
                perform such functions as cleaning air and water, and controlling storm water runoff.
       Solid Waste. The City will promote efforts designed to reduce the amount of solid waste
       generated and ensure that generated waste is recycled or efficiently disposed of in an
       environmentally safe manner.

                                    SUSTAINABILITY
Transportation. The City will promote accessible, attractive, economically viable and
environmentally sound transportation options that meet the needs of residents, employers,
employees and visitors for safe, convenient and efficient travel by a variety of methods. This
element will encourage concentration of future development along Pinole’s three primary
transportation corridors and will set a policy to replace the City’s vehicle fleet with hybrid fuel
and other viable alternative fuel vehicles.
Compact Development. The physical form of the city will support energy efficiency and the use
of sustainable energy sources through more compact development and diverse housing
opportunities to achieve more efficient use of public facilities and services, and land resources,
and to improve the jobs/housing balance.
Open Space. The City will seek to conserve lands of scenic and recreational value and to use
open space and parks to serve as community buffers between Pinole and its neighbors.
Preserving open space and reforestation can also help Pinole offset greenhouse gas emissions.
Environmentally Sensitive Lands. The City will endeavor to conserve natural habitat,
preserve connections between habitats, minimize impact to watershed functions including water
quality and flood protection, and avoid natural hazards.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Though greenhouse gas emissions were discussed above in Environmental Systems, climate
change has become such a priority for local governments that it is a separate issue area for
Pinole to address. The City has set goals, policies, and implementation actions that guide
Pinole’s efforts to address climate change while also preparing the city for the adverse effects of
climate change.
A large part of the City’s response to climate change will be reducing the City’s greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions from energy, waste, and transportation sources while embracing the
expansion of the city’s green infrastructure and green technology and industry. By addressing
climate change and reducing GHG emissions, Pinole will become a more sustainable city.
Reducing GHG emissions improves a city’s air quality, improves public health, boosts the local
economy, and reduces damage to the city’s environmental systems.
AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, codified the State’s goal of reducing GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. This act defined a number of milestones to be met by the
State and vested principle authority in the California Air Resources Board (CARB). In addition,
there are a number of other important statutes and regulations affecting GHG emissions and
providing incentive funding to support climate change action efforts. The Background Report
addresses the regulatory framework in more detail.
Potential Impacts
There are have been many studies in the past few years that have found that human activities
are a major influence on climate change by changing the composition of the atmosphere and
modifying the land surface. Increases of GHGs in the atmosphere result in an increase in
                                                                        CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 11.0-7

       average global temperatures.1 In 2006, climate modeling was performed by the California
       Energy Commission that determined possible future impacts of climate change in California.
       The results showed increasing smog and unhealthy air, hotter and more dangerous
       temperatures in the summer, less snowfall which means reduced water supplies, increasing
       numbers of wildfires, and a rise in sea level by as much as 3 meters by the end of the century.
       See the Health and Safety Element (Chapter 9) for more discussion on these impacts and their
       effects on Pinole.
       Local Government Actions
       In June, 2009, the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA) prepared a
       report on ways for local governments to address climate change. They determined that there
       are five core areas of local government operations responsible for climate change. Those areas
       are energy use, waste and recycling, water delivery and wastewater treatment, transportation,
       and the built environment. Pinole has addressed those five core areas in the goals, policies,
       and implementation actions set in this Element and in the Community Character Element,
       Growth Management Element, Land Use and Economic Development Element, Circulation
       Element, Community Services and Facilities Element, and Natural Resources and Open Space
       Element.
       GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS IN OTHER
       ELEMENTS
       All of the other General Plan Elements help enhance the sustainability of Pinole. As mentioned
       above, the specific policies that are considered sustainable are identified by the leaf symbol. In
       this General Plan, some of the major areas of sustainable development and policies that will
       affect and improve sustainable growth for Pinole for now and into the future are:
            1. Create opportunities for more compact development along transportation corridors.
            2. Promote alternative modes of transportation.
            3. Preserve Industry and promote Green Industry.
            4. Create opportunities for diverse housing types affordable to all income levels.
            5. Protect open space, resources and sensitive habitats.
            6. Protect and promote a healthy community.
       These policies will support a sustainable community by reducing Pinole’s dependence on non-
       renewable natural resources and its production of wastes, while improving livability and

   Sustainable development practices refer to the use of architectural and planning methods that address the needs
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Specific examples
include the use of solar panels for energy conservation, placing jobs near housing to reduce vehicle trips, and infill
development in urban areas to reduce the consumption of agricultural land. Policies related to sustainability are
identified with a   symbol.

                               COMMUNITY CHARACTER
      The Community Character Element seeks to identify and protect locally important sites,
      buildings and memorabilia that reflect the history of the community. It also seeks to honor the
      people of Pinole by promoting the inclusion of cultural arts into the fabric of the community as a
      component that contributes to the overall quality of life for residents, workers and visitors. The
      element provides goals, policies and implementation actions designed to recognize and
      preserve the history of the area and celebrate the diversity of the city’s population.
      Finally, developers should take advantage of Pinole’s primary circulation corridors when looking
      to locate future projects. While maintaining Pinole’s established building massing and scale, this
      element will also attempt to focus future development in certain
      priority development areas. Future development in Pinole should
                                                                               While it is the Community

      RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
      The Community Character Element relates to several other local, regional and state plans and
      programs, which are listed in detail in the Appendix.
      ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
      Pinole is defined by its natural and man-made features. The natural setting includes the Bay
      shoreline, open spaces, Pinole Creek and other watersheds, and a hillside topography. The
      physical setting is primarily defined by the transportation and circulation corridors that divide the
      city into zones, a cohesive ―Old Town,‖ and other commercial and residential development in
      the community. These natural and physical features are described in greater detail below.

                         COMMUNITY CHARACTER
NATURAL SETTING
In many respects, Pinole is a city of visual contrasts. Pinole’s varied geography includes
marshlands along San Pablo Bay, Pinole Creek running through the city, and valleys separated
by small ridgelines within the city boundaries. The marshlands along the Bayshore and steep
ridgelines have placed certain limitations on development.
Bayshore
The Pinole shoreline is developed with a sewage treatment plant, Union Pacific Railroad's ―Cal-
P‖ main line (with more than 30 Amtrak trains a day) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe’s
(BNSF) line. Pinole is located in an area that transitions naturally from San Pablo Bay, through
lowlands, and then to hillsides that increase in slope to the Briones Hills. Consequently, the city
has an abundance of open space and preserved areas that provide both recreational and
environmental benefits and challenges to potential development. Pinole’s many residential
neighborhoods are nestled among the hillside topography.
The Pinole shoreline presents a complex land use challenge due to the existence of significant
infrastructure (e.g., sewage disposal facility and railroads) in an area that has played a vital role
in the history of Pinole and that contains high natural
resource value. As the City makes plans to preserve
and/or expand necessary infrastructure, enhance
recreation opportunities, preserve natural resources and
honor Pinole’s heritage, there is a tremendous
opportunity for the City to create a cohesive image for
the waterfront.
Open Space
Open space provides a critical visual and physical
connection to the natural environment and habitat for a             An example of Pinole open space
rich diversity of plant and animal species and is an
integral part of Pinole’s landscape and community
character. A great deal of Pinole’s open space is found along the San Pablo Bay shoreline and
along the steep ridgelines throughout the city.
Issues of open space are further addressed in the Natural Resources and Open Space Element
(Chapter 10), which defines, describes and maps a variety of types of open space in Pinole.
Pinole Creek
Pinole Creek has greatly influenced development in the City of Pinole. Issues regarding Pinole
Creek are addressed in the Land Use and Economic Development Element (Chapter 5), Health
and Safety Element (Chapter 9), Natural Resources and Open Space Element (Chapter 10),
and Sustainability Element (Chapter 11).

      The Pinole Creek Vision Plan and Pinole Creek
      Greenway Master Plan set forth more information about
      the creek and its future. The Pinole Creek Restoration
      Project outlines development plans to restore high-
      quality riparian habitat, provide additional flood protection
      and improve water quality in Pinole Creek. This project
      will also enhance recreation by connecting Old Town
      Pinole to the Bay Trail by means of a multipurpose path
      and will provide a launch for non-motorized boats at the
      mouth of the creek as part of the San Francisco Bay
      Area Water Trail backbone.

      Watersheds
      The Pinole Creek watershed covers approximately 15 square miles of west Contra Costa
      County, extending from the headwaters in the Briones Hills to the outfall at San Pablo Bay north
      of Point Pinole. Approximately 30 percent of the watershed is owned and managed by the East
      Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD). Though these holdings are located outside of the City
      of Pinole, their use and management are crucial to the City’s water quality, resource
      enhancement and flood protection objectives. Recent discussions have included the possible
      use of the EBMUD property for possible mitigation land banking and floodwater diversion
      basins.
      Topography
      Physical development in the City of Pinole is substantially influenced by topographic conditions
      that include a fairly steep shoreline, distinct valleys that are separated by small ridgelines, and a
      comparatively level alluvial plane at the mouth of Pinole Creek. Originally, development
      occurred primarily in Pinole’s valleys and commercial activity was most prevalent in Old Town,
      adjacent to San Pablo Bay and Pinole Creek. Beginning in the late 1950s, residential and
      commercial development expanded into surrounding uplands.
      PHYSICAL SETTING
      The City of Pinole is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, on the shores of San Pablo Bay in
      west Contra Costa County. Interstate 80, which traverses the city, connects the San Francisco
                                                and Oakland metropolitan areas with Sacramento and
                                                other communities to the east. Pinole is linked to central
                                                Contra Costa County and the cities of Martinez, Concord
                                                and Pleasant Hill by State Route 4, which begins just
                                                north of Pinole and connects with Interstate 680. San
                                                Pablo Avenue serves as one of the main arterials
                                                through Pinole and intersects with Tennent Avenue and
                                                Appian Way.

                          COMMUNITY CHARACTER
Pinole’s physical character is largely influenced and characterized by the city’s topographical
diversity and the major arterial roads that extend throughout the city.
The City of Pinole is defined in large part by its physical development. The general layout and
extent of Pinole began to emerge almost 100 years ago. Residential development through the
late 1950s further defined this development pattern, and with commercial center development in
the 1960s and more recently with Pinole Vista Shopping Center, the city now stands largely built
out.
Downtown Pinole
Old Town Pinole still maintains its historic and small-town feel and is characterized by older
buildings with unique architecture and commercial and residential uses. Old Town Pinole hosts
the majority of historic buildings in the city. Today, Old Town Pinole still serves as the downtown
area of the city and includes the Senior Center, Fire and Police Department offices/station,
Fernandez Park, City Hall and the Bank of Pinole building, as well as several other community
services and facilities.
The pedestrian experience in Old Town Pinole is enhanced by shops, restaurants and retail
fronting onto the street, thereby providing a street façade. By increasing landscaping, shade
trees and pedestrian facilities (for example, benches, gathering places and fountains) and
promoting physical connections between activities and uses that bring activity to the street,
Pinole can ensure that Old Town remains a vibrant
pedestrian center. San Pablo Avenue, a highly traveled
arterial, extends through Old Town and carries a high
volume of traffic. Until automobile circulation is modified
to slow vehicles through Old Town, San Pablo Avenue
will hinder pedestrian movement.
In contrast, other commercial development, including
major regional shopping centers Pinole Vista, Pinole
Vista Crossing, Pinole Valley, and Appian 80, was
developed relatively recently and is located near the
Interstate 80/Appian Way interchange.                            Example of terraced mixed-use building

      Residential and Commercial Development
      The wide range of residential development in the city includes low-density residential
      neighborhoods in the southern and western portions of the city, as well as a mix of single- and
      multi-family residential units in the more central portions.
      The City of Pinole has loosely defined neighborhoods to reflect their diversity in terms of size,
      density, characteristics and land use mix. These neighborhoods are located south of San Pablo
      Avenue and west of Appian Way, between the Bayshore and San Pablo Avenue, and south of
      Interstate 80 in Pinole Valley. These residential neighborhoods are characteristically more rural
      and lower in density.
      Pinole offers residential development that in one location is suburban and rural in its feel, with
      landscaped hillsides and low-density residential neighborhoods, while other areas are
      characterized by modern homes and a distinctly more urbanized feel. The city also varies in its
      scale and types of commercial development, with the large, modern appearance of the major
                                                shopping districts as well as the commercial district with
                                                a historic feel in the Old Town. In many respects, it is this
                                                diversity in the built and natural environments that helps
                                                define the character of Pinole.
                                                The Residential Design Criteria and Guidelines were
                                                adopted by the City of Pinole in 2007 to implement the
                                                goals and policies of the existing General Plan.
                                                Specifically, these guidelines implement the City’s
                                                existing General Plan land use policies relevant to urban

Guidelines supplement the Zoning Code development standards and are used by the City to
evaluate design review applications for qualifying residential and residential mixed-use projects.
In the future, as described in the Three Corridors Specific Plan and utilizing sustainable
(Chapter 11) practices, Pinole will further explore mixed-use development.
Light Pollution
Light pollution refers to all forms of unwanted light in the night sky caused by unnecessary use
of artificial light. Specific categories of light pollution include light trespass, glare, clutter, over-
illumination and sky glow. Excessive light and glare can be visually disruptive to humans and
nocturnal animal species and are also indicative of a high level of energy consumption. Light
pollution becomes an issue of increasing concern as new development creates additional
outdoor lighting installed for safety and other reasons.
Architectural Styles
Architectural styles help create a distinct identity for a single development, a neighborhood or an
entire community. Old Town Pinole, along San Pablo Avenue, contains a variety of architectural
styles that mirror the community’s historical development and development pattern. Land uses
in this district consist of a mixture of commercial, residential, public/institutional and open space.
The distinct architectural styles present within Old Town Pinole are described in detail below.
Commercial buildings with historic designs that characterize Old
Town Pinole are located on San Pablo Avenue between                          Main historical residential

      The Bank of Pinole building along San Pablo Avenue depicts a neoclassical architectural style.
      The limestone building façade consists of two grand Ionic columns, a grand portico and an
      arched glass entrance.
      Residential buildings represent a diverse mix of architectural styles, spanning several decades.
      The main historical residential design themes can be characterized as follows:
               Queen Anne Cottages (1880–1905): Queen Anne Cottage homes along San Pablo
               Avenue illustrate a unique evolution of the style from a rural farmhouse with earlier
               Italianate Cottage features (tall narrow windows and hip roof) to the Queen Anne
               Cottages of the 1890s. Scaled-down classical columns characterize later versions of
               these homes as porch supports.
               Hip Roof Cottages (1870–1910): The Italianate Hip Roof Cottages have subtle stylistic
               details (tall narrow windows and a small flat area at the roof peak) that establish the age
               of these buildings. Porch design and detail features varied according to what was
               available for decoration at the local lumberyard when the cottages were built.
               Bungalows (1915–1930): The Bungalow or Craftsman Bungalow was the predominant
               housing style between 1915 and 1930. These narrow rectangular houses have low-
               pitched gable or hipped roofs and small front porches enclosed by screens.
      Other residential styles include Classical Revivals, Farmhouse/Ranch Style homes, Prairie Style
      Bungalows and Second Empire French.

                                        million returning veterans eager to start families —
                                        combined to produce the largest building boom in the
                                        nation’s history, almost all of it concentrated in the
                                        suburbs. From 1944 to 1946, single-family housing starts
                                        increased eight-fold from 114,000 to 937,000. The
     View from Oak Ridge development    greatest periods of growth in Pinole occurred after WWII,
                                        during a period of time when mortgages backed by the
Federal Housing Administration supported more and
more new residential development on the edges of
American cities. During this time, the curvilinear
subdivision layout became institutionalized as the
building industry came to support national regulations
that would standardize local building practices and
reduce unexpected development costs. This form of
development, in seamless repetition, would create the
post-WWII suburban landscape.
                                                                   View of Silver Creek development
Architects of this period adapted the traditional housing
of southwest ranches and haciendas and Spanish Colonial revival styles to a suburban house
type suited for middle-income families. This ranch-style house was typically built of natural
materials such as adobe or redwood and was oriented to an outdoor patio and gardens that
ensured privacy and intimacy with nature. The Ranch house in various configurations continued
as the dominant suburban house well into the 1960s.
Though comparatively new, the buildings constructed during this era contribute a great deal to
the character of Pinole. Though many of the buildings that were constructed in the 1950s, ’60s
and ’70s have been largely dismissed as architecturally insignificant, when considered as a
whole they best define the character and context of Pinole outside of the Old Town area. When
                                        examined more closely, these developments also
                                        provide good examples of post-war tract development.
                                        As these subdivisions age, their significance within the
                                        historic context of Pinole will only increase, particularly in

                                COMMUNITY CHARACTER
       The residential design guidelines adopted for Pinole were intended to protect the character of
       these and similar developments from new development that could otherwise detract from the
       established character of the post-war communities. Specifically, development patterns were
                                                  resulting in proposals to construct homes that had a
                                                  height, mass and bulk that was substantially larger than
                                                  the traditional post-war tract homes.
                                                  It is worth noting that more recent developments have
                                                  provided good examples of how modern architecture and
                                                  site planning could result in projects that respect and

Circulation Systems
Major arterials that extend through the city boundaries include San Pablo Avenue and Interstate
80 (running east-west) and Tennent Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian Way (running
north-south). These arterial roads and the freeway direct much of Pinole’s physical form and
design.
Interstate 80 (I-80) bisects Pinole east to west, providing regional access to San Francisco City
and County, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Solano County and points beyond to the
east. It serves as the ―front door‖ to the city and acts as a

    CHAPTER             3
                                COMMUNITY CHARACTER
       HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES SETTING
       Much of Pinole’s charm and character is derived from its rich architectural heritage. Its historic
       resources are irreplaceable assets that contribute to the special and unique character of the city
       and are a source of identity and pride for its residents. In recognition of the importance of these
       resources to its community image, Pinole has made a major commitment to preserve these
       cultural and historic resources, in both the public and
       private sector.
       Pinole comprises a diverse mix of people from all walks
       of life. Pinole is more racially diverse than both Contra
       Costa County and the rest of the San Francisco Bay
       Area. Non-white races constitute 34.5 percent of the
       population in Contra Costa County and 41.9 percent of
       the population in the San Francisco Bay Area, whereas
       they made up 45.6 percent of the population of Pinole as
       of 2008. These diverse populations enhance the city by
       sharing their traditions and customs with the rest of the
       community.                                                                 Fernandez Mansion
       Adequately serving a diverse population is a key goal of the General Plan. It includes providing
       the services and information necessary to having an informed and engaged public, including
       reaching out to different segments of the population. The City is actively engaged in providing
       information that facilitates continued public involvement in civic activities.
       The culture of the community is also established in the visual and performing arts. The Pinole
       Playhouse serves as the community theatre and is used by the City of Pinole School of
       Performing Arts and the Pinole Community Players. Providing opportunities for the enjoyment of
       the visual and performing arts is a vital component of building a city and helps to establish the
       quality of life in the community.
       Pinole has a wealth of cultural and historic resources, including Native American sites, historic
       period sites and buildings, artifacts, and memorabilia, associated with locally historic events like
       incorporation. While there are only a few sites and buildings in the city that meet the criteria for
       designation as a State Historic Resource or State Historic Landmark, many other buildings are
       of a significant historic value to the community. The following list includes some of the structures
       that are important to the community. It is intended that this list will be updated with additional
       sites as the community identifies them.
                Bank of Pinole (2361 San Pablo Avenue) is listed on the National Register of Historic
                Places. The building was purchased by the Redevelopment Agency in 1995 and
                seismically upgraded for new commercial uses.
                Bernardo Fernandez House (100 Tennent Avenue) is listed on the Contra Costa
                Inventory of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places.

                          COMMUNITY CHARACTER
        The Downer Home (2711 San Pablo Avenue) has been determined as eligible but is
        not yet listed.
        Pinole Waterfront at the base of Tennent Avenue played an important role in the
        development of Pinole and contains structures of historic significance.
When these individual properties are viewed from an elevated vantage point on San Pablo
Avenue as it approaches Old Town from either direction, they convey a strong sense of
character. From this perspective, Old Town can be viewed as a unique, cohesive center for
community activity, commerce and recreation. The Old Town area provides a visible, tangible
heart to the City of Pinole with its many historic and cultural resources.
ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ADDRESSES
The Community Character Element establishes the
framework for how the City will look, feel and function
that applies to the type, location and character of both
private and public development projects for new and
existing areas of Pinole. The element also provides
goals, policies and implementation actions designed to
recognize and preserve the history of the area and
celebrate the diversity of the city’s population.
The primary issues that this element attempts to solve
are listed below and were identified during the                       View of Pinole from Hercules

                                COMMUNITY CHARACTER
       POLICY CC.1.5         Encourage project compatibility, interdependence and support with
                             neighboring uses, especially between commercial and mixed-use centers and
                             the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Uses should relate to one another
                             with pedestrian connections, transit options, shared parking, landscaping,
                             public spaces, and the orientation and design of buildings.
       Action CC.1.5.1           Through the design review process, ensure that development in Pinole is
                                 oriented toward the maintenance and upkeep of the city’s unique
                                 character.
       Action CC.1.5.2           Continue to support the code enforcement program to ensure private
                                 properties are maintained in accordance with community standards.
       Action CC.1.5.3           Utilize the Zoning Code provisions to identify appropriate solutions to
                                 create compatibility between existing neighborhoods and new
                                 developments.
       GOAL CC.2         Emphasize and enhance the visual and physical connection between the city’s
                         natural environment and the community’s quality of life.
       POLICY CC.2.1         Provide visual and physical connections between the natural environment
                             and the built environment through careful site design, building placement,
                             architectural features that allow views of Pinole’s unique environment such as
                             ridgelines or the San Pablo Bay shoreline, public access to open space such
                             as via the Bay Trail, and the use of native vegetation in the urban
                             environment such as for landscape buffers for sidewalk areas and street
                             trees.
       Action CC.2.1.1           Create a connected network of open spaces in Pinole that are accessible
                                 to the community for outdoor recreation and other use and enjoyment as
                                 a key aspect of local community character.
       Action CC.2.1.2           Promote and provide an integrated pedestrian and bicycle network that
                                 links open spaces and other destination points within Pinole.
       Action CC.2.1.3           Enhance existing priority development areas, commercial corridors, trails

                                 vistas. Many of Pinole’s existing open space areas are on or near existing
                                 ridgelines with scenic views. Ensuring that trails connect these spaces
                                 enhances scenic opportunities.
       Action CC.2.1.4           Determine new connections, public spaces and improvements needed
                                 along pedestrian and bike paths, and add new trails. Prioritize completion

        promoting sound local land              transportation planning efforts. The Growth Management
      use choices that support infill           Element includes level of service standards and
     development along circulation              performance standards for traffic and the provision of
       corridors that are served by             public services (e.g., fire, police, parks, sanitary sewer
        existing infrastructure and             facilities, water and flood control) in order to ensure that
                    transit.                    public facilities are provided to accommodate growth
                                                consistent with adopted standards. By adopting and
                                                implementing this element, the City of Pinole establishes
                                                a comprehensive, long-range program that will match the
demands for public facilities and services generated by new development or redevelopment with
plans, capital improvement programs and development mitigation programs to ensure facilities
are provided at an appropriate time and level to serve new development. Specifically, the
Growth Management Element seeks to:
     1. Attain a new level of mutually beneficial communication and coordinated planning
           between Pinole and its neighboring jurisdictions, other public agencies and regional
           agencies.
     2. Provide community facilities, commercial services and amenities easily accessible to
           and from residential neighborhoods.
     3. Support further development of bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
     4. Provide a safe, attractive and efficient circulation system that ensures convenient access
           to all residential, business and recreational areas by various modes of transportation.
     5. Encourage future growth to locate along the primary travel corridors through the
           community and in areas that are or can easily be served by transit.
     6. Guide future growth so that at buildout the community remains an attractive, uncrowded
           and pleasant place to live and work.
The Growth Management Element also expresses a vision for the future where sustainable
development and land use practices provide for the needs of existing residents and businesses
while preserving choices for future generations.1

  Sustainable development practices refer to the use of architectural and planning methods that address the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Specific examples include
the use of solar panels for energy conservation, placing jobs near housing to reduce vehicle trips, and infill
development in urban areas to reduce the consumption of agricultural land. Policies related to sustainability are
identified with a    symbol.
                                                                                         CITY OF PINOLE GENERAL PLAN  4.0-1

      GOVERNMENT CODE AUTHORITY
      While a Growth Management Element is not a State-mandated general plan element, the
      Growth Management Element of the Pinole General Plan is adopted pursuant to the authority
      granted to local jurisdictions by Section 65303 of the Government Code of the State of
      California, which states:
               The general plan may include any other elements or address other subjects
               which, in the judgment of legislative body, relate to the physical development of
               the county or city.
      The content of the Growth Management Element is dictated by the requirements of the Contra
      Costa County Transportation Authority (CCTA), and this element follows a specific format
      required by that agency. The element also serves as a means for the CCTA to determine
      whether the City is in compliance with policies that support the receipt of Measure J funding.
      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
      The Growth Management Element is not intended to supersede the goals or policies of the
      other elements of the General Plan. When other elements of the General Plan are updated, it
      may be appropriate to amend the Growth Management Element to ensure an internally
      consistent and comprehensive set of City goals, policies and actions.
      Chapter 5:        The land use framework for implementing the Growth Management Element
                        policies and the Urban Limit Line (Figure 5.1) are established by the Land Use
                        and Economic Development Element.
      Chapter 6:        Consistent with the requirements of Measure J, the City of Pinole has an adopted
                        Housing Element that meets the requirements of the California Department of
                        Housing and Community Development (HCD).
      Chapter 7:        The Circulation Element establishes level of service standards that govern traffic
                        operations in Pinole.
      Chapter 8:        The Community Services and Facilities Element establishes performance
                        standards for public services and facilities that are used to evaluate the effect of
                        new development in Pinole.
      Chapter 10        The Natural Resources and Open Space Element discusses man-made hazards,
                        development constraints, conservation policies that affect the potential siting of
                        land uses and open space policies.
      Chapter 11:       The Sustainability Element discusses ways for Pinole to incorporate more green
                        practices, including ways affecting how Pinole will grow.

                           GROWTH MANAGEMENT
BACKGROUND
Local Requirements
In November 2004, voters approved Measure J, extending the Contra Costa County
Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Program (Measure C, 1988) by 25
years. That action established a 0.5 percent countywide sales tax through the year 2034 that
will be used to address existing major regional transportation problems. To qualify for its share
of the sales tax, the City of Pinole will:
     1. Adopt a Growth Management Element as part of the General Plan;
     2. Adopt a development mitigation program (adopted by Resolution 2008-92 on June 17,
        2008);
     3. Provide diverse housing options for people who live and work in Pinole (refer to Chapter
        6, Housing Element);
     4. Participate in cooperative multi-jurisdictional planning (Pinole continues to be an active
        participant on the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee);
     5. Maintain the adopted Urban Limit Line (ULL) (adopted by Resolution 2007-12 on
        February 6, 2007);
     6. Implement a five-year Capital Improvement Program (the 5-year CIP is updated
        annually); and
     7. Adopt a Transportation Systems Management Ordinance or Resolution (adopted by
        Ordinance 2006-06 on June 20, 2006).
Measure J requires that tax revenues be dedicated to transportation projects in Contra Costa
County and to the implementation of a Growth Management Program by all the cities and the
County. Specifically, Measure J provides funding for three categories of transportation projects:
     1. Transportation projects identified in Measure J;
     2. Paratransit programs; and
     3. Transportation projects funded by Local Street Maintenance and Improvement or
        “Return-to-Source” funds.
Return-to-Source funds are revenues derived from the additional sales tax that are distributed to
participating general purpose governments in Contra Costa County. The system of distribution
is based on a formula which includes the jurisdiction’s population and the miles of streets and
highways within the jurisdiction. Measure J requires that in order to receive Return-to-Source
funds, participating jurisdictions prepare a Growth Management Element. This element satisfies
the requirement for the City of Pinole and is consistent with the standards established by
Measure J and the Contra Costa County General Plan.
                                                                           CITY OF PINOLE GENERAL PLAN 4.0-3

   CHAPTER             4
                                GROWTH MANAGEMENT
      PLANNING FOR GROWTH
      As discussed in the Background Report, the Pinole population is projected to grow by about
      2,761 people between 2000 and 2030 (an almost 13 percent increase).2 The number of
      households is expected to increase by 1,317 between 2000 and 2030 (a 16 percent increase).
      The average household size in the Pinole Planning Area is projected to decrease from 2.91
      persons per household in 2000 to 2.82 in 2030. The City of Pinole is planning for growth to
      occur primarily along San Pablo Avenue, Appian Way and Pinole Valley Road. By concentrating
      development on these corridors and coordinating policy and capital improvement planning with
      neighboring jurisdictions and other transit agencies, the City seeks to:
           1. Ensure a healthy jobs/housing balance;
           2. Accommodate the housing needs of people who live and work in Pinole;
           3. Accommodate the City’s share of regional growth while maintaining acceptable traffic
               circulation standards; and
           4. Participate in regional planning efforts.
      Jobs/Housing Balance
      For purposes of the Growth Management Element, jobs/housing balance is defined as the
      reasonable opportunity for people to live and work within the Planning Area. Three components
      of jobs/housing balance were analyzed:
           1. The number of jobs as a percentage of the number of employed residents (i.e., total
               jobs/total employed residents);
           2. Average household income and the implicit relationship between income and the ability
               to pay housing costs; and
           3. The amount of vacant land by current zoning designation.
      Maintaining a reasonable jobs/housing balance is important because it:
           1. Reduces the need for residents to use regional transportation infrastructure;
           2. Reduces the amount of household income that must be used for transportation costs;
           3. Has positive environmental impacts, because of overall reduction in commute trips;
           4. Reduces the amount of time residents must spend commuting and allows the use of that
               time for leisure activities; and

    5. Is important to the overall health and vitality of the community, by creating greater
        opportunities for community involvement and interaction.
Housing Needs
For Pinole, the regional housing need is determined by the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), based upon an overall regional housing need number established by the
State. In accordance with state law, ABAG has determined the fair share of the regional housing
need that must be planned for during the 2007 to 2014 planning period. State law also requires
that the allocation of regional housing needs consider the need for housing across all income
levels. These income categories, as defined by the State, are:
        Very Low: up to 50 percent of median income
        Low: between 50 and 880 percent of median income
        Moderate: between 80 and 120 percent of median income
        Above Moderate: above 120 percent of median income
Pinole’s allocation for the 2007–2014 period is 323 total housing units, of which 180 must be
affordable. The breakdown of required affordable units is 83 (26 percent) must be affordable to
very low-income households, 49 (15 percent) affordable to low-income households, and 48 (15
percent) affordable to moderate-income households. The allocation for above moderate-income
households is 143 (44 percent) housing units.
Most of the vacant or redevelopable sites that are designated in the General Plan for single-
family or multiple-family use within the Pinole Planning Area are small infill lots that are already
served by necessary infrastructure and are within the existing service areas of the City’s Police
and Fire departments.
Traffic Capacity
Pinole has participated in the development of the West County Traffic Model and Action Plan
and has developed specific standards for traffic level of service based on the model and on the
subregional Action Plan for Routes of Regional Significance. Measure J, which extended
Measure C through the year 2034, established two basic categories of routes: (1) routes of
regional significance and (2) basic routes.
Routes of regional significance in Pinole are Interstate 80, San Pablo Avenue and Appian Way.
In west Contra Costa County, the Action Plan for Routes of Regional Significance is developed
by the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee (WCCTAC).
Actions to improve basic routes are addressed at the local level through the development of
other General Plan implementation programs and the City’s Capital Improvement Program
(CIP). The City has established traffic level of service (LOS) standards in the Circulation
Element (Chapter 7). Currently, all roadways meet City standards.
                                                                          CITY OF PINOLE GENERAL PLAN 4.0-5

   CHAPTER              4
                                 GROWTH MANAGEMENT
      The Circulation Element also projects future traffic conditions through the year 2030. According
      to projected volumes, only a few intersections and road segments will eventually function at
      LOS F, which is the lowest level of service and indicates “breakdown conditions.” Increases in
      daily volumes in segments along San Pablo Avenue, Appian Way and Pinole Valley Road will
      begin to exceed the capacity of the roadways. The increase in daily volumes can be attributed
      to growth in Pinole as well as in the adjacent areas, such as Hercules, San Pablo and the
      unincorporated county. Solutions for the LOS F street sections will need to be developed.
      While there may be improvements at some intersections and road segments that could improve
      the level of service, constraints in Old Town Pinole make it difficult to increase traffic capacity
      without detracting from important community attributes. Traffic improvements that would widen
      San Pablo Avenue in Old Town, or support vehicular circulation at the expense of pedestrian
      circulation, have the potential to change the historic character of Old Town Pinole, damage the
      economic vitality of the area and potentially decrease public safety and enjoyment. For those
      reasons, the City favors acceptance of LOS F as the traffic circulation threshold for the Old
      Town section of San Pablo Avenue.
      The West County computerized traffic model, developed in conjunction with CCTA, the five west
      Contra Costa County cities and the local transit agencies, can be used to analyze existing and
      anticipated traffic levels impact on basic and regional routes. The model integrates
      transportation demands in the cities of El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond and San Pablo,
      and the surrounding unincorporated areas, including Bay Area-wide through traffic along the
      major travel corridors. Refer to the Circulation Element (Chapter 7) for a discussion of existing
      and anticipated circulation conditions.
      West County Action Plan
      The West County Action Plan is a program of improvements to be carried out by the members
      of the West Contra Costa County Transportation Advisory Committee (WCCTAC) to improve
      and maintain the network of regional routes in west Contra Costa County. The five west county
      cities, the County, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), WestCAT and the other transit agencies
      combine their efforts to ensure that traffic and transit facilities can handle the needs of the
      community into the future.
      The Action Plan is required as part of the Growth Management Program and is prepared by
      CCTA, in consultation with WCCTAC, to reflect a regional view of transportation needs and
      issues, and ultimately, implementing actions and projects for regional routes of significance.
      Projects are funded and carried out through local capital improvement programs, Return–to-
      Source funding and Measure J project funding.
      SERVICE CAPACITY CONSIDERATIONS
      There are a number of conditions and infrastructure considerations that affect service capacity
      in Pinole. Some of the most important issues (e.g., traffic, sewage disposal and the provision of
      emergency services) will require coordinated efforts with adjoining communities and regional
      planning agencies. The following trends and inter-jurisdictional considerations are fundamental
      to Pinole’s growth management planning.
4.0-6     CITY OF PINOLE GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                             CHAPTER         4
                               GROWTH MANAGEMENT
1. Regional growth has occurred at a much higher rate than growth in Pinole and has
     impacted transportation infrastructure at a disproportionately high rate.
     Based on ABAG Projections 2007, the Planning Area of Pinole grew at a much slower rate
     in the last decade than did Contra Costa County and neighboring Solano County (see Table
     4.1–Regional Population Comparison). The Pinole Planning Area includes unincorporated
     portions of the county that abut Pinole.
                                               Table 4.1
                                    Regional Population Comparison

 Pinole Planning Area                 30,806                   32,300                      5%
 Contra Costa County                 948,816                 1,061,900                    12%
 Solano County                       394,542                  455,200                     15%

Source: ABAG, Projections 2007
     Accordingly, growth in surrounding communities has placed a much higher demand on
     transportation infrastructure than has growth in Pinole. This condition has resulted in
     increased congestion at Interstate 80 ramps in Pinole and has contributed to traffic
     congestion on surface streets as motorists seek alternative routes to a congested interstate.
     While Pinole has the ability to influence local traffic conditions, participation in regional
     planning efforts is critical for ensuring adequate transportation improvements to serve the
     City of Pinole.
2. Wastewater treatment capacity is shared between the cities of Pinole and Hercules.
     Wastewater treatment capacity at the Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP)
     is currently shared between the cities of Hercules and Pinole. In the last decade, growth in
     the City of Hercules has generated greater demand for new service connections than has
     growth in Pinole, and this trend is expected to continue into the future (see Table 4.2–Local
     Population Comparison). Service limitations, however, are a function of peak flows during
     periods of wet weather. Aging infrastructure in Pinole contributes substantially to wet
     weather flow as the result of inflow and infiltration. It is worth noting that a little over half of
     the Pinole Planning Area is served by the WPCP. Accordingly, the absolute population
     numbers contained in Table 4.2 are less informative for planning purposes than the
     percentage of change over time.
                                                                               CITY OF PINOLE GENERAL PLAN 4.0-7

           The Pinole/Hercules WPCP needs to upgrade in order to accommodate existing wet
           weather peak period flows. Any future WPCP upgrade should also be designed to
           accommodate projected growth in the cities of Pinole and Hercules. Growth management
           policies should establish appropriate mechanisms for addressing existing infrastructure
           needs, accounting for future projected growth and assigning available capacity. Please see
           the Community Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8) for more information.
      3. The growth rate of local employment opportunities exceeds the growth rate in the
           number of employed residents, providing local work for Pinole Planning Area
           residents.
           Between 2000 and 2030, based solely in the number of jobs and employed residents in the
           city, the ratio of employed residents to jobs is expected to improve in Pinole from 2.6 to 2.3
           employed residents per job. The number of employed residents is expected to increase by
           3,596 over the next 30 years, while the number of local jobs is expected to increase
           by 2,410.
      4. Housing and commercial development is anticipated to occur slowly and
           incrementally over the next 30 years.
           Most large land holdings in Pinole have been developed. With few exceptions, growth in
           Pinole is expected to occur on small infill lots that can accommodate housing and mixed-use
           development. Exceptions to this condition exist in redevelopment opportunities at the Appian
           80 Shopping Center, Gateway West, and Doctors Hospital, and at industrial properties
           located at the west end of San Pablo Avenue.
      5. The high cost of market-rate housing, in conjunction with an increase in lower-paying
           employment opportunities, reinforces the need to provide diverse housing
           opportunities to households at all income levels.
           While the number of jobs is expected to increase, many will be at salary levels that are
           below what is needed to afford market-rate housing in Pinole. While Pinole remains
           comparatively affordable for the San Francisco Bay region, proximity to employment
           centers, an attractive small-town character and an advantageous climate are expected to
           perpetuate increasing demand in a community with limited supply and generate higher
           housing costs. Job growth in Pinole has been primarily in the services industries, jobs with
           traditionally lower earning potential. This combination will make it difficult to provide housing

                        GROWTH MANAGEMENT
POLICY GM.2.3    Development Costs. Services and capital improvements necessary to serve
                 new development should be installed and funded by the project.
Action GM.2.3.1      Where feasible, development should provide improvements necessary to
                     ensure adequate service to the project and create an adequate
                     mechanism for ensuring ongoing funding for necessary services.
Action GM.2.3.2      Where improvements are needed to serve multiple projects or existing
                     development, the City will maintain a development mitigation program to
                     collect the proportionate share of a development’s contribution to capital
                     and service costs associated with regional and local facilities and services
                     needed to support the development. The development mitigation program
                     may include, but not be limited to:

                           streets and improving available transportation alternatives:
                           a. Through-traffic should be discouraged as much as possible from
                                residential streets.
                           b. New commercial development should be focused along arterial corridors.
                           c. Transit services that are accessible to children, adults, senior citizens and
                                people with disabilities should be located within half a mile of schools,
                                public facilities and shops.
                           d. Commuters should have easy access to the BART system.
                           e. A shuttle bus, especially for seniors, at regular intervals throughout the
                                city, as well as hiking and biking trails, is desirable.
                           f.   Maintenance of AC Transit, BART feeder and WestCAT services.
       Action GM.3.3.1          Bus Service. Coordinate with WestCAT and AC Transit to strategically

       LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                          INTRODUCTION
          VISION STATEMENT
                                          Pinole is a bedroom community with small-town
      The City will be a memorable        character and modern amenities. The small-town
         destination and provide a        character that makes Pinole a desirable place to live and
      balanced mix of housing, jobs,      visit is rooted in Pinole‘s Old Town area, where most
         commercial activities and        major civic facilities are located, and established
     services, as well as cultural and    residential neighborhoods. More modern services can be
    civic amenities. Pinole will foster   found in development projects such as the Kaiser
   an integrated mix of uses that are     Medical Office Building and redeveloped Pinole Valley
     connected by lively streets and      Shopping Center. Established neighborhoods and new
       contiguous open space areas.       development are linked together by community
         Pinole will have walkable        greenways, paths, roads and park facilities. Regional
        neighborhoods, each with a        shopping centers located adjacent to Interstate 80 attract
             center of activity.          visitors from throughout western Contra Costa County
                                          and make Pinole an accessible and attractive place for
people to work, shop and conduct business. The goals, policies and actions in the Land Use
and Economic Development Element are intended to maintain Pinole‘s historic roots and small-
town character, while providing the framework for the city to grow as a dynamic place with a
balanced mix of land uses and a strong sense of identity that complements historic patterns and
trends.
It is anticipated that Pinole will have minimal growth in the future. This growth will likely be
modification of uses and infill development. Pinole does not anticipate expanding its Sphere of
Influence (SOI) or annexing any land into the city in the foreseeable future. As required by
Measure C and Measure J, the General Plan will address how future growth will impact
community services and facilities in the Growth Management Element (Chapter 4), Community
Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8) and Circulation Element (Chapter 7).
The Land Use and Economic Development Element provides goals, policies and actions that
achieve the following objectives:
     1. Concentrate new development on Pinole‘s primary transportation corridors. By growing
          inward and along corridors that can accommodate transit, bicycles and pedestrians, the
          General Plan seeks to build on the city‘s historic land use patterns and improve the
          standard of living through the provision of additional high-quality services and shopping.
          The General Plan also looks to provide a logical and convenient interface between land
          uses to minimize the vehicular travel distances between residences, employment,
          services, shopping and recreational spaces.
     2. Support economic development to improve the jobs/housing balance, attract catalyst
          businesses and ensure an economically sustainable community.
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-1

   CHAPTER            5
        LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
          3. Protect ridgelines, community buffers, the San Pablo Bay shoreline, creeks, waterways
               and other environmental resources.
          4. Retain and preserve existing businesses, particularly those which provide job
               opportunities and living wages for residents of Pinole.
          5. Preserve open space by concentrating development densities and creating opportunities
               for urban agricultural areas. Urban agricultural areas provide opportunities for
               community gardening and specialty crop production. Preserved private open space and
               urban agriculture areas could also create opportunities for recreation and education.
          6. Guide waterfront development to include enhanced public access, increased public
               recreational uses, Bay Trail connections, reuse of the RV Park property, and available
               area for the wastewater treatment plant expansion and Pinole Creek restoration.
      PURPOSE
      The Land Use section of this element provides the central framework for the General Plan and
      serves as a compass to guide the public, planners, decision-makers and city staff on the desired
      pattern of development in Pinole. It describes both existing and future land use activity and how
      the city should grow, and identifies the distribution, location and intensity of all land use types
      throughout the city. Text, maps and diagrams establish the blueprint for future land uses within
      the city and describe how these uses are integrated with the other General Plan elements and
      policies.
      The Economic Development section provides information that is vital and relevant to the desired
      pattern of land uses. This section attempts to identify the City‘s strengths and weaknesses as it
      seeks to provide a full range of employment, housing, commercial, industrial and entertainment
      options to residents. The element establishes goals, policies and actions to improve the City‘s
      prosperity, maintain regional competitiveness, ensure accessibility to assets, and set fair and
      equitable policies for development.

       LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Both sections of this element express a vision for the future where sustainable development and
land use practices provide for the needs of existing residents and businesses while preserving
choices for future generations.1
The Land Use and Economic Development Element of the General Plan will be implemented by
the Zoning Code and by subsequently adopted Specific Plans. The General Plan provides
broad policy direction related to land use, while the Specific Plans and Zoning Code provide
property-specific standards that implement the Land Use and Economic Development Element.

General Plan land use designations establish the type and intensity of land use that is desirable
for identified areas of a city. Because Specific Plans and the Zoning Code must be consistent
with the General Plan, land use designations are usually written
to accommodate a broad range of uses and development                                   While it is the Land Use

  Sustainable development practices refer to the use of architectural and planning methods that address the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Specific examples include
the use of solar panels for energy conservation, placing jobs near housing to reduce vehicle trips, and infill
development in urban areas to reduce the consumption of agricultural land. Policies related to sustainability are
identified with a   symbol.

      community. The Economic Development portion of this element is supported by the Land Use
      section through policies related to density, intensity and infill of underutilized properties,
      redevelopment and reinvestment, and the creation of a vibrant economy in Pinole, specifically in
      the areas of Old Town, San Pablo Avenue, Appian Way and Pinole Valley Road. Both sections
      of the element cover how the City will guide development for the next 20 years.
      Natural and man-made hazards, development constraints, conservation policies that affect the
      potential siting of land uses, open space policies, and policies that integrate parks and open
      space into development are all addressed in both the Natural Resources and Open Space
      Element and the Health and Safety Element. Land use classifications and development
      standards in the Land Use and Economic Development Element create a physical form related
      to the community design principles and aesthetic policies of the Community Character Element.
      The Community Character Element also sets forth policy direction creating an identity for Pinole
      that makes it a distinctive place in the region and supports economic development activities.
      The Community Services and Facilities Element relates to this element through examination of
      available community services, public facilities and public services, and then providing for
      comprehensive infrastructure and service systems now and for the projected future needs of the
      community.
      A circulation plan is established in the Circulation Element to accommodate increased traffic
      from the planned development outlined in the Land Use and Economic Development Element.
      The Circulation Element contains policies related to improving circulation and access between
      land uses in order to support economic development and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
      The Sustainability Element expresses a vision for the future where sustainable development and
      conservation practices provide for the needs of existing residents and businesses while
      preserving choices for future generations. Of particular importance to the Pinole community are
      the preservation and enhancement of Pinole Creek and its watershed, access and use of the
      shoreline along San Pablo Bay, protection of the ridgelines around Pinole and connection to the
      Bay Trail in Pinole. Finally, the other General Plan elements ensure that the infrastructure,
                                         services and environmental quality standards necessary for

                                         A number of land use plans and programs have a direct bearing
      on the Land Use and Economic Development Element. Critical among them are the general
      plans for Contra Costa County and the cities of Hercules, Richmond and San Pablo, the West
      County Action Plan, the Bay Trail and Water Trail plans promulgated by the Bay Conservation
      and Development Commission, and the Pinole Redevelopment Plan. Because the cities of
      Pinole and Hercules are linked by Interstate 80, San Pablo Avenue and the Bay Trail, as well as
      railroad lines; share the lower portion of the Pinole Creek Watershed and San Pablo Bay; and

      LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
currently still share a common wastewater treatment facility, the land use decisions in one city
have the potential to impact circulation and public services in the other.
City of Pinole Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The City‘s CIP is a five-year capital plan
that is updated annually to prioritize and schedule capital projects that implements policies and
objectives including economic development, housing, infrastructure, parks and open space, and
citywide beautification.
The San Francisco Bay Trail Plan. Adopted in 1987, Senate Bill 100 directed the Association
of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) to develop a plan to create a recreational corridor that
became the Bay Trail. The plan for the Bay Trail proposes development of a regional hiking and
bicycling trail around the perimeter of San Francisco and San Pablo bays. The plan prepared by
ABAG pursuant to Senate Bill 100 mandated that the Bay Trail provide connections to existing
park and recreation facilities, create links to existing and proposed transportation facilities, and
be planned in such a way as to avoid adverse effects on environmentally sensitive areas. As of
2009, approximately 240 miles of the alignment — over half of the Bay Trail‘s ultimate 400-mile
length — have been completed. Though the goal of the San Francisco Bay Trail Plan is to
secure continuous access around San Francisco Bay, the Bay Trail does not presently provide
continuous access through Pinole.
The San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail. Adopted in 2005, the San Francisco Bay Area
Water Trail Act establishes the San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail to link access to the waters
of the San Francisco Bay and Suisun Marsh that are available for navigation by human-powered
boats and beachable sail craft, and to provide for diverse water-accessible overnight
accommodations. The act requires the Bay Conservation and Development Commission
(BCDC), in collaboration with the State Coastal Conservancy and ABAG, to establish and
coordinate a collaborative partnership with other interested parties in the development of a plan
to establish the Water Trail. The Pinole access point to the Water Trail is in Bayfront Park.
The West Contra Costa County Action Plan. Action Plans are a requirement of the Measure J
Growth Management Program administered by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority
(CCTA). The primary purpose of the Action Plans, which are developed by regional
transportation subcommittees of the CCTA (WCCTAC serves this function in Pinole), is to
establish policies for managing the traffic impacts from new development on regional routes.
The 2000 update of the West County Action Plan document identifies San Pablo Avenue and
Appian Way as routes of regional significance through Pinole, supports changes in how traffic
flows are managed on Interstate 80, and establishes several new Traffic Service Objectives
(TSOs) that mostly relate to alternative modes such as ferry usage, bicycling and walking.
West Contra Costa Transit Authority Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP). The SRTP is a
planning tool to help the CCTA in the development and provision of transit services in the cities
of Pinole and Hercules and in unincorporated areas of Rodeo, Crockett, Port Costa, Tara Hills,
Montalvin Manor and Bayview in western Contra Costa County.
East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) Master Plan. The Master Plan defines the vision
and mission of the Park District and sets priorities each decade for the District to manage its
land holdings and operations that include 65 regional parks, over 100,000 acres of open space,
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-5

         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      and 1,100 miles of trails within Contra Costa and Alameda counties including portions of Pinole.
      The policies set forth by the Master Plan help guide the stewardship and development of current
      and future parks in such a way to maintain a balance between the need to protect and conserve
      natural resources while offering recreational use of parklands.
      The Contra Costa County, Richmond, Hercules and San Pablo General Plans. These
      general plans establish land use and circulation improvements for adjacent jurisdictions. Land
      use in the City of Pinole has the potential to influence, and be impacted by, policies, programs
      and actions that are implemented by these general plans. In particular, planned developments
      in Hercules and the unincorporated community of El Sobrante could increase traffic volumes
      through the City of Pinole and, in the case of Hercules, create opportunity for alternative forms
      of transit at a planned ferry terminal and rail station.
      Economic Development Strategy. Adopted in 1999, the Economic Development Strategy
      establishes goals and strategic themes to support economic prosperity, identifies six opportunity
      zones where economic development should occur and establishes an implementation process
      for achieving the identified goals. Though intended as a five-year strategic plan, many of the
      goals and implementation ideas remain valid in 2010 and influence Pinole land use decisions.
      Five-Year Implementation Plan. The Pinole Redevelopment Agency is required to adopt a
      Five-Year Implementation Plan that will guide the agency in implementing programs and
      projects that eliminate blight and satisfy affordable housing obligations. The Implementation
      Plan provides valuable insight into the Agency‘s economic development priorities.
      ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
      PLANNING BOUNDARIES AND SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
      The City of Pinole occupies a land area of approximately 5.45 square miles with a Planning
      Area of approximately 13.3 square miles. State law requires a municipality to adopt a general
      plan that addresses physical development within the city or county and for ―any land outside its
      boundaries which in the planning agency‘s judgment bears relation to its planning‖ (California
      Government Code Section 65300). The Planning Area boundary (the study area for the General
      Plan Update) reflects the City‘s current Sphere of Influence. A Sphere of Influence (SOI) or
      Planning Area is a boundary that includes incorporated and unincorporated areas. These areas
      are related to the City‘s current and future land use planning and growth.
      The SOI for the City of Pinole includes all lands within the incorporated city limits, as well as
      additional lands just beyond the city limit line. There are four such areas in the SOI but beyond
      the city limits:
               Montalvin Manor: Lands just beyond the southwestern city limit near San Pablo and
               bordered on the south by Richmond Parkway.
               El Sobrante: Lands just beyond the south city limit near the unincorporated area of El
               Sobrante.

      LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
        Tara Hills: Lands beyond the southwestern city limit located south of San Pablo
        Avenue. A portion of Tara Hills is located within the city limits; the balance is located in
        the county.
        Bayview: Lands just beyond the western city limit between the railroad and the Bay.
The City provides emergency services to the four unincorporated areas within the Sphere of
Influence. The city limits and SOI are shown in Figure 5.1. The neighborhoods in the SOI and
their proposed land use designations are shown in Figure 5.3. The General Plan promulgates
annexation criteria to identify circumstances under which the City may wish to consider
annexing adjoining lands.
This page intentionally left blank Contra Costa County has proposed redevelopment of the area
encompassing Montara Bay, which is currently in the City‘s SOI. The City should play an active
role in the redevelopment planning for Montara Bay in order to determine whether this area
should be annexed to the City of Pinole or removed from the SOI. Among the issues the City
should consider is the possibility of creating an open space buffer at the southern boundary of
the city to provide an urban separator between the city and the new development.
DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS
Demographic information is based in large part on 2000 U.S. Census information that does not
reflect more recent changes in economic conditions or changes in Pinole. During preparation of
the General Plan, the nation experienced a severe recession. Accordingly, demographic
information contained in the General Plan likely overstates employment and understates poverty
and unemployment in 2010 and does not accurately depict changes that resulted from the
closure of Doctors Hospital in 2006 or the opening of the Kaiser Medical Office Building in 2009.
Though demographic information derived from the U.S. Census and ABAG projections may not
depict conditions at the time the General Plan was prepared, data from these sources remains
useful for monitoring trends and conditions over time and as a tool for planning into the future.
Population
After experiencing rapid growth in the 1950s, ‘60s and ‘70s, population growth in Pinole slowed
in the 1980s and ‗90s and is expected to average growth of less than 1 percent per year for the
foreseeable future. The City of Pinole‘s population changes and expected future trends are
summarized below in Table 5.1. The most notable increases occurred during the 1950–1970
period, when the city grew from 1,147 to 13,266 residents, a 1,240 percent increase in just 20
years. After 1970, population growth became more moderate, growing at 10 to 20 percent every
decade. The population grew even more slowly in recent years, with the slower pace projected
to characterize growth into the future. In part, this is the result of the city attaining buildout
conditions with comparatively little available vacant land for new development. Though land use
changes that increase development densities would create incentives for higher growth rates,
these rates would be tempered by the fact that most properties are already developed. Infill
redevelopment of sites would likely occur as the cost of maintaining and modernizing aging
properties make redevelopment to higher densities a more attractive alternative to continued
maintenance.

Demographics
Ethnicity
The percentages of Pinole‘s population indicate that the City of Pinole is more racially diverse
than both Contra Costa County and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the
2000 Census, non-white races constituted 34.5 percent of the population in Contra Costa
County and 41.9 percent of the population in the San Francisco Bay Area versus 45.6 percent in
Pinole.

Employment Trends
According to ABAG, Pinole had 6,200 jobs in 2000. The majority of employment is in the service
sector — almost 62 percent of the total — which includes health, educational, recreational,
financial and professional service jobs. The second largest sector is retail, accounting for almost
24 percent of jobs. Employment in the health industry has fluctuated due to the closure of
Doctors Hospital in 2006 and the opening of the Kaiser Medical Office Building in 2009.
Projections of job growth in the service sector between 2000 and 2030 show significant growth.
By 2030, Pinole is projected to have 6,050 service jobs, a 57 percent total growth in service
                                                                         CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-11

       jobs. Other sector jobs are projected to have minor growth between 2000 and 2030. In Pinole,
       overall job growth is projected to grow at a steady 1.1 percent per year pace from 2000 to 2030.
       Poverty Rate
       In 2000, 5.0 percent of the City of Pinole‘s population was below the poverty line (approximately
       954 individuals).
       Unemployment
       In 2000, the unemployment rate in the City of Pinole was 2.0 percent of the population (293
       people), which was 3.0 percent of the civilian labor force.
       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
       Based on available economic information, historic development patterns and the built-out nature
       of Pinole, the City anticipates:
                Slow growth in coming decades.
                Future job growth that will be concentrated in service sectors.
                Long-term prospects for the residential market will remain comparatively strong due to
                the proximity of Pinole to major employment centers, while the rental market prospects
                remain modest.
                Retail centers likely need the attention of redevelopment, while office opportunities are
                good and the supply of industrial centers is adequate.
       Pinole has opportunities for growth, particularly in the three major commercial corridors of San
       Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian Way. The City should adopt a planning
       document for those three corridor areas to establish mixed-use and infill development
       opportunities to revitalize these corridors, enhance Old Town Pinole and encourage transit-
       oriented development while preserving the character of Pinole. Further discussion of the
       opportunities along these corridors can be found later in this chapter.
       Redevelopment Agency
       The Redevelopment Agency is approaching the operating limits of the Planning Area.
       Consequently, the Agency is exploring opportunities to more actively manage Agency assets to
       optimize revenues to the City for capital projects and programs, including possible extension of
       the operating limits. While the Agency remains active, it will continue to facilitate development
       and provide investment in the City to:
                Retain business;
                Attract new business; and
                Create an attractive atmosphere.

     LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
To accomplish these goals, the Agency will continue to implement programs to revitalize the
business climate, rehabilitate structures, assist people with housing, encourage active
participation and private investment by property owners, and create job opportunities which
would not otherwise occur. The Redevelopment Agency provides the following programs:
        Commercial Rehabilitation Program – Provides zero- and low-interest loans for façade
        and other improvements to buildings and commercial sites within the project area.
        Business Relocation and Job Incentive Program – Provides assistance to any new
        business coming to Pinole‘s Redevelopment Area or any existing business in Pinole that
        is acquiring property in the Redevelopment Area and expanding jobs.
        First Time Homebuyer Program – Offers up to $100,000 of down payment assistance to
        qualified borrowers within the project area.
        Residential Rehabilitation Program – Offers grants and low-interest loans to low-income
        homeowners within the redevelopment area.
        Affordable Housing Partnerships – Explores means for acquiring and developing
        properties for rental and ownership housing opportunities at below-market rates.
HOUSING
The following information is discussed in greater detail in the Housing Element of the General
Plan. This summary is provided because housing needs are an important consideration when
examining land use options.
Housing Stock
The city‘s housing units increased to 6,888 units in 2000 (from 6,463 housing units in 1990).
The majority of housing units are single-family detached. Multi-family housing units increased
more than any other type of housing unit between 1990 and 2000. The California Department of
Finance estimates that, as of January 1, 2009, there were 6,990 housing units in the City of
Pinole.
Housing Needs
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) established Pinole‘s regional fair share of
housing needs for 2007 through 2014 for various types of housing and income groups. Two of
the objectives of allocating regional housing needs to local agencies are to increase the supply
of housing and to consider the housing needs of persons at all income levels. Income levels are
considered based on region-wide distribution of household income and existing concentrations
of poverty within the region.
For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need and eligibility for housing
assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). For Contra Costa County, the
median income for a family of four in 2009 was $89,300. HCD has defined the following income
                                                                   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-13

       In addition to accommodating overall housing needs, the City of Pinole is also responsible for
       planning housing for special needs groups, including seniors, female-headed households,
       people living with physical and mental disabilities, people with HIV/AIDS or other illnesses, large
       families, farmworkers and homeless persons.
       Housing Opportunities and Constraints
       Land and development costs are high in Pinole due to the limited supply of vacant land. In
       addition, the high land cost, increasing cost of constructing new housing, site constraints,
       availability of community services, and allowable densities all work to inhibit housing
       opportunities.
       An inventory of vacant lands in Pinole demonstrates that land zoned for residential development
       does not provide adequate opportunity for the City to address their regional share of housing
       production. To create additional housing potential, the City has identified housing opportunity
       sites containing approximately 30. Together with existing vacant land, these opportunity sites
       will be used to address Pinole‘s regional share of housing needs for 2007 through 2014 (Figure
       5.4).

     LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Please see Chapter 2.0 (Demographics and Fiscal Conditions) in the Background Report for
more information on demographics and economic conditions in Pinole and the surrounding
area. See the General Plan Housing Element (Chapter 6) for more information on housing
conditions in Pinole.
Redevelopment Agency programs to support first-time homebuyers, inclusionary requirements,
and long-term affordability preservation create most of the opportunities in Pinole for diverse
workforce housing. Through this General Plan, the City is modifying land use densities and
standards to create additional housing opportunities, predominantly along the primary
transportation corridors.
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS AND STANDARDS
Land Use Designations
The following land use designations establish a range of residential and nonresidential uses and
development intensity/density levels for the City of Pinole Planning Area. The land use
designations also include brief descriptions of the essential characteristics and intent of each
category. The land use designations establish general use categories that will be further refined
and implemented through a Redevelopment Plan, Specific Plan and/or the Zoning Code.
Commercial Land Uses
    1. RC - Regional Commercial. Intended for large regional shopping centers serving the
        West County market area. Uses may include large retailers such as furniture, appliance,
        auto and hardware stores, department stores, toy stores, offices, hotels and restaurants.
        This designation would apply to areas along Interstate 80 that are not within the Three
        Corridors Specific Plan Area described below. An example is the Pinole Vista Shopping
        Center. Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR): 0.40.
Residential Land Uses
    2. LDR - Low Density Residential (0.21 to 1 unit per acre). Includes sites located adjacent
        to open space areas or near environmental resources where a development transition
        from suburban to rural land use is desirable. This designation is typical of sites where
        larger lot sizes are appropriate to ensure flexible siting and design to maintain scenic
        and environmental resources.
    3. SR - Suburban Residential (1.1 to 10 units per acre). Provides for single-family
        development that is typical of most residential areas of the city. This is the single largest
        residential category. One dwelling unit per parcel, with the potential for a secondary
        dwelling unit. Other uses which may be considered potentially compatible with single-
        family neighborhoods include, but are not limited to, religious facilities, daycare and
        group care facilities, schools, cemeteries and home occupations subject to compliance
        with City standards.
    4. MDR - Medium Density Residential (10.1 to 20 units per acre). Intended for attached
        dwelling units, typically two or three stories, which include on-site usable open space.
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-19
    CHAPTER             5
         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
               Medium Density Residential land use would include town homes, apartments,
               condominiums and planned unit developments.
          5. HDR - High Density Residential (20.1 to 35 units per acre). Provides for higher-density
               multi-family areas, typically two or three stories, usually located near transit corridors or
               arterial roadways and located in close proximity to commercial services.
       Public and Other Land Uses
          6. Rural (0.0 to 0.20 units per acre). Includes sites where development shall be clustered to
               preserve at least 90% of the property in a natural condition and predominantly free of
               development in order to protect visual and environmental resources. This designation is
               typical for sites that are characterized by steep slopes, contain environmental resources,
               have visual significance in the community, are integral to riparian systems, or which
               have been identified as having limited development potential due to service delivery
               constraints. These parcels also create opportunities for urban agriculture uses, including
               agricultural parks and specialty crop farming. Other uses, such as telecommunications
               facilities, solar collectors, and wind energy conversion systems, may be considered
               provided they are designed to preserve the natural landscape. These areas help
               preserve remaining natural landscapes. In certain areas of the city, they can also provide
               open space buffers between Pinole and neighboring communities, serve as fire breaks,
               provide connections between neighborhoods and recreational areas, and may provide
               an educational resource.
          7. PQI - Public/Quasi-Public/Institutional. Reserved for uses which are public-serving in
               nature, including religious institutions, City and other government offices, publicly owned
               recreation facilities, and fire and police facilities. For schools, letters will be used on the
               map to designate grade levels as (ES) elementary, (MS) middle school or (HS) high
               school. This designation also includes facilities owned and/or operated by public utilities
               to serve the public with electricity, gas, water and communications.
          8. PR - Parks and Recreation. Includes public parks, City-owned conservation lands, and
               private open space or recreation facilities. This designation is intended for improved
               open space lands whose primary purpose is recreation and includes all local and
               regional parks. Wherever possible, school sites shall be combined with public park and
               recreation facilities.
          9. OS - Open Space. Reserved for undeveloped lands which are vacant of structures and
               improvements and which are primarily maintained in their natural condition and
               designated as open space. In some cases, maintained pathways or access routes,
               which enhance access to the open space areas, may be considered suitable for this
               designation.
          10. SPBCA - San Pablo Bay Conservation Area. Reserved for the portion of the Pinole
               Planning Area that extends into San Pablo Bay and the land immediately adjacent to
               San Pablo Bay. This is primarily an open space designation with a few other possible
               uses such as for expansion of the Pinole-Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant, railroad
               corridors, passenger rail stations, recreation facilities such as the Bay Trail, or flood

        Appropriate commercial uses may include limited food establishments, marine-related
        recreational uses, marine-related retail, offices and marina berths. City uses such as
        water pollution control, corporation yard and parks are also allowed uses. Maximum
        FAR: 0.25.
    11. Transportation. Designated transportation corridors that accommodate movement of
        goods and services through the city, regional trips and transit service. The designation
        includes Caltrans rights-of-way, railroad corridors which provide transportation (portions
        of the railroad corridor not required for transportation purposes may be considered for
        other uses), San Pablo Avenue, Appian Way, portions of Pinole Valley Road, and other
        mass transit rights-of-way.
Three Corridors Specific Plan Area Land Uses
The three primary commercial corridors in Pinole include portions of San Pablo Avenue, Pinole
Valley Road and Appian Way that provide an opportunity to concentrate future development,
improve transit service by encouraging transit-oriented development projects, create more
mixed-use development, and encourage redevelopment and substantial new economic
investment over time. Where creation of a Specific Plan is recommended by the General Plan,
broad land use categories with flexible development standards are established as follows:
    12. SSA - Service Sub-Area (10.1 to 50.0 units per acre). The Service Sub-Area is intended
        to maintain and enhance existing land uses while providing land use flexibility and
        incentives to encourage new private investment and additional development. Each
        service sub-area has a different emphasis as summarized below and as described in
        greater detail in the Specific Plan:
        San Pablo Avenue: Preserve land for manufacturing and industrial uses, particularly
        ―green industry‖. A limited amount of general office, retail and residential uses may be
        permitted where they will not conflict with the principal industrial uses in the area.
        Pinole Valley Road: Maintain and increase existing employment opportunities and
        encourage new housing opportunities while accommodating commercial uses that serve
        residents through mixed use development. This is a transitional area that serves
        residential neighborhoods in Pinole Valley and serves as a gateway immediately south
        of the historic Old Town.
        Appian Way: Maintain and enhance the regional gateway area into Pinole and
        capitalize on freeway access to upgrade existing development and attract a desirable
        mix of commercial services and residential uses.
    13. OTSA - Old Town Sub-Area (10.1 to 50.0 units per acre). The Old Town Sub-Area will
        maintain and enhance the residential, commercial and mixed-use character, scale and
        style of Old Town Pinole. All types of commercial and residential uses as either a single
        use or in combination with other allowable commercial and residential uses are allowed
        within this area, at intensities that preserve the character of Old Town Pinole. The
                                                                      CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-21

    CHAPTER            5
         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                designation is intended to encourage ground-floor, pedestrian-friendly retail sales and
                service uses with upper floors of office and/or residential uses. Commercial activity can
                include a range of retail activity from neighborhood convenience stores and community
                shopping centers to regionally oriented specialty stores and office uses, including
                administrative, professional, medical and dental offices. Residential uses may include
                single-family and multi-family residential uses. The designation allows limited, small-
                scale specialty manufacturing uses, such as arts and crafts, woodworking, and assembly
                processes, when they include retail sales on-site and are located in areas that are
                compatible with surrounding uses.
           14. MUSA - Mixed-Use Sub-Area (10.1 to 50.0 units per acre). The Mixed-Use Sub-Area
                encourages mixed residential and commercial development that is united by transit and
                pedestrian improvements, parks and public spaces. This land use designation allows all
                types of commercial and residential uses as either a single use or in combination with
                other allowable commercial and residential uses at densities and intensities that support
                transit service. The designation is intended to encourage ground-floor, pedestrian-
                friendly retail sales and service uses with upper floors of office and residential uses.
                Commercial activity can include a range of retail activity from neighborhood convenience
                stores and community shopping centers to regionally oriented specialty stores and office
                uses, including administrative, professional, medical and dental offices. Residential uses
                may include single-family and multi-family residential uses.
       Development Densities and Intensities
       The density and intensity ranges for the above Three Corridors Specific Plan Area land use
       categories are as shown in Table 5.5. Residential and mixed-use projects shall comply with
       both the floor area ratio (FAR) requirements and the density requirements, except that the FAR
       for projects built pursuant to State-mandated density bonuses may be increased beyond the
       City‘s specified limits if necessary to accommodate the increased density required by law.
       The FAR provides a measurement of the maximum amount of building that may be developed
       on a site; it does not provide any specifications about how tall a building is or otherwise how it is
       shaped or how it looks. The FAR is not intended to define the character of a building or the
       quality of buildings within a neighborhood; such issues will be addressed through zoning and
       design standards that specify height, bulk, coverage and setbacks of buildings, and the form
       guidelines within the Three Corridors Specific Plan which contain more definitive formulas of
       how buildings are shaped and how they relate to each other and to streets and open spaces.
       More qualitative standards addressing architectural style, materials and other details are
       established through the guidelines contained within the Three Corridors Specific Plan.
       For purposes of interpreting the land use densities and intensities expressed for each land use
       category above and as described in Table 5.5 below, the following definitions apply:
                Density is the number of permanent residential dwelling units per total gross acre of land
                in the development site. Baseline development intensities allow up to 35 dwelling units
                per acre and a floor area ratio of up to 2.0.

LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
 Floor area ratio (FAR) is the gross floor area divided by the total gross area of the
 development site.
 The City may offer incentives for projects that provide community benefit. Incentives
 include density bonuses, FAR bonuses and other benefits that the City may grant in
 return for special benefits provided by the development project to a particular
 neighborhood or the city as a whole for transit-oriented development (TOD), particularly
 in Priority Development Areas (PDAs). This includes, but is not limited to, projects with
 three or more of the following features. Examples of community benefits include:
     Residential developments with mixed-income workforce housing that includes long-
     term affordability covenants to assure at least 20 percent of the units on site remain
     affordable to lower-income households
     Residential or nonresidential developments with on-site child care
     LEED-certified gold or higher green building developments
     On-site recreation facilities available to the public
     Developments that include 50 or more employment opportunities for existing
     residents
     Developments which include substantial public art features
     Developments that provide a bus turnout or other features that directly benefit transit
     riders or transit providers
     Construction of       off-site infrastructure  improvements to correct pre-existing
     deficiencies
     Substantial financial contributions that enable the City to complete high-priority
     capital projects listed in the most recent City Capital Improvement Program
     Other features that provide substantial benefits and address unmet needs of the
     neighborhood or City as a whole
 The City may zone property to allow development up to the maximum density or FAR
 allowed with TOD incentives to encourage development of sites that provide TOD
 opportunities in accordance with PDA objectives.

     LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
LAND USE OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
This General Plan contains goals, policies and implementation actions that:
    1. Anticipate redevelopment or revitalization of existing retail centers, notably at Appian 80
        and Fitzgerald Drive.
    2. Concentrate new development along the primary transportation corridors.
    3. Protect visually prominent, environmentally sensitive property for Rural Residential use.
    4. Balance resource protection, public service needs, public access, and recreation within
        the San Pablo Bay Conservation Area.
    5. Protect and enhance Pinole Creek.
    6. Preserve the physical form that defines Pinole.
Shopping Centers
Pinole‘s large regional shopping centers are currently adequately serving the needs of Pinole
and west Contra Costa County. However, as these properties age, the role of these shopping
centers and the ―highest and best use‖ of the properties on which they are located are likely to
change.
As the trends toward environmental sustainability increase and our reliance on the automobile
decreases, it is likely that improved transit options and opportunities will present themselves as
viable options in Pinole. The existing shopping centers present key opportunity sites for transit
hubs/access points. First, they are existing destination points that could be easily built upon and
improved. Second, these shopping centers are located on some of the largest centrally located
parcels in the city and therefore provide substantial opportunity for development through their
size alone. Third, the existing design of Pinole‘s single-story shopping centers with large
expanses of surface parking renders the land underutilized.
The City should explore the potential for improving transit connectivity at these sites, evaluate
the market conditions to determine what densities and uses these sites could support, and lay
the groundwork to allow a future overhaul of these shopping centers once the market conditions
and transit providers can support high-density mixed-use developments to better utilize these
centrally located properties.
Preservation of Resources
Several properties in the community have topographic conditions, visual prominence and/or
resource value that should be protected. Properties that are steeply sloped, highly visible, have
the potential for landslide and/or contain areas of environmental sensitivity should be protected
from development activities.
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-25

    CHAPTER            5
          LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
       Rural Properties
       In general, the Pinole properties that need additional protection have been designated as Open
       Space and/or Suburban/Rural Residential in the General Plan. The Rural land use designation
       modifies the development potential of certain properties to allow no more than 1 housing unit
       per 5 acres (0.2 dwelling units per acre) and provides greater design control over future
       development in order to avoid potential environmental impacts by:
                Requiring development to be clustered on the most accessible, least visible portions of
                the property;
                Preserving highly visible portions of the property as community separators and
                neighborhood buffers;
                Establishing desirable separations between environmental resources and future
                development.
       The visual and resource value of lands designated as Rural Residential is such that residential
       densities should be lower than called for in the 1995 General Plan. These lands create the
       opportunity for urban agriculture uses which should be preserved for larger land holdings. These
       properties also serve as community separators, potential fire breaks and visual buffer areas.
       Other General Plan goals, policies and actions seek to direct development so that it is clustered
       on the most accessible, geologically stable and least visible portions of the site to maximize
       community separators, views and other resource protection and to support urban agriculture
       uses.
       San Pablo Bay Conservation Area
       High priority shall be given to protection of the natural features of biologically sensitive and
       visually prominent lands with this land use designation. This designation is primarily an open
       space designation where the water-oriented environment of Pinole will be enhanced by
       encouraging development proposals that include very limited water-oriented commercial
       activities and include design features that protect and restore natural resources while providing
       improved public access.
       The Bay Trail
       As discussed further in the Community Services and Facilities Element, the Bay Trail is a
       planned recreational corridor that is intended to circumnavigate San Francisco Bay. Though the
       City has acquired parcels to contribute to the Bay Trail, there still exists a significant gap in the
       trail along the San Pablo Bay shoreline in Pinole from Point Pinole Regional Shoreline to Rodeo
       in west Contra Costa County. It is a priority that this gap be closed.
       For more information on parks and trails, please see the Community Services and Facilities
       Element. For more information on open space, please see the Natural Resources and Open
       Space Element.

      LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Pinole Creek Restoration
Since 1965, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers channelized a portion of Pinole Creek to
help provide flood protection, few improvements have been made to the creek. Many species
and their habitats have been threatened by the changes the corps made to the creek and by
impacts from later development. The Pinole Creek Restoration Project plans to restore high-
quality riparian habitat, provide additional flood protection and improve water quality in Pinole
Creek. This project will also enhance recreation by connecting Old Town Pinole to the Bay Trail
by means of a multipurpose path and will provide a launch for non-motorized boats at the mouth
of the creek as part of the Bay Water Trail backbone.
Railroads
As discussed further in the Circulation Element and Health and Safety Element, there is
opportunity for the City to improve transit opportunities in Pinole by exploring the establishment
of a railroad stop within Pinole and to establish the areas around railroad crossings as quiet
zones.
Sustainability and Green Building
Concerns about energy consumption, air and water quality, climate change and related issues
have caused the City of Pinole to actively promote development and construction practices that
are sustainable and to use green building techniques. Pinole is striving to achieve tangible
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and create a more sustainable community to help
combat global climate change through adoption of a General Plan Sustainability Element.
Pinole’s Physical Form
The city‘s physical form is largely influenced by great topographic diversity and by the major
transportation corridors that extend through the city‘s boundaries. Pinole‘s varied geography
includes the marshlands around San Pablo Bay, Pinole Creek, and hillsides throughout the city.
The marshlands have largely limited development along the Bay shoreline. The major
transportation corridors include the Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads,
San Pablo Avenue and Interstate 80 (extending east-west), and Tennent Avenue, Pinole Valley
Road and Appian Way (extending north-south). Interstate 80 is a regionally significant corridor,
the most traveled route through the city, and consequently most of the regional health services
and retail shopping centers are clustered near this interstate highway. The railroad corridors that
provide freight and passenger service through the community have also created a barrier that
constrains the San Pablo Bay coastline within the city.
Gently rolling hills are scattered throughout Pinole, and steeper hills parallel each other and
extend north and south. As a result of the hilly topography, residential streets weave around the
hills and residential neighborhoods perch on top of and cling to hillsides. These neighborhoods
are located south of San Pablo Avenue and west of Appian Way, between the Bayshore and
San Pablo Avenue, and south of Interstate 80 in Pinole Valley.
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-29

          LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
       Pinole’s Circulation Corridors
       In addition to the regional access provided by Interstate 80 and the railroads, the City of Pinole
       has three primary circulation corridors:
                San Pablo Avenue
                Pinole Valley Road
                Appian Way
       The San Pablo Avenue and Pinole Valley Road corridors intersect in Old Town Pinole and have
       been designated by ABAG as Priority Development Areas (PDA). The Appian Way corridor
       contains several developed but aging or underutilized properties, Doctors Hospital and
       Appian 80. There are many opportunities for revitalization in all three corridors and many
       reasons to focus future growth and development in certain planned areas. In order to meet the
       required Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) targets, Pinole will need to plan for
       additional residential growth and development in the coming years. Pinole will also need to
       improve its jobs/housing balance. Developing more housing in PDAs, along with amenities and
       services to meet the day-to-day needs of residents, helps a community to encourage a
       pedestrian-friendly environment where it is also easier to be served by transit.
       Another reason to encourage development within PDAs is that by focusing development in
       areas that are already largely developed, other areas of open space or which contain sensitive
       resources are left free from development.

       Figures 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 depict the area boundaries within which concentrated development is
       recommended.
       Resource Zone Map
       There are areas within Pinole that contain sensitive resources, as described above. This
       General Plan particularly discusses Pinole Creek, the area within the San Pablo Bay
       Conservation Area, and the visual resources and ridgelines found throughout the city, including
       ―Protected Areas‖. Figure 5.9 depicts these areas. Protected areas contain a combination of
       riparian, oak-bay woodland, and/or salt marsh habitat that are likely to be governed by General
       Plan policies related to resource protection. The Goals, Policies and Actions section contains
       several policies to suggest how the City should protect these resources.

                                                                                        CHAPTER        5
    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Action LU.1.3.1    Continue to identify civic beautification projects and programs to
                   implement the General Plan and include them in the Capital Improvement
                   Program.
Action LU.1.3.2    Implement the existing Residential Design Criteria and Guidelines for
                   residential development, and create design guidelines for Old Town
                   Pinole and hillside development.
POLICY LU.1.4   Preserve the quality of the environment through code enforcement and
                property maintenance programs.
Action LU.1.4.1    Maintain the existing code enforcement program.
Action LU.1.4.2    Maintain existing graffiti control and removal programs.
Action LU.1.4.3    Support community policing efforts and encourage neighborhood
                   volunteers to assist with outreach and education through the
                   neighborhood watch program and other community-based activities.
Action LU.1.4.4    Maintain the rental inspection program.
POLICY LU.1.5   Identify opportunities to achieve desired           land     uses   and    physical
                improvements in and around Old Town Pinole.
Action LU.1.5.1    Ensure that Specific Plans are coordinated to preserve and enhance the
                   character and function of the area that includes Old Town Pinole.
POLICY LU.1.6   Establish required setback areas around sensitive resources or reduce
                development intensity on constrained sites to prevent development impacts.
Action LU.1.6.1    Currently the Zoning Code identifies ridgelines as:
                        Ridgeline, major: A long narrow chain of hills identified in the open
                        space element . . .
                        Ridgeline, minor: A short narrow chain of hills which connects to a
                        ―major ridgeline‖ identified in the open space element . . .
                   Update the Zoning Code to require setbacks from sensitive resources
                   such as ridgelines, riparian areas and identified geologic hazard areas.
                   Such setbacks could include standards similar to the following:
                        Ridgelines: 300 feet vertical and 100 feet horizontal from the ridgeline
                                                                   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-41

         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
                                   Riparian: 50 feet from the tree canopy or from the centerline of the
                                   creekbed if no canopy exists
       Action LU.1.6.2         Consider assigning lower density/intensity land use designations, such as
                               the Rural Land Use Designation, to properties that are steeply sloped,
                               geologically unstable, or contain other environmental constraints.
       GOAL LU.2       Assure the City takes an active leadership role coordinating planning with
                       neighboring jurisdictions and other public agencies.
       POLICY LU.2.1       Continue to coordinate planning review of development proposals with
                           appropriate federal, state, regional and local public agencies (e.g., WCCTAC,
                           BCDC, EBRPD, ABAG).
       POLICY LU.2.2       Coordinate land use planning decisions within Pinole‘s Sphere of Influence
                           (SOI) or Planning Area with other jurisdictions (see Figure 5.1).
       POLICY LU.2.3       Annexation of areas outside the current city limits should be dependent on
                           resident interest, the cost/revenue implications of specific annexation
                           proposals and the ability to provide City services to the area.
       Action LU.2.3.1         Consider property annexation where it would:
                                   Encourage orderly growth and development through logical and timely
                                   boundary changes.
                                   Promote long-term and efficient delivery of local services and the
                                   assignment of appropriate local political responsibility for those
                                   services.
                                   Provide for the orderly implementation of the adopted Sphere of
                                   Influence.
                                   Implement the adopted General Plan.
                                   Result in boundaries that follow existing natural or man-made features
                                   such as streams, lakes, natural terrain, railroad tracks and roadways.
                                   Ensure economically feasible provision of services with available
                                   revenues.
       Policy LU.2.4       Continue to support the agreement for the Briones Hills Preserve that
                           established this area as an agricultural preservation area in 1987.
5.0-42   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                        CHAPTER        5
     LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Policy LU.2.5    The City should work with the school district to support adequate educational
                 and recreational facilities within Pinole to preserve these facilities for the
                 future educational needs of the community based on long-range anticipated
                 demographic changes. Should properties become surplus, the City should
                 work with the district to plan for effective reuse of any surplus school sites.
                 Any private redevelopment or use of surplus public school sites should be
                 consistent with the type of use and density of surrounding neighborhood
                 development. It may be in the community‘s interest to retain public education,
                 recreation and childcare facilities. To accomplish this, a density transfer from
                 a portion of the site retained in public recreation or childcare use can be
                 considered.
GOAL LU.3     Preserve historic resources and ensure high-quality site planning and design.
Policy LU.3.1    Old Town Pinole should continue to be an important historic resource to the
                 City of Pinole.

                     Guidelines.
Policy LU.3.3    Require design review of commercial and industrial projects to ensure
                 compatibility with adjacent or nearby land uses, including intensity, access,
                 internal circulation, visual characteristics, noise, odors, fire hazards,
                 vibrations, smoke, discharge of wastes and nighttime lighting.
Action LU.3.3.1      Develop and adopt Commercial and Industrial Design Review Criteria and
                     Guidelines.
Action LU.3.3.2      Update the Zoning Code to reflect Commercial and Industrial Design
                     Review policies and procedures.
Policy LU.3.4    Identify and protect sites and structures of architectural, historical,
                 archaeological and cultural significance, including significant biological
                 resources. Require new development in historic areas to complement the
                 character of nearby historic structures. (See also the Community Character
                 Element.)
                                                                   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-43

    CHAPTER           5
         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
       Action LU.3.4.1         Formulate design guidelines that include standards to protect and
                               enhance the historic character and historic buildings of Old Town Pinole.
       Action LU.3.4.2         Consider adopting an ordinance to protect significant biological
                               resources, establish an appropriate means of assessing and conserving
                               the resource, and identify methods of mitigating impacts to habitat.
       GOAL LU.4       Preserve and strengthen the identity and quality of life of Pinole‘s residential
                       neighborhoods.
       Policy LU.4.1       Ensure all new development, renovation or remodeling preserves and
                           strengthens Pinole‘s residential neighborhoods by requiring projects to be
                           harmoniously designed and integrated with the existing neighborhood.
       Action LU.4.1.1         Continue to implement the adopted Residential Design Criteria and
                               Guidelines.
       Action LU.4.1.2         Adopt appropriate guidelines to ensure that hillside development is sited
                               and designed appropriately to protect visual resources and avoid
                               unnecessary site disturbance and geologic risks.
       Policy LU.4.2       Maintain the character and long-term viability of the city‘s residential areas by
                           ensuring that residential projects are well designed and consistent with site
                           and area resources and constraints. The following guidelines shall provide a
                           starting point for establishing project-specific densities, as shown on the Land

                           a) Low End of the Density Range/Below the Maximum Allowable Density:
                               The low end of the range is appropriate for sites with challenging
                               development constraints, such as those with restrictive easements,
                               irregular shape, proximity to important open space or natural resources,
                               other physical or service delivery access challenges, or ongoing safety
                               concerns.
                           b) High End of the Density Range: The high end of the range is allowable
                               when site development constraint issues (see Policy LU.4.3 and other
                               General Plan elements) can be mitigated through some or all of the
                               following:
                               1. Creative solutions to building location and/or design.
                               2. Preservation of views or vistas.
                               4. Creation of usable open areas for public and/or private enjoyment.

                           Residential, Rural, or Open Space. The following are specific policies:
                           a) Address site development constraints, including potential slope stability
                               problems, protection of open space resources and ridgelines, the need for
                               access easements, water availability above the 400-foot elevation, and
                               accessibility.
                           b) Cluster development on portions of property to protect existing natural
                               resources and view corridors as well as to minimize the environmental
                               impacts of any new development.
                           c) Locate and design structures and other improvements so as to minimize
                               cut and fill areas that will impact public views, safety and surrounding
                               uses, and avoid locating building profiles (silhouettes) above the ridgeline
                               when viewed from public streets and designated public access areas.
                           d) Consider existing access areas and easements for permanent public
                               access to the ridge trail during future development.
                           e) Consider these properties for acquisition as open space.
       Action LU.5.1.1         Development within the ridgeline resource areas (Figure 5.9) should be

    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
POLICY LU.5.2    Proposed development shall adhere to the following policies:
                 a) Address site development constraints and resources, including
                      archaeological sites, access, riparian protection, tree protection, steep
                      slopes, ridgelines, wetlands, potential geologic hazards, and protection of
                      views and open space resources.
                 b) Consider clustering all development in areas that are most geologically
                      stable and accessible.
                 c) Protect resources on the site, including the riparian corridors, visible
                      knolls and heavily wooded areas.
                 d) Protect drainage channels, the steepest slopes and wildlife corridors
                      (since they provide habitat and trail links), and locate development to
                      minimize crossing drainage areas.
                 e) Evaluate the visual impacts of development.
POLICY LU.5.3    Retain the Open Space designation to protect the resource and recreation
                 values of Pinole Creek.
Action LU.5.3.1       Establish a creek protection ordinance to govern land use along Pinole
                      Creek that takes into account resource and flood protection issues.
                      Standards may be different for existing and new development. For the
                      portion of the creek located north of Interstate 80, the protection zone
                      should extend 50 feet outward from the centerline of the creek. For
                      upstream parcels, the City should establish standards that respect
                      existing development patterns, particularly where the creek is located on
                      private property. Within this zone, riparian resource protection, public
                      access and recreational activity should be the primary use.
Action LU.5.3.2       In areas where existing development abuts the creek, recreational use
                      and public access adjacent to the resource are appropriate uses and
                      activities. Where undeveloped properties abut the creek, siting and
                      design of facilities should preserve and protect the natural resources, but
                      public access and recreational activity are acceptable.
GOAL LU.6     Protect and enhance the natural resources of the San Pablo Bay waterfront for
              public enjoyment.
POLICY LU.6.1    Retain the designation for the land immediately adjacent to the bay as San
                 Pablo Bay Conservation Area, and expand the San Pablo Bay Conservation
                 Area to include the Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant and
                 Bayfront Park. Primary use of the San Pablo Bay Conservation Area shall be
                                                                    CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-47

                           public access, open space and resource protection. The City should
                           formulate a plan for this area to meet the needs of connecting the Bay Trail,
                           providing backbone facilities for the Bay Water Trail, expanding the Pinole-
                           Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant, restoring Pinole Creek, and providing
                           Pinole residents with waterfront uses. All proposals shall incorporate public
                           open space and provide public access to open space areas.
       Action LU.6.1.1         Establish a waterfront planning strategy to coordinate between regulatory
                               agencies, property owners and other stakeholders to maximize
                               recreation, public access and flood protection while ensuring continued
                               water pollution control and creating opportunities for water-dependent
                               uses.
       POLICY LU.6.2       Consider rezoning this site to Open Space for parks and recreation and/or
                           open space use. This site creates an opportunity to support water-dependent
                           and recreational uses as a staging area for the Bay Trail and parking or
                           Bayfront Park, or to support water pollution control plant expansion. Other
                           uses may be appropriate for this site provided they address the following
                           policies:
                           a) Address site development constraints including noise from the railroad,
                               potential for flooding and requirements for creek setbacks for
                               maintenance and habitat protection.
                           b) Consider improving the appearance of the recreational vehicle storage, in
                               the short term, through the use of screening and landscaping.
                           c) Consider City or Redevelopment Agency assistance in finding alternative
                               sites to relocate the vehicles parked on this site.
                           d) Consider restoring a portion of the site as a wetlands area.
                           e) Consider using this site as a railroad stop for commuter railroad between
                               the Bay Area and Sacramento.
                           f)  Consider acquisition of this site for recreational purposes.
                           g) Consider using a portion of this site for part of the Pinole Creek
                               Restoration Project.
                           h) Consider using this site for expansion of the Pinole-Hercules Water
                               Pollution Control Plant.
                           i)  Ensure that activities do not create conflicts with natural resources.

    LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
POLICY LU.6.3     Provide waterfront parks, pedestrian pathways and recreation areas that are
                  safe, accessible, and attractive for public use.
POLICY LU.6.4     Consider waterfront areas for mitigation of the loss of wetlands in other
                  locations. Establish required setback areas for any development around
                  wetlands and mitigation for any impacts or potential impacts.
GOAL LU.7     Balance housing and employment opportunities to reduce trips in and out of the
              region and encourage commercial development which maintains and enhances
              the quality of the city‘s commercial areas, provides services for residents and
              broadens the tax base of the community to provide needed revenues for public
              services.
POLICY LU.7.1     Provide sufficient land for commercial and industrial uses to allow for
                  development that provides basic goods and services to Pinole residents.
POLICY LU.7.2     Provide for economic development which (1) maintains the City‘s ability to
                  finance services and the construction and maintenance of public
                  improvements; (2) offers local employment opportunities for Pinole residents
                  to reduce inter-city commuting; and (3) assures the availability and diversity
                  of resident-serving goods and services.
Action LU.7.2.1       The Pinole Redevelopment Agency should establish a strategy for
                      optimizing agency assets and resources as it approaches the operating
                      limits of the Agency.
Action LU.7.2.2       The City of Pinole should identify projects that respond to community
                      needs and desires and that are supportable by the market, and identify
                      sites that could accommodate such catalytic projects.
Action LU.7.2.3       The City should create a climate that supports existing businesses and
                      shall periodically conduct a survey of local business needs to understand
                      how that support might be best accomplished.
POLICY LU.7.3     Continue to strive for a balance between the number of jobs in the Pinole
                  Planning Area and the number of housing units available for workers by
                  encouraging and supporting policies and programs, mixed-use projects which
                  provide both housing and employment opportunities, and the development of
                  affordable housing.
Action LU.7.3.1       Utilize the Three Corridors Specific Plan to identify sites that are
                      appropriate for higher-density residential development and create greater
                      opportunities for the creation of new jobs within mixed-use developments.
                                                                    CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-49

         LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
       POLICY LU.7.4       Encourage       affordable    housing      production   by    allowing    mixed
                           residential/commercial projects. Proposed mixed-use projects should:
                           a) Provide commercial uses primarily for residents of the project in which the
                               establishment is located and for adjacent residences.
                           b) Limit commercial uses to the ground floor of a multi-story residential
                               building or to single-story buildings.
                           c) Limit commercial uses to those that are compatible with residential.
                           d) Regulate signs through a planned sign program.
                           e) Protect residential uses from the noise and traffic generated by
                               commercial establishments with landscaping, open space and other
                               design features.
                           f)  Develop a parking management strategy that balances parking demand
                               with the objective encouraging public transportation and pedestrian/
                               bicycle circulation to minimize vehicle trips. This may include on-site, off-
                               site and shared parking to provide sufficient parking for residents,
                               employees and customers within convenient walking distance of the
                               destination.
                           g) Provide an adequate amount of open space for use by any residents of
                               the project. Such open space area should be designed to provide a
                               private area for residents.
                           h) Use sustainable, green building practices such as the use of solar power
                               or swales to help with stormwater runoff.
       POLICY LU.7.5       Ensure that new and existing developments can be adequately served by
                           municipal services and facilities in accordance with City standards. New
                           projects which require construction or expansion of public improvements shall
                           pay their fair share of the costs necessary to improve or expand infrastructure
                           to serve them, including street improvements, parks, water storage tanks,
                           sewer and water service, and other public services.
       POLICY LU.7.6       Consider the exchange or sale of City-owned land for private development if
                           such development can meet City needs based on the following criteria:
                           a) Revenue-generating potential of the land use.
                           b) Preservation of open space or important natural habitats as part of the
                               project design.

                      properties use(s).
                  e) Public notice and review prior to sale of any publicly owned land.
POLICY LU.7.7     Maintain an active role of the Redevelopment Agency in assembling land,
                  providing financial assistance for improving properties, paying for public
                  beautification improvements, providing marketing and promotion assistance
                  for retail activities, protecting historic properties, and providing low- and
                  moderate-income housing.
POLICY LU.7.8     The City should explore opportunities to extend the operating limitation of the
                  Redevelopment Agency. Should there be no extension, the City should
                  develop a plan for the last five years of the Agency‘s operating limits in order
                  to optimize use of existing agency assets and tax increment to support capital
                  projects and housing development that eliminates blight and supports the
                  development of affordable housing.
POLICY LU.7.9     Ensure that new or expanded land uses are designed to be compatible with
                  potential future uses of the railroad corridor as a more heavily used transit
                  way through noise attenuation, setbacks and appropriate access. Evaluate
                  surplus right-of-way to identify appropriate uses that would be compatible
                  with being located near the railroad right-of-way.
POLICY LU.7.10    Encourage development of hotels and motels in commercial areas, but
                  require strict design and use controls that consider potential impacts on
                  surrounding uses. Require adequate security, including security plans and
                  contracts, adequate lighting, and other motel and hotel security features, to
                  ensure safety for guests and the surrounding community.
GOAL LU.8     Concentrate commercial development and mixed-use activity areas within the
              Fitzgerald Drive, San Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road, and Appian Way
              corridors.
POLICY LU.8.1     Encourage land uses that attract higher-density residential development to
                  key San Pablo Avenue locations that support local-serving and specialty
                  business. Expand the range of community and civic uses within the Old Town
                  Sub-Area and encourage industrial uses in the Service Sub-Area at the west
                  end of San Pablo Avenue that can serve local and regional demand for green
                  industries and products. Utilize the San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use and Old
                                                                    CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 5.0-51

                           opportunities with a variety of housing types and densities.
       Action LU.8.1.1          Utilize the Three Corridors Specific Plan to encourage attractive mixed-
                                use development along San Pablo Avenue while retaining Pinole‘s
                                important view corridors; providing a safe circulation plan that includes
                                traffic calming measures, enhanced transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
                                facilities as well as to encourage sustainable and green building
                                environment.
       Action LU.8.1.2          Establish and enhance unique San Pablo Avenue regional and
                                neighborhood gateway treatments at the shared boundary with the City of
                                Hercules, at the shared boundary with unincorporated Contra Costa
                                County near Dursey Drive, and at the intersections of San Pablo Avenue
                                and Appian Way, San Pablo Avenue and Tennent Avenue, and San
                                Pablo Avenue and Pinole Valley Road to visually enhance the portion of
                                the corridor within Pinole over time. Based on funding availability and site
                                conditions, decorative gateway features could include signage, enhanced
                                landscaping, decorative paving, decorative lighting, and public art.
       POLICY LU.8.2       Utilize the Three Corridors Specific Plan to continue to revitalize the Pinole
                           Valley Road south of Interstate 80, encourage additional medical office use
                           north of Interstate 80, and enhance Pinole Creek as a natural amenity that
                           supports wildlife and provides a trail system connecting Pinole Valley High
                           School and commercial uses adjacent to Interstate 80 with the Old Town area
                           and with San Pablo Bay and the Bay Trail.
                           Continue to encourage the mixed-use nature of Pinole Valley Road while
                           protecting the architectural integrity of existing historic buildings and
                           connecting more recent development to the historic Old Town area. The
                           strategies below shall be used to support this action:
                           a) Further define and enhance existing regional and neighborhood gateway
                                locations consistent with the Three Corridors Specific Plan;
                           b) Ensure that the scale and massing of new development is compatible
                                with Pinole‘s small-town character along this corridor;
                           c) New development shall provide enhanced pedestrian and bicycle mobility
                                features that improve both connections within the corridor and
                                connections to surrounding residential, commercial, recreational, and
                                institutional uses.
       Action LU.8.2.1 Adopt and implement the Three Corridors Specific Plan for the Pinole Valley
                           Road transportation corridor (Action LU.1.1.1) to include design guidelines

                                               INTRODUCTION
         VISION STATEMENT
                                               This element of the General Plan describes the existing
   Pinole will maintain and improve            transportation conditions in the City of Pinole. It
       a well-planned, multimodal              describes the various modes in the existing
    circulation system. The City will          transportation system, the existing traffic volumes on
   promote accessible, economically            area roadways, and current levels of service. Relevant
       viable and environmentally              planning documents and policies and planned roadway
   sound transportation options that           improvements for the area are also described.
       meet the needs of residents,
        employers, employees and               A Circulation Element has been required as part of local
    visitors for safe, convenient and          general plans since 1955. Guidelines adopted by the
      efficient travel by a variety of         California Office of Planning and Research emphasize
                  methods.                     the need to develop a “balanced, multimodal
                                               transportation system.” Cost efficiency and protection of
environmental quality, including air quality, require attention to non-auto transportation facilities
and careful coordination with the Land Use and Economic Development Element (Chapter 5).
Section 65302(b) of the Government Code summarizes state law requirements:
          A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and
          proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local
          public utilities and facilities all correlated with the land use element of the plan.
PURPOSE
Traffic congestion and other circulation constraints are major considerations in determining
appropriate land uses and responding to future conditions that will affect the quality of life in
Pinole. The Circulation Element provides data concerning existing and future conditions as a
factual basis for community goals, policies and implementing actions for existing and proposed
roadway improvements and other transportation needs.
Pinole’s Circulation Element addresses such issues as regional traffic congestion, traffic
impacts on neighborhoods, public transit, trails and parking. More than other elements, the
Circulation and Land Use elements act in concert to help achieve a vision of sustainability for
the city. This element expresses a vision for the future where sustainable options of
transportation, in conjunction with thoughtful development, provide for the needs of existing
residents and businesses while preserving choices for future generations.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
Chapter 4:        The Growth Management Element encourages future growth to locate along the
                  primary travel corridors through the community and in areas that are or can
                  easily be served by transit.
Chapter 5:        The Land Use and Economic Development Element establishes land use
                  designations that guide future Pinole growth and demands on the circulation
                  system.

      Chapter 8:       The Community Services and Facilities Element sets policies for the future
                       maintenance of the road network in Pinole.
      Chapter 10:      The Natural Resources and Open Space element addresses pedestrian trails
                       and linkages for Pinole.
      Chapter 11:      The Sustainability Element encourages transit options for Pinole and guides
                       future growth to Pinole’s transit corridors. This element also addresses
                       greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that may be realized by reducing automobile
                       trips.
      ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES
      LOCAL AND REGIONAL REQUIREMENTS
      A number of agencies and pieces of legislation govern the growth and maintenance of regional
      and local transportation systems. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the
      regional organization responsible for prioritizing transportation projects.
      In November 2004, voters approved Measure J, extending the Contra Costa County
      Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Program (Measure C, 1988) by 25
      years. Measure C is enacted by the Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCTA). Full details of
      pertinent Measure J requirements can be found in the Growth Management Element. Below are
      highlights of Measure J that relate to the Circulation Element.
      Measure J continues a 0.5 percent countywide sales tax through the year 2034 that will be used
      to address existing major regional transportation problems. To qualify for its share of the sales
      tax, the City of Pinole will:
          1. Adopt a development mitigation program (adopted by Resolution 2008-92 on June 17,
               2008);
          2. Provide diverse housing options for people who live and work in Pinole (refer to Chapter
               6 – Housing Element);
          3. Participate in cooperative multi-jurisdictional planning (Pinole continues to be an active
               participant on the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee);
          4. Maintain the adopted Urban Limit Line (ULL) (adopted by Resolution 2007-12 on
               February 6, 2007;
          5. Implement a five-year capital improvement program (the 5-year CIP is updated
               annually); and
          6. Adopt a Transportation Systems Management Ordinance (adopted by Ordinance
               2006-06 on June 20, 2006).

Pinole has an adopted Growth Management Element as part of its General Plan, as required by
Measure J. In addition, Measure J requires that tax revenues be dedicated to transportation
projects in Contra Costa County and to the implementation of a Growth Management Program
by all the cities and the County. Specifically, Measure J provides funding for three categories of
transportation projects:
    1. Transportation projects identified in Measure J;
    2. Paratransit programs;
    3. Transportation projects funded by Local Street Maintenance and Improvement or
         “Return-to-Source” funds.
Pinole has met and will continue to meet all Measure J requirements.
The West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee (WCCTAC) is one of four Regional
Transportation Planning Committees in Contra Costa County, and the committee of which
Pinole is a member. The Regional Transportation Planning Committees were created to
manage the 1988 Measure C 1/2 cent transportation sales tax projects and programs, as well
as its extension, Measure J, approved by Contra Costa voters in 2004. In addition to managing
revenues from Measures C and J, WCCTAC also administers the subregional transportation
mitigation fee program (STMP) and participates in defining and implementing policies, programs
and projects to improve local and regional transportation and air quality.
PINOLE’S EXISTING CIRCULATION SYSTEM
The roadway network in Pinole is made up of Interstate 80 (I-80), operated by the California
Department of Transportation, arterials, collectors, and local streets. Roadways in Pinole also
support pedestrian and bicycle facilities, though there are some deficiencies in those areas that
are discussed below. Two railroad lines run along the San Pablo Bay shoreline and support
both passenger (Amtrak) and freight rail service (Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa
Fe). This circulation network connects to neighboring jurisdictions which offer access to ferry
service, passenger rail service, and the Bay Area Regional Transit (BART) system. Routes of
regional significance in Pinole are I-80, San Pablo Avenue, and Appian Way. The Background
Report contains more details of Pinole’s transportation services and facilities.
Transit Systems
Transit systems provide a motorized alternative to private vehicles. As discussed in the
Sustainability Element (Chapter 11), local governments are taking on responsibility for
combating climate change. This is done primarily through reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, a large portion of which are caused by automobile transportation. By reducing
vehicle miles traveled and single-occupancy vehicle use, and encouraging the use of other
transit options, Pinole can meet GHG reduction targets, meet state government requirements
for reducing GHG emissions, contribute to efforts to combat climate change and become more
sustainable.

    CHAPTER             7
                                          CIRCULATION
      Bus Service
      Bus service in Pinole is provided by the West Contra Costa Transit Authority (WestCAT) and the
      Alameda Contra Costa Transit Authority (AC Transit). Bus service facilities run primarily along
      Pinole’s main transportation corridors: San Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian Way.
      Passenger Rail Service
      The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) provides regional transit service to
      Alameda, San Francisco, Contra Costa and San Mateo counties. There is currently no BART
      service in Pinole. However, WestCAT operates the J bus route, which connects to the BART
      station at El Cerrito del Norte. In addition, the Orinda BART station is approximately 12 miles
      from the city and the Richmond BART station is approximately 6 miles from the city.
      Amtrak operates passenger rail service for three routes that traverse western Contra Costa
      County. While there is no station in Pinole, the closest stations are an Amtrak station at the
      Richmond BART station (approximately 6 miles) and the Martinez station (approximately 9
      miles), and there are plans to build a ferry and Amtrak station in neighboring Hercules. Two of
      Amtrak’s routes that stop in Richmond are intrastate services, the Capitol Corridor serving
      Sacramento/San Jose and the San Joaquin serving Oakland/Bakersfield. The other route is the
      California Zephyr, an interstate service serving Emeryville/Chicago. The Coast Starlight route,
      which serves Los Angeles and Seattle, also shares the existing track.
      Freight Rail Service
      The Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroads operate freight services that pass
      through Pinole. The Union Pacific tracks are located along the San Pablo Bay shoreline, which
      limits possible public access to the shoreline. Amtrak passenger trains share these tracks with
      the freight trains.
      BICYCLING FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS
      Pinole currently has few designated bicycle facilities. Reasons for this include disconnection,
      lack of signage, lack of roadway crossing aids, topography, and lack of bicycle lanes, and road
      width issues make it difficult to encourage the use of bicycles as a more sustainable
      transportation alternative.
      Bicyclists need parking facilities to access various places and services. Bicycle rack parking is
      located at City Hall and Fernandez Park. According to the Contra Costa Countywide Bicycle and
      Pedestrian Plan, Pinole requires adequate bike parking facilities at transportation centers, public
      parks and buildings, recreational facilities, commercial centers, and large multi-family residential
      projects. Other facilities that may enhance the bicycle system include directional signage
      indicating points of interest and mileage, water fountains, bicycle loops and bicycle showers at
      private facilities, and bike boxes at intersections to facilitate high-volume left turns.

                                       CIRCULATION
PEDESTRIAN SYSTEMS
Due to the age of existing infrastructure, many sidewalks in Pinole are too narrow to meet the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards and have utility poles and other obstructions in
the pedestrian pathway. Certain sidewalks in Pinole also are too narrow to facilitate convenient
pedestrian travel. Most signalized intersections have marked crosswalks on all roads and
pedestrian-activated signals. Intersections close to I-80 prohibit pedestrian crossing across
some road segments, though some pedestrians cross in spite of these prohibitions. Only one
intersection has audible crossing signals (San Pablo Avenue at Sunnyview Drive) and none
have audible actuation. Marked crosswalks are also generally found at unsignalized
intersections on some legs. Pedestrian curb ramps are located at most intersections except at
some T-intersections; however, many ramps are steep and are not optimally positioned to lead
into the crosswalk. Additionally, many existing pedestrian ramps lack high-contrast textured
markings that optimally delineate the pedestrian and vehicle areas of the intersection.
The city’s multi-use paths along Pinole Creek and in Bayfront Park at the Bay Trail provide
recreational and transportation opportunities to walkers. The Pinole Creek Trail provides
connections to several activity centers, but the Bay Trail must still be completed along the Bay
shoreline as discussed in the Community Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8) and
Natural Resources and Open Space Element (Chapter 10). Disconnection, inadequate signage
and width issues for bicyclists are equally problematic for pedestrians. Additionally, pathway
connections from Tennent Avenue and Railroad Avenue to the Bay Trail are unpaved and
unsigned. Neighborhood access to the Pinole Creek Trail is provided at Prune Street but
discouraged at Plum Street. The Old Town area also includes convenient transit stops along
portions of San Pablo Avenue and Tennent Avenue that are easily accessible to pedestrians.
OTHER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AIRPORTS
The closest airports to Pinole are Oakland International Airport, which is 27 miles away, and
San Francisco International Airport, which is 34 miles away. Buchanan Field is a local airport
that does not currently support commercial airline service and is located in Concord,
approximately 15 miles east of Pinole.
PARKING
Parking in Pinole is generally readily available except in Old Town, though off-street parking lots
and metered on-street parking have not been used as a method to manage parking demand.
EXISTING TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS
TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM
Neighborhoods wishing to install or remove speed humps on local or collector streets within
residential areas may submit an application to the Public Works Department. According to the
adopted residential traffic calming policy approved by the City Council on April 21, 2009, the
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 7.0-7

                                            CIRCULATION
      installation or removal of speed humps requires approval from 65 percent of the property
      owners within a defined area determined by the Public Works Department
      TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
      Developed because of the growth management requirement of Measure C, a transportation
      demand management program, 511 Contra Costa, was created to promote alternatives to the
      single-occupant vehicle, such as carpooling, vanpooling, telecommuting, biking, transit and
      walking in Contra Costa County. The program has three offices in the county. Pinole is
      represented by the office located in San Pablo.
      EAST BAY SMART CORRIDOR PROGRAM
      The City of Pinole is a partner of the East Bay SMART Corridors program, the goals of which
      are to “better manage congestion and incidents along regional routes, improve transportation
      mobility, efficiency and safety, and to provide timely, multi-modal transportation information to
      agency transportation managers and to the public”1 along three major arterial corridors including
      the San Pablo Avenue corridor, which runs through Pinole.
      I-80 INTEGRATED CORRIDOR MOBILITY PROJECT
      The I-80 Integrated Corridor Mobility (I-80 ICM) project is sponsored by the Alameda County
      Congestion Management Agency, WCCTAC, CCTA, California Department of Transportation
      (Caltrans), MTC, local agencies including the City of Pinole and local transit agencies in
      Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The I-80 ICM project’s goal is to enhance the current
      transportation network along I-80 and its parallel arterials, such as San Pablo Avenue, by
      building an integrated system that would improve the safety and mobility of all users.
      FOCUS
      FOCUS, short for the Focusing Our Vision initiative, is a regional planning initiative undertaken
      by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the MTC in coordination with the Bay
      Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and the Bay Conservation and Development
      Commission (BCDC) to support regional development patterns that are compact and transit-
      oriented.
      As part of the FOCUS program, all three of Pinole’s major corridors have been designated as
      potential or planned Priority Development Areas (PDA). PDAs are eligible for capital
      infrastructure funds, planning grants and technical assistance.
      Designation of PDAs in Pinole expresses the City’s priorities for managed growth and
      sustainability. This is one way the City is continuing to work with regional agencies to
      accommodate growth and plan future development in a more sustainable manner.

                                       CIRCULATION
Regional agencies are working with cities to provide technical assistance and grants and to
facilitate development within PDAs. Future funding opportunities are anticipated in partnership
with state agencies and other sources to focus regional development within PDAs as part of a
long-term strategy to accommodate future growth in a more sustainable manner.
PINOLE’S FUTURE CIRCULATION CONDITIONS
Future traffic conditions for Pinole are projected using the CCTA Travel Demand Model. Level of
service (LOS) is a measure of effectiveness by which traffic engineers measure auto and truck
service on existing or planned roadways. The definitions of the LOS measures are:
     A. Traffic flowing freely
     B. Generally unimpeded traffic flow
     C. Slower but stable flow with minor delays
     D. Reduced speeds and increased delays
     E. Slow speeds and significant delays
     F. Stop-and-go traffic, high level of delay
According to projected volumes, the future auto traffic conditions in Pinole will generally function
at acceptable LOS, with only two intersections and four road segments that will eventually
function at LOS E or LOS F. Please see Figure 7.4. While most of Pinole’s roadway system will
continue to function within acceptable levels, increases in daily volumes in segments along San
Pablo Avenue, Appian Way and Pinole Valley Road will slowly begin to exceed the capacity of
the roadway. Since increase in daily volumes is minimally due to growth in Pinole, the increase
in daily volumes can mostly be attributed to growth adjacent areas, such as Hercules, San
Pablo and the unincorporated county, as well as the lack of alternate transportation options.
Another cause of the degradation in operations can be attributed to the diversion of through
traffic from the congested I-80 onto local streets. The anticipated growth in both the San
Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento region is expected to result in increased demand on
the I-80 corridor.
Traffic improvements that would widen San Pablo Avenue in Old Town in order to avoid LOS F,
or support vehicular circulation at the expense of pedestrian circulation, have the distinct
potential to change the historic character of Old Town Pinole, damage the economic vitality of
the area, and potentially decrease public safety and enjoyment. The viability of the City being
able to purchase additional public right-of-way in that area is not feasible.
For these reasons, and with the overarching theme of sustainability in mind, the City has chosen
to adopt policies to enhance bicycle, pedestrian and public transit options.
As part of the ongoing effort to encourage future development along the three main
transportation corridors in Pinole (San Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian Way), the
                                                                        CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 7.0-13

       development projects that the Specific Plan encourages is the narrowing of San Pablo Avenue
       through Old Town Pinole. The road would be narrowed down to two lanes, a bike lane added,
       and pedestrian facilities enhanced, which would slow down traffic, discourage the use of San
       Pablo Avenue as a bypass for I-80, and encourage economic activity in the Old Town area.
       The City will encourage economic development in Old Town that supports this area as a
       destination and the vibrant cultural heart of the community and discourage the use of San Pablo
       Avenue in Old Town as a bypass for I-80. Old Town will continue to be served by shared
       parking facilities and on-street parking as specified in the Zoning Code in order to preserve the
       character of Old Town. Please see Figure 7.5 for a map of the Old Town Parking District. In
       addition, the City will encourage road improvements that increase pedestrian safety, especially
       in areas such as Old Town where there are destinations easily accessed by pedestrians. To this
       end, the City will support vehicle LOS F as the traffic circulation threshold for the Old Town
       section of San Pablo Avenue.
       It should be noted that several planning efforts are under way to address regional traffic issues
       that may improve the LOS in Old Town. They include (1) the I-80 Corridor Study by the
       Sacramento Area Council of Governments, ABAG, the MTC, and the Solano Transportation
       Authority; and (2) the I-80 Integrated Corridor Mobility Project. Further, the WCCTAC (West
       Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee) Action Plan includes objectives to help
       alleviate congestion along the I-80 corridor and could reduce the traffic impacts on the local
       streets in Pinole. The City will continue to work with regional agencies toward improving
       transportation conditions in Pinole.
       ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ADDRESSES
       This element provides goals, policies and actions that address the following issues, many of
       which were raised at public meetings for the Three Corridors Specific Plan, as well as during
       research to prepare for the update of the General Plan. Some areas of Pinole’s circulation
       system that are addressed in the goals, policies and actions are:
                Expanding and enhancing the pedestrian trail system in Pinole.
                Concentration of future development and circulation improvements around Pinole’s three
                primary transportation corridors: San Pablo Avenue, Pinole Valley Road and Appian
                Way (also see the Land Use and Economic Development Element (Chapter 5) and the
                Sustainability Element (Chapter 11)).
                Improvements to Pinole’s bicycle facilities.
                More walkable streets with wider sidewalks, pedestrian buffers, and more signalized
                crossings with higher visibility and actuation.
                Maintain level of service (LOS) standards for traffic operations, except in Old Town,
                where the City will work with CCTA to reduce the threshold to LOS F.

                                movement of traffic flowing into and out of the city.
       GOAL CE.3        Provide timely input and effective means (as appropriate) of programming street
                        and highway improvements to maintain the objective peak hour level of service
                        without detrimentally impacting community character or commercial activity.
       POLICY CE.3.1        Apply the traffic service objectives indicated on Figure 7.4 [of the Circulation
                            Element] for the identified roadways. LOS (level of service) and volume to
                            capacity (V/C) thresholds are defined as follows:
                            Level of Service A (50 to 59 V/C): Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic,
                            with little or no limitation on vehicle movement or speed.
                            Level of Service B (60 to 69 V/C): Describes a steady flow of traffic, with
                            only slight delays in vehicle movement and speed. All queues clear in a
                            single signal cycle.
                            Level of Service C (70 to 79 V/C): Denotes a reasonably steady, high-
                            volume flow of traffic, with some limitations on movement and speed, and
                            occasional backups on critical approaches. LOS C+ = 70 to 75 V/C. LOS C- =
                            75 to 79 V/C.
                            Level of Service D (80 to 89 V/C): Denotes the level where traffic nears an
                            unstable flow. Intersections still function, but short queues develop and cars
                            may have to wait through one cycle during short peaks. LOS D+ = 80 to 85
                            V/C. LOS D- = 85 to 89 V/C.
                            Level of Service E (90 to 99 V/C): Describes traffic characterized by slow
                            movement and frequent (although momentary) stoppages. This type of
                            congestion is considered severe, but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours,
                            with frequent stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections. LOS
                            E+ = 90 to 94 V/C.
                            Level of Service F (100+ V/C): Describes stop-and-go traffic characterized
                            by traffic jams and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized
                            intersections usually have to wait through one or more signal changes, and
                            “upstream” intersections may be blocked by the long queues.

organizations and agencies (e.g., schools, libraries) that are not
controlled by the City of Pinole. Nevertheless, the General Plan expresses the City’s objectives
for the operation, maintenance and expansion of both City and non-City facilities and services.
The General Plan land use designations create the potential for additional development in
Pinole. The Community Services and Facilities Element establishes the framework to ensure
that necessary capital improvements and operational changes are made to provide adequate
services to future potential development. Of the services and facilities discussed in this element,
sewage disposal and the provision of emergency services are the two that will require the
greatest facilities improvements and operational changes to respond to existing service demand
and accommodate future growth.
PURPOSE
The Community Services and Facilities Element is an optional element under state law but is
included in Pinole’s General Plan to address important issues related to how new development
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-1

   CHAPTER               8
              COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
      under this General Plan will affect the City’s ability to provide adequate community services and
      facilities. This element concerns the public infrastructure and facilities that support community
      functions and allow for the growth of the community. Operational and programmatic issues are
      considered, but this chapter is primarily concerned with the provision of capital facilities. It also
      expresses a vision for the future where sustainable development and land use practices provide
      for the needs of existing residents and businesses while preserving choices for future
      generations.1
      The primary tools for implementing the Community Services and Facilities Element are
      infrastructure and facilities master plans (i.e., water, wastewater, storm drainage, parks) and the
      five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
      Specifically, this element addresses the following service and facility topics:
                Civic/Community                                                          Water

      above topics.
      This General Plan aims to build partnerships between the City and other public agencies that
      provide services to the City of Pinole.
      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
      Chapter 3:          The Community Character Element contains goals and policies to maximize
                          preservation of Pinole’s historic resources, including Pinole’s public buildings,
                          and integration and interaction with Pinole’s education facilities, services and
                          programs.
      Chapter 4:          The Growth Management Element plans the future growth of Pinole, which will
                          have impacts on Pinole’s ability to provide community services and facilities.

         Sustainable development practices refer to the use of architectural and planning methods that address the needs of the present
      without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Specific examples include the use of solar panels for
      energy conservation, placing jobs near housing to reduce vehicle trips, and infill development in urban areas to reduce the
      consumption of agricultural land. Policies related to sustainability are identified with a symbol.

                 become more sustainable and for Pinole to incorporate more green building
                 practices, including ways affecting community services and facilities.
ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
As discussed in greater detail in this element, a number of improvements will be needed to
maintain quality service into the future. The following list identifies some of the more important
service and facility issues to be addressed in Pinole:
     1. Expand and upgrade the Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant to avoid wet
         weather discharge into San Pablo Bay through the shallow water outlet.
     2. Implement operational changes and provide building and equipment upgrades to ensure
         sustainable fire protection services into the future.
     3. Complete the Bay Trail connection through Pinole.
     4. Implement the Pinole Creek Vision Plan and Pinole Creek Greenway Master Plan.
     5. Expand park area to provide adequate facilities for Pinole residents.
     6. Develop a plan to satisfy Corporation Yard needs for the future.
     7. Maintain County library services and facilities in the city.
     8. Reinvest in existing infrastructure to maintain, and extend, its useful life.
     9. Continually upgrade communication systems, and support an emergency notification
         system to communicate with the community during hazardous events.
CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Civic and community facilities include public buildings that house the various functions and
services provided by the City of Pinole: City Hall; public safety (police and fire) stations; the
library; recreational structures, such as pools, recreation centers and theaters; health-related
facilities; corporation or maintenance facilities; and large capital equipment items with long-term
usage, such as fire engines and street maintenance vehicles. In general, civic and community
facilities in Pinole are appropriately sized and designed to support their intended use and have
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-3

   CHAPTER               8
              COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
      benefited from active maintenance. Existing facilities, however, are approaching an age where
      they are depreciating more quickly than capital is being invested to maintain them. Maintaining
      older infrastructure (e.g., sewer, roadway and storm drain systems) and extending its useful life
      is critical to Pinole’s future.
      Future Civic and Community Facility Needs
      The members of the community, and the departments that provide services in Pinole, have
      identified the following service goals and objectives that may require modifications to existing
      facilities.
                Pinole should make public buildings and facilities more sustainable by adding solar
                panels to City facilities.
                The City should make community services accessible to all areas of the community by
                providing transportation connections between areas and services or by bringing
                community services and facilities to underserved areas of the community.
                Pinole should upgrade all public buildings to current security standards.
                The City should maintain a functional Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in a state of
                readiness. This may require creation of a dedicated EOC that is not shared by other
                users.
                The City should dedicate land for a Corporation Yard that provides adequate space for
                current and future storage and operational needs.
                                                 POLICE
                                                 Police Facilities and Services
                                                 The Pinole Police Department shares the Public Safety
                                                 Building with the Pinole Fire Department. From this base
                                                 of operations, the Police Department patrols all areas
                                                 within the city limits of Pinole, responds to and
                                                 investigates crime, responds to all calls on school

         COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Future Police Facility Needs
The Pinole Police Department expects to continue providing police services to the geographic
area they presently serve, but may, due to fiscal constraints, have to reduce service levels and
eliminate programs. Several police facilities and programs require an update, including the
following:
        Expansion of and improved access to the secured patrol parking area at the Public
        Safety Building.
        Expansion of the Property/Evidence Room and enhanced facilities to ensure safe
        storage of material.
        Upgrades and/or changes to the computer-aided dispatch and records management
        system.
        Equipment upgrades to participate in the East Bay Regional Communication System
        (EBRCS), a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) established to improve inter-agency
        emergency communication. Pinole is presently an active member of EBRCS.
FIRE
Fire Facilities and Programs
The City of Pinole Fire Department maintains Station 73, the primary station located in the
Public Safety Building adjacent to City Hall in Old Town, and Station 74, located on Pinole
Valley Road. Fire and medical dispatch is handled by the Contra Costa County Regional Fire
Communications Center in Pleasant Hill. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is a shared
community meeting room located off the lobby of the Public Safety Building and is used to
coordinate and manage large-scale emergency response efforts.
The City of Pinole Fire Department provides full fire and rescue services, fire suppression,
medical advanced life support, rescue and hazardous materials response. The Fire Department
promotes disaster preparedness, fire prevention and safety in the city by providing free services
and safety devices, public outreach (schools, businesses) and public education and/or training
courses (safety demonstrations including child car seat safety and earthquake preparedness),
maintenance (station upgrades, etc.) and biannual commercial inspections.
Pinole shares responsibility for fire and emergency medical services with Contra Costa County
Consolidated Fire Protection District (Con Fire) and Rodeo/Hercules as part of a regional group
called Battalion 7. In response to a 9-1-1 call, the Battalion 7 fire engine closest to the
emergency is dispatched, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. This program has reduced
response times and assures that adequate numbers of engines automatically respond to each
emergency without additional requests for aid.
Figure 8.1 shows the Pinole Fire Department Boundary and Service Area as recently
determined by the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission.
                                                                   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-5

      Please see the Background Report for more details on specific public safety facilities, and
      please see the Health and Safety Element (Chapter 9) for more information on Pinole’s
      response to emergency situations.
      Future Fire Facility Needs
      The Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) produced a Municipal
      Service Review (MSR) which, when examined in conjunction with Pinole’s city budget, found
      that the current level of service from the fire department is unsustainable. This finding has
      prompted the City to consider various service options to improve staffing efficiencies and to
      address funding challenges associated with maintaining two fire stations. To maintain
      exceptional fire services, the City will need to establish a multifaceted approach to fire protection
      that includes the following:
          1. Operational planning that critically examines existing and anticipated needs and
               resources within the region and that takes advantage of opportunities that may result
               from consolidation of services, overlapping service areas and shared emergency service
               responsibility in and around Pinole. Operational changes could include:
                    Maintaining the Pinole Fire Department as an independent department;
                    Consolidating the Pinole Fire Department with the Rodeo/Hercules Fire Protection
                    District, with Con Fire, or with both together;
                    Entering into an agreement to share a fire station with other service providers; and/or
                    Establishing alternative staffing models.
          2. Fire facilities planning to optimize fire protection in Pinole by ensuring personnel and
               apparatus are strategically located to maximize coverage. Facility planning could
               include:
                    Consolidating fire services within one station; and/or
                    Construction of new facilities in a location that more efficiently serves all
                    neighborhoods in Pinole as well as immediately surrounding areas.
          3. Improved open space management to reduce wildfire risks and match maintenance
               expectations and obligations. Open space management options could include:
                    Changing ownership arrangements so that open space would be managed by a land
                    trust, other public organizations or private entities; and/or
                    Improved, all-weather access through open space to improve access to and from
                    Hercules and El Sobrante to shorten response times and improve mutual aid.

       Trails Facilities and Programs
       The City of Pinole maintains local pedestrian and hiking trails for recreational use by residents
       and visitors. The San Francisco Bay Trail runs along the northern edge of the city adjacent to
       San Pablo Bay and is maintained by the East Bay Regional Parks District. The Pinole Creek
       Trail provides access to San Pablo Bay and the Bay Trail from properties abutting Interstate 80
       to the south.
       Please see the Natural Resources and Open Space Element (Chapter 10) for more information
       on Pinole’s open space trails.

           COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Future Parks, Trails and Recreation Facility Needs
The Pinole Recreation Department expects to expand in the future as school enrollment
increases. They will likely be adding additional fitness and sports activities plus on-site after-
school programs at almost all Pinole schools. In order to accommodate some of these
expanded services, additional facilities will need to be added to some schools. Because almost
75 percent of the department budget is recovered from fees paid for services and by fundraising
activities, budget constraints will not limit Recreation Department services as much as those of
other City departments. Since 2001, the Recreation Department has continued to grow and
expand in response to a strong community desire for active and safe recreation programs.
Park facilities will need to expand in the future. Pinole currently has approximately 1.8 acres of
parks for every 1,000 residents, while the National Recreation and Parks Association
recommends having 2.5 acres of parks per 1,000 residents and the California Quimby Act
recommends 3 to 5 acres per 1,000 residents. Areas of the city are underserved and do not
have a park within walking or bicycling distance.
A number of trail improvements should be implemented during the life of the General Plan,
including the following:
         The trail along Pinole Creek should be connected to East Bay Municipal Utility District
         (EBMUD) watershed lands by a continuous trail from the city’s Bayshore to the city’s
         ridges. One route could begin at Pinole Valley High School, extend to Duncan Canyon,
         cross Rancho Road and run alongside either Galbreth Road or Pinole Valley Road to
         connect with Adobe Road in Pinole Valley Park.
         Completion of the Bay Trail along the San Pablo Bay shoreline in Pinole remains a
         priority project.
         Implementation of the Pinole Creek Vision Plan and the Pinole Creek Greenway Master
         Plan would result in enhanced recreation trails and access to environmental resources
         within Pinole.
         Goals, policies and actions also include provisions for the development of new hiking
         trails and the creation of new protected public open space for passive recreation.
HEALTH-RELATED FACILITIES
Hospital Facilities and Programs
The John Muir Medical Center, Walnut Creek campus, is the only trauma center for Contra
Costa County and parts of Solano County. Oakland Children’s Hospital provides trauma
services for children, and Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo provides the nearest emergency
room services. Contra Costa Regional Medical Center in Martinez (a County-owned hospital),
Los Medanos Community Hospital in Pittsburg, John Muir Medical Center campuses in Walnut
Creek and Concord, and Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo are the primary medical service
providers for Contra Costa County. There are also several hospitals, County health centers, and
public health clinics located in and around the rest of the county. Those health care facilities
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-11

    CHAPTER            8
              COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
       located in close enough proximity to Pinole to provide many primary health care services
       include the Richmond Health Center, the North Richmond Center for Health, the Martinez
       Family Practice Center and the Martinez Specialty Center.
       Medical Support Facilities and Programs
       Pinole’s Fire Department provides emergency medical response service to the city and has an
       automatic aid agreement with Con Fire and the Rodeo-Hercules Fire District. Other medical
       support options include Kaiser medical offices in Pinole (no emergency room care), Kaiser
       offices in Richmond, and the County facility in Martinez. Some trauma victims are transported to
       John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek by air or ground. All air transport of trauma patients
       is routed to the John Muir Medical Center. Ground-transported trauma cases are routed either
       to the John Muir Medical Center for acute trauma or to Doctors Medical Center for other
       emergency medical attention.
       The Pinole Fire Department is not the patient transport provider for the City of Pinole. American
       Medical Response (AMR) currently provides countywide emergency transport. Typical
       emergency medical services involve first response by paramedics followed by AMR ambulance
       response. AMR units are positioned to provide time-efficient response in West Contra Costa
       County. It is not uncommon for Fire Department paramedics to assist or maintain patient care
       in emergencies and administer care during ambulance transport.
       Pinole has a high number of medical offices including doctors, dentists and other medical
       professionals that help serve the medical needs of the city. Many of these facilities were built
       around the now closed Doctors Hospital. While these facilities do not provide emergency
       services, they provide valuable medical care services to the community.
       Senior Services Facilities and Programs
       Pinole has several facilities and programs for local seniors. The Senior Village of Pinole offers
       opportunities for independent and assisted living for adults. The Pinole Senior Center is a very
       popular program and facility, as described in the Background Report, and provides social,
       educational, recreational, health, nutritional, and consumer services and activities. Bay Park is a
       retirement residence and a facility for seniors.
       Future Health-Related Facility Needs
       Pinole will continue to encourage the location and growth of health-related facilities in the city.
       Pinole will also take advantage of opportunities to reuse the existing Doctors Hospital site for
       medical purposes when considering redevelopment options for this site.

                                           Public elementary, middle and high schools in Pinole are
                                           governed by the West Contra Costa Unified School
                                           District (WCCUSD). The WCCUSD has adequate
                                           capacity, particularly in Pinole. There are also private
                                           schools and preschools throughout Pinole.
                                           Future Educational Facility Needs
    Ellerhorst Elementary School in Pinole Current enrollment and projected population growth
                                           shows that the school district currently has the capacity
to handle any future student population in Pinole. Due to declining enrollment and budget
constraints, the WCCUSD is closing school sites in the district. While Pinole schools will remain
open for the foreseeable future, the City should develop contingency plans for reuse of school
sites should closure take place. The City will continue to collaborate with the West Contra Costa
County Unified School District in planning for quality school sites and facilities for Pinole’s youth
in grades kindergarten through 12.
The City will also continue to advocate for safe transportation and circulation at school sites
(also see the Circulation Element, Chapter 7). Currently, there are safety concerns with travel to
and from school sites, particularly the high school. Traffic on heavily traveled roads and a lack of
clearly marked crosswalks and bicycle lanes create conditions that may inhibit safe pedestrian
and bicycle travel going to and from the schools.
Library Facilities and Programs
There is one library in the City of Pinole. The Pinole Library is a branch of, and is operated by,
the Contra Costa County library system. Located on Pinole Valley Road, the library was
renovated in 2002.
Future Library Facilities Needs
Though the library is operated by the County, the City has contributed funds for capital
improvement projects and maintenance in order to defray County costs of library operation. The
City cannot maintain this practice indefinitely, and the County continues to struggle to maintain
existing levels of service. The library administration has expressed an interest in leasing library
space in another location as a way to avoid the maintenance costs associated with ownership.
WATER SERVICE
Water Supply Facilities and Programs
The City of Pinole obtains its water supply from the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD),
which serves western and central Contra Costa County (see the Background Report). Please
see Figure 8.2 for an illustration of the EBMUD water supply system.
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-13

    CHAPTER             8
              COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
       Water Treatment and Distribution Facilities and Programs
       The City of Pinole’s water is treated at the EBMUD Sobrante treatment plant. Water is filtered,
       disinfected and subject to fluoridation and corrosion control.
       EBMUD’s Laboratory Services Division is a full-service environmental laboratory, which
       performs water quality analysis throughout each day to ensure the safety of drinking water.
       The district’s capital improvement program for the water system primarily involves maintaining
       infrastructure, constructing water supply improvements and regulatory compliance strategies.
       The capital improvement program is expected to provide adequate capacity for future growth in
       Pinole.
                                                WASTEWATER SERVICE
                                                Wastewater Facilities and Programs
                                                The City of Pinole Public Works Department and West
                                                County Wastewater District (WCWD) maintain the City’s
                                                sewer system, as shown in Figure 8.3. The City of
                                                Pinole is responsible for the collection and treatment of
                                                wastewater flows to their lift stations and treatment plant,
                                                the Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution Control Plant
                                                (WPCP). The Pinole/Hercules WPCP is owned and
                                                operated by a Joint Powers Authority comprising the
            The Pinole/Hercules Water Pollution
                                                cities of Pinole and Hercules. The facility treats
                   Control Plant in Pinole
                                                wastewater from both cities to secondary standards prior
                                                to discharge to San Pablo Bay. There are two
       operational discharge outfalls (deepwater and shallow water). The deepwater outfall is shared
       with the Rodeo Sanitary District and is permitted by the Regional Water Quality Control Board
       (RWQCB). The shallow water outfall is not permitted but has been used during wet weather
       conditions when influent flows exceed the capacity of the deepwater outfall.
       Currently, the Pinole/Hercules WPCP is permitted (as the plant was updated in the 1980s) to
       treat 4.06 million gallons per day (mgd) average dry weather flow and 10.3 mgd peak wet
       weather flow, but the plant has experienced wet weather flows of almost 20 mgd, which exceed
       permitted capacity (see Tables 8.1a, b and c). During the WPCP upgrade in the 1980s, the
       assumed total solids loading was 165 parts per million (ppm). Under peak wet weather
       conditions, it has sometimes been necessary to blend flows and discharge through the
       unpermitted shallow water outfall. The RWQCB has ordered WPCP upgrades to correct this
       condition. This condition means that the Pinole/Hercules WPCP sometimes has trouble serving
       existing development in Pinole and Hercules and would certainly have trouble supporting new
       development. Should this situation not be addressed, there is likely to be an imposed limit on
       future growth in the community.
       WCWD is responsible for collection and treatment of flows tributary to their lift stations and
       treatment plant. Approximately 0.4 square miles in Pinole lie within the WCWD (see Figure 8.4).

Since the greatest anticipated 2030 flow amount is anticipated to be 3.93 mgd, which is below
the existing capacity of 4.06 mgd, the average dry weather capacity of the WPCP will not need
to be expanded at this time.

Table 8.1c shows that the plant improvements that were made in the 1980s significantly
underestimated solids loading. This imbalance in processing solids has reduced the actual
capacity of the WPCP from 4.06 mgd to 3.2 mgd. Improving the WPCP’s ability to process
solids, such as by the use of clarifiers and aeration basins, will improve the capacity of the plant.
Future Wastewater Service Facility Needs
The WCWD has adequate capacity to continue providing services within their small portion of
Pinole’s service area.
                                                                        CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-23

    CHAPTER            8
             COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
       The WPCP needs to be upgraded to accommodate wet weather flows, to improve solids
       processing and to ensure there is adequate capacity for future growth in Pinole and Hercules. In
       addition to capacity issues at the plant, there are other issues related to the collection system
       and treatment process that the City should encourage the Joint Powers Authority (JPA) to
       address.
               The City’s sewer system has a significant amount of inflow and infiltration that may be
               reduced by lining older, leaking pipes and eliminating sources of inflow.
               Future sea level rise due to climate change could impact the Bay shoreline and
               particularly the area in and around the Pinole/Hercules WPCP. Preliminary estimates
               from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC)
               estimate that the sea level could increase by as much as 55 inches by 2100. Though this
               is an evolving issue and the actual change in sea level and the areas that will be
               impacted are uncertain, the potential for an increase should be taken into consideration
               when designing improvements at the WPCP.
               Pinole will work collaboratively with the City of Hercules to evaluate, select, design and
               implement improvements to the WPCP. Improvements may include some of the
               following:
                    Upgrade from secondary to tertiary treatment and install a new, permitted outfall in
                    Pinole Creek for discharge of tertiary-treated effluent. Abandon the two existing
                    outfalls.
                    Install a new, larger capacity pipeline and outfall at the Rodeo Sanitary District.
                    Upgrade the existing deepwater outfall and include the addition of a smaller tertiary
                    facility to handle increased wet weather flows.
                    Decommission and dismantle the existing Pinole/Hercules WPCP and divert all
                    existing flows to the WCWD facilities.
                    Divert all flows from the City of Hercules to the WCWD facilities while the City of
                    Pinole flows would continue to be treated at the Pinole/Hercules WPCP, which would
                    then need only minor facility upgrades (such as to the deepwater outfall pipeline).
                    Install a primary effluent flow equalization tank near the Pinole/Hercules WPCP and
                    make other minor improvements to the Pinole/Hercules WPCP such as a larger
                    pipeline to the deepwater outfall. The improvements need to increase the capacity of
                    the Pinole/Hercules WPCP and allow for flows over that capacity to receive primary
                    treatment before delivery to the flow equalization facility.
                    Upgrade infrastructure at the WPCP to support continued operations, including
                    installation of a fire hydrant.

          COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
The JPA has narrowed upgrade options for the WPCP to three choices:
    1. Secondary treatment of flows at the WPCP and constructing a new land outfall line to
        the deepwater outfall in Rodeo;
    2. Secondary treatment at the WPCP, constructing an underground tank to be used during
        wet weather events, and constructing a new land outfall line to the deepwater outfall in
        Rodeo; or
    3. Diverting all flows from Hercules to the WCWD facilities while only the City of Pinole’s
        flows would be treated at the WPCP.
The first option, improving the outfall line, was submitted to the RWQCB as the chosen WPCP
improvement plan on June 1, 2009.
STORM DRAINAGE AND FLOODING
Flooding in Pinole generally occurs as the result of either:
        Storm runoff originating within the Pinole Creek watershed and flooding lowlands
        because drainage channels and pipes are poorly maintained or inadequately sized to
        transport surface water to San Pablo Bay.
        The lower reach of Pinole Creek is filled with water from both storm runoff and a high
        tide. Under these conditions, storm runoff may exceed channel capacity and overtop the
        creek banks. The elevation of the water surface in the Bay varies depending on the tide
        and wind and wave effects.
For more information regarding flooding hazards in the city, please see the Health and Safety
Element (Chapter 9). Figure 8.6 illustrates the City of Pinole’s storm drain collection system.
Future Storm Drain and Watershed Facility Needs
Damaged, poorly maintained or inadequately sized storm drains in the city result in localized
flooding during the rainy season and will need to be repaired or replaced.
The Pinole Creek flood protection improvements were not designed to accommodate a 100-
year storm event. This condition could be exacerbated by changes in sea level. Because there
are limited opportunities to improve flood protection at the outfall, the City is working with the
Contra Costa Flood Control District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District to identify
opportunities to create an upstream detention basin in order to meter peak wet weather flows
and reduce the potential for downstream flooding. The Pinole Creek Watershed Vision Plan and
Pinole Creek Greenway Master Plan include restoration of the lower flood control channel to
improve creek habitat while providing flood protection and recreation enhancements.
The City should develop a management plan and/or implementation strategy to implement the
Contra Costa Clean Water Program and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit.
                                                                     CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 8.0-25

               COMMUNITY SERVICES AND FACILITIES
       Road Facilities and Operations
       The City of Pinole owns 6 arterial streets, 19 collector streets, and a large number of local
       streets. As the owner, Pinole is responsible for the design, construction, repair and maintenance
       of roads to ensure safe and efficient use of public streets. To fulfill this obligation, the Public
       Works Department administers surfacing and maintenance programs, including street
       sweeping, and coordinates with utility companies, neighboring cities, transit service providers
       and Caltrans to ensure circulation issues are properly coordinated.
       Future Roadway Facilities and Operational Needs
       Growth in the region and in surrounding communities will continue to place a burden on the
       city’s road network. This growth will likely result in the need for roadway expansion to maintain
       levels of service and an increased demand for road maintenance.
       SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING
       Solid Waste Collection and Disposal Facilities and Programs
       Richmond Sanitary Services (RSS) provides weekly solid waste collection and disposal services
       to residents and businesses in Pinole.
       The West Contra Costa Integrated Waste Management Authority (WCCIWMA) is a joint powers
       agency made up of the cities of El Cerrito, Hercules, Pinole, Richmond, and San Pablo and
       Contra Costa County and oversees the solid waste services for these cities and areas.
       Solid waste from Pinole is transported to the Portero Hills Landfill in Suisun City in Solano
       County (25 miles away) for disposal. The WCCIWMA has a contract with Portero Hills Landfill
       through 2014, at which point the contract will be renegotiated. The estimated remaining capacity
       of the Portero Hills Landfill is 38.1 percent.

Future Solid Waste and Recycling Facility Needs
Pinole currently has several programs to encourage recycling and other sustainable behaviors,
such as the community-wide swap meet and electronic waste recycling program. For more
information regarding waste and recycling, please see the Sustainability Element (Chapter 11).
ENERGY AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
The City of Pinole operates a noncommercial community access cable television station and
maintains a City website to facilitate the exchange of community information. The City also
maintains a fiber optic network of facilities as a deterrent to crime and to assist with police
investigations.
The City of Pinole does not presently own or operate energy
production facilities but is beginning to install solar power
generators to reduce demand for gas and electric power.
Electrical and Gas Facilities and Programs
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides electricity and
natural gas to the City of Pinole. The majority of energy that
PG&E provides the City is renewable (57 percent), and the
remaining energy sources are gas (42 percent) and coal
(1 percent).
With the city approaching buildout, it is likely that PG&E will have no difficulty in maintaining this
service.
Alternative Energy and Energy Efficiency Facilities and Programs
The City Council reduced the fees for a solar electric permit in Pinole to $300 per residence in
March 2008 to encourage solar energy installations.
General Plan policies promote citizen awareness of energy conservation programs and seek to
improve energy conservation through the Residential Rehabilitation Program.
PG&E has numerous programs to promote energy efficiency, many of which are free to public
agencies. PG&E’s Energy Partners Program provides assistance for energy conservation
improvements.
A number of programs have evolved at the state and national level (e.g., the American
Reinvestment and Recovery Act and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants
Program) that have the potential to support energy conservation in Pinole. For more discussion
of energy efficiency programs, please see the Sustainability Element (Chapter 11).

       Telephone, Telecommunications, and Television Facilities and Programs
       AT&T Communications provides local telephone service to the city, and cable television service
       is provided through Comcast. It is a goal of the General Plan to continue to provide the ability to
       maintain these services to meet the needs of city residents and businesses in the future.
       The Pinole community public access broadcasting cable TV station broadcasts to Pinole,
       Hercules, Crockett, Rodeo, Tara Hills and parts of El Sobrante. This operation is administered
       by the Recreation Department and is housed in the Youth Center.
       Both the City of Pinole and Contra Costa County have experienced a dramatic increase in
       demand for telecommunications products and services in the last decade as this industry has
       emerged to provide a new form of customer phone and related services.
       Future Energy and Communication Facilities and Program Needs
       The City of Pinole plans to take advantage of technological advancements to maintain open,
       transparent, efficient communication. While technology advances at a pace that makes it difficult
       to identify the City’s facility and programming needs into the future, Pinole will increase storage
       capacity and operating efficiency and take advantage of visual technological enhancements in
       order to convey information of community interest, improve civic services and business
       transactions, and defray City costs.

   CHAPTER             9
                                    HEALTH AND SAFETY
      PURPOSE
      The Health and Safety Element seeks to recognize and remedy both present and anticipated
      concerns about the ongoing well-being of the city’s residents, workforce and visitors. The goals,
      policies and actions identify viable solutions to minimize the potential risk of death, injuries,
      property damage, and economic hardship and social displacement resulting from fires, floods,
                                          earthquakes, landslides and other hazards. Additionally, this
           The Health and Safety          element addresses safety and hazards related to surface and
        Element addresses issues          groundwater contamination, the potential release of hazardous
             that will ensure the         materials into the community, and general issues related to
          community’s well-being          health care and police and fire protection services. By identifying
            from man-made and             these hazards and the appropriate abatement provisions, the
              naturally occurring         Health and Safety Element will effectively reduce the potential
                   hazards.               for loss of life, property damage, and economic and social
                                          disruption from catastrophic events.
      This element combines the noise, water and air quality analysis required by the State to be
      included in the Health and Safety Element, and guides land use patterns in a way that
      minimizes the exposure of city residents to excessive natural and man-made hazards. The goal
      of the element’s noise section is to identify the major sources of noise in the city and discuss the
      City’s role in ensuring comfortable and safe noise levels throughout the community.
      This element addresses air quality issues by establishing a framework for working with other
      communities in the region and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) to
      improve air quality in the Bay Area. The element’s air quality section underscores the effects on
      air quality brought about by land use patterns and the resulting transportation behavior. The
      goals, policies and actions outlined in this element focus on improving air quality through
      embracing regional coordination, “smart growth” land use concepts, transportation demand
      management, energy conservation, encouraging cleaner industries and vehicles, and public
      education.
      This element also addresses water quality issues. The element describes local efforts to satisfy
      the federal Clean Water Act and describes efforts to require on-site stormwater treatment in
      conjunction with new development to satisfy ongoing Regional Water Quality Control Board
      permit requirements.
      Finally, this element addresses the significance of health care accessibility and affordability in
      Pinole. This element will outline health care that serves various sectors of the population, as
      well as the types of health care facilities that serve Pinole. In addition, attention will be given to
      initiatives that the City or related agencies have begun or are in the process of developing to
      increase accessibility to health care for the entire population.
      By addressing all the components mentioned above, the City can maintain high levels of service
      while implementing necessary programs and capital improvements to ensure the community’s
      well-being.
9.0-2   CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN

                                                                                              CHAPTER          9
                                  HEALTH AND SAFETY
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Health and Safety Element works in conjunction with several of the other General Plan
elements. Most specifically, it relates to the Community Services and Facilities Element to
ensure the timely provision of public services and infrastructure, the Land Use and Economic
Development Element and Community Character Element to promote safety through design,
and the Sustainability Element which links land use, environmental protection and economic
development to ensure a healthy community. The four health issues addressed in this element
(air quality, water quality, noise, and health services) relate to other General Plan elements as
described below.
Air quality, particularly as it relates to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is a critical global issue
that Pinole intends to address at a local level. Air quality is tied to the Land Use and Economic
Development Element through policies related to land use patterns and density, and policies
that encourage infill development to reduce air pollution. There are also ties to the Circulation
Element as circulation systems around Pinole contribute greatly to GHG emissions.
Water quality is an important safety concern since the amount of impervious surface limits
natural filtration, increases stormwater flows and urban runoff in the community, and causes the
accumulation of contaminants in water bodies in Pinole. The water quality component is tied to
the Land Use and Economic Development Element through policies related to land use patterns
and density, and policies that encourage infill development in already urbanized areas. This
component also relates to the Sustainability Element and efforts to protect natural resources in
the Natural Resources and Open Space Element.
The noise component relates to several other elements in the General Plan, including the Land
Use and Economic Development Element, Community Character Element, and Circulation
Element. The Land Use and Economic Development Element and Community Character
Element establish land use patterns and development/design policies to ensure land use
compatibilities that include potential noise issues. The Circulation Element identifies the City’s
roadway network that is used in projecting transportation noise sources.
The health services component relates particularly to the Community Services and Facilities
Element because the City’s ability to provide adequate community services and facilities is
dependent on ensuring adequate public infrastructure and facilities to accommodate new
development under the General Plan.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The Health and Safety Element relates to several other plans and programs and the agencies
who administer them, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the
California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA) and the Pinole Emergency Operations
Plan (EOP). The full list of related plans and programs and information about each is located in
the Appendix. Many of the policies, programs and actions contained in the General Plan will be
implemented through the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).
                                                                           CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 9.0-3

                                      HEALTH AND SAFETY
      ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
      SAFETY SETTING
      A responsive public health and safety system is critical to Pinole’s future. Police and fire
      services must serve all areas of the community with an equal and adequate level of service.
      The City actively promotes programs to protect its residents and property from noise nuisances,
      seismic and geologic hazards, flooding, air quality, and man-made hazards. The City maintains
      an Emergency Operations Plan and is working with Contra Costa County to prepare a regional
      Emergency Response Plan to support and direct public safety actions during times of
      emergency. Together, these plans and programs help make Pinole a safe community in which
      to live, work and recreate. The following discussion summarizes the safety issues for Pinole.
      Additional details can be found in the General Plan Environmental Impact Report and in the
      Background Report.
      Seismic and Geologic Hazards
      The Pinole Planning Area is located at the northwest end of the East Bay Hills, next to San
      Pablo Bay. While large portions of Pinole exhibit generally stable soils and geologic conditions,
      steeply sloped hillsides and mud deposits along Pinole Creek and San Pablo Bay experience
      instability during heavy rains or seismic events (see Figure 9.1).
      The Planning Area is located approximately 1.5 miles to 3.9 miles northeast of the Hayward
      Fault and the Rodgers Creek/Healdsburg fault zone underneath San Pablo Bay (see Figure
      9.2). The Planning Area is also located about 18 to 20 miles northeast of the San Andreas fault
      zone. The Green Valley-Concord fault trend is located approximately 12 miles east of the
      Planning Area. Though the San Andreas fault system, which forms the boundary between the
      North American and Pacific plates, is the principal source of earthquakes in California, given its
      proximity to Pinole, the Hayward Fault poses the greatest seismic threat to the city.1
      Ground movement, soil liquefaction and landslides in susceptible areas can be expected to
      result in damage during a seismic event. The City’s 1995 General Plan identifies the primary
      geologic and geotechnical concerns in Pinole as slope stability, earthquake ground shaking and
      fault ground rupture.
      Fault ground rupture is a concern during a seismic event.
      Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the                            Given its proximity to
      earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the                    Pinole, the Hayward Fault

      1 The North American Plate is a tectonic plate covering most of North America, Greenland and parts of Siberia and
      Iceland. It extends eastward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and westward to the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. The
      North American Plate meets the Pacific Plate along the western coastline of California. The tectonic boundary
      between these two plates forms the San Andreas Fault. All land west of the fault on the Pacific Plate is moving slowly
      to the northwest, while all land east of the fault is moving southwest (relatively southeast as measured at the fault)
      under the influence of plate tectonics.

such as dams, bridges and nuclear power stations. According to data obtained by the United
States Geologic Survey (USGS) and released to the public in 1999, there is a 70 percent
likelihood of a 6.7 magnitude or greater earthquake between 2000 and 2030. The USGS has
emphasized the need for the heavily urbanized East Bay to be prepared should a major
earthquake strike.
Geologic Hazards
Geologic hazard concerns identified in the 1995 General Plan’s Safety Background Report
include ground subsidence and settlement, erosion, slope stability and foundation conditions.
Details on each are given in the Background Report.
Regional landslide mapping has indicated the presence of extensive slope stability hazards in
Pinole, with the hazard typically more pronounced on steeper slopes. The hazards can include
relatively large, loose debris flows. Figure 9.1 shows geologic hazards that include landslide
hazard classifications for portions of Pinole and in the City’s Sphere of Influence. Recently,
slope stability has been a prevalent issue in the city. In April 2006, a large landslide was
induced by heavy rainfall on Interstate 80 between Pinole Valley Road and Appian Way, closing
the westbound No. 4 lane for a few months.
Seismic Hazards
Seismic hazard concerns identified in the 1995 General Plan’s
Safety Background Report include fault ground rupture, greatest        Damage to buildings and
potential secondary seismic events, and moderate to low                utilities in Pinole is likely
potential secondary seismic events.                                       to be on those sites

Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone in the region.
A major earthquake may also trigger an industrial disaster. The City’s EOP identifies this
possibility as a particular concern for western Contra Costa County and Pinole. Western Contra
Costa County contains a high concentration of petroleum and chemical industries. As a result,
large quantities of potentially explosive, flammable and poisonous materials are being stored,
processed and transported in the county and through Pinole. Because industrial structures and
transport facilities may sustain significant damage in a major earthquake, the EOP establishes
protocols for addressing potential failures.
The City’s EOP includes the possible impacts on housing, population, transportation, medical
services, communication, utilities, and facilities and buildings in Pinole in the case of a major
earthquake. The Background Report contains more information on seismic hazards.

      Flooding Hazards
      Flooding hazards were identified in the 1995 General Plan’s Safety Background Report. Flood
      hazards result from localized flooding and standing water that occur during brief, intense storms
                                            when runoff exceeds storm drain capacity. The potential for
                                            flooding also exists at locations along Pinole Creek. Creek flows
           Localized flooding and           along Pinole Creek would not be contained within the existing
         standing water may occur           creek bank during a 100-year storm event. The creek channel
             during brief, intense          was designed to carry projected flows from a 50-year storm
                    storms.                 event. Consequently, the City has worked with the Contra Costa
                                            County Flood Protection District to explore two approaches to
      enhancing flood protection: (1) increasing channel capacity in the lower reaches of the creek
      and (2) reducing stormwater flows in the creek by diverting stormwater to a detention basin in
      the upper reaches of the watershed. Maintenance of the channel is essential to successful flood
      protection. The Flood Protection District does not have a
      dedicated source of funding to maintain Pinole Creek. Flood
      protection could be improved by identifying potential funding
      sources to correct this condition.
      Figure 9.3 illustrates the City’s flood hazards, including
      areas in the 100-year flood zone and areas between the
      100-year and 500-year flood zones. It is anticipated that
      existing flood maps will be changing to include additional
      areas of floodways.
      Areas of possible impacts due to flooding in Pinole include the Pinole-Hercules Water Pollution
      Control Plant (WPCP) and the freeway underpass at Interstate 80 and Pinole Valley Road. The
      WPCP is impacted by flooding of the creek when tidal surge and heavy rain runoff occurs. The
      ability for the facility to vent/drain is hampered by these conditions.

The Pinole Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) addresses flooding in the city. The EOP was
updated and adopted in May 2006. The Background Report contains more information on flood
hazards in the City of Pinole.
Wildland Fire Hazards
In January 2009, the Pinole Fire Department received notification of the adjusted “Very High
Fire Hazard Severity Zone” (VHFHSZ) from the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CalFire). The review and reclassification of certain areas that are prone to wildfire
was done under authority of California Government Code Sections 51175–51189 as a means to
address the wildfire threat statewide. Once in place, this designation places certain restrictive
building codes on development in the area. For the City of Pinole, the reclassified area involves
the Sobrante Ridge boundary of the city from Duncan Canyon south through the slopes above
                                       Pinole Valley Park. Only a few buildable parcels are actually
                                       encompassed in the fire zone within the city limits, although
                                       many homes are adjacent to this zone.
                                       Management, maintenance and use restriction issues will
                                       evolve as the City designates the new classification of the
                                       area by ordinance. The VHFHSZ is shown in Figure 9.4,
                                       which shows fire hazard areas in the city’s regions.
                                       Additionally, moderate fire severity areas are located
                                       directly south of the city’s southern border. This issue is

       abated separation between flammable vegetation and any property. Additional distances may
       be required depending upon the slope or other factors.
       The Fire Department also maintains the fire roads and fire breaks in the city’s open space areas
       and patrols the open space with assistance from the Pinole Police Department. Please see the
       Community Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8) for more information about public safety
       services in Pinole.
       East Bay Municipal Utility Division (EBMUD) maintains a Fire Management Plan which includes
       the Pinole Valley watershed basin located within Pinole’s Sphere of Influence. EBMUD provides
       fire suppression and protection services on watershed lands. See the Land Use and Economic
       Development Element (Chapter 5) for a discussion and diagram of Pinole’s Sphere of Influence,
       and the Community Services and Facilities Element for further discussion of EBMUD.
       Hazardous Materials and Waste
       Hazardous materials consist of any substance which has the potential to cause injury and can
       include flammable liquids and gases, poisons, corrosives, explosives, radioactive materials, and
       medical supplies and wastes. In Pinole, hazardous materials are transported over highways, in
       underground pipelines and by rail. Such materials are also often found in locations that have a
       long history of development, such as the City of Pinole. When these materials are found, there
       is a responsibility to clean them up and/or mitigate the effects of the materials on the
       environment.
       The storage and cleanup (remediation) of hazardous sites is largely regulated by a series of
       federal, state and local agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
       the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA) and the California Department of
       Toxic Substance Control. The latter maintains a list of hazardous wastes and substances. The
       Contra Costa County Health Department, Hazardous Materials Division specifically administers
       permitting and land use related to hazardous materials in the City of Pinole. The Fire
       Department works within the recently adopted County Hazardous Materials Plan.
       The storage and transportation of hazardous materials to and from nearby refineries in the cities
       of Richmond, Rodeo and Martinez has the potential to impact Pinole and degrade air and water
       quality in the community.
       The State of California identified 23 hazardous materials sites in Pinole as of February 2009,
       including underground storage tanks (USTs), leaking underground fuel tanks (LUFTs), and
       abandoned or leaking pipelines; 19 sites involved LUFTs. Figure 9.5 includes the location of
       hazardous sites in the City of Pinole as of 2009. The primary risk they pose is leaking of
       gasoline and diesel fuel hydrocarbons and related compounds into the soil and groundwater.
       Six previously identified sites have undergone successful remediation, which usually involves
       removal of the LUFT and any contaminated soil. Several of the remaining LUFTs in the city
       have undergone interim remediation.

Law Enforcement
Police protection services in the City of Pinole are provided by the City’s Police Department,
which is responsible for services related to the enhancement and maintenance of public safety
in Pinole. These services include preventing and controlling conduct that is threatening to life
and property, aiding individuals who are in danger of physical harm, protecting constitutional
guarantees, facilitating the movement of people and vehicles, assisting those who cannot care
for themselves, resolving conflict, identifying potential problems in the community, creating a
feeling of security in the community, and developing and implementing strategies and programs
which enhance delivery of police services to the community. Law enforcement services are
explored more thoroughly in the Community Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8).
Fire Protection
The City of Pinole Fire Department provides fire protection services within the city limits and has
long-term contracts to serve several county unincorporated neighborhoods adjacent to the city.
The Fire Department’s mission is to provide for the safety and welfare of the public through
preservation of life, property and the environment. The Fire Department promotes disaster
preparedness, fire prevention and safety in the city by providing free services and safety
devices, public outreach (schools, businesses) and public education and/or training courses
(safety demonstrations including child car seat safety and earthquake preparedness),
maintenance (station upgrades, etc.) and biannual inspections (commercial occupancies). Fire
protection services are explored more thoroughly in the Community Services and Facilities
Element.
Emergency Preparedness
In 2006, the City of Pinole updated and adopted an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The
goal of the EOP is to effectively and efficiently organize and coordinate the City’s response to
major emergencies. The EOP is designed to be implemented and exercised prior to an
emergency. The plan identifies four phases of emergency management: preparedness,
mitigation, response, and recovery.
                                  To ensure preparedness for an emergency, the EOP identifies
                                  the responsibilities of the following departments in an

                                  developing and maintaining standard operational procedures.
The City’s “Mutual Aid System” is the system which allows for the mobilization of resources to
and from emergency response agencies, local governments, operational areas, regions and the
state, with the intent of providing adequate resources to requesting agencies. The City of Pinole
is in the Contra Costa County Operational Area, which is in the OES Coastal Region
(administratively) and Fire/Rescue Region II, and requests mutual aid through this region. The
City’s EOP describes Pinole’s Mutual Aid System extensively.
                                                                       CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 9.0-19

   CHAPTER              9
                                     HEALTH AND SAFETY
       The City’s EOP is consistent with the Emergency Operation Plans of Contra Costa County and
       the State of California’s Disaster and Civil Defense Master Mutual Aid Agreement. The Master
       Mutual Aid Agreement details that all of the resources and facilities of the State, its various
       departments and agencies, and all its political subdivisions, municipal corporations, and other
       public agencies be made available to prevent and combat the effect of disasters which may
       result from such calamities as flood, fire, earthquake, pestilence, war, sabotage and riot. The
       agreement also states that it is desirable that each of the parties should voluntarily assist each
       other in the event of disaster with fire, police, medical and health, communication, and
       transportation services and facilities.
       In addition to the EOP, the City of Pinole is participating with Contra Costa County, neighboring
       cities and special districts to prepare a Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan (NHMP) to address
       regional emergency preparedness.
       For more information on the City’s emergency preparedness, please see the Background
       Report.
       Homeland Security
       Homeland security is of growing concern in the United States and therefore homeland security
       is an important aspect of the City of Pinole’s health and safety. The City’s Emergency
       Operations Plan addresses national security issues related to the city. The EOP identifies sites
       in Contra Costa County that may be subject to attack. These sites include the large petroleum
       refineries and other industry, local, state or federal government facilities, power and
       communications facilities, other utilities, dense population areas and major transportation
       centers such as BART stations.
       California has published a Terrorism Response Plan (1998) and Contra Costa County has
       developed a Terrorism Annex to the Operational Area EOP (1999). The Terrorism Working
       Group was developed in Contra Costa to address terrorism response planning.
       HEALTH SETTING
       Air Quality
       Pinole is located in western Contra Costa County, which is part of the nine-county San
       Francisco Bay Air Basin and the Northern Alameda and Western Contra Costa Counties
       Climatological Subregion. This subregion stretches 20 miles from the Richmond area through
       Oakland to San Leandro. Its western boundary is defined by the San Francisco Bay and its
       eastern boundary by the Oakland-Berkeley Hills. The hills are a significant barrier to air flow
       since they have an approximate ridgeline height of 1,500 feet.
       The air pollution potential of areas close to the marine air is minor, due to frequent ventilation
       and less influx of high pollutant concentrations from upwind sources. However, the occurrence
       of light winds (mainly during the night and early morning) may set the scene for occasional
       elevated pollutant levels. Pinole is downwind and surrounded by air pollution sources, notably
       the Chevron Refinery, that could intensify pollutant levels.

Air Pollutants of Concern in the Bay Area and Pinole
Most of the federal ambient air quality standards are met in the Bay Area. However, as of
February 2009, the Bay Area was designated as a nonattainment area for the federal 8-hour
ozone standard. The more stringent state standards for ozone and particulate matter (PM10 and
PM2.5) are exceeded.
Several air quality monitoring stations are located in the proximity of Pinole including:
         Richmond – 7th Street
         Richmond – Point Richmond
         Rodeo – Third Street
         San Pablo – Rumrill
Greenhouse Gases
In the City of Pinole, climate change could impact air quality and increase health problems. The
State of California is undertaking programs and policies to decrease its greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Please see the Background Report for more information on those policies, such as
Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.
The EPA’s U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
and Sinks demonstrates that electricity, transportation
and industrial sectors account for most of the
anthropocentric emissions of criteria pollutants and GHG
emissions between 1990 and 2004.2 A draft GHG
emissions inventory for the City of Pinole was submitted
to the City in January 2009. In addition, the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District recently produced the
Source Inventory of Bay Area Greenhouse Gas
Emissions by county. Neither the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) nor BAAQMD maintain an
inventory of any GHG emissions by city.                              Climate change could impact air quality and
                                                                         water resources and increase health

The City of Pinole is developing a GHG inventory to calculate emissions caused by activities
within Pinole’s boundaries. This inventory quantifies GHGs from municipal and community
activities, including energy consumption, vehicle miles traveled and waste production, and
provides a baseline against which future emissions reductions can be measured. A preliminary
analysis shows that the community of Pinole, including government operations, emitted
approximately 159,369 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2005. The

       Other Air Quality Issues
       Other air quality issues of concern in the Bay Area include nuisance impacts of odors and dust.
       In Pinole, surrounding refineries, particularly the downwind refinery in Richmond, emit odors and
       particulate matter that can impact Pinole. BAAQMD has enacted an odorous substances control
       program as part of its effort to control the use and emission of odorous substances and
       nuisance dust in the Bay Area.
       Sensitive Receptors and Pollution Sources
       BAAQMD defines sensitive receptors as facilities where sensitive receptor population groups
       (children, the elderly, the acutely ill and the chronically ill) are likely to be located. These land
       uses include schools, retirement homes, convalescent homes, hospitals and medical clinics.
       Such sensitive receptors are spread through most parts of Pinole.
       The BAAQMD inventory lists no major emitting facilities for criteria pollutants in Pinole. The
       current inventory does, however, identify dry cleaners and gas stations as sources of toxic air
       contaminants (TACs) in Pinole. None of the sources of TACs in Pinole are considered as
       facilities with health risks requiring public notification under BAAQMD’s Air Toxics Hot Spots
       Program. Larger industrial uses located at the west end of San Pablo Avenue store materials
       that can become airborne and contribute to a degradation of air quality in the vicinity of these
       properties and result in nuisance.

Water Quality
Federal and state laws govern water quality and regulate the major sources of water pollution.
The laws are implemented regionally through the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality
Control Board (RWQCB). The Pinole Planning Area is drained primarily by the Pinole Creek and
Garrity Creek watersheds. The quality of surface water and groundwater is affected by land
uses and activities in these watersheds, as well as by underlying geologic conditions.
Cities are required to implement Stormwater Management Plans (SWMP) with performance
standards and controls to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharge. The City of Pinole has,
and will continue to promulgate, policies and standards that govern water quality and watershed
protection issues to control surface runoff.
The City East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) provides domestic water service to the City
of Pinole.

traffic on Interstate 80, which runs northeast to southwest
through the community.3 The ambient noise environment is also
influenced by two existing rail transportation lines located at the northern edge of the
community. At locations removed from Interstate 80 and the railroads, the ambient noise
environment tends to be defined by local traffic and typical neighborhood noise sources. No
significant noise-producing commercial or industrial activities are identified in the City of Pinole.
Roadways and Railroads
The major noise sources in the City of Pinole are vehicular and rail traffic. The level of vehicular
noise generally varies with the volume of traffic, the number of trucks or buses, the speed of
traffic and the distance from the roadway. Noise generated by vehicular traffic in Pinole is
greatest along Interstate 80 and San Pablo Avenue. Two rail lines traverse the city, the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and the Union Pacific. There are no significant sources of
aircraft or industrial noise in the City of Pinole. The noise contours are shown on Figure 9.6.
The General Plan includes policies that would support a request to designate railroad quiet
zones around crossings in the city. Quiet zones would relieve the railroad of a requirement to
signal the train’s approach to crossings by blowing the train whistle. This signal, particularly late
at night and early in the morning, can be disruptive to adjoining properties. To ensure public
safety, the City should consider enhancing traffic controls at the Tennent Avenue crossing.
Non-Transportation Noise Sources
Industrial noise sources (auto repair, wrecking yards, equipments lots, etc.) are generally
significant only in industrial areas. However, there are locations where undeveloped properties
or current noise-sensitive areas abut industrial activities. Commercial, recreational and public
service facility activities can also produce noise that affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
3 The “ambient” noise level can be defined as the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given noise environment.
                                                                                          CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 9.0-23

   CHAPTER              9
                                     HEALTH AND SAFETY
       From a land use planning perspective, there are two goals for controlling fixed-source noise: to
       prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas and to prevent
       encroachment of noise-sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The first goal can
       be achieved by applying noise performance standards to proposed new noise-producing uses.
       The second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in proximity to noise-
       producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance with those noise
       performance standards.
       Some general types of existing fixed noise sources in the City of Pinole are general service
       commercial and light industrial uses, parks and school playing fields, and airplane flyovers.
       Site-specific noise analyses would be performed where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed
       in proximity to these (or similar) noise sources, or where similar sources are proposed to be
       located near noise-sensitive land uses. Please see the Background Report for more details.
       Temporary Noise
       Other noise generators in Pinole tend to be temporary and/or transitory and may be associated
       with special events and non-stationary sources, including emergency vehicles. By their nature,
       such short-term and transitory noise events are typically tolerable, but the City of Pinole
       continues to look for opportunities to minimize noise from such sources. For example, the City
       seeks to minimize noise associated with emergency vehicles by establishing control at
       signalized intersections in order to minimize the length of time that vehicles using sirens are
       stationary.
       Health Services
       There are no hospitals or urgent care centers in the City of Pinole.
       New Kaiser medical offices were built in the City of Pinole along Pinole Valley Road just north of
       Interstate 80. The facility opened January 12, 2009. The Pinole campus of Doctors Hospital
       closed prior to 2005, though there is a possibility of a medical center being located in the
       building in the future. A significant portion of the city’s jobs are in the medical and health field, so
       it would benefit both the employment sector and the health and safety of the city’s residents to
       have another medical use established in the Doctors Hospital building or elsewhere in the city.
       Issues with health care facilities and services are addressed in greater detail in the Community
       Services and Facilities Element (Chapter 8), which describes the health services available to the
       residents of Pinole.

ISSUES THIS ELEMENT ADDRESSES
This element provides goals, policies and actions that address the following issues, many of
which were raised at public meetings during research to prepare for the update of the General
Plan:
       Taking further actions to prevent flooding along Pinole Creek and improve stormwater
       drainage when possible, and measures to minimize damage from flooding and drainage
       issues when preventive actions are insufficient.
       Managing geologic and seismic hazards through rehabilitation and renovation of older
       buildings, and using inspection as a way to ensure new structures will be safe in the
       event of any likely geologic or seismic hazards.
       Improving traffic and pedestrian safety and taking measures to prevent accidents.
       Preparing to respond to major emergencies that could threaten the community and its
       citizens.
       Creating procedures to decrease the likelihood of harm to humans or the ecosystem in
       the event of a release of toxic or hazardous materials.
       Preventing further groundwater contamination while cleaning existing contaminated
       areas to minimize harm to humans and the ecosystem.
       Providing adequate police and fire protection in all areas of the city.
       Addressing both real and perceived safety concerns in the community through design of
       public and private projects, as well as enhanced activities and services.
       Reversing increases in regional air pollution, reducing local greenhouse gas emissions,
       and achieving attainment for ozone levels at both the federal and state standards.
       Improving visibility of scenic vistas.
       Making Pinole a healthier community in which to live.
       Creating opportunities to decrease the number of vehicle miles traveled, length of trips,
       and traffic congestion.
       Improving air quality through land use and circulation patterns to discourage fossil fuel-
       powered transport.
       Improving water quality through land use and site design controls to reduce surface
       water pollutant discharge.
                                                                        CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 9.0-27

                                    HEALTH AND SAFETY
               Creating more choices for multiple forms of transportation and strengthening pedestrian
               and bicycle mobility.
               Reducing noise from vehicle traffic, especially in residential areas.
               Controlling noise from industrial uses and aggregate operations.
               Maintaining livability in more compact neighborhoods.
       GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
               Goal HS.1: Minimize the potential for loss of life, injury, damage to property, economic
               and social dislocation, and unusual public expense due to natural and man-made
               hazards.
               Goal HS.2: Protect the community from the risk of flood damage and improve surface
               water quality.
               Goal HS.3: Minimize hazards of soil erosion, weak and expansive soils, potentially
               hazardous soils materials, other hazardous materials, geologic instability and seismic
               activity.
               Goal HS.4: Ensure that government agencies, citizens and businesses are prepared for
               an effective response and recovery in the event of emergencies or disasters.
               Goal HS.5: Support land use patterns and densities that lessen air and water quality
               impacts.
               Goal HS.6: Support multiple forms of transportation and a circulation system design that
               reduces vehicle trips and emissions.
               Goal HS.7: Ensure that all new development meets or exceeds state and federal water
               quality standards.
               Goal HS.8: Ensure all new development complies with the noise standards established
               in the Pinole Health and Safety Element, and prevent all new noise sources from
               increasing the existing noise levels above acceptable standards.
               Goal HS.9: Eliminate or reduce noise from existing objectionable noise sources.
               Goal HS.10: Ensure that environmental and public service conditions are adequate to
               support a healthy community.

                                HEALTH AND SAFETY
GOAL HS.3     Minimize hazards of soil erosion, weak and expansive soils, potentially
              hazardous soils materials, other hazardous materials, geologic instability and
              seismic activity.
POLICY HS.3.1     Require geotechnical studies for development proposals. Such studies
                  should determine the actual extent of geotechnical hazards, optimum location
                  for structures, the advisability of special structural requirements, and the
                  feasibility and desirability of a proposed facility in a specified location.
Action HS.3.1.1        Continually update the geologic hazard map with new information
                       provided by geotechnical studies.
POLICY HS.3.2     Require soils and geologic review of development proposals in accordance
                  with City procedures to assess potential seismic hazards, liquefaction, land
                  sliding, mud sliding, erosion, sedimentation, hydromodification and settlement
                  in order to determine whether these hazards can be adequately mitigated.
POLICY HS.3.3     Require that all geologic hazards be adequately addressed and mitigated
                  through project development. Development proposed in areas of potential
                  geological hazards should not be endangered by, nor contribute to, the
                  hazardous conditions on the site or on adjoining properties.
POLICY HS.3.4     Assure existing and new structures are designed to protect people and
                  property from seismic hazards. Evaluate new development on sites which
                  may have involved hazardous materials prior to development approvals.
Action HS.3.4.1        Update the Building Code and other codes as necessary to address
                       earthquake, fire and other hazards, and support programs for the
                       identification, abatement or mitigation of existing hazardous structures.
Action HS.3.4.2        Implement actions to address safety issues related to unreinforced
                       masonry buildings in coordination with historic preservation policies and
                       programs.
Action HS.3.4.3        Ensure that sites in Pinole which are contaminated with hazardous
                       substances are cleaned through decontamination of soils, treatment, and
                       filtration of groundwater.
POLICY HS.3.5     Require proper handling, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous
                  materials to prevent leakage, potential explosions, fires or the escape of
                  harmful gases and to prevent individually innocuous materials from
                  combining to form hazardous substances, especially at the time of disposal.
Action HS.3.5.1        Work with Contra Costa County and other regional partners to implement
                       the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan and notify the public
                                                                           CITY OF PINOLE DRAFT GENERAL PLAN 9.0-31

       Action HS.3.5.2          Use the Conditional Use Permit and Encroachment Permit process to
                                ensure pipeline safety when construction occurs. New developments
                                should screen, protect or underground all gas, electric and
                                communication lines, screen facilities (e.g., transformers) as safety and
                                conditions require, and provide underground connections when feasible,
                                to improve public safety and the city’s appearance.
       Action HS.3.5.3          A comprehensive investigation of hazardous materials storage tanks
                                should be undertaken for specific sites when development is proposed.
                                The potential hazard of any tanks or former tank sites found should then
                                be evaluated using California EPA and local regulatory guidelines, and
                                sites shall be remediated as needed.
       Action HS.3.5.4          At the time of new development, any known or discovered hazardous
                                material should be cleaned up and any impacts mitigated as required by
                                the governing law.
       POLICY HS.3.6        Support measures to responsibly manage hazardous waste to protect public
                            health, safety and the environment, and support state and federal safety
                            legislation to strengthen requirements for hazardous materials transport.
       POLICY HS.3.7        Limit development and require appropriate control measures in conjunction
                            with proposed development in areas susceptible to erosion.
       Action HS.3.7.1          Consider adoption of a habitat protection ordinance that would identify
                                and protect areas of biological value, including streams, creeks and
                                wetlands. The ordinance would include setbacks from creeks, guidelines
                                for avoidance of filling of creeks or wetlands and destruction of riparian
                                vegetation, standards for compensation of habitat loss (as established by
                                City of Pinole General Plan (1995) Open Space and Environmental
                                Protection 7-9), and requirements for mitigation, monitoring and habitat
                                enhancement plans. The ordinance would also cover implementation and
                                enforcement of specific criteria to ensure that safety, natural resources
                                and aesthetic values of Pinole Creek, other creeks and major drainages
                                are protected and enhanced.
       Action HS.3.7.2          Establish riparian and stream restoration programs that include
                                stormwater treatment, erosion control measures, stream cleanup projects
                                and revegetation plans for denuded areas. These programs may also
                                result in the removal of invasive, non-native vegetation that would be
                                replaced with native plant materials to stabilize slopes and enhance
                                wildlife habitat.

                                building setbacks, building orientation and noise barriers. If a noise barrier
                                is required for mitigation of exterior noise levels, it should be constructed
                                of tight-fitting, massive materials (1-inch-thick wood, stucco, masonry,
                                etc.) and should be of sufficient height to interrupt line of sight between
                                the source and receiver. Line of sight should be determined by drawing a
                                straight line between the effective heights of the noise source and
                                receiver.
