                                       Bikeway Classification Descriptions
   Class I Bike Path or Bike Trail
   Provides a completely separated right-of-way designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians;
   crossflows with motorized vehicles minimized.
   Sizing: Minimum width for Class I (two-way) is eight feet. Desirable width is 10-12 feet. Minimum shoulder width
   of two feet each side. Minimum width for Class I (one-way) is five feet. Minimum shoulder width of two feet each
   side.
   Class II Bike Lane
   Provides a restricted right-of-way on a roadway’s shoulder designated for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of
   bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or pedestrians prohibited; vehicle parking and crossflows by
   pedestrians and motorists permitted. Vehicle parking in a Class II bike lane is not desirable and should be
   discouraged. Additional lane width (12 feet minimum and 13 feet desirable) shall be required if on-street parking is
   permitted.
   Sizing: Typical width of eight feet. A reduction in width to allow for restriping of an existing roadway or for added
   turning lanes may be permitted. In such cases, a five-foot width, or gutter width plus three feet, whichever is
   greater, is the minimum width.
   Class III Bikeway
   Provides for shared use of roadway facilities. These bikeways share the street with motor vehicles or share the
   sidewalk with pedestrians. In both of these conditions, bicycle use is a secondary function of the pavement.

Quality Management Plan and participate in
regional efforts to implement TDM
requirements. Programs to increase transit
ridership     and     use    of   non-vehicular
transportation such as walking and bicycling
will be actively pursued.
TRANSPORTATION FINANCING
Implementing circulation improvements to
accommodate planned growth will require
financing.     Funding     for    transportation
improvements is available from several local,
state, and federal sources. The City will
identify available funding sources and
establish a Development Mitigation Program
(LFTM), and maintain the Comprehensive
Phasing Program, Performance Monitoring
Program, and Capital Improvement Program to
guide      construction   and     funding     of
transportation system improvements. More
information about these programs is provided
in the Public Facilities/Growth Management
Element.
The standards and programs required to
qualify for revenue from the Congestion
Management Plan and Measure M will be
applied in the City. Circulation improvements
to accommodate new development projects
will be constructed and/or funded by project
proponents. Fees will be collected for traffic
impacts of new development in accordance
with established fee programs.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                               Introduction
I.       INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element is a guide for housing within Lake Forest. The
Element provides an indication of the need for housing in the
community in terms of housing affordability, availability,
adequacy, and accessibility. The Element provides a strategy to
address housing needs and identifies a series of specific housing
programs to meet community needs.
This Housing Element is one of two City documents that address
housing issues – the other being the 2010-2015 Consolidated
Plan. The Consolidated Plan addresses housing and community
development needs and satisfies federal requirements for the
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The City became an
entitlement jurisdiction in 1994 and now receives its CDBG allotment directly from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The purpose of the
Consolidated Plan is to address the needs of lower-income groups who are the intended
beneficiaries of HUD programs.
A.       Purpose of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. The Housing
Element is one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing Element
law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments plan to meet the existing
and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The law
recognizes that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs,
local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result, housing
policy in California rests largely upon the effective implementation of local General Plans
and, in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element law also requires the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to review local
housing elements for compliance with state law and to report its written findings to the
local government.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from
October 15, 2013 to October 15, 2021 1. This Element identifies strategies and programs
                                               0F
that focus on: 1) providing diversity in housing opportunities and 2) maintenance and
preservation of the housing stock.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
            An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Section II);
   As discussed elsewhere in this Housing Element, the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) period

   begins January 1, 2014 and ends October 31, 2021.
                                                      1                                      January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                Introduction
           An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
            address the City’s housing goals (Section III);
           A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
            to meeting the City’s housing needs (Section IV); and
           A Housing Action Plan for the 2013–2021 planning period, including housing
            goals, policies and programs (Section V).
           A review of the City’s accomplishments and progress in implementing the
            2008-2014 Housing Element is provided in Appendix A.
B.      Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a Land
Use Plan which determines the extent and density of future residential development in
the community.
City residents had several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment
on the Lake Forest Housing Element. Two Study Sessions were held, followed by meetings
of the Planning Commission and City Council. Meeting notices were posted on the City’s
website, and notification was published in the local newspaper in advance of the
meetings. Copies of the draft Element were made available for review at City Hall and
were posted on the City website, and notices were sent directly to agencies that serve
the City’s special needs populations. These service providers included organizations that
represent the housing interest groups.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                 Introduction
C.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Lake Forest General Plan contains the following six elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Housing;
3) Circulation; 4) Recreation and Resources; 5) Safety and Noise; and 6) Public Facilities/
Growth Management. The City will ensure consistency between the various General Plan
elements and ensure policy direction introduced in one element is reflected in other plan
elements. For example, residential development capacities established in the Land Use
Element and constraints to development identified in the Safety/Noise Element are
incorporated into the Housing Element. This Housing Element builds upon the other
General Plan elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the
Plan. As the General Plan is amended from time to time, the City will review the Housing
Element for internal consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
State law requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water and
sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing in the event a rationing system is imposed. The
Housing Element will be provided to these agencies immediately upon adoption. State
law also requires that the safety and conservation components of the City’s Safety/Noise
Element and Recreation/Resources Element include an analysis and policies regarding
flood hazard and management information upon revisions to the Housing Element. The
City will ensure compliance with this requirement by reviewing its Safety/Noise and
Recreation/Resources Elements.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                     Housing Needs Assessment
II.      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Lake Forest lies in southern Orange County, approximately midway between San Diego
and Los Angeles. The City is economically diverse and provides a range of employment,
lifestyle, and housing opportunities. Since its incorporation in 1991 it has grown from a
population of about 56,000 to over 78,000 residents today. Most of the population growth
occurred as the result of annexation. Lake Forest is approximately 16.6 square miles in
area and is bounded by the cities of Mission Viejo to the southeast, Laguna Woods and
Laguna Hills to the southwest, Irvine to the west and unincorporated Orange County to
the north and northeast. The population is relatively affluent with a median household
income in of $94,632 in 2011 inflation-adjusted dollars. The 2007-2011 American
Community Survey (ACS) reported Lake Forest's median household income was 25%
greater than that of Orange County ($75,762) and 54% greater than California as a
whole ($61,632).
This section examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such
as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household
income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of
units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally, the City’s
projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census,
American Community Survey (ACS), California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD), California Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment
Development Department (EDD), Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) and other relevant sources. Supplemental data was obtained through field
surveys and from private vendors. In addition, the City’s Consolidated Plan provides
useful information for this update of the Housing Element.
A.       Population Characteristics
1.       Population Growth Trends
Lake Forest was incorporated in 1991 with a population of 56,065. From 1991-2000 the
City experienced modest growth of approximately 5%. From 2000 to 2012 the City grew
almost 33% to an estimated population of 78,036 (see Table H-1 and Figure H-1). A
majority of the growth during this period was due to annexations of unincorporated
areas of the County. The City’s 2012 population represents approximately 2.6% of the
County’s total population of 3,055,792.

2.      Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups require different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level,
and housing preference. Table H-2 provides a comparison of the City’s and County’s
population by age group between 2007 and 2011. This table shows that the age
distribution of the City’s population is similar to Orange County as a whole. The median
age of the City’s population exceeds the County median by almost two years.

3.      Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the City differs from the County in that a lower
proportion of City residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial minorities. Approximately
57% of City residents are non-Hispanic white, contrasted with 45% for the County as a
whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing in the City, at 23%, is approximately two-
thirds that of the County. Asians, at 15%, represent the largest non-Hispanic minority
(Table H-3).

B.      Household Characteristics
1.      Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the City and Orange County
as a whole, as reported in the 2007-2011 American Community Survey (ACS). Family
households comprised approximately 73% of all households in the City, somewhat higher
than the County with 71% (Table H-4). In general, household composition in the City is
similar to that of the County with small differences in family households with children
under 18 (39% City vs. 38% County), non-family households (27% City vs. 29% County) and
single living alone (22% for both jurisdictions). As of 2012, according to the California
Department of Finance, the average housing size for the City of Lake Forest was 2.95 in
2012 while the County’s average household size was 3.02. These statistics suggest that
that the need for large units in Lake Forest is about the same as other areas of the
County.

2.      Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying income, family size and
composition, and lifestyle. Table H-5 provides a comparison of the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units in the City between 2007 and 2011 as compared to
the County as a whole. It reveals that the level of homeownership for the City (71%) is
substantially higher than the County (60%).

3.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table H-6 summarizes overcrowding
for the City of Lake Forest between 2007 and 2011.

As of 2007-2011, overcrowding was more prevalent among renters than for owner-
occupied units. Approximately 12.0% of the City’s renter-occupied households were
overcrowded compared to only 1.8% of owner-occupants.                                     The incidence of
overcrowding was substantially lower in Lake Forest when compared to the County,
regardless of tenure. It should be noted that the City of Lake Forest Code Enforcement
Division enforces the occupancy standards of the California Uniform Housing Code (2000
edition), which are based on persons per square feet. These standards result in a
significantly higher threshold for overcrowding than the standards of the U.S Census
Bureau.
The relatively high cost of housing in Lake Forest and throughout the region is the primary
cause of overcrowding. Several programs in the Housing Action Plan (Section V)
designed to address housing affordability will also help alleviate overcrowding. These
include Program 3 – Facilitate Affordable Housing Production; Program 9 - Rental
Assistance; Program 10 – Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units; and
Program 13 - Mortgage Credit Certificate Program.
4.      Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community. According to the 2007-2011
ACS, the median household income in Lake Forest was $94,632, approximately 25% higher than the
Orange County median income of $75,762 (Table H-7).

5.       Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table H-8 displays estimates for overpayment between 2005
and 2009 by lower-income households. According to CHAS data developed by HUD,
76% of all lower-income renter households and 70% of all lower-income owner
households in Lake Forest were overpaying for housing. While extremely-low-income
renters appeared to suffer the greatest cost burden, with 85% of this category
overpaying for housing, nearly three-of-four lower-income households, both renters and
owners, were found to be overpaying for housing.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.

           Community Survey (ACS).
The relatively high cost of housing in Lake Forest and throughout the region is the primary
cause of overpayment. Several programs in the Housing Action Plan (Section V)
designed to address housing affordability will also help to address this issue. These include
Program 3 – Facilitate Affordable Housing Production; Program 9 - Rental Assistance;
Program 10 – Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units; and Program 13 -
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program.
Extremely-Low-Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely-low-income (ELI) households. Extremely-low-income is defined as households
with income less than 30% of area median income. As reported by HCD in 2013, the area
median income for Orange County was $87,200. For extremely-low-income households,
this results in an income of $28,900 or less for a four-person household. Households with
extremely-low-income have a variety of housing situations and needs.
                                                                  10                                                        January 2014

Existing Needs
Between 2005 and 2009, approximately 1,650 extremely-low-income households resided
in Lake Forest (Table H-8). Of these households, 85% ELI renter-households were
overpaying, while 73% of ELI owners overpaid.
Projected Needs
The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of the very-low-
income regional housing need of 647 units. As a result, the City has a projected need for
323 extremely-low-income units. The resources and programs to address this need are
the same as for low-income housing in general and are discussed throughout the
Housing Element, including Chapter V, the Housing Action Plan. Furthermore, the City
accommodates transitional and supportive housing, residential care facilities, and single
room occupancy (SRO) units, which can be suitable housing types for ELI households.
C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
1.      Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table H-9 shows that the City had a workforce of
44,460 persons, or 74% of the working-age population, as reported in the 2007-2011 ACS.
This table shows that the characteristics of the City’s population are similar to those
countywide with a somewhat higher proportion of working-age population in the labor
force. Over two-thirds (67.2%) of County residents aged 16 and over were in the labor
force between 2007 and 2011. About 5.5% of City residents worked at home, and just
over one-fourth (26.1%) were not in the labor force.

Between 2007 and 2011, approximately 47% of the City’s working residents were
employed in management and professional occupations (Table H-10). A significant
percentage of workers (28%) were employed in sales and office related occupations. A
relatively low percentage of workers (13%) were employed in service related
                                                                 11                                 January 2014

occupations such as waiters, waitresses and beauticians. Blue collar occupations such as
machine operators, assemblers, farming, transportation, handlers and laborers
constituted another 13% of the workforce.

As of 2010, the four largest employment sectors within Orange County were trade,
transportation and utilities (244,400 employees), professional and business services
(243,500 employees), leisure and hospitality (168,600 employees), and educational
services, health care, and social assistance (155,500 employees).2
2.        Projected Job Growth
According to estimates by the Center for Demographic Research and the City,
businesses within Lake Forest employed approximately 39,167 people as of July 2012.
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. Table H-11shows projected job growth by occupation for the Santa
Ana-Anaheim-Irvine Metropolitan Division (Orange County) for 2010 and 2020 along with
median hourly wages for 2012. Total employment in Orange County is expected to grow
by 13% between 2010 and 2020. The overall growth is expected to add 197,100 new jobs
and bring the employment of Orange County to almost 1,684,000 by 2020.
Generally, residents who are employed in well-paying occupations have less difficulty
obtaining adequate housing than residents in lower-paying occupations. Table H-11
illustrates the growth trend in lower-wage service jobs such as food preparation and
serving, personal care and service, and building and grounds cleaning and
maintenance.

D.          Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.
1.          Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2012, the housing stock in Lake Forest was comprised mostly of single-family
detached homes, which made up about 54% of all units, while multi-family units
comprised about 26% of the total. About 15% of units were single-family attached units,
while mobile homes comprised the remaining 5%. Table H-12 provides a breakdown of
                                                                13                                      January 2014

Between 2000 and 2012, single-family detached homes represented 57% of all units
added to the City’s housing stock. While detached units comprised the majority of new
units in both the City and County, 24% of new residential units in the City were multi-family
units. It should be noted that, during this period, most of the units added to the City’s
housing stock were acquired through annexation rather than new construction.
2.       Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table H-13 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Lake Forest compared to
Orange County as a whole. This table shows that only about 10% of the owner-occupied
housing units and 11% of rented units in Lake Forest were constructed prior to 1970. These
findings suggest that there may be a need for maintenance and rehabilitation, including
remediation of lead-based paint, for only a small portion of the City’s housing stock.
   The City’s housing stock grew by approximately 6,000 housing units in year 2000 with the annexation of
3
   Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills. Very little new residential construction occurred between 2000 and 2012.

Table H-14 identifies ACS estimates for the number of owner-occupied and renter-
occupied housing units lacking complete kitchen or plumbing facilities in the City and
the County as a whole between 2007 and 2011. This table shows that less than 1% of both
renter-occupied and owner-occupied units in Lake Forest are estimated to lack
complete plumbing. Additionally, less than 1% of owner-occupied units and 1.9% of
renter-occupied units reported by the ACS to lack complete kitchens. The lack of
complete kitchen or plumbing facilities is often an indicator of serious problems, and
housing units may need rehabilitation even though they have complete kitchens and
plumbing facilities.
Kitchen and plumbing facilities provide an indication of living standards and assess the
quality of household facilities within the housing inventory. According to the ACS,
housing units are classified as has complete kitchen or plumbing facilities when the
following facilities are present:
       Kitchen: a sink with a faucet, a stove or range, and a refrigerator. All kitchen
        facilities must be located in the house, apartment, or mobile home, but they need
        not be in the same room. A housing unit having only a microwave or portable
        heating equipment such as a hot plate or camping stove is not considered as
        having complete kitchen facilities. An icebox is not considered to be a
        refrigerator.
       Plumbing: hot and cold running water, a flush toilet, or bathtub or shower. All three
        facilities must be located inside the house, apartment, or mobile home, but not
        necessarily in the same room.

In order to further assess housing conditions in the City, knowledgeable Code
Enforcement staff identified those few areas where problems may exist. In December
2007 a targeted field survey of those areas determined that less than five units were in
need of minor repair, and only one was identified with structural problems. Given that
approximately 90 percent of the City’s dwelling units were constructed after 1970, it is
likely that the 2007 survey results remain applicable and represent current housing
conditions in Lake Forest.
The goal of the City’s Code Enforcement program is to address housing concerns before
they become serious problems. The Code Enforcement program has helped to reduce
structural deterioration by identifying problems and informing residents of programs to
assist with improvements. In addition, the City addresses issues related to lead-based
paint through its rehabilitation program for single-family homes and mobile home units
(see Program 11).
3.      Vacancy
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow
sufficient choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair.
Specifically, vacancy rates of 1.5 to 2.0 percent for ownership housing and 5.0 to 6.0
percent for rental housing are considered optimal to balance demand and supply for
housing. Housing vacancy rates as reported by the 2009-2011 ACS are shown in Table H-
15. The table shows that vacancy rates for rental and ownership units in the City were
relatively high when compared to optimal vacancy rates by tenure (6.5% rental and 2.4%
for-sale). The County had lower vacancy rates for rental and ownership units. However,
overall vacancy rate in the County was higher than in Lake Forest, due to seasonally
occupied housing and other vacant units (such as foreclosed or abandoned homes).

4.      Housing Cost
Housing Affordability Criteria
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home
in the City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income
levels. Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size
and type of housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience
overcrowding and overpayment.
Housing affordability is an important indicator of quality of life in Lake Forest. If residents
pay too much for housing they will not have sufficient income for other necessities such
as health care. Households that spend a substantial portion of their income on housing
may also be at risk of becoming homeless in the event of unexpected circumstances
such as illness or loss of employment. State law requires that the City facilitate provision
of housing opportunities that are affordable to all economic segments of the community.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to
determine the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper
range of their respective income category. Households in the lower end of each
category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end.
Table H-16 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Lake Forest (and Orange County)4 by income category and households size.
The maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households ranges from
$409 for a one-person household to $607 for a five-person household, while the maximum
affordable rent for very-low-income households ranges from $747 to $1,127. Low-income
households can afford between $1,252 and $1,907. Median- and moderate-income
households can afford much larger monthly rental payments. Maximum purchase prices
are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest rates and qualifying
procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association fees,
property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home purchase prices by
income category shown in Table H-16 have been estimated based on typical conditions.
   Affordable rent and purchase prices are based on county median income.

 a.            For-Sale Housing
 Existing housing resale price statistics for Lake Forest and neighboring cities and the
 County in January 2012 and January 2013 are shown in Table H-17. The table shows that
 the median price for homes was $422,500 in January 2013, up substantially from January
 2012 when the median sale price was only $248,000. The City’s median home sale price
 in early 2013 was slightly lower than the countywide median sale price ($460,000) and
 higher than nearby Rancho Santa Margarita ($377,000).

Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table H-17, lower-income
households could not afford a median-priced home in Lake Forest. These data illustrate
the fact that public subsidies are generally required to reduce sales prices to a level that
is affordable to lower- and moderate-income buyers. At a median price of $422,500,
there is a “gap” of over $107,144 between the market price and the maximum price a
four-person low-income household can afford to pay for a home. The gap is even
greater for very-low-income and extremely-low-income households.                                                            Most moderate-
income households could afford to purchase a median price home in the City.
b.      Rental Housing
Table H-18 shows current (March 2013) market data for rental apartments in Lake Forest
based on a survey of properties listed for rent on Craigslist. . . The table shows that the
median rent for all surveyed units in Lake Forest is $1,635 per month, with a range of
$1,190 for the lowest advertised one-bedroom units to a high of $3,800 for a six-bedroom
unit.

When market rents are compared to the amounts low-income households can afford to
pay (Table H-16), it is clear that extremely-low-income households could not find market-
rate rental housing in Lake Forest without incurring cost burden, overcrowding, or both.
Very-low-income households would have a very difficult time finding housing without
overpaying. Once adjusted by household size to avoid overcrowding, the gap between
                                                                         19                                                         January 2014

market rent and affordable rent at the very-low-income level is approximately $625 per
month for a two-person and $1,275 per month for a five-person household. However, at
the low-income and moderate-income levels, households are much more likely to find
affordable rentals. A median 2-bedroom unit currently rents for about $1,640 while the
affordable payment for a 4-person low-income household is $1,763.
E.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Lake Forest
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. Many households within these special needs groups
also fall within the extremely-low-income category. This section contains a discussion of
the housing needs facing each of these groups.
1.      Persons with Disabilities (Including Developmental Disabilities)
Between 2009 and 2011, the ACS estimated 4,581 persons with disabilities among the
City’s population age five years and older (Table H-19). Among people between the 18
and 64 years of age (the working age population), 2,074 persons with disabilities were
reported, of which ambulatory difficulty was the most common (47%) followed by
cognitive difficulty (39%). . Of those aged 65 and over, the ACS estimated 2,045 persons
with disabilities. Ambulatory and independent living difficulties were the most common
disabilities within this age group (66% and 55%, respectively). Housing opportunities for
the handicapped can be maximized through housing assistance programs and
providing universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered
countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.

                      Note: An individual can report more than one disability.
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing
needs of persons with developmental disabilities.                                         As defined by federal law,
“developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
       Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
        physical impairments;
       Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
       Is likely to continue indefinitely;
       Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
        major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning;
        d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic
        self- sufficiency; and
       Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
        interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
        assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned
        and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. The State Department of
Developmental Services (DDS) maintains a database of clients served by the
Developmental and Regional Centers by ZIP Code. Developmentally disabled clients

from ZIP Code 92610, 92630, and 92679 are summarized in Table H-20. As of November
2012, at least 602 Lake Forest residents with developmental disabilities were being
assisted at Developmental and Regional Centers.5 Most of these individuals were
residing in a private home with their parent or guardian and specifically at least 151 of
these persons with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.

The City’s Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance, adopted in 2002, helps to address
the needs of disabled persons through simplifying the process for obtaining approvals
and permits for modifications to City regulations and building standards.
In addition, a variety of programs encourage affordable housing opportunities and
respond to the needs of the disabled. These include Program 3 – Facilitate Affordable
Housing Production; Program 7 – Transitional and Supportive Housing; Program 8 –
Coordination with Social Service Agencies; Program 9 – Rental Assistance; Program 10 –
Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units; and Program 14 – Fair Housing
Services.
2.      Elderly
The ACS documented 3,859 households in Lake Forest where the householder was 65 or
older between 2007 and 2011 (Table H-21). A significant majority of these householders
owned their homes (83%). The ACS also reported that approximately 348 (5%) of Lake
Forest’s 7,077 seniors were below the poverty level. Many elderly persons are dependent
on fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly homeowners may be physically unable
to maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can
be addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living
arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs.
In particular, the following programs described in the Housing Action Plan (Section V)
help to address the housing needs of the elderly: Program 3 – Facilitate Affordable

3.         Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Among both owners and renters, a little more than half
of all households have only one or two members. About 14% of renter-households had
five or more members, while about 10% of owners were large households (Table H-22).
This distribution indicates that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is
expected to be significantly less than for smaller units. Also, in comparison to the County
as a whole, Lake Forest has significantly fewer large renter-households (10% city vs. 16%).

Of the 26,888 households in the City between 2007 and 2011, approximately 9% or 2,354
were headed by a female (Table H-23). The majority (61%) of these households owned
their homes. While female-headed households represent a small portion of households,
the ACS reported that they made up a significant portion (38%) of households that were
below the poverty level between 2007 and 2011.

5.      Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal
agricultural work. Historically, Orange County’s economy was linked to agriculture. While
there are still active farming areas on the Irvine Ranch and in some other cities, shifts in
the local economy to production and service-oriented sectors have significantly
curtailed agricultural production within the County. Today, Orange County is a mostly
developed urban/suburban region with a strong local economy. Although the County is
increasingly capturing major employers in Southern California, this growth is not tied to an
agricultural base.
The 2006-2008 ACS reported about 3,664 persons employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing
and hunting, and mining occupations in Orange County. Of these, approximately 3%
lived in Lake Forest (Table H-24).

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                          Housing Needs Assessment
The City of Lake Forest has a single agricultural operation, the 90-acre Nakase nursery
located south of SR 241 between Lake Forest Drive and Bake Parkway. The nearest major
agricultural area to the City of Lake Forest is on the Irvine Ranch, a few miles to the
northwest. Given limited active agriculture operations in and around the City, the
number of residents employed in agriculture as opposed to those employed in forestry,
fishing and hunting, or mining is likely to be much smaller than 115.             In addition, it is
possible (although statistics are not available) that a number of active farm workers are
not full-time residents of Orange County, and migrate into the area depending on
seasonal crop harvest. Such farm workers may find temporary housing by living with
relatives, or short-term rental of a single unit for several families, resulting in overcrowded
conditions.
Because there is only one agricultural operation within Lake Forest, there is not a
significant need for permanent farm worker housing. Although there is not a need for
farm worker housing in Lake Forest, the City allows agricultural uses within the A-1 and OS
zones and therefore farm worker housing must be allowed as an accessory use pursuant
the California Employee Housing Act. The City will revise the Zoning Code to comply with
the California Employee Housing Act (see Program 4).
6.      Homeless Persons
Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include: the general lack of housing
affordable to low and moderate income persons; increases in the number of persons
whose incomes fall below the poverty level; reductions in public subsidy to the poor; and
the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
Definitions of Homelessness
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42, U.S.C. 1130, et seq. 1994) defines a
"homeless" person as an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime
residence, or an individual whose primary nighttime residence is:
      a.    A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
            temporary living accommodations;
      b.    An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
            be institutionalized;
      c.    A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, regular
            sleeping accommodations for human beings.
The McKinney-Vento Act (§725(2); 42 U.S.C. 11435(2)) defines a person “at risk” of
becoming homeless as an individual who faces imminent eviction (within a week) from a
private dwelling or institution and who has no subsequent residence or resources to
obtain housing. People are also at risk of homelessness when they experience a sudden
drop in income, a rise in housing costs, and/or they do not have the skills necessary to
manage their limited resources. According to the National Coalition for the Homelessness
(NCH), most individuals at risk of homelessness are on a fixed income or are marginally
employed and have few ties to family and friends.

Profiles of the Homeless Population in Orange County and Lake Forest
The County of Orange Housing and Community Services Department and the OC
Partnership undertake an annual estimate of the County’s homeless population as part
of its application for homeless assistance grant funds to HUD. The most recent point-in-
time survey conducted in January 2011, estimated that there were 18,325 annual
incidents of homelessness in Orange County 6 The 2011 survey did not provide an
                                                       8F .
estimate of the homeless population in Lake Forest. While County staff involved with
homeless issues could not provide an estimate of the City’s current homeless population,
the City of Lake Forest Police Services Department indicates that the homeless
population within Lake Forest on any given night is approximately 25 individuals7.
The needs of the homeless vary by subpopulation. Mentally ill persons require housing
supported by mental health care and counseling. Alcohol and drug abusers require
treatment facilities and medical and social support services. Victims of domestic
violence need shelter and social services to assist in the transition to independent living.
Runaway and recently emancipated youths require shelter, combined with counseling
and social services to reintegrate them with their families or enable them to live
independently.
While the City’s homeless population is observed to be minimal, homelessness is a
regional issue and should be addressed from a regional perspective. Specifically, the
lack of affordable housing throughout Orange County contributes to the rising number of
homeless persons in the County.
Inventory of Homeless Shelters and Transitional Housing Facilities
The facility and service needs of homeless families and individuals generally include
emergency shelter, transitional housing, supportive services such as job training and
counseling, and mental and general health services.
             Emergency Shelters – Emergency shelters are generally geared toward
              providing immediate housing to persons without shelter. Stays in emergency
              shelters are typically limited to a short period of time (up to six months). The
              City amended the Zoning Code in 2013 to allow emergency shelters with
              ministerial permit in the Industrial zone, consistent with SB2.
             Transitional and Supportive Housing – Transitional and supportive housing are
              important components for assisting homeless individuals and families to
              become self-sufficient. The City amended the Zoning Code in 2013 to treat
              Transitional and Supportive Housing as residential uses that are subject to the
              same standards and requirements as other residential uses of the same type in
              the same zone, consistent with SB2.
             The City has provided CDBG funding to two non-profit organizations that
             between them have purchased 11 condominiums for transitional and
             affordable housing. These condominiums continue to offer transitional and

            affordable housing to extremely-low-income residents and will continue to do
            so until 2022–2030. Supportive services that are provided to residents include
            weekly case management counseling, weekly budget/ financial counseling,
            child care assistance to attend counseling, education supplies assistance,
            employment supplies/tools assistance, health care payment assistance,
            permanent housing placement assistance, legal assistance (as available), life-
            skills training, weekly children’s program that addresses self-esteem/social
            skills/coping skills/values & beliefs/peer pressure/ anger management/self-care
            and identifying social networks.
While it is difficult for the City to assess the exact number of its homeless population, as
evidenced by the lack of city-by-city data gathered from the 2011 Point-In-Time Survey,
the City has annually provided assistance through CDBG funds to identified extremely-
low-income persons, female head of households, the disabled, and elderly by
contracting for social services by non-profit organizations. In recent years these services
have included the following: emergency housing/shelter(South County Outreach and
Families Forward), food distribution (South County Outreach and Families Forward),
primary health care services to the indigent or non-insured (Camino Health Services and
Laguna Beach Community Clinic), senior case-management services and home-
delivered meals (South County Senior Services), support services for the disabled (Dayle
McIntosh Center) and before-and-after school youth programs (Saddleback Valley
Unified School District) for extremely low and low income families. While individual
services may vary in any given year based on priorities and funding availability, the City
anticipates that these general categories of supportive services will continue in
partnership with various non-profits.
F.       Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
This section identifies all residential projects in the City that are under an affordability
restriction, along with those housing projects that are at risk of losing their low-income
affordability restrictions within the ten-year period 2013 – 2023. This information is used in
establishing quantified objectives for units that can be conserved during this planning
period. The inventory of assisted units includes all units that have been assisted under any
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state, local and/or other
program.

  Notes:
  CATEGORY 1
     Each of the first 5 apartment complexes have received bond funding from the County that include affordability covenants for 30 years with an
     approximate maturity date of 2028. There are a total of 209 affordable units among the 5 complexes. All 5 apartment complexes have similar regulatory
     agreements. Therefore, although bond maturity dates are 2028, it is possible that property owners could pre-pay bond funding beginning in 2013. .
     Although these are covenanted units, the covenants are in favor of the County. Consequently, the County monitors and regulates these units.
  CATEGORY 2
     In 2001, the City’s former Redevelopment Agency entered into agreement with Trammel Crow to reserve 6 affordable units as part of the 131 apartment
     complex development. The complex known as Bellecour Way, located on Osterman, is required to make the 6 units available for affordable occupancy
     for a term of 15 years from the date of the final Certificate of Occupancy for these units. The units remain affordable until approximately 2018. Of the 6
     affordable units, 4 are for low income and 2 are for moderate income. Unlike the 209units in Category 1, the covenant for these 6 Bellecour Way units
     are in favor of the Agency.
  CATEGORY 3
     There are 10 transitional housing units and 1 affordable unit that has received CDBG funding from the City, and are required to be affordable to very low
     or low income households for 25 years from the date the covenants were first agreed upon. Transitional housing units are generally occupied for 6 – 18
     months by income qualified households while the households work toward independent living. Under the covenant for the affordable unit, the
     occupant(s) in that unit may remain in the unit as long as he or she continues to qualify as an affordable household. The 1 affordable unit may continue
     to be rented by the same tenant(s) as long as the tenant(s) continue to qualify as a very low or low income household. These covenants are in favor of
     the City and with the assistance of an independent accounting firm, are monitored annually to ensure the households continue to qualify as affordable.
  CATEGORY 4
     The County purchased land at 21011 Osterman Rd. with CDBG funds in 1982. The Crestwood Apartments developer is currently leasing the land from
     the County. The lease, along with affordability covenants, expires August 2017.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  Housing Needs Assessment
2.        Units at Risk
State Housing Element law requires the analysis of government-subsidized housing that
may change from lower-income housing to market-rate housing during the next ten
years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from October 15, 2013 through
October 15, 2023. This section evaluates affordable housing in Lake Forest that may be
at risk of converting to market rates and the estimated costs to preserve or replace the
at-risk units.
Within the 2013-2023 period, 255 affordable housing units are at risk of converting to
market rate. Of these units, 209 are located in 5 “Category 1” developments and are
only considered “at risk” because owners have the option to pre-pay bond funding
before 2023. Affordability covenants for 38 units in the Crestwood Apartments expire in
2017, 6 units at Bellecour Way could convert to market rate in 2018 and 2 transitional
housing units become “at risk” in 2022 and 2023.
Preservation Options
Depending on the circumstances of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to
preserve or replace the units. The following discussion highlights ways that the City’s at-
risk units could be preserved as affordable housing. All of the presented alternatives are
costly and beyond the ability of the City of Lake Forest to manage without large
amounts of subsidy from federal and/or State resources.
Purchase Similar Units
One preservation option is for a nonprofit organization to purchase similar units. By
purchasing similar units, a non-profit organization can secure lower-income restrictions
and potentially enable the project to become eligible for a greater range of
governmental assistance. The cost of purchasing similar units depends on a number of
factors, including the market conditions at the time, occupancy rate, and physical
conditions of the units to be acquired.
Current market value for the at-risk units is estimated on the basis of the units’ potential
annual income, and operating and maintenance expenses. The estimated market
value of Lake Forest’s current stock of at-risk affordable housing is $43.2 million.8 This
estimate is provided for the purpose of comparison and understanding the magnitude of
costs involved and does not represent the precise market value of the at-risk units or units
that could be purchased to offset converted units. The actual market value at time of
sale would depend on market and property conditions, lease-out/turnover rates, among
other factors.
    For the purposes of this analysis, a two-bedroom unit and three-person household is assumed to represent
8
    the average unit and household size among the 255 at-risk units. According to HUD, the FY 2013 FMR for a
    two-bedroom unit in Orange County is $1,527 per month. Estimated annual gross income was calculated
    with a 5% vacancy assumption. Net annual revenue was assumed by subtracting annual operating and
    maintenance costs ($4.50 per square-foot and average 850 square-foot units). Finally, a multiplication
    factor of 12.5 (for a building in good condition) was applied to the net annual income to approximate
    market value of the at-risk units.

Rental Assistance
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing.
Similar to Housing Choice Vouchers, the City, through a variety of potential funding
sources, could provide rent subsidies to very low income households. The level of the
subsidy required to preserve the at-risk units is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent
(FMR) for a unit minus the housing cost affordable by a very low income household.9
Approximately $150,450 in rent subsidies would be required monthly (or $1.8 million
annually). Assuming a 20-year affordability, the total subsidy is about $36.1 million.
Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive
package to the owners to maintain the projects as affordable housing. Incentives could
include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, and/or
supplementing the subsidy amount received to market levels.
To purchase the affordability covenant on these projects, an incentive package should
include interest subsidies at or below what the property owners can obtain in the open
market. To enhance the attractiveness of the incentive package, the interest subsidies
may need to be combined with rent subsidies that supplement the HUD fair market rent
levels.
Replacement Option
The construction of new lower income housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk
units should they be converted to market-rate. The cost of developing new housing
depends on a variety of factors such as density, size of units, location and related land
costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average development cost of $300,000 per
unit10 for multi-family rental housing, replacement of the 255 at-risk units would require
approximately $76.5 million, excluding land costs, which vary depending upon location.
Cost Comparison
The cost to build new housing to replace the 255 at-risk units is high, with an estimated
total cost of more than $76.5 million. This cost estimate is substantially higher than the
cost associated with transfer of ownership ($43.2 million) and providing rent subsidies
similar to Housing Choice Vouchers for 20 years ($36.1 million).
Resources for Preservation of At-Risk Units
Various potential funding sources are available for the acquisition, replacement, or rent
subsidies. Financial resources are further discussed in Section III (Resources and

Opportunities). However, due to the high costs of developing and preserving at-risk
housing relative to the amount of available local funds, multi-layering of local and non-
local sources may be required. Furthermore, some funding programs require a local
match. Without redevelopment funds, the City would have difficulty in meeting the
match requirement.
The City will continue to monitor the 255 at-risk units and should a notice of intent to
convert to market rate be filed, work with potential purchasers to preserve the units, and
ensure that tenants were properly notified of their rights under California law.

III.     RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A variety of resources are available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation
of housing in the City of Lake Forest. This section provides an overview of the land
resources and adequate sites to address the City’s regional housing need allocation,
and describes the financial and administrative resources available to support the
provision of affordable housing. Additionally, the section discusses opportunities for
energy conservation which can lower utility costs and increase the affordability of
housing.
A.       Land Resources
1.       Future Housing Needs (2014-2021)
In accordance with Government Code §65584, projected housing needs for each city
and county in the Southern California region are prepared by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) under a process known as the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). SCAG’s Regional Council adopted the final Regional Housing
Need Allocation in October 2012. The RHNA covers the period of January 1, 2014 to
October 31, 2021.
The RHNA process began with an update of the population, employment and household
forecasts for both the region as a whole and for each county. These forecasts were
largely derived from Department of Finance (DOF) population and employment
forecasts and modified by regional demographic and modeling efforts by SCAG. SCAG
then disaggregated the regional and county forecasts to each jurisdiction and
estimated the number of dwelling units needed to achieve a regional target vacancy
rates and to account for projected housing demolitions. The total housing needed in
each jurisdiction was then distributed by income category (very low, low, moderate and
upper income).
To avoid the over concentration of new lower-income households in jurisdictions with
higher proportions of existing lower-income households (as required by State law), SCAG
adjusted the percentage of households in each income category for each jurisdiction.
In October 2012, SCAG adopted the final RHNA growth needs for each of Orange
County’s cities plus the unincorporated area. The total housing growth need for the City
of Lake Forest during the 2014-2021 RHNA planning period is 2,727 units. This total is
distributed by income category as shown in Table H-26. While not explicitly addressed in
the RHNA, state law11 now requires the Housing Element to estimate the future needs of
extremely-low-income households. As provided by state law, the extremely-low-income
need is estimated to be 50% of the very-low category, or 323 units during this planning
period.

2.       Future Housing Development Potential
State law mandates that a jurisdiction provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety
of housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community.                                                  Section
65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an “inventory
of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having
potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public
facilities and services to these sites.” Compliance with this requirement is measured by
the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land with adequate density and
appropriate development standards to accommodate the RHNA.
The City of Lake Forest has adequate land capacity to meet the needs of all income
groups through the 2014-2021 RHNA period. The City intends to accommodate the
RHNA within four of the City’s five “New Neighborhoods” (Figure H-2).12 Lake Forest’s
New Neighborhoods are part of the City’s Opportunities Study Area (OSA) – a re-zoning
effort of over 600 acres of business/industrial use land. The zone changes and
development agreements that were approved by the City between 2008 and 2010
allow for approximately 4,000 new homes. An Affordable Housing Implementation Plan
(AHIP) has been adopted for each of the New Neighborhoods. The AHIPs are consistent
with the City’s goal to incorporate a minimum of 15% affordable units within new
developments (see Policy 1.8).                       The New Neighborhoods and related residential
development capacity included in the City’s 2014-2021 land inventory are discussed on
the following pages.

Baker Ranch
The Baker Ranch community is a 387-acre master planned community located in the
northwestern portion of the City of Lake Forest. Baker Ranch was approved in the
summer of 2010 for up to 2,379 homes, 25,000 square feet of commercial use, parks,
open space, and related infrastructure. Baker Ranch is envisioned to include a wide
range of housing types, situated among its diverse community-wide open space and
recreational system. A broad mix of single-family homes, bungalows, green-courts,
condominiums, flats, townhomes, cluster detached, and apartment homes will serve a
wide range of family types, life-stage, and affordability levels.
        Up to 1,638 for-sale homes, on approximately 308 acres, ranging from low density
         (2-7 units per net acre) to medium density (up to 25 units per net acre). A broad
         variety of home styles including single family detached, motor courts, cluster
         homes, green courts, flats, townhomes and condominiums.
        A maximum of 48.4 gross acres designated for mixed use development. The
         mixed-use development contemplates commercial areas developed together
         with multi-family residential units ranging from low-medium to high densities. A
         maximum of 741 residential units is allowed.
Existing uses on the Baker Ranch site are limited and include RV storage, nursery stock,
and landscape maintenance services. These existing uses and related improvements
may remain until phasing of development requires their removal or relocation.
The City is currently processing Site Development Permit applications for 1,197 homes in
the Baker Ranch neighborhood (Table H-27). Of these units, 1,010 would be offered at
market rate prices. A 187-unit deed-restricted affordable housing development is
proposed on a 6.3-acre site in Planning Area 1A. This project includes 20 very-low-
income units, 165 low-income, and 2 moderate-income manager units.

Serrano Summit
The Serrano Summit development agreement allows for up to 608 homes, a 9-acre civic
center site, along with various neighborhood parks and roads, on the approximately 82-
acre site. Currently, the majority of the Serrano Summit property consists of vacant land
that was formerly used for agricultural purposes and water district operations. The land
within Serrano Summit is now owned by the Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD
As summarized in Table H-30, Medium Density Residential land use comprises
approximately 44.3 acres allowing for a variety of residential detached and attached
housing types at densities up to 25 units per acre. A density factor of 13.7 was used to
determine the realistic capacity by Planning Area; however, this factor is a function of
acreage by planning area and the maximum number of units approved for Serrano
Summit. The development agreement gives the developer the flexibility to cluster units
within and among planning areas so long as the net density of a planning area does not
exceed 25 units per acre.

The Pinnacle at Serrano Highlands
The Pinnacle at Serrano Highlands will include up to 85 single-family homes plus parks,
open space, and infrastructure on approximately 24.6 acres. Residential lots are
designated Low-Medium Density Residential (max. 15 du/ac) and will range in size from
4,019 sq. ft. to 7,675 sq. ft. and will accommodate two- and three-story homes with floor
plans ranging from 3,198 sq. ft. to 3,797 sq. ft. A list of sites by Assessor Parcel Number
(APN) is included in Appendix C.
3.       Affordability, Suitability, and Availability Analysis
This subsection describes the assumptions applied to each site in the Residential Land
Inventory (Figure H-2) to determine affordability level and establish the suitability and
availability for development within the 2014-2021 RHNA period.

Lower-Income
The City has identified 107.4 acres within the Baker Ranch, Serrano Summit, and Portola
Center communities that can accommodate at least 1,579 lower income units during
the planning period (Table H-31). Of the 1,579 units, 185 are part of a Site Development
Permit application for an affordable housing development that is currently under review
by City staff. If approved, these units will be constructed and occupied after January 1,
2014.
At least 147 mixed-use units can be accommodated on land designated for up 43
du/ac. These sites are suitable for lower income housing because the maximum
allowable density is greater than 30 du/ac; the default lower-income density for Lake
Forest per Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B).
Another 1,229 units can be accommodated on sites that allow up to 25 du/ac. Although
the “default density” for Lake Forest is 30 du/ac, past development trend in the region
has demonstrated that affordable housing is feasible at a density less than 25 du/ac. As
noted in Table C-4 (Appendix C), numerous affordable projects have been developed in
Orange County and north San Diego County at a density less than 25 du/ac, including
several constructed since the housing market began its steep decline in 2008.
Finally, the Portola Center Area Plan anticipates 18 second dwelling units. Second
dwelling units are considered an important source of “below market” housing pursuant
to Government Code Section 65852.150. Moderate-income households can afford a
wide range of market-rate rental housing product in Lake Forest (refer to Table H-16 and
Table H-18); therefore, second dwelling units are considered to be a suitable ”below
market” housing option for lower-income households.

4.      Adequacy of Land Inventory to Accommodate RHNA
When the City’s land inventory, including units with occupancy anticipated after January
1, 2014 and vacant sites, is compared to the RHNA, there is a surplus of 482 lower-income
sites,190 moderate-income sites, and 621 above-moderate sites for this planning period
(Table H-34). As discussed in the analysis of non-governmental constraints (Section IV),
there are no infrastructure deficiencies that would preclude development of these sites.
Section V (Housing Action Plan) contains Program 3 to encourage and facilitate the
development of affordable housing units during the current planning period.

B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
1.      State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
Federal funding for housing programs is available through the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). The City’s use of federal funds is described in the 2010-
2015 Consolidated Plan. As an Entitlement City, Lake Forest participates in the
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. CDBG funds are used by the
City to fund its Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (see Program 11). The CDBG
allocation for Fiscal Year 2012/2013 is $62,191 (down from $478,551 in 2008) and is expected
to decrease in future years. The City does not currently participate in other HUD programs
such as HOME, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) or Housing Opportunities for Persons with
AIDS (HOPWA).
Housing Choice Voucher Program Rental Assistance (Formerly “Section 8”)
The City of Lake Forest works cooperatively with the Orange County Housing Authority,
which administers the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The program assists very-low-
income, elderly and disabled households by paying the difference between 30% of an
eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting a unit. According to the
Orange County Housing Authority, a total of 194 tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers
were used in the City as of March 2013, and there were 809 Lake Forest resident applicants
on the waiting list. The City facilitates use of the voucher program within its jurisdiction by
encouraging apartment owners to list available rental units with the County Housing
Authority for potential occupancy by tenants receiving vouchers.
                                                                  43                                              January 2014

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986
to provide an alternate method of funding low-and moderate-income housing. Each
state receives a tax credit, based upon population, toward funding housing that meets
program guidelines. The tax credits are then used to leverage private capital into new
construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on
projects funded under the Tax Credit programs include minimum requirements that a
certain percentage of units remain rent-restricted, based upon median income, for a
term of 15 years.
Southern California Housing Finance Agency (SCHFA) Mortgage Financing for First-Time
Homebuyers
The SCHFA raises funds for mortgage financing through the sale of tax-exempt revenue
bonds. The City cooperates with lenders and the County in advertising the availability of
the SCHFA program.
2.      Local Resources
Former Redevelopment Agency Assets
The Lake Forest Redevelopment Agency was terminated by the State of California
effective February 1, 2012. The City’s Housing Authority is responsible for administering
remaining Lake Forest Redevelopment Agency housing assets. In 2012, the California
Department of Finance (DOF) completed its “meet and confer” process with the City.
Although the DOF did not approve retention of any low income housing set-aside
balance, the City retained all of the assets that the former Redevelopment Agency had
transferred to the Housing Authority. These assets include:
       Madrid Drive: Condominiums used as transitional housing and operated by a
        nonprofit organization.
       Saguro Street: 4-unit apartment complex currently occupied by lower income
        households.
       Vacant lot 1: A 2.67-acre lot (APN 614-024-01) that was formerly railroad right-of-
        way and is not currently zoned.
       Vacant lot 2: A 0.16-acre lot (APN 614-021-31) in the A1 zone.
The City is currently exploring options for retention and/or disposition of these assets.
Affordable Housing In-Lieu Fees
Development agreements for three of the five New Neighborhoods include provisions for
the developer to pay an affordable housing fee at the time of building permit issuance
in-lieu of constructing affordable as part of their projects. The fee, which is currently
$13,177 per unit, increases during the beginning of each year, following the publication
of the Consumer Price Index for January (usually sometime in February). The City’s
Housing Authority has collected approximately $1.15 million dollars to date and
anticipates collecting another $1.15 million dollars upon issuance of remaining two
                                                44                                 January 2014

building permits in Whisler Ridge and 85 building permits in The Pinnacle at Serrano
Highlands. The total estimated $2.3 million dollars will be available during the planning
period to provide gap financing for affordable housing (e.g., new construction,
acquisition/rehabilitation, etc.)
C.       Energy Conservation Opportunities
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce
California's energy consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations and are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods. California's building
efficiency standards (along with those for energy efficient appliances) have saved
nearly $80 billion in electricity and natural gas costs since 1978. 13
                                                                    5F
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an “energy
budget” for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate
requirements are adopted for “low-rise” residential construction (i.e., no more than 3
stories) and non-residential buildings, which includes hotels, motels, and multi-family
residential buildings with four or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy
saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and
cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the
use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar energy or wind power. The home
building industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan check and building
inspection processes.
Examples of techniques for reducing residential energy use include the following:
             Glazing – Glazing on south facing exterior walls allows for winter sunrays to
              warm the structure. Reducing glazing and regulating sunlight penetration on
              the west side of the unit prevents afternoon sunrays from overheating the unit.
             Landscaping – Strategically placed vegetation reduces the amount of direct
              sunlight on the windows. The incorporation of deciduous trees in the
              landscaping plans along the southern exposure of units reduces summer
              sunrays, while allowing penetration of winter sunrays to warm the units.
             Building Design – The implementation of roof overhangs above southerly
              facing windows shield the structure from solar rays during the summer months.
             Cooling/Heating Systems – The use of attic ventilation systems reduces attic
              temperatures during the summer months. Solar heating systems for swimming
              pool facilities saves on energy costs. Natural gas is conserved with the use of
              flow restrictors on all hot water faucets and showerheads.

           Weatherizing Techniques – Weatherization techniques such as insulation,
            caulking, and weather stripping can reduce energy use for air-conditioning up
            to 55% and for heating as much as 40%. Weatherization measures seal a
            dwelling unit to guard against heat gain in the summer and prevent heat loss
            in the winter.
           Efficient Use of Appliances – Appliances can be used in ways that increase
            their energy efficiency. Unnecessary appliances can be eliminated. Proper
            maintenance and use of stove, oven, clothes dryer, washer, dishwasher, and
            refrigerator can also reduce energy consumption. New appliance purchases
            can be made on the basis of efficiency ratings.
In addition to the requirements of Title 24, the City encourages energy conservation
through its land use planning policies. Lake Forest contains a mix of housing,
employment, commercial, recreation, educational and other community facilities. Lake
Forest is located within a jobs-rich portion of south Orange County giving the residents of
the City access to a variety of jobs within a short driving distance. Other opportunities for
energy efficiency include the following:
           Voluntary Green Building program for residential remodels
           Implementation of Citywide design guidelines
           Energy efficient improvements, including window replacement, are eligible for
            rehabilitation loan program
           The City’s existing network of on- and off-road bicycle trails link residential
            areas to employment centers within Lake Forest and surrounding cities.

IV. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
A.      Governmental Constraints
1.      Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the city’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Lake Forest General Plan Land Use Element provides for five residential land
use designations, as shown in Table H-35.
                Table H-35: Residential Land Use Categories – Lake Forest General Plan
                                                             Maximum

          *Density expressed in dwelling units per net acre.
An additional designation, Mixed-Use (MU), provides opportunities for residential
development in conjunction with commercial and/or office development. The mixed use
designation can occur in areas where multiple activities and pedestrian orientation are
considered desirable objectives. A maximum density of 43 dwelling units per net acre is
allowed when a project proposal includes only residential uses; 35 dwelling units per net
acre is expected for mixed-use developments. The City of Lake Forest General Plan is not
considered to be a constraint to the goals and policies of the Housing Element as the
City’s zoning is consistent with the General Plan and adequate sites with appropriate
densities have been identified to permit the construction of the City’s fair share of new
housing units for the 2014-2021 RHNA period (see Section III, Resources and
Opportunities).
                                                                    47                                            January 2014

b.      Planned Communities
Much of the land use in Lake Forest is based on pre-incorporation planning for nine large-
scale Planned Communities (PCs). These PCs included Lake Forest, El Toro, Baker Ranch,
Pacific Commercentre, Rancho de los Alisos, Rancho Serrano, Serrano Highlands, Foothill
Ranch, and Portola Hills. Several of these PCs are also the subject of development
agreements that identify the levels of development allowed. Future development in
these areas must follow the PC Development Plans and related development
agreements.
Many of the development standards found in the PCs mirror the R1 and RS zoning found
in the City’s Zoning Code. Two of the largest PCs, Lake Forest PC and Rancho De Los
Alisos PC, allow for smaller and more flexible side yard setbacks and allow for cluster
development. Several PCs include a “High Density Residential” or “Heavy Density
Residential” zone, which allow a variety of multi-family residential uses. The Baker Ranch,
Foothill Ranch, and Portola Hills Planned Communities have mixed-use zones.
2.      Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
through the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan
and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. The Municipal Code also helps to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. The Municipal Code sets forth residential development standards
for each zoning district.
Only one attached housing development was built during previous planning periods –
Bellecour Way (formerly called Alexan Bellecour) in 2002-2003. This project was built in the
R2 district at 22 units per acre. The project’s inclusion of low- and moderate-income units
at 22 units per acre, confirms that the City’s zoning standards do not pose an
unreasonable constraint on multi-family housing development. Appendix C provides
additional analysis demonstrating the feasibility of affordable housing in Orange County
at densities of 20 to 25 units per acre.
a.      Zoning Districts
The five zoning districts that allow residential units as a permitted use are as follows:
        R1      Single-Family Residence District
        RS      Residential Single-Family District
        R2      Multi-family Dwellings District
        R4      Suburban Multi-family Residential District
        RP      Residential Professional District
A summary of the residential development standards for these zoning districts is provided
in Table H-36. These development standards continue to be viewed as reasonably
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare and maintain the quality of
life, and are not considered to be constraints on the development of housing.

Densities range from six units per net acre in the R1 District to a maximum of 43 units per
net acre in the R2 District, excluding potential density bonus. However, these zoning
districts are built-out and given the age and condition of these properties, there is little
potential for redevelopment during the planning period.
Two additional zoning districts, the Planned Community (PC) District and the Planned
Development (PD) District, allow residential development through discretionary actions.
All of the parcels in the City’s residential land inventory are zoned PC (see Appendix C).
Planned Community (PC) District
The purpose of the Planned Community District is to provide the authority, regulations,
and procedures whereby large land areas can be planned and developed as individual
integrated communities. The City of Lake Forest contains nine PCs, all of which were
originally approved prior to the City’s incorporation. Each planned community
establishes its own character with its own unique set of land use regulations, including
zoning standards for residential areas. The Planned Communities within Lake Forest
contain a variety of residential zoning districts and densities, ranging from large single-
family detached homes to condos, apartments, and mixed-use buildings, thereby
facilitating a variety of housing types for a variety of income levels.
Planned Development (PD) District
The purpose of the Planned Development District is to produce planned development
projects that take advantage of modern site planning techniques providing for better
use of common areas and open space. The PD District is used in conjunction with a base
district (e.g., R1, RS, etc.) to indicate the additional permitted uses and development
standards associated with the PD. The PD results in flexibility by allowing development
standards, including lot coverage, setbacks and building sizes, to be determined through
approval of a Use Permit. The PD combining district therefore facilitates flexibility in
residential zoning standards, which encourages a variety of housing types for a variety of
income levels. Residential projects built with the PD District have included single-family
and multi-family homes.

Commercial Districts
While major residential projects are excluded, some types of special needs housing, such
as congregate care facilities, are allowed in the General Business District (C2),
Commercial Neighborhood District (CN), Community Commercial District (CC), Urban
Activity District (UA), and Agriculture District (A1) by right or through use permits or site
development permits.
b.      Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential uses vary by residential type. Single-family
attached and detached dwellings require two covered parking spaces per unit. Multi-
family dwellings require 1.5 parking spaces per studio and 1-bedroom units, 2 spaces for
2-bedroom units, and 0.5 additional spaces for each bedroom above two. The parking
requirements are summarized in Table H-37.
The required parking is typical for most cities in Orange County and is not considered to
be a constraint on the production of affordable housing. Chapter 9.168.080 of the City’s
Zoning Code provides for exceptions and alternatives to the off-street parking standards.
Shared, off-site, and reduced parking options are available when justified by a parking
study. The Director of Development Services may approve a parking reduction of up to
5% of the total parking requirement and the Planning Commission may approve parking
reductions of up to 10%. Reduced parking is also available for qualifying density bonus
projects.

      1. Condominium projects require a use permit.
      2. Second units are permitted in accordance with existing state law in any residential zone that allows single-family homes.
As shown in Table H-38, the Zoning Code provides for a variety of housing types including
single-family homes, multi-family (both rental and condominiums), manufactured
housing, mobile homes, and second units. Low-income housing can be accommodated
in all residential districts. Second units, which can be an effective tool in facilitating
affordable housing, are permitted by-right in any residential zone with a single-family
home. The City’s Zoning Code also accommodates a variety of special needs housing.
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, the elderly, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional
living arrangements, and single room occupancy units. The City’s provisions for these
housing types are discussed below. Many of these households also fall into the extremely-
low-income category.
a.        Manufactured Housing/Mobile Home Parks
The manufacturing of homes in a factory is typically less costly than the construction of
individual homes on site thereby lowering overall housing costs. State law precludes local
governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on permanent
                                                                              51                                                      January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                       Constraints
foundations on single-family lots. In the City of Lake Forest, manufactured housing is
allowed in all residential zones as a permitted use provided the installation complies with
the site development standards for the applicable zoning district.
Mobile home parks are also permitted in the R2, R4, and RP districts, but require a use
permit. Mobile home development is regulated by Chapter 9.176 of the Municipal Code,
which is designed to ensure that mobile home developments are compatible with other
permitted uses in the district. The City of Lake Forest currently has four mobile home parks.
The City recognizes these mobile home parks for their contribution to affordable housing
and provides home rehabilitation loans to qualified mobile home owners through its
Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (see Program 11). The City’s development
standards for mobile homes are reasonable to ensure neighborhood compatibility, and
do not present an unreasonable constraint to development.
b.      Second Units
The development of second units is regulated by Section 9.146.050 of the Municipal
Code. In response to state-mandated requirements and local needs, the City of Lake
Forest allows for the development of second dwelling units by right (i.e., no discretionary
approval required) in any residential district that permits single-family dwellings. The
owner of both units must occupy either the primary dwelling or the accessory second
dwelling unit. Second unit permits are approved via an administrative and ministerial
process by the Director of Development Services. Permit review and approval typically is
completed within 10 working days.
The following requirements apply to second unit construction:
           Allowed in any residential zone where an owner-occupied detached single-
            family dwelling currently exists;
           Maximum 640 square feet of living area;
           Must comply with all development standards for the zone where it is located;
           One additional parking space required (covered or uncovered, tandem
            parking permitted);
           Compatible in materials, color and general architecture to the primary unit;
           Either the primary unit or the second unit must be owner-occupied; and
           Second units may not be sold separately from the primary dwelling, but may
            be rented.
Second units serve to augment resources for senior housing, or other low- and moderate-
income segments of the population. Two second unit permits were issued in 2006-07,
following adoption of the City’s Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance. Since these initial
permits, the economy entered recession and the City has not processed any additional
applications for second dwelling units. The initial approval of two units prior to the
economic downturn demonstrates that the City standards do not present an
unreasonable constraint to development.

c.       Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities refer to any family home, group home, or rehabilitation facility
that provides 24-hour non-medical care to persons in need of personal services,
protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for daily living. The City
of Lake Forest Zoning Code refers to residential care facilities as “community care
facilities”. This definition includes State-licensed childcare, medical, and non-medical
care facilities. Community care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-
right in all residential districts. Facilities serving more than six persons are conditionally
permitted in all residential zones by use permit. These requirements are consistent with
state law and do not pose a significant constraint on the establishment of such facilities.
City regulations do not require any separation between care facilities or group homes
beyond those established in state law.
d.       Farm Worker Housing
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Needs Assessment), the City of Lake Forest is not located
within a major agricultural area and has no significant need for permanent on-site farm
worker housing. The City’s overall efforts to provide and maintain affordable housing
opportunities will help to support the few seasonal farm workers that may choose to
reside in the City. However, the City’s Zoning Code includes two districts that allow
agricultural uses (A-1 and OS). Commercial agriculture is permitted by right in the A1
zone and with approval of a Site Development Permit in the OS zone. Currently,
“employees’ quarters” and “quarters for employee temporary use” are only allowed in
the A1 zone, subject to a Site Development Permit. “Employees' quarters” is defined in
the Zoning Code as “Quarters for the housing of agricultural and domestic employees
when such quarters are located upon the same land occupied by their employer.”
“Quarters for employee temporary use” is defined as “quarters for the temporary (no
longer than 30 days) housing of agricultural and domestic employees when such
quarters are located upon the same land occupied by their employer.” No residential
uses of any type are allowed within the OS zone.
Pursuant to the California Employee Housing Act, facilities with up to 36 beds or 12 units
to board farm workers must be treated as accessory or incidental to agriculture
operations. The City will evaluate provisions for commercial agriculture operations in the
A-1 and OS zones (and the related farm worker housing issues). The City will revise the
Zoning Code to achieve consistency with State law (Program 4).
e.       Housing for the Elderly
Senior housing projects (of 35 units or greater) are permitted in the R2, R4, and RS Districts
subject to a site development permit. Senior condominium projects would require a use
permit as do all condominiums in the City. The requirement for a site development permit
is reasonable to ensure neighborhood compatible design and is not considered to be a
constraint to the development of senior housing.

f.        Emergency Shelters
Consistent with California Health and Safety Code (§50801), the Zoning Code defines an
emergency shelter as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that
is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or
household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
SB 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelters and
transitional/supportive housing. For jurisdictions with an unmet need, emergency shelters
must be allowed by-right in at least one zoning district. The City amended its Zoning
Code in 2013 to allow emergency shelters by-right (i.e., ministerial approval) in the M1
zoning district.
The M1 zone has capacity to accommodate at least one year-round emergency shelter
and provide temporary shelter for the City’s unsheltered homeless population, which is
estimated to be approximately 25 people as of 2013. Approximately 115 acres on 115
parcels are located within the M1 zone. Most of these parcels are developed; however,
one parcel is vacant and there is ample vacancy within existing buildings, allowing for
potential adaptive reuse of existing space. The vacant 2.5-acre parcel (APN: 610-301-10)
is located at the corner of Dimension Drive and Prism Place. The City’s Economic
Development Department also maintains an inventory of commercial and industrial
properties available for lease or purchase.14 As of March 2013, 99 properties with over
one million square feet were listed for lease or sale in the M1 zone.
The M1 zone is suitable for emergency shelters because:
         Shelters are compatible with a range of uses that are common in suburban
          communities and allowed in the M1 zone (e.g., office buildings, religious institutions,
          child or day care, commercial or vocational schools, warehousing, libraries, civic or
          government uses, etc.);
         M1 parcels are served by public bus routes that connect to regional transit with an
          average distance of 0.29 miles from each parcel to a bus stop;
         Existing uses in the M1 zone are primarily light industrial, warehousing, and office uses
          – no heavy industrial uses are present; and
         The parcels are not known to be constrained by the presence of hazardous
          materials either on or adjacent to the properties.
The City amended the Zone Code in 2013 to establish the following objective
development and management standards that are intended to facilitate the
development of safe and sanitary emergency shelters, as allowed by SB2:
         Maximum Number of Persons/Beds: Maximum of 10 beds and no more than 10
          people served per night.
         Parking Ratio: One space per three beds.
         Spacing Requirement: 300 feet radius required between shelters.
         Length of Stay: Maximum 180 nights per calendar year per resident.

                the shelter is in operation.
            o   Facility must have a written management plan that includes provisions for
                staff training, neighborhood outreach, screening of residents, eligibility and
                admission procedures, operating schedule, rules regarding smoking, access
                to the facility, visitors, and guests, and a written policy outlining the
                consequences of rules violations or infractions.
            o   The facility must be designed and rules in place to avoid loitering on or
                adjacent to the site by patrons.
            o   Written eligibility and admission policies and procedures as well as dates,
                times, and services available, must be clearly posted.
            o   The facility must conform to and maintain all applicable State and local
                building codes, fire codes, occupancy standards and other relevant codes
                and regulations and permits.
            o   Staffing levels must be maintained consistent with industry standards.
            o   The facility must be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.
g.      Transitional and Supportive Housing
The City amended the Zoning Code in 2013 to define and allow transitional and
supportive housing in accordance with SB 2. The Zoning Code defines “transitional
housing” and “transitional housing development” as “buildings configured as rental
housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the
termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less
than six months. Transitional housing that is provided in single-, two-, or multi-family
dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding houses shall be
permitted, conditionally permitted, or prohibited in the same manner as other single-,
two-, or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or
boarding houses under this Code.”
The Zoning Code defines “supportive housing” as “housing with no limit on length of stay,
that is occupied by the target population as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 53260 of
                                                55                                January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                        Constraints
the CA Health and Safety Code, and that is linked to on- or off-site services that assist the
supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status,
and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
Supportive housing that is provided in single-, two-, or multi-family dwelling units, group
residential, residential care facilities, or boarding houses shall be permitted, conditionally
permitted, or prohibited in the same manner as other single-, two-, or multi-family
dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding houses under this
Code.” These definitions are consistent with definitions for these uses contained in
California Government Code §65582.
The City’s provisions for transitional and supportive housing are consistent with SB 2
because transitional and supportive housing are considered a residential use of property
subject to only those restrictions that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type
in the same zone, as required by Government Code §65583(a)(5).
For example, as shown in Table H-39, transitional or supportive housing that is proposed
within a single-family detached structure is permitted by-right and subject to the same
land use regulations as all single-family detached structures in the R and A-1 zones.
Similarly, transitional or supportive housing that is proposed in a multi-family structure with
five or more units requires a Site Development Permit (or Use Permit if a condominium)
and is subject to the same restrictions that apply to all multi-family structures with five or
more units in the R2/R4 zone.
Supportive or transitional housing may also operate within care facilities (e.g., community
or residential care facilities), and therefore, transitional or supportive housing would be
permitted as and subject to the same development standards as these care facilities in
the same zones.

h.       Single Room Occupancy
Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units. The Zoning Code
defines SROs as follows:
         A building with a common entrance containing a cluster of at least five (5) rental
         units which provide sleeping and living facilities for one (1) or two (2) persons
         where kitchen and/or bathroom facilities may be shared. The units shall have a
         minimum of one hundred (100) net square feet of space for single occupancy
         and one hundred twenty (120) square feet for two-person occupancy. The
         calculation for floor space in the sleeping area includes built-in cabinets, sinks,
         and closets but excludes toilet compartments. A unit larger than two hundred
         twenty five (225) square feet shall be deemed an efficiency dwelling unit and not
         a Single-Room Occupancy (SRO).
Pursuant to Section 9.156.040 of the Zoning Code, SRO facilities are allowed in any
district, planned community, or specific plan area zoned for hotels subject to approval of
a Use Permit and management plan. The SRO facility must accommodate an on-site 24-
hour manager and the management plan must describe policies, operations,
emergency procedures, security, rental procedures, maintenance plans, and staffing
needs. SROs are treated as nonresidential uses and are therefore not subject to
maximum density requirements.
i.       Boarding Houses
Boarding houses are not permitted in Lake Forest. This use is defined in the Zoning Code
as “a residence or dwelling, other than a hotel, wherein room(s) are rented under three
                                                                57                                    January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                     Constraints
(3) or more separate written or oral rental agreements, leases or subleases or
combination thereof, whether or not the owner, agent or rental manager resides within
the residence. ‘Boarding house’ includes unlicensed community care facilities serving six
(6) or fewer persons, as provided in this section.”
j.      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City’s building codes require that new residential construction comply with the
federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions include requirements for a
minimum percentage of units in new developments to be fully accessible to the
physically disabled. Provision of fully accessible units may also increase the overall
project development costs. However, unlike the California Building Code, enforcement
of ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under federal
law.
Compliance with building codes and the ADA may increase the cost of housing
production and can also impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties required
to be brought up to current code standards. However, these regulations provide
minimum standards that must be complied with in order to ensure the development of
safe and accessible housing. In order to facilitate the processing of requests to reduce
architectural obstacles for persons with disabilities, the City adopted a Reasonable
Accommodations Ordinance in 2007 (Municipal Code Chapter 9.224). The ordinance
includes the following provisions:
       Application procedures, including the accommodation requested and the basis
        for the request;
       Review of applications for completeness by the Director of within five days of
        receipt;
       Decision by the Director within 30 days of submittal of a complete application;
        and
       Procedures for requesting a Director’s hearing or appeal to the Planning
        Commission
These provisions are consistent with state law and do not pose a constraint to reasonable
accommodation for persons with disabilities.
Parking standards comply with Building Code and ADA requirements for handicapped
spaces. For single-family homes, requests to modify parking requirements for persons with
disabilities are processed under the Reasonable Accommodations Ordinance.
The Zoning Code defines “family” as one or more persons occupying one dwelling unit.
"Family" includes the occupants of community care facilities serving six or fewer persons
which are permitted or licensed by the State. "Family" does not include occupants of a
fraternity, sorority, boarding house, lodging house, club, or motel. City regulations do not
require any separation between or concentration of care facilities or group homes.

4.      Density Bonus
Under state density bonus law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a
density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the Municipal Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of
equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with
units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Section 9.152.010 of the
Municipal Code (“Affordable Housing or Senior Citizen Housing Incentive Use Permit”)
incorporates by reference the procedures for providing density bonus or other incentives
in compliance with state law (Government Code §65915 et seq.).
5.      Condominium Conversions
In order to ensure a variety of housing opportunities (ownership and rental) including low-
density single-family homes, moderate-density townhomes, higher-density condominiums
and mobile homes, the City’s Municipal Code provides the following requirements for
proposed condominium conversions:
      1.    A requirement for a condominium use permit approved by the City Council (if
            five or more units).
      2.    Compliance with the applicable standards and requirements of the zoning
            district is which the project is located.
      3.    The provision of a tenant purchase option.
      4.    The payment of relocation expenses of $1,500 in 2006 dollars adjusted annually
            in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.
      5.    A requirement to submit an affordable housing implementation plan which
            incorporates a minimum of 15% affordable units (either rental or ownership).
      6.    A general prohibition on conversions (with specified overriding considerations)
            that becomes effective when the average rental vacancy rate within the City
            during the 12 preceding months is 4% or greater.
When a condo conversion is permitted, the increase in the supply of less expensive for-
sale units helps to compensate for the loss of rental units. One condominium conversion
has been approved since adoption of the condominium conversion standards. This
demonstrates that the ordinance to regulate condominium conversions is reasonable to
preserve rental housing opportunities, and does not present an unreasonable constraint
on the production of ownership housing.
6.      Building Codes and Enforcement
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such changes to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
                                                 59                             January 2014

The City's building codes are based upon the 2010 edition of the California Building,
Plumbing, Mechanical, Electrical and Fire Codes. These are considered to be the
minimum necessary to protect the public's health, safety and welfare. No amendments
or additional regulations have been imposed by the City that would unnecessarily add
to housing costs.15 The Portola Center and Pinnacle at Serrano Highlands are in the Very
High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ). Lake Forest, like other cities and counties in
California, are required to adopt the VHFHSZ by the State; therefore, additional building
code requirements associated with the VHFHSZ are a State mandate as opposed to a
City-imposed amendment to the Lake Forest’s building codes.
As part of the City’s Community Preservation efforts, code enforcement staff conducts
health and safety code compliance inspections, and also disseminates, as appropriate,
valuable information regarding the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program (Program
11). The Loan Program provides funding to lower-income homeowners and assists in
addressing housing and/or health and safety code compliance issues.
7.      Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
All residential development is reviewed by City staff for zoning, building and fire code
compliance prior to issuance of building permits. For most property in Lake Forest, new
residential development with fewer than five units is permitted by right, provided the
project adheres to the allowed density and development standards of the zone.
Allowing smaller projects by right encourages the provision of affordable housing on
smaller in-fill and underutilized lots within the older areas of the City. For projects with five
or more units, a Site Development Permit must be approved by the Planning Commission.
The discretionary process allows the project to be reviewed for appropriateness, scale,
architecture, design, and compatibility with the surrounding area.
The Site Development Permit process includes the following steps:
      1.      Applicant submits application package including application, letter of
              explanation, deposits, environmental information form, and plan sets. Some
              applicants also provide technical studies (e.g., traffic, geotechnical) at this
              time, if required.
   Local amendments are primarily administrative in nature or pertain to non-residential uses. One local
15
   amendment requires undergrounding of overhead utility lines as condition of building permit issuance for
   new residential construction or remodel/addition work that will exceed 50% of existing improvement
   value. If it is determined that practical difficulties, or unreasonable hardships unique to a particular parcel
   of property, would result from the undergrounding requirement, the City’s Building Official may waive,
   modify, or delay the imposition of any undergrounding requirement.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                      Constraints
      2.    Planning staff routes application for inter-departmental review and reviews
            application for planning issues. A first screencheck letter is issued to the
            applicant within 30 days of application pursuant to the Permit Streamlining Act.
      3.    Applicant submits responses to first screencheck letter as appropriate. There is
            no specified time limit for the applicant’s resubmittal.
      4.    Planning staff repeats step 2 and either issues a letter deeming the project
            application complete and sets a date for a Planning Commission hearing, or
            issues a second screencheck letter requesting additional information from the
            applicant.
      5.    All residential projects are subject to CEQA review once a complete
            application is received. Staff prepares a Notice of Exemption or other
            appropriate CEQA document. If an EIR or Negative Declaration is required, an
            appropriate public review period occurs prior to the public hearing.
      6.    Once a public hearing date has been set, staff publishes public notices and
            prepares a staff report and resolution(s) of approval.
      7.    A public hearing is held before the Planning Commission.
The City of Lake Forest does not have a Design Review Board. Staff and the Planning
Commission work with applicants to ensure high quality design.
Processing times vary and depend on the size and complexity of the project. Projects
reviewed by the Planning Commission, including Site Development Permits, Tentative
Parcel Maps, and Tentative Tract Maps, typically require between 3 to 12 months to
process. Projects reviewed by the City Council, such as General Plan and Zoning Code
amendments, typically require between 6 to 12 months to process.
The following findings must be made by the decision-making body in order to approve a
Site Development Permit (LFMC Sec. 9.184.040.E):
      a.    General Plan. The use or project proposed is consistent with the General Plan.
      b.    Zoning Code. The use, activity or improvement(s) proposed by the application
            is consistent with the provisions of the Zoning Code.
      c.    CEQA. The approval of the permit application is in compliance with the
            requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.
      d.    Compatibility. The location, size, design and operating characteristics of the
            proposed use will not create significant noise, traffic or other conditions or
            situations that may be objectionable, detrimental or incompatible with other
            permitted uses in the vicinity.
      e.    General Welfare. The application will not result in conditions or circumstances
            contrary to the public health and safety and the general welfare.
      f.    Development Fees for Provision of Public Facilities. One (1) of the following
            findings shall be made:
                                                 61                               January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                         Constraints
                i.     The property to which the permit applies is not located in a fee area.
                ii.    The permit would not allow development of a project which would
                       contribute to the need for the facility for which a fee is required.
      g.    Design Guidelines. The project has been reviewed in accordance with
            Citywide Design Guidelines, and is consistent with the purpose and intent of
            the guidelines.
These findings are derived from State Planning and Zoning Law, ensure the orderly
development of the community, help to prevent land use conflicts, and do not
significantly impact approval certainty, timing or cost.
Certain steps of the development process are required by State rather than local laws.
The state has defined processing deadlines to limit the amount of time needed for review
of required reports and projects. In an effort to provide an efficient permit processing
system, the City has implemented the following time and cost saving developmental
processes:
            Prepared permit processing guidelines to assist residential builders in applying
             for development permits for single-family residences, multifamily residential
             developments and subdivisions.
            Located all City divisions involved in the permitting process - Planning,
             Engineering, Building, Public Works, Economic Development - in one central
             location.
            Encourage applicants to utilize the City’s Zoning Confirmation process to
             ensure that a use is permitted on a particular property.
            Developed “early consultation” pre-application process to identify issues as
             soon as possible and reduce processing time, as determined on a case by
             case basis.
            Allow processing fees to be reduced, postponed or supplemented with
             housing funds for affordable projects meeting City priorities.
            Encourage concurrent processing of applications.
These procedures help to ensure that the development review process meets all legal
requirements without causing a significant unwarranted constraint to housing develop-
ment or affordability.
b.       Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all discretionary applications for development under
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Lake Forest has a number of
environmental and development constraints due to its sensitive environmental resources
and the City’s commitment to preserving its open space and natural surroundings.
Because of these environmental constraints, the larger planned residential projects have
required the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs). An EIR is required of all
developments that have the potential of creating significant impacts that cannot be
mitigated, which is highly typical of large projects. Preparation of an EIR can take six
                                               62                                    January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    Constraints
months or more. Some residential projects in Lake Forest are either Categorically Exempt
or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration. A Negative Declaration typically
takes four to six weeks to prepare, depending on complexity of the project and required
technical studies, followed by a state-mandated public review period. Categorically
Exempt developments require a minimal amount of time. As a result, environmental review
does not pose a significant constraint to housing development.
c.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and infra-
structure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system, based on
the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will be derived.
Table H-40 provides a listing of fees the City of Lake Forest and regional agencies charge
for new, standard residential development (see Appendix D for regional impact fees).
The rates charged by the City are inclusive and based on standardized unit sizes.
Development fees will vary from project to project depending on the specific
characteristics. Table H-41 and Table H-42 summarize the total development fees for
typical single-family and multi-family projects.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                       Constraints
The City periodically evaluates the actual cost of processing the development permits
when revising its fee schedule. The last review and update occurred in 2008.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development
impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision
Map Act.
A typical local street requires a 60-foot right-of-way, with two 18-foot travel lanes. The
City’s road standards are typical for cities in Orange County and do not act as a
constraint to housing development. Table H-43 illustrates the City’s road improvement
standards.

The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improve-
ments including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the continued build-
out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public
improvements is coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.      Non-Governmental Constraints
1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The City’s land use plans have been
                                                                        66                                         January 2014

designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and also to protect public safety
by avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain residential
development to some extent, they are necessary to support other public policies. In
Southern California, nearly all development projects face potential community-wide
environmental constraints such as traffic, noise and air quality impacts, in addition to site-
specific constraints. None of the sites identified in the land inventory (Appendix C) have
environmental constraints that would preclude the assumed level of development. It is
noteworthy that during the previous planning period, a major constraint to residential
development in Lake Forest was removed with the closure of the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station and the subsequent re-designation of land formerly subject to aircraft overflight
noise.
2.      Infrastructure Constraints
As discussed under Development Fees and Improvement Requirements, the City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-way,
transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map
Act.
Additionally, the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements including streets, bridges, and other public works projects to facilitate the
continued build-out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction
of public improvements is coordinated with private development. As a result of these
policies, any infrastructure constraints which currently exist must be fully mitigated and
financed as growth occurs.
a.      Wastewater
Sewage collection and treatment in Lake Forest is provided by the Irvine Ranch Water
District (IRWD), El Toro Water District (ETWD), and the Trabuco Canyon Water District
(TCWD). The wastewater is collected by the districts and directed to local and regional
treatment plants in conjunction with the South Orange County Wastewater Authority.
ETWD presently reclaims water which is used for landscape irrigation. The western portion
of the City is primarily developed, with the necessary sewer infrastructure in place. In the
undeveloped portions of the City, sewer lines may need to be extended to serve
planned development. Sewer infrastructure improvements are typically addressed in the
development agreements for the Planned Communities. Sewage treatment capacity is
available to serve these areas and does not constrain development.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that wastewater service providers develop
written policies that grant priority to proposed development that includes housing
affordable to lower income households should a rationing system is implemented. The
legislation also prohibits wastewater service providers from denying or conditioning the
approval of development that includes housing affordable to lower income households,
unless specific written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted
Housing Element to the IRWD, ETWD and TCWD within 30 days of adoption. The City will
                                                  67                                  January 2014

also continue to coordinate with the districts to ensure affordable housing developments
receive priority wastewater service provision.
b.        Water
Water for City residents is supplied by the IRWD, ETWD and TCWD. The three districts treat
and distribute water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District, which imports water
from northern California and the Colorado River. As with the sewer lines, water lines must
be extended to service new planned developments. Domestic water supply is not
expected to limit development during the planning period.16
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies
that grant priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower
income households should a rationing system is implemented. The legislation also
prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the approval of development that
includes housing affordable to lower-income households, unless specific written findings
are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to the IRWD,
ETWD and TCWD within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue to coordinate
with the districts to ensure affordable housing developments receive priority water
service provision.
c.        Storm Water Drainage
The City of Lake Forest spans three watershed areas with five natural creeks. A flood
control system has been partially constructed to direct runoff away from developed
areas and prevent flooding from rain. The Orange County Flood Control District (OCFCD)
is responsible for regional flood control and maintains several facilities within the City. The
City works closely with OCFCD to determine needs for flood control improvements and
to identify improvements needed to accommodate proposed development projects.
Development proposals and amendments within Planned Communities are reviewed for
consistency with flood control improvements required in approved development plans
and agreements. Development proposals outside of Planned Communities are assessed
for drainage impacts and required facilities. With these existing facilities and review
procedures in place, the City’s flood control system is not expected to limit development
during the planning period.
3.        Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and have moderated slightly in recent
years after marked and sustained increases between 2000 and 2007. Changes in land
prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market. The current market
is showing signs of modest recovery after experiencing a significant downturn similar to
the early 1980s and early 1990s, which was characterized by relatively sharp declines in
property values and extended periods of minimal appreciation before prices recovered.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                 Constraints
Despite the generally poor economic conditions since 2007, land prices throughout
Orange County remain high relative to other regions in California and pose a significant
challenge to development of affordable housing by the private market .
Per-unit land cost is directly affected by density – higher density allows the cost to be
spread across more units, reducing the total price. The City zoning code allows
development at up to 43 units per acre in the R2 District, which has helped to reduce
per-unit land cost. Much of the City’s future residential development will occur within the
New Neighborhoods with approved development agreements and entitlements.
Therefore, future fluctuations in land costs would not necessarily influence the feasibility
of housing development in these areas.
4.        Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Lake Forest are not substantially
different than most other cities in Orange County. Construction costs for materials and
labor have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general rate of inflation
according to the Construction Industry Research Board.
5.        Cost and Availability of Financing
The recent (2007) crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability and cost of
real estate loans, although the long-term effects remain unpredictable. The credit
“crunch” resulted when “sub-prime” lenders made it possible for low-income families or
others who could not qualify for standard mortgages to become home owners even
though they might not have had the credit history and income to support repayment of
the loans. The problem typically occurs with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) after the
initial fixed interest rate period expires (often three years) and the interest rate converts to
market. Because ARMs often offer “teaser” initial interest rates well below market for the
first few years, monthly payments may increase by several hundred dollars when the loan
converts to market rate. When property values were increasing, as was the case from
2000 to 2006, homeowners had the option of refinancing to a new loan when the initial
rate expired. However, given the decline in values since peak market conditions, many
homeowners owe more than the resale value of their home, making refinancing
impossible. Furthermore, institutions have tightened underwriting standards making it
even more difficult to refinance existing mortgages without substantial equity and
demonstrably stable income.
As a result of these conditions, there has been a significant rise in foreclosures since 2007,
but the rate of foreclosures has slowed in recent years. The number of Lake Forest homes
in the foreclosure process declined 57% in the last year; from 387 homes in January 2012
to 164 in January 2013.17

6.      Fair Housing
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the City.
State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City also
provides annual financial support to a contracted fair housing service provider. The City
currently contracts with the Fair Housing Council of Orange County (FHCOC) through its
CDBG program and is an active participant in fair housing activities.

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
A.      Goals and Policies
Sections II, III and IV of the Housing Element evaluate the City’s housing needs,
opportunities and constraints, while Appendix A presents a review of the previous
element. This Housing Action Plan reflects the City’s experience during the 2008-2014
planning period and sets forth the City’s goals, policies, and programs to address the
identified housing needs and issues for the 2013-2021 planning period. Quantified
objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and conservation are also identified.
The goals and policies that guide the City’s housing programs and activities are as
follows:
ISSUE 1 - HOUSING DIVERSITY AND OPPORTUNITIES
The diversity of housing opportunities in Lake Forest distinguishes the City from many other
south Orange County communities and has attracted residents into the City. Continuing
to provide a balanced inventory of housing in terms of unit type (single-family, multi-
family, mobile home), cost, and style will allow the City to fulfill a variety of housing
needs.
GOAL 1.0:      Adequate housing to meet the existing and future needs of Lake Forest
               residents.
        Policy 1.1:    Ensure the provision of a variety of housing opportunities (ownership
                       and rental) in Lake Forest including low-density single-family homes,
                       moderate-density townhomes, higher-density apartments and
                       condominiums, mixed-use development, second dwelling units, and
                       mobile homes to fulfill regional housing needs.
        Policy 1.2:    Facilitate the development of affordable housing by offering
                       development incentives on a case-by-case basis.
        Policy 1.3:    Ensure that the design of new residential development is compatible
                       with that of existing residences.
        Policy 1.4:    Encourage the development of residential units that are designed
                       and marketed to meet the needs of extremely low income
                       households and special groups, such as the elderly, persons with
                       disabilities (including developmental disabilities), and those in need
                       of temporary shelter.
        Policy 1.5:    Encourage the development of new housing units in close proximity
                       to public transportation and community services, including mixed-
                       use development in the Baker Ranch and Portola Hills Planned
                       Communities.

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                              Housing Action Plan
        Policy 1.6:    Remove or reduce governmental constraints on affordable housing
                       development, while maintaining compatibility with surrounding
                       development.
        Policy 1.7:    Support the provision of housing and supportive services for special
                       needs populations in Lake Forest.
        Policy 1.8:    Encourage residential developments to incorporate a minimum of
                       15% affordable units, including units affordable to extremely low
                       income households.
        Policy 1.9:    Identify potential sites in the City to expand housing opportunities
                       through public/private partnerships.
ISSUE 2 - MAINTENANCE, PRESERVATION, AND CONSERVATION OF HOUSING
The majority of the Lake Forest housing stock is in good condition. However, some of the
City's older neighborhoods show signs of age and maintenance needs typical of
structures 30 to 40 years old. As the City's housing stock continues to age, on-going
maintenance is vital to preserve neighborhood quality and character. Other housing
conservation needs of the City include existing affordable housing stock and rental units
at risk of converting to market-rents or condominiums, and the Housing Choice Voucher
Program.
GOAL 2.0:      Maintenance and enhancement of the quality of existing residential

Related Goals and Policies
The goals and policies described in the Housing Element are related to and support
subjects included in other General Plan elements. In turn, many goals and policies from
other elements directly or indirectly support the goals, and policies of the Housing
Element. These supporting goals and policies are identified in Table H-44.

  B.        Housing Programs
Lake Forest offers a variety of housing opportunities to meet the needs of the community.
This section of the Housing Action Plan addresses the issues identified in the previous
sections of the Element and provides a strategy to achieve the City’s housing goals. The
housing programs designed to implement the City’s strategy are discussed in detail
below.
PROVISION OF ADEQUATE HOUSING SITES TO ACHIEVE A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES AND DENSITIES
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all segments of the community is the
provision of adequate sites for housing. This is an important function of both the General
Plan and zoning.
Program 1: Land Use Policy, Entitlements, and Development Capacity
Planning and regulatory actions to achieve adequate housing sites are implemented
through the Land Use Element, Zoning Code, and implementation of existing
development agreements. These regulatory documents provide for a variety of
residential types, ranging from lower-density single-family homes to higher-density
apartments, condominiums, and mixed-use development.
Lake Forest’s residential sites inventory consists of over 600 acres of developable land
with the capacity to yield nearly 3,900 new units during the planning period. As noted in
Section III, these sites are adequate to meet the City's share of regional housing needs for
the 2014-2021 RHNA period.
    Responsible Agency:          Development Services Department
    Financing:                   Department budget
                                                     74                                            January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                           Housing Action Plan
    2014-2021 Objectives: Maintain and monitor the residential sites inventory to ensure
                              adequate sites remain to accommodate the RHNA
                              throughout the RHNA period.        Receive and process
                              development applications for projects within the New
                              Neighborhoods.
    Timeframe:                Annual monitoring and reporting throughout the planning
                              period.
Program 2: Monitor Residential Capacity (No Net Loss)
Monitor the consumption of residential acreage to ensure an adequate inventory is
available to meet the City’s RHNA obligations. To ensure sufficient residential capacity is
maintained to accommodate the RHNA, the City will develop and implement a formal
ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code
Section 65863. Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity
below the residential capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower
income households, the City will identify and, if necessary, rezone sufficient sites to
accommodate the shortfall and ensure “no net loss” in capacity to accommodate the
RHNA.
    Responsible Agency:       Development Services Department
    Financing:                Department budget
    2013-2021 Objectives: Develop and implement a formal evaluation procedure
                              pursuant to Government Code Section 65863 by January 1,
                              2014.
    Timeframe:                Annual monitoring and reporting throughout the planning
                              period.
Program 3: Facilitate Affordable Housing Production
Affordable housing developments face a number of hurdles, including financing,
development codes and standards, and in some cases, public opposition. Dissolution of
the City’s Redevelopment Agency by the State in 2012 eliminated the Low and
Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly the City’s primary mechanism for
providing direct funding support of affordable housing development. Continuing
reductions in federal funding of HUD programs (e.g., CDBG) will constrain the City’s ability
to offer committed funding assistance to future affordable housing even further. The City
can encourage and facilitate affordable housing through financial assistance, removal
of regulatory constraints, and administrative support. With limited funding, the City will
rely on the following actions to encourage affordable housing production during the
planning period:
           Affordable Housing Implementation Plans (AHIPs):         Each of the New
            Neighborhoods land owners / developers has entered into a development
            agreement (DA) with the City. The DAs include an Affordable Housing
            Implementation Plan (AHIP) to facilitate the production of affordable units in
            conjunction with the development of the OSA projects. The City will monitor
                                              75                                January 2014

City of Lake Forest 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   Housing Action Plan
            the development of the New Neighborhoods projects and include in the
            annual Housing Element Progress Report to HCD the status of compliance with
            the AHIPs and the progress toward development of affordable units.
           Collaborate with Affordable Housing Developers:                  Affordable housing
            developers work to develop, conserve and promote rental and ownership
            affordable housing. Particularly in relation to senior housing, the affordable
            housing developer is often, but not always, a local organization interested in
            developing affordable housing. The affordable housing developer is often
            involved with what is called "assisted housing", where some type of
            government assistance (such as Section 8 or Tax Credits) is provided to the
            individual household to keep rents affordable.              An affordable housing
            developer can help meet the City’s goal of incorporating a minimum of 15%
            affordable units within new residential developments by implementing or
            assisting with the implementation of programs described in this Element. The
            City will continue to collaborate with affordable housing developers to identify
            potential sites, write letters of support to help secure governmental and
            private-sector funding, and offer technical assistance related to the
            application of State density bonus provisions.
           Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
            developers on a case-by-case basis to provide State-mandated regulatory
            concessions and incentives to assist with the development of affordable and
            senior housing. In a relatively small city like Lake Forest, this is the most effective
            method of assisting developers, as each individual project can be analyzed to
            determine which concessions and incentives would be the most beneficial to
            the project’s feasibility. State-mandated regulatory concessions and incentives
            could include, but are not limited to, density bonuses, parking reductions, fee
            reductions or deferral, expedited permit processing, and modified or waived
            development standards. Any requested concessions or incentives would be
            evaluated on a case-by-case basis while simultaneously working to ensure the
            project is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

    Financing:                Department budget; Affordable Housing In-Lieu Fees
    2013-2021 Objectives: Maintain contact information for affordable housing
                              developers for the purposes of soliciting their involvement in
                              development projects in Lake Forest.                Participate with
                              affordable housing developers to review available federal
                              and State financing subsidies and apply as feasible on an
                              annual basis. Assist and support developers of housing for
                              lower-income households, especially housing for extremely
                              low-income households, with site identification, supporting
                              applications, conducting pre-application meetings, assisting
                              with design and site requirements, and providing State-
                              mandated regulatory incentives and concessions. Monitor
                              and enforce AHIP provisions and collaborate with developers

                              the construction of 250 affordable units over the planning
                              period (10 extremely low-income, 40 very low-income, and
                              200 low-income units).
    Timeframe:                Update list and contact information for affordable housing
                              developers     annually   thereafter.      Provide    ongoing
                              participation and assistance to interested affordable housing
                              developers. Annual monitoring and reporting throughout the
                              planning period.
REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
State law requires the Housing Element to address, and where appropriate and legally
possible, remove governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement,
and development of housing. In 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to define and
allow emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive housing in accordance
with SB2. The following programs are designed to lessen governmental constraints on
housing development during the 2013-2021 planning period.
Program 4: Farm Employee Housing
The City’s Zoning Code includes two districts that allow agricultural uses (A-1 and OS).
Commercial agriculture is permitted by right in the A1 zone and with approval of a Site
Development Permit in the OS zone. Pursuant to the California Employee Housing Act,
facilities with up to 36 beds or 12 units to board farm workers must be treated as
accessory or incidental to agriculture operations. State law also provides that employee
housing occupied by six (6) or fewer employees in a single family structure, shall be
treated the same as a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone. The City will
evaluate provisions for commercial agriculture operations in the A-1 and OS zones (and
the related farm worker housing issues) and revise the Zoning Code to address
compliance with Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code.
    Responsible Agency:       Development Services Department
    Financing:                Department budget
    2013-2021 Objectives: Review and revise the Zoning Code to address compliance
                              with Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6.
    Timeframe:                Review and revise the Zoning Code within one year of
                              adoption of the Housing Element.
Program 5: Monitor Changes in Federal and State Housing, Planning, and Zoning Laws
Although the 2013-2021 Housing Element update did not identify any significant
governmental constraints to the development or maintenance of housing in Lake Forest,
the City will continue to monitor its development process and zoning regulations to
identify and remove constraints to the development of housing. The City will also
continue to monitor federal and State legislation that could impact housing and
comment on, support, or oppose proposed changes or additions to existing legislation,
                                               77                                January 2014

                              remove housing constraints.
    Timeframe:                Annual monitoring and reporting throughout the planning
                              period.
HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS
Where there is a need for affordable housing, often there is also a need for supportive
services for lower income households, including the homeless, extremely low income
households, and persons with disabilities (including developmental disabilities). The City
assists service providers in meeting the immediate needs of persons with special needs,
including the homeless, near-homeless, and extremely low income households.
Immediate need includes the provision of food, temporary shelter, health care, and
other social services. The following programs intend to address the overall need for
housing and supportive services for special needs populations in Lake Forest.
Program 6: Sites for Homeless Shelters
Homelessness is a chronic problem throughout Southern California. While the majority of
the County’s homeless are in the older, more urbanized jurisdictions and in the beach
communities, current data indicates approximately 25 homeless persons within the City
on any given night. In addition, the City has numerous households who may be
considered at-risk of becoming homeless by virtue of their limited incomes. It is important
for the City to provide and maintain the appropriate zoning mechanisms to
accommodate the provision of facilities that serve the homeless population, most of
whom are extremely-low-incomes.

                              case-by-case basis). Assist non-profit organizations identify
                              potential sites for homeless shelters.        Continue staff
                              participation in the Commission to End Homelessness and
                              support of a Homeless Liaison within the Police Services
                              Department.

Program 7: Transitional and Supportive Housing
The City provided financial assistance to non-profit service agencies to purchase existing
housing in the community for use as transitional and supportive housing. These facilities
help to address the needs of very low and extremely low income persons. Specifically,
the City has provided CDBG funding to non-profit organizations for the purchase and
operation of condominium units for transitional/supportive and affordable housing. These
condominiums will continue to offer transitional/supportive and affordable housing to
extremely low income residents through 2022–2030.
Through the City’s partnership with Families Forward, supportive services are provided to
residents that include weekly case management counseling, weekly budget and
financial counseling, child care assistance to attend counseling, education supplies
assistance, employment supplies and tools assistance, health care payment assistance,
permanent housing placement assistance, legal assistance (as available), life-skills
training, weekly children’s program that addresses self-esteem, social skills, coping skills,
values and beliefs, peer pressure, anger management, self-care, and identifying social
networks.

Program 8: Coordination with Social Service Agencies
A variety of social services agencies provide housing and supportive services to special
needs groups in Lake Forest. Several of these social service agencies receive CDBG funds
from the City to help administer these programs. The City determines its CDBG allocations
to social service agencies annually based upon applications received, whether the
agency provides a priority need in the City’s 5-year Consolidated Plan, and if the agency
meets Federal HUD regulations. In a typical program year, funding is allocated to
nonprofits that serve the following needs of lower income individuals and households
(i.e., those earning up to 80% AMI): food distribution, housing assistance, services and
programs for the elderly and youth, before and after school care programs, services for
the disabled (including developmentally disabled), primary health care services, and fair
housing advocacy and counseling.
Similar to the Housing Element update, the Consolidated Plan involves comprehensive
outreach, citizen participation workshops, and assessment of community needs to
develop a road map for programs and activities to be pursued in the ensuing five years.
The variety of social service agencies that may be awarded CDBG are guided by priority
                                               79                                January 2014

needs articulated in the Consolidated Plan. All CDBG-contracted and funded programs
(emergency housing/shelter, food distribution, primary health care services to the
indigent or non-insured, senior case-management services and home-delivered meals,
and before-and-after school youth programs for lower income families) address and
assist the needs of lower income persons and households of our community.
    Responsible Agency:       City of Lake Forest Housing Authority
    Financing:                CDBG
    2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to evaluate on an annual basis allocation of CDBG
                              Funds to social service agencies to benefit Lake Forest
                              residents.
    Timeframe:                Annual monitoring and reporting throughout the planning
                              period.
CONSERVE THE EXISTING SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Market rents in Lake Forest are at a level which significantly limits the supply of housing
affordable to very low income households. Rental subsidies are necessary to prevent
many of the City's very low income residents from spending upwards of 30% of their
incomes on housing costs, and over-extending themselves financially. In addition to rent
subsidies, actions to conserve the low income bond project in Lake Forest at-risk of
converting to market rate will be necessary to maintain affordability.
Program 9: Rental Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program extends rental subsidies to
extremely low and very low income families and elderly (i.e., those earning up to 50%
AMI) who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the
difference between the excess of 30% of their monthly income and the actual rent. Rent
subsidies can be used to pay for mobile home park space rents. Lake Forest contracts
with the Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA) to administer the Federal Housing
Choice Voucher Program. According to OCHA, approximately 194 Lake Forest resident
households received voucher assistance as of March 2013, with another 809 applicants
on the waiting list.
    Responsible Agency:       Orange County Housing Authority
    Financing:                U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
    2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to contract with the OCHA to administer the
                              Housing Choice Vouchers Program with the goal of assisting
                              an average of approximately 190 extremely low and very low
                              income households annually during the planning period.
                              Promote the Housing Choice Vouchers program on City
                              website. Support the OCHA’s applications for additional
                              voucher allocations and efforts to maintain and expand
                              voucher use in the City.

Program 10: Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
In order to meet the housing needs of all economic groups in Lake Forest, the City must
develop programs to minimize the loss of housing units available to lower income
households. As of April 2013, the City’s affordable housing inventory consisted of 264
units with at least another 250 affordable units anticipated during the planning period.
Of the existing 264 affordable units, 255 were at risk of converting to market rate rents. Of
the at-risk units, 209 are only considered “at risk” because owners have the option to
could pre-pay bond funding before 2023. Affordability covenants for 38 units in the
Crestwood Apartments expire in 2017, 6 units at Bellecour Way could convert to market
rate in 2018, and 2 transitional housing units become “at risk” in 2022 and 2023.
    Responsible Agency:       City of Lake Forest Housing Authority; Orange County Housing
                              Authority.
    Financing:                U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Section

                              sources as available.
    2013-2021 Objectives: The City will work with property owners, interest groups and
                              the State and federal governments to implement the
                              following programs on an ongoing basis to conserve its
                              affordable housing stock:
                                 Monitor Units at Risk: Maintain contact with providers and
                                   owners to monitor the status of existing and future
                                   affordable units, including the 255 at-risk units.
                                 Work with Owners:         Provide technical assistance to
                                   owners of properties with at-risk units by identifying
                                   funding sources and supporting grant or tax credit
                                   applications for the extension of affordability covenants.
                                 Work with Potential Purchasers: Where feasible, provide
                                   technical assistance to public and non-profit agencies
                                   interested in purchasing and/or managing properties that
                                   include units at risk.
                                 Tenant Education: The California Legislature extended
                                   the noticing requirement of at-risk units opting out of low
                                   income use restrictions to one year. Should a property
                                   owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate, the
                                   City will ensure that tenants were properly noticed and
                                   informed of their rights and that they are eligible to
                                   receive Section 8 vouchers that would enable them to
                                   stay in their units.
    Timeframe:                Ongoing implementation and annual monitoring and
                              reporting throughout the planning period. Within 60 days of

                                program.
REHABILITATE THE CITY'S EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY AND MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING STOCK
The majority of the City's housing stock is in good condition; however, it is important for
the City to provide programs that ensure the continued maintenance of its housing
stock. The City utilizes CDBG funds to operate a single-family rehabilitation loan program
for low-income households, and implements improvements through its code enforce-
ment and targeted Neighborhood Preservation programs citywide.
Program 11: Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program
The City provides housing rehabilitation assistance to lower income homeowners through
a loan program for owner-occupied single-family detached and attached homes and
mobile home units, which is funded through the City’s CDBG program. A zero-interest
deferred payment loan of up to $30,000 is available to households earning up to 80%
AMI. A 3% interest loan amortized for a 15 year period is available to those who wish to
pay off their loan sooner. Loans of up to $15,000 are also available to owners of mobile
homes. Eligible repairs include roofing, windows, exterior and interior painting, plumbing,
electrical, energy/weatherization, garage doors, and other common home repairs, as
well as accessibility improvements. Since the City has its own rehabilitation program, City
residents are no longer eligible to participate in County-sponsored rehabilitation
programs.
The City promotes its owner-occupied Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program on a year-
round basis on its website and in the City’s quarterly newsletter. The loan program is only
available for owner-occupied homes, townhomes and mobile homes.
    Responsible Agency:         City of Lake Forest Housing Authority
    Financing:                  CDBG
    2013-2021 Objectives: Assist 10 lower income homeowners annually.
    Timeframe:                  Annual allocation of CDBG funds through the HUD Action

                                the HUD CAPER process throughout the planning period.
Program 12: Code Enforcement and Neighborhood Preservation
The Code Enforcement and Neighborhood Preservation program implements a
comprehensive approach to neighborhood improvement in ten targeted Neighborhood
Preservation Areas. Development Services Department inspectors respond to complaints
related to substandard housing, property maintenance, overgrown vegetation, trash
and debris, illegal conversions, improper occupancy and other nuisance and zoning
                                                  82                                   January 2014

complaints. In the past, the City has allocated CDBG funds to sponsor periodic
neighborhood clean-up and paint days. As funding permits, the City will consider
sponsoring similar neighborhood preservation and revitalization events during the
planning period. Code enforcement staff will also continue to inform eligible owners
about the City’s rehabilitation program (see Program 11).
    Responsible Agency:       City of Lake Forest Development Services Department
    Financing:                CDBG and Department budget
    2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to implement the applicable sections of the Lake
                              Forest Municipal Code, including the California Building Code.
    Timeframe:                Ongoing implementation and annual            monitoring     and
                              reporting throughout the planning period.
PROVIDE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS
Home ownership in Orange County is increasingly unaffordable to lower and moderate
income residents. Due to the high cost of housing in Lake Forest, first-time home buyer
programs are cost-prohibitive for the City without a County or other complimentary
program.
Program 13: Homebuyer Assistance Programs
A few resources are available to Lake Forest residents. The Mortgage Credit Certificate
(MCC) Program, administered by the County of Orange, enables lower and moderate
income first-time homebuyers to receive a federal income tax credit of up to 15% of the
annual mortgage interest paid. The MCC reduces federal income tax, increases take-
home pay, and increases the qualifying loan amount for homebuyers. Program
assistance is available only to income-eligible persons and families who have not owned
a home in the last three years. The property must be a single-family detached home,
condominium, or townhouse.
The Southern California Housing Finance Agency (SCHFA) raises funds for mortgage
financing through the sale of tax-exempt revenue bonds. The City cooperates with
lenders and the County in advertising the availability of the SCHFA program.
    Responsible Agency:       County of Orange; City of Lake Forest Housing Authority
    Financing:                Federal tax credits; mortgage revenue bonds
    2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to promote the MCC and SCHFA programs by
                              notifying eligible applicants to County programs and
                              providing information on the City’s website with the goal of
                              assisting five households to achieve home ownership annually
                              during the planning period.
    Timeframe:                Ongoing implementation and annual            monitoring     and
                              reporting throughout the planning period.

EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
Promoting equal housing opportunities for all persons is an important City goal. The
following program is intended to help ensure Lake Forest residents have equal
opportunity to obtain and maintain decent and safe housing regardless of race, religion,
sex, family size, marital status, sexual orientation, ancestry, national origin, color, age,
physical or mental disability.
Program 14: Fair Housing Services
Lake Forest currently contracts with the Orange County Fair Housing Council (OCFHC) for
the provision of fair housing services. Services offered include counseling and information
on potential discrimination and landlord/tenant problems, special assistance for ethnic
minority and single-headed households (which includes escort services to locate
adequate housing), bilingual housing literature and video-tape presentations, day-care
services, and housing assistance counseling.
The City monitors and attempts to minimize discriminatory housing practices with the
assistance of the OCFHC that is annually funded by the City’s CDBG. Fair Housing
actively counsels residents on landlord/tenant issues to help minimize landlord and
housing acquisition policies that utilize discriminatory practices. In addition to providing
educational workshops to our residents, the organization advocates fair housing rights on
behalf of residents.

                       Evaluation of the Prior Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review of the housing goals, policies, and programs of
the previous housing element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period, beginning July 1, 2008 through
December 31, 2012. This analysis also includes an assessment of the appropriateness of
goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this evaluation have been instrumental in
determining the City’s 2013-2021 Housing Action Plan (Section V).

                             Public Participation Summary
Section 65583(c)(8) of the Government Code requires that local governments make “a
diligent effort…to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element." Public participation played an
important role in the formulation and refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies
and in the development of a Land Use Plan which determines the extent and density of
future residential development in the community.
City residents had several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment
on the Lake Forest Housing Element. Two Study Sessions were held before the Planning
Commission; the first ocurred prior to completion of the draft Housing Element and the
second occurred to introduce the public review draft Housing Element to the public prior
to transmittal of the document to the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD).          Meeting notices were posted on the City’s website, and
notification was published in the local newspaper in advance of the meetings. Copies of
the draft Element were made available for review at City Hall and were posted on the
City website, and notices were sent directly to agencies that serve the City’s special
needs populations and to others who requested to receive such notification. These
service providers and interested parties included organizations that represent the housing
interest groups. Table B-1 provides a summary of public comments while Table B-2
includes the public notification distribution list.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update.

ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING AFFORDABILITY
Although the “default density”19 for Lake Forest is 30 units per acre, the City’s analysis of
local affordability factors and development trends determined that affordable housing
can be produced in Lake Forest at densities of 25 units per acre or less. The following
factors (or a combination of these factors) demonstrate that the development
community can produce affordable housing at less than 30 units per acre.
Project Examples
Table C-4 lists many affordable housing projects in Orange County and north San Diego
County that have been approved or constructed at less than 25 du/ac. Affordable
apartment projects approved or built in recent years include, Ability First Apartments
(12.0 du/ac), Avocado Court (16.2 du/ac), Brighton Place (18.9 du/ac), Bonterra
Apartment Homes (19.0 du/ac), Parkview Apartments (20.7 du/ac), The Arbor at
Woodbury (22.0 du/ac), Westlake Village (22.6 du/ac), and Springbrook Grove (24.9
du/ac). Based on these numerous examples in the region, development of affordable
housing in Lake Forest at less than 25 du/ac is feasible. Specifically, the City contacted
neighboring jurisdictions that are within 25 miles from Lake Forest to share project
experience. These communities are located within the same housing market with similar
development patterns. Responses from these jurisdictions conclude similar experience
that affordable housing at a density below 25 units per acre is preferred due to the
construction type and associated costs.

Local Policies and Programs
The 2013-2021 Housing Element includes policies and programs that are intended to
facilitate and encourage the development of new affordable housing in the City of Lake
Forest. The following policies and program can facilitate the construction of affordable
housing at 25 units per acre or less:
           Policy 1.2:           Facilitate the development of affordable housing by offering
                                 development incentives on a case-by-case basis.
           Policy 1.4:           Encourage the development of residential units that are designed
                                 and marketed to meet the needs of extremely low income
                                 households and special groups, such as the elderly, persons with
                                 disabilities (including developmental disabilities), and those in need
                                 of temporary shelter.
           Policy 1.6:           Remove or reduce governmental constraints on affordable housing
                                 development, while maintaining compatibility with surrounding
                                 development.
           Policy 1.8:           Encourage residential developments to incorporate a minimum of
                                 15% affordable units, including units affordable to extremely low
                                 income households.
Program 3: Facilitate Affordable Housing Production
Affordable housing developments face a number of hurdles, including financing,
development codes and standards, and in some cases, public opposition. Dissolution of
the City’s Redevelopment Agency by the State in 2012 eliminated the Low and
Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly the City’s primary mechanism for
providing direct funding support of affordable housing development. Continuing
reductions in federal funding of HUD programs (e.g., CDBG) will constrain the City’s ability
to offer committed funding assistance to future affordable housing even further. The City
can encourage and facilitate affordable housing through financial assistance, removal
                                                                           C-4                                                         January 2014

of regulatory constraints, and administrative support. With limited funding, the City will
rely on the following actions to encourage affordable housing production during the
planning period:
           Affordable Housing Implementation Plans (AHIPs):                 Each of the New
            Neighborhoods land owners / developers has entered into a development
            agreement (DA) with the City. The DAs include an Affordable Housing
            Implementation Plan (AHIP) to facilitate the production of affordable units in
            conjunction with the development of the OSA projects. The City will monitor
            the development of the New Neighborhoods projects and include in the
            annual Housing Element Progress Report to HCD the status of compliance with
            the AHIPs and the progress toward development of affordable units.
           Collaborate with Affordable Housing Developers:                  Affordable housing
            developers work to develop, conserve and promote rental and ownership
            affordable housing. Particularly in relation to senior housing, the affordable
            housing developer is often, but not always, a local organization interested in
            developing affordable housing. The affordable housing developer is often
            involved with what is called "assisted housing", where some type of
            government assistance (such as Section 8 or Tax Credits) is provided to the
            individual household to keep rents affordable.              An affordable housing
            developer can help meet the City’s goal of incorporating a minimum of 15%
            affordable units within new residential developments by implementing or
            assisting with the implementation of programs described in this Element. The
            City will continue to collaborate with affordable housing developers to identify
            potential sites, write letters of support to help secure governmental and
            private-sector funding, and offer technical assistance related to the
            application of State density bonus provisions.
           Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
            developers on a case-by-case basis to provide State-mandated regulatory
            concessions and incentives to assist with the development of affordable and
            senior housing. In a relatively small city like Lake Forest, this is the most effective
            method of assisting developers, as each individual project can be analyzed to
            determine which concessions and incentives would be the most beneficial to
            the project’s feasibility. State-mandated regulatory concessions and incentives
            could include, but are not limited to, density bonuses, parking reductions, fee
            reductions or deferral, expedited permit processing, and modified or waived
            development standards. Any requested concessions or incentives would be
            evaluated on a case-by-case basis while simultaneously working to ensure the
            project is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

Local Funding Sources
The disposition or lease of Housing Authority real property assets and collection of in-lieu
fees can provide funding to mitigate development costs and facilitate the provision of
affordable housing at less than 25 units per acre.
The California Department of Finance allowed the City’s Housing Authority to retain all of
the real property assets that the City’s former Redevelopment Agency had transferred to
the Housing Authority.         These assets include transitional housing units, a four-unit
apartment complex occupied by lower income households, and two vacant lots with
approximately 2.9 acres of land area. The City is currently exploring options for retention
and/or disposition of these assets. Options under consideration include the lease or sale
of the vacant properties. Revenue generated from the lease or sale of the properties at
market rate prices could be used to off-set the cost of developing affordable housing.
Alternatively, the larger of the two properties (2.67 acres) could be offered at below-
market sale or lease in exchange for affordability covenants on subsequent residential
development.
The City’s Housing Authority also collects affordable housing in-lieu fees in accordance
with development agreements for three of the five New Neighborhoods. The fees are
paid at the time of building permit issuance in-lieu of constructing affordable as part of
their projects. The fee, which is currently $13,177 per unit, and escalates annually
following the publication of the Consumer Price Index. The City’s Housing Authority has
collected approximately $1.2 million to date and anticipates collecting another $1.15
million upon issuance of 85 building permits in The Pinnacle at Serrano Highlands. The
total estimated $2.35 million dollars will be available during the planning period to
provide gap financing for affordable housing (e.g., new construction,
acquisition/rehabilitation, etc.) on covenanted units.
Construction Costs
City staff and the City’s Housing Element consultant, Veronica Tam and Associates, Inc.,
interviewed several housing developers with significant development history in southern
California, including Orange County. Developers have noted that achieving 30 units per
acre often requires four-story construction, underground/pedestal parking, or other
design features that can result in higher per-unit costs of development when compared
to two- or three-story garden style apartments constructed at 18 to 25 units per acre. A
higher per-unit construction cost typically translates into a higher per-unit subsidy
requirement to ensure affordability.
Affordable Housing Incentives
As required by Government Code Section 65915, the City’s Zoning Code offers density
bonuses and incentives/concessions for the development of affordable housing as
required by the State. The City’s Zoning Code follows State density bonus law by
allowing density bonus ranging from 20% to 35% depending on the level of affordability
of the project and overall percentage of affordable units. Additionally, the Zoning Code
includes State-mandated regulatory concessions and incentives which include, but are

not limited to, parking reductions, fee reductions or deferral, expedited permit
processing, and modified or waived development standards, which may reduce
construction costs by avoiding a need for four-stories, underground/pedestal structured
parking, or other design features that raise the per-unit cost of construction.
Correlation between Density and Affordability
In 2012, the County of San Diego commissioned Keyser Marston Associates, Inc. (KMA) to
assess the feasibility of developing affordable housing at densities less than 30 units per
acre. Although prepared for a different county, some of the findings and conclusions
apply to affordable housing development in general. Furthermore, some of the data
from northern San Diego County are more closely applicable to Lake Forest because of
similarities in population density, demographics, land values, and real estate market
conditions.
The following KMA findings support the conclusion that affordable housing can be
provided in Lake Forest at less than 25 units per acre:
       Affordable housing for low income households can be accommodated on land
        designated between 20 and 23 units per acre.
       Almost all affordable housing developed in San Diego County between 2009 and
        2012 has occurred at less than 30 units per acre; some as low as 15 units per acre.
       Per-unit financing gaps were lowest for affordable housing development at a
        density of 24 units per acre for garden-style apartments.
       Per-unit financing gaps were deemed “least feasible” for stacked flats at 30 units
        per acre.

various reasons, many parcels in the
community have not been developed to their
maximum density or intensity and, in the
future, maximum development as described in
this Element can be expected to occur only on
a limited number of parcels. 11
The overall future development in Lake Forest
is anticipated to occur at the expected level of
density or intensity indicated in Table LU-2.
Development at an intensity or density
between the expected and maximum levels can
occur only where projects offer exceptional
design quality, important public amenities or
benefits, or other factors that promote
important goals and policies of the General
Plan. For the residential land use designations,
projects are expected to build to a density at
least as high as the lowest density allowed by
their respective designations.

development capacity of the Land Use Plan.
The degree to which the estimated capacity
exceeds projected population is referred to as
“overage.” Some overage is desirable to make
allowance for inevitable small pockets of
undevelopable land, to allow for difficulty in
recognizing development trends in completely
vacant areas, to allow for unforeseen need for
public utilities, and to recognize that some
owners will maintain their land in an
undeveloped state beyond the time span of the
Plan. The Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) has recommended that
Plan capacity not exceed approximately 1.20 to
1.25 times the projected population. The
measurement of capacity is accomplished by
dividing the difference between maximum
population capacity of the Plan by the
projected population. For Lake Forest, the
projected population per the Plan is
approximately 97,261 and the projected
population in 2020 per OCP 2006 is
approximately 79,863 resulting in a capacity of

REVITALIZATION                 OF       OLDER
AREAS
Revitalization and rehabilitation of older
development in the community can
substantially improve the overall quality of life
in Lake Forest. Buildings, landscaping, and
public facilities can be improved physically
through rehabilitation efforts designed to
breathe new life into areas that may otherwise
decline over time.
Enforcement of City ordinances regulating
building, zoning, health and safety, as well as
community programs aimed at removal and
prevention of graffiti will have very positive
effects. The use of Community Development
Block Grant Funds for commercial and
residential rehabilitation also provides a sound
approach for revitalization.
For larger distinct areas that would benefit
from revitalization and focused study of
improvement needs, state law provides a
planning approach known as the Specific Plan
that can be used to promote positive changes
over time. The Specific Plan can be prepared
for such Special Study Areas as a cooperative
effort by the City and interested property
owners to plan for improvements and changes
within an area to achieve both economic and
other land use planning objectives. Such areas
do not have to be comprehensively identified
in the General Plan, but one such area that is
appropriate for a Specific Plan is the El Toro

RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management Ordinance (Measure M)
Orange County voters approved Measure M in
 1990 to allocate additional funds to provide
needed transportation facilities in Orange
County. Measure M specifically authorizes a
half-cent retail sales tax increase for a period
of 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The
monies received from Measure M are returned
to local jurisdictions for use on local and
regional transportation improvements and
maintenance projects. The tax is estimated to      1. Adoption of a Growth Management

 COORDINATION AND COOPERATION
 Lake Forest is one of 33 cities in Orange

 opportunities facing the community can only
 be resolved through mutually cooperative
 efforts.' Planning for solid waste disposal
 and recycling, air quality improvement, and
 transportation are a few examples of issues
 that lend themselves to cooperative solutions.
 GOAL 9.0: Effective coordination and
 cooperation with other public agencies to
 address regional issues and opportunities.
 Policy 9.1: Participate with other public
 agencies in cooperative efforts to address
 important regional issues.
 Policy 9.2: Monitor major new developments
proposed in adjacent communities to ensure
that impacts on Lake Forest are mitigated.

To ensure sufficient recreational opportunities,
the City has established a parkland standard of
five acres per 1,000 residents. The standard is
useful in determining existing parkland
deficiencies and predicting the demand from
future population growth. Table RR-4
summarizes the parkland requirements for the
population from development of planned land
uses (as established in the Land Use Element).
Based on the parkland standard and existing

Noise Ordinance
The City Noise Ordinance is designed to
protect people from non-transportation noise
sources such as music, construction activity,
machinery and pumps, and air conditioners.
Enforcement of the ordinance ensures that
adjacent properties are not exposed to
excessive noise from stationary sources.
Enforcing the Noise Ordinance includes
requiring proposed development projects to
show compliance with the ordinance, and
requiring construction activity to comply with
established work schedule limits. The Noise
Ordinance does not apply to railroad
operation, maintenance and construction
activities occurring with the OCTA right-of-
way or the permitted hours for such activities.
The ordinance will be reviewed periodically
for adequacy and amended as needed to
address community needs and development
patterns.
