1 INTRODUCTION
  The General Plan provides a vision for the future and establishes a
  framework for how Tracy should grow and change over the next two
  decades. While embracing change, this General Plan establishes goals,
  objectives, policies and actions that empower the City and community
  to guide this change in a desired direction.
  A. Vision Statement
  Through the year 2025, the City of Tracy will continue to enhance its
  place as a great community in which to live, work and play. Drawing
  on its small town character, the City will grow in a manner that pro-
  vides a high quality of life for all current and future residents and em-
  ployees. In the coming years, Tracy will:
  1. Balance the development of new retail and job creating commer-
      cial, office and industrial development with the development of
      new housing so that residents have the opportunity to work in
      Tracy.
  2. Continue to provide a healthy setting for existing businesses while
      actively facilitating the establishment of new businesses, particu-
      larly those that reflect community aspirations.
  3. Preserve its “hometown feel” by creating residential neighbor-
      hoods with a sense of place and that are diverse, attractive, safe,
      walkable and affordable and by preserving significant historic and
      cultural resources.
  4. Meet the transportation challenges of the future, so that people can
      travel safely and conveniently on foot or by car, air, bicycle, and
      transit.
                                                                         1-1

5. Ensure that development and redevelopment adhere to basic prin-
      ciples of high quality urban design.
6. Strengthen its Downtown and develop the cultural, retail and civic
      amenities of a vibrant city, without losing the spirit of a small
      town.
7. Protect its unique identity through the preservation of agricultural
      lands and the creation of new park and open space lands.
8. Protect public health, safety and the environment by taking steps
      to reduce noise and air pollution, conserve water and energy, and
      prepare for natural and man-made disasters.
9. Provide beautiful parks, exciting cultural and recreational ameni-
      ties, and civic institutions that inspire community pride.
10. Encourage high quality schools.
11. Enhance the cultural environment in the City by promoting the
      arts and cultural activities.
12. Welcome people from all backgrounds, ages, income levels and
      physical capabilities and invite them to put down roots and stay
      awhile.
The City will achieve its vision through bold civic leadership, citizen
participation and assistance, and responsive, accountable government.
B. Purpose of this General Plan
The City of Tracy’s General Plan is the principal policy and planning
document for guiding future conservation, enhancement and devel-
opment in the City. It represents the basic policy direction of the
Tracy City Council on basic community values, ideals and aspirations

                                                       I N T R O D U C T I O N
to govern a shared environment through 2025. The General Plan ad-
dresses all aspects of development including land use, transportation,
housing, economic development, public facilities and infrastructure
and open spaces, among other topics.
California Government Code Section 65300 requires that the General
Plan must be comprehensive, internally consistent and long-term. Al-
though required to address the issues specified in State law, the Gen-
eral Plan may be organized in a way that best suits the City. The plan
must be clearly written, available to all those concerned with the com-
munity's development and easy to administer.
The City of Tracy General Plan meets these requirements. The Plan
articulates a vision for the city’s long-term physical form and devel-
opment. It also brings a deliberate overall direction to the day-to-day
decisions of the City Council, its commissions and City staff. In par-
ticular, the General Plan serves six related purposes:
1. Policy Determination. The General Plan enables the City Council
    to define a set of policies that govern the future physical develop-
    ment of the community and determine a general physical design
    showing how the policies will be implemented.
2. Policy Effectuation. The General Plan provides a framework for
    the City Council to compare and evaluate specific projects.
3. Communication. The General Plan provides a forum for the City
    Council to communicate its vision for the future of the City to
    citizens and key stakeholders.
4. Conveyance of Advice. The General Plan provides a coherent,
    unified structure for the Planning Commission to advise the City
    Council on development issues, and to allow the City to provide
    advice and recommendations to County and State government.
                                                                            1-3

5. Education. The document, and the process of creating and revis-
      ing it, provides a forum for the City Council to educate them-
      selves and others on the problems and opportunities of the City.
6. Action Plan. The General Plan includes specific actions that the
      City will take in order to meet its planning goals. These actions
      constitute a work program for the Planning Commission and City
      staff over the life of the General Plan.
In order to be used in the ways described above, the General Plan
must contain the following characteristics and information:
   ♦ Define a realistic vision of what the City intends to be in the long-
      term.
   ♦ Express the policy direction of the City in regard to the physical,
      social, economic, cultural and environmental character of the City.
   ♦ Serve as a comprehensive guide for making decisions about land
      use, community character, economic development, circulation,
      open space, the environment, and public health and safety.
   ♦ Contain a general level of information to allow for flexibility of
      future conditions and ideas. As such, the General Plan should be
      designed to allow amendment in the future.
   ♦ Chart the course of coordinated development and conservation
      that will preserve the character and heritage of Tracy.
   ♦ Serve as the City’s “constitution” for land use and community de-
      velopment. That is, it is to provide the legal foundation for all
      zoning, subdivision and public facilities ordinances, decisions and
      projects—all of which must be consistent with the General Plan.
   ♦ Be in a clear and easy to understand form that encourages public
      debate and understanding.

C. Tracy Today
Tracy began as an agricultural community centered on several rail
lines, and eventually became the San Joaquin Valley headquarters for
the Central Pacific Railroad. The City was incorporated in 1910 and
grew rapidly after the first irrigation district was established in 1915.
Towards the latter part of the twentieth century, the City transitioned
into a primarily residential community, as more people arrived from
the Bay Area seeking affordable housing, a small-town feel, and a res-
pite from the highly-urbanized San Francisco region.
Between 1990 and 2004, the population of Tracy increased from 33,500
to 74,070 residents. This growth has brought proportionally more
families to Tracy, increased diversity and increased percentages of
home ownership and household size. From 1990 to 2000, Tracy be-
came more racially and ethnically diverse, as the percentage of Cauca-
sians dropped from 68 to 56 percent and that of African Americans,
Asian or Pacific Islanders and Hispanics each increased by 3 to 5 per-
cent.
During this period of growth, the percentage of owner-occupied hous-
ing increased from 60 percent to 72 percent and the average household
size increased from 3.0 to 3.29 people. This trend has been attributed
in part to the swell of families with children and the shift in racial and
ethnic composition, since Asian and Hispanic households are typically
30 percent larger than white households. Between 1990 and 2000, the
median household income also increased in real terms from $52,993 to
$62,794 and the City became proportionally more educated as the per-
centage of the population with college and graduate degrees increased
from 20 percent to 27 percent.
                                                                            1-5
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
I N T R O D U C T I O N
As the population has grown and diversified so too has the economy,
aided in part by numerous companies that have established distribu-
tion facilities in Tracy to take advantage of inexpensive land and prox-
imity to three major freeways. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of
jobs in Tracy increased from 11,112 to 29,078. There is also a greater
diversity of job types in the City, with over 8,000 jobs in each of the
professional services and retail sectors and over 4,000 jobs in the manu-
facturing sector.
Over the next 20 years, from 2005 until 2025, similar trends are likely
to continue. Tracy’s residential population will continue to grow, al-
beit not as rapidly as in the past, due to the City’s Growth Manage-
ment Ordinance. It is also likely that the City will continue to diver-
sify and expand its economic base due to its proximity to the San
Francisco Bay area and Sacramento and major north-south interstate
highways as well as the availability of land. This General Plan is de-
signed to guide this growth in a way that benefits both existing and
future residents and businesses.
D. The City and Its Planning Area
Tracy is located in San Joaquin County, east of the Coastal Range that
separates California’s Central Valley from the San Francisco Bay Area.
The City lies 68 miles south of Sacramento and 60 miles east of San
Francisco. Interstate 205 (I-205) runs through the northern-most part
of the City and connects I-580 to I-5, a major north-south interstate
corridor east of Tracy. Figure 1-1 shows Tracy’s regional location.
The existing incorporated area of the City of Tracy is approximately
22 square miles.

The State of California encourages cities to look beyond their borders
when preparing a General Plan. For this reason, the General Plan as-
sesses two delineated areas known as the Sphere of Influence (SOI) and
the Planning Area, both of which are larger than the City limits. Fig-
ure 1-2 depicts the boundaries for each area.
The SOI is the area outside of the City limits that the City expects to
annex and urbanize in the future. It is the expected physical limit of
the City based on the most current information. During the General
Plan update process and in response to Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCo) policies established in 2007, revisions to the
SOI were made to more accurately reflect locations where the City
may grow in the future and locations where no urban growth is ex-
pected. The SOI is approximately 42 square miles and is 20 square
miles larger than the City limits, which is approximately 22 square
miles as of 2005; it is approximately 7 square miles smaller than the
LAFCo approved 1994 SOI. As in many communities, the SOI can
accommodate more growth than is expected during the planning hori-
zon of the General Plan. The modifications to the SOI are described
below.
   ♦ Holly Sugar. In 2003, the City purchased the Holly Sugar prop-
      erty, consisting of approximately 1,200 acres, surrounding the for-
      mer sugar beet processing plant. Whereas only a portion of this
      property was previously in the SOI, the entirety is now included
      in the SOI. Approximately 300 acres are designated as Park. The
      other approximately 900 acres are designated as Agriculture with
      provisions to allow for the land application of treated effluent, ef-
      fluent cooling, and public facilities uses. The portion of the Holly
      Sugar property being added to the SOI in this General Plan con-
      sists of approximately 400 acres.

   ♦ Cordes Ranch. This area, which has been added to the SOI,
      largely comprises the area referred to as Urban Reserve 6 and is
      approximately 1,730 acres in size.
   ♦ Northeast Expansion. The General Plan includes an expansion of
      the SOI in the northeast corner of the SOI, east of MacArthur
      Drive and north of I-205. This area is designated as Industrial and
      represents an increase of approximately 140 acres.
   ♦ North of Larch Clover. An expansion of approximately 50 acres is
      included to rectify the SOI line which did not follow property
      boundaries in the previous SOI. The area added to the SOI is des-
      ignated as Residential Very Low and will help to create a transi-
      tion between the urbanized area of Tracy and rural county land.
   ♦ Tracy Hills Open Space. A small expansion of approximately 43
      acres is proposed in an area south of the Tracy Hills Specific Plan
      that is designated as Open Space.
   ♦ Area to the West of City Limits. A contraction area of approxi-
      mately 2,350 acres of land is located west of Corral Hollow Road,
      between Eleventh Street and Linne Road. These lands were previ-
      ously designated in the 1993 General Plan as Residential Very
      Low, Residential Low, Residential Medium, Urban Center/Mixed
      Use, Public, Industrial and Park.
      This area to the west of city limits includes a 575-acre area south of
      the Patterson Pass Business Park, which was removed because of
      its location between I-580, the Delta Mendota Canal and the Cali-
      fornia Aqueduct. As a result, it is an isolated area that would
      likely be difficult and expensive to provide with urban services.
   ♦ Area to the Northwest of City Limits. A contraction of approxi-
      mately 270 acres is located south of Middle Road, between San
      Jose Road and Naglee Road. The area is located to the west of the

    I-205 Regional Commercial area and was designated in the 1993
    General Plan as Residential Low.
  ♦ Area to the Northeast of City Limits. A contraction of approxi-
    mately 1,650 acres of land is located south of I-205 and to the east
    of Chrisman Road, which was designated in the 1993 General Plan
    as Agriculture, Residential Very Low, Residential Low, Residential
    Medium, Commercial and Industrial. This area includes the area
    commonly known as “Banta” that is situated around an existing
    agricultural town at the intersection of Grant Line Road and the
    Union Pacific Railroad. In addition, this contraction area includes
    approximately 3.5 acres of land to the east of Chrisman Road and
    south of Brichetto Road that was designated in the 1993 General
    Plan as Commercial.
  ♦ Area to the Southeast of City Limits. This contraction area of ap-
    proximately 2,500 acres was designated in the 1993 General Plan as
    Aggregate, Residential Very Low, Commercial, Public Industrial
    and Open Space. These lands are located to the south of Schulte
    Road and to the north of I-580, between Corral Hollow Road and
    Banta Road. This area includes land south of the Tracy Hills Spe-
    cific Plan area and west of I-580 that contains a 44-acre former
    landfill; the remaining area consists of land that is vacant or in ag-
    ricultural use.
Any changes to the SOI are subject to approval by LAFCo.
State law also allows cities to identify a Planning Area. This is an area
outside of city boundaries and generally outside the SOI that bears a
relation to the City’s planning and policy direction. While Tracy does
not have any regulatory authority within the Planning Area outside of
the SOI, the Planning Area is included in the General Plan as a signal
                                                                          1-11

to San Joaquin County and to other nearby local and regional authori-
ties that Tracy recognizes that planning and development within this
area has an impact on the future of the City. The community of
Mountain House lies just within the City’s Planning Area to the
northwest. Immediately north and east of the City’s Planning Area
are the City of Lathrop and the Primary Zone of the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta.
Under State law, the City is invited to comment on development
within the Planning Area that is subject to review by the County.
The portion of the Tracy Planning Area outside of the SOI will re-
main under the jurisdiction of San Joaquin County. The Planning
Area contains approximately 114 square miles and is 92 square miles
larger than the City limits and 72 square miles larger than the pro-
posed SOI.
E. The General Plan Update Process
Prior to the initiation of the General Plan update, the Tracy Tomor-
row 2000 project was initiated by the Tracy City Council to establish
citizen task forces to evaluate, make recommendations and propose
solutions to the challenges presented by growth. The first step in the
process was a community-wide survey that resulted in the identifica-
tion of topics of significant interest. These topics were: a) land
use/agriculture/open space, b) economic development, c) transporta-
tion, d) education, and e) community enrichment/public safety. Five
task forces were formed in September of 2000 that included approxi-
mately 100 citizens. Initial work included an educational process,
community forums, and information gathering. A second, more spe-
cific community survey provided a more detailed picture of the issues.

Preliminary solutions to the issues were presented to the public in a
series of five forums in April of 2001. Public input and feedback were
obtained and the final report was completed in late May of 2001. The
final report was titled Tracy Tomorrow 2000: Citizens Shaping the Fu-
ture. A high percentage of the recommendations were for specific
modifications to the 1993 General Plan. As a result of the hard work
of many dedicated citizens during the Tracy 2000 process and the
many insightful recommendations that ensued, the City Council de-
cided to move forward with a comprehensive update of the City’s
General Plan.
One recommendation arising from the Tracy Tomorrow 2000 Pro-
gram was the desire to have an ongoing process. The intent was to
create a process managed by a citizen group that will advocate consen-
sus building in the community. The Tracy Tomorrow and Beyond
Steering Committee was established to manage the processes by which
the City Council, community and City staff come together to resolve
issues facing Tracy.
The Tracy Tomorrow and Beyond Committee played a significant
role in the General Plan update process. The Committee attended the
General Plan workshops, has provided input based on the work to the
Tracy Tomorrow Committees and acted as a “sounding board” for
various concepts, policies, and directions. Several issues were discussed
in detail at the regularly scheduled Tracy Tomorrow and Beyond
meetings.
The General Plan Update process began in 2002. At that time the
consultant team conducted an assessment of existing conditions in the
City of Tracy and its environs on five major topic areas to help iden-
tify key issues:
                                                                          1-13

   ♦ Land Use, Population and Housing
   ♦ Environmental Conditions
   ♦ Transportation and Circulation
   ♦ Infrastructure and Services
   ♦ Assessment of the 1993 General Plan, which was the City’s Gen-
      eral Plan prior to adoption of this document.
To complete these assessments, the consultant team conducted field
observations, interviews, and database and archival research. Planning
documents, government laws and regulations, and City codes and or-
dinances were also reviewed.
Concurrently, City staff and the consultant team worked closely with
the City Council and Planning Commission to determine the scope
and direction on policy issues to be addressed in the General Plan.
Twenty City Council/Planning Commission workshops were held on
the topics listed below. Members of the public were invited to com-
ment at the end of each of the workshops.
   ♦ General Plan Update Process, Urban Design Principles,
      Vision Development (April 22, 2003)
   ♦ Urban Design and Transportation (May 12, 2003)
   ♦ Housing Element (May 20, May 25 and October 6, 2003 and May
      10, 2004)
   ♦ Community Character (June 30 and November 3, 2003)
   ♦ Land Use Element (December 1, 2003)
   ♦ Land Use Designations (February 2 and March 1, 2004)
   ♦ Transportation and Circulation (April 5 and May 3, 2004)

In addition, three community workshops were held on the following
topics:

    tember 17, 2003)
  ♦ Land Use Designations within the City limits (January 13, 2004)
  ♦ Land Use Designations within the SOI (February 18, 2004)
The General Plan was adopted by the City Council on July 20, 2006.

cation process for an updated SOI and Municipal Services Review with
LAFCo in November 2006. In early 2007 LAFCo changed its policy
regarding SOIs which necessitated that Tracy’s proposed SOI be re-
duced to show a 30-year development horizon and a 10-year develop-
ment horizon.
                                                                        1-15

On December 12, 2007, City staff conducted a community meeting to
discuss the new LAFCo polices and to receive feedback. City staff pre-
sented the revised draft SOI at the City Council meetings held on
January 15, February 5, April 1 and June 3, 2008. In addition, a work-
shop was held with the City Council on July 15, 2008. The City
Council approved the recommended draft SOI revision with minor
modifications. The General Plan was updated to reflect the new plan-
ning boundary. At this time, the City took the opportunity to incor-
porate new State legislation regarding flooding as well as to enhance
goals, objectives, policies and actions regarding sustainability and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the City prepared
a separate Sustainability Action Plan at this time, and updated the
General Plan to account for and be consistent with the Sustainability
Action Plan.
F. Plan Contents
1. General Plan Elements
The City of Tracy General Plan is guided by the vision statement at
the beginning of this introduction. The remainder of the General Plan
is comprised of nine separate “elements” that set goals, objectives, poli-
cies and actions for a given subject. Five of these elements cover six
topics required by State law, while the remaining four elements have
been prepared by the City to meet local needs and concerns. The ele-
ments that form the General Plan Update are briefly described below:
   ♦ Land Use Element. The required Land Use Element designates all
      lands within the City for a specific use such as residential, office,
      commercial, industry, open space, recreation or public uses. The
      Land Use Element provides policy direction for each land use cate-
      gory, and also provides overall land use policies for the City.

♦ Community Character Element. The Community Character Ele-
  ment is not required by State law. However, due to the impor-
  tance of maintaining and enhancing Tracy’s hometown feel and
  the related importance of urban design for the City, this optional
  element has been included.
♦ Economic Development Element. This optional element contains
  goals, objectives, policies and actions to encourage the develop-
  ment of desired economic activities throughout the City. The in-
  formation in this element is derived from the City’s Economic
  Development Strategy prepared in 2002.
♦ Circulation Element. This required element specifies the general
  location and extent of existing major streets, level of service, tran-
  sit facilities, and bicycle and pedestrian network. As required by
  law, all facilities in the Circulation Element are correlated with the
  land uses foreseen in the Land Use Element.
♦ Open Space and Conservation Element. The Open Space Element
  and the Conservation Element are required under State law and
  are combined in this General Plan. Issues addressed include the
  preservation of open space and agricultural land, the conservation,
  development and utilization of natural resources, and the provi-
  sion of parks and recreational facilities. Open space goals for pub-
  lic health and safety are covered in the Safety Element.
♦ Public Facilities and Services Element. This optional element covers
  a wide range of topics related to the provision of public services
  and infrastructure in the City. Topics covered include law en-
  forcement, fire protection, schools, public buildings, solid waste
  and the provision of water, wastewater and stormwater infrastruc-
  ture.
                                                                         1-17

   ♦ Safety Element. State law requires the development of a Safety Ele-
      ment to protect the community from risks associated with the ef-
      fects of flooding, seismic and other geologic hazards, and wildland
      fires.
   ♦ Noise Element. This required element addresses noise in the com-
      munity and analyzes and quantifies current and projected noise
      levels from a variety of sources, such as traffic, industry, rail and
      the airport. The Noise Element includes goals, objectives, policies
      and actions to address current and foreseeable noise issues.
   ♦ Air Quality Element. This element, which is required for all juris-
      dictions in the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District, out-
      lines goals, objectives, policies and actions to mitigate the air pollu-
      tion impacts of land use, the transportation system and other ac-
      tivities that occur in the City of Tracy.
In addition, the City has prepared a Housing Element under a separate
cover. Each city and county has an obligation to contribute its part by
including a Housing Element as one of the seven mandatory elements
of the General Plan. The Housing Element provides a long-term,
comprehensive plan to address the housing needs for all economic
segments of the community. The Housing Element addresses existing
and projected housing demand and establishes goals, objectives, poli-
cies and actions to assist the City in implementing the plan in accor-
dance with other General Plan policies. It is not included with the
remainder of the General Plan because it was prepared under a sepa-
rate timeline and under detailed State criteria.
2. Organization of the Elements
Each element of this General Plan contains background information
and goals, objectives, policies and actions. Some elements also have
additional sections that are specific to them. For example, the Land

                                                       I N T R O D U C T I O N
Use Element contains a series of land use designations that guide over-
all development in the City and the Circulation Element contains in-
formation on the network and hierarchy of streets in the City.
The background information section of each element describes current
conditions in the City of Tracy relative to the subject of the element.
The goals, objectives, policies and actions provide guidance to the City
on how to accommodate growth and manage its resources over the
next 20 years. The goals, objectives, policies and actions in each ele-
ment are derived from a number of sources including: the 1993 Gen-
eral Plan, the background information collected for this update, dis-
cussions with the City Council and Planning Commission, public
workshops and meetings with property owners. In addition, many of
the recommendations from the Tracy Tomorrow 2000 final report are
brought forward into this General Plan.
Goals, objectives, policies and actions are described as follows and the
relationship between each is represented in Figure 1-3:
  ♦ A goal is a description of the general desired outcome that the City
     seeks to create through the implementation of its General Plan.
  ♦ An objective is a specific condition or end that serves as a concrete
     step toward attaining a goal. Objectives are intended to be clearly
     achievable and, when possible, measurable.
  ♦ A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making in
     working to achieve an objective. Such policies, once adopted, rep-
     resent statements of City regulation and require no further im-
     plementation. The General Plan’s policies set out the standards
     that will be used by City staff, the Planning Commission and City
     Council in their review of land development projects and in deci-
     sion-making about City actions.
                                                                          1-19

I N T R O D U C T I O N
   ♦ An action is a program, implementation measure, procedure or
      technique intended to help to achieve a specified objective.
As noted in Figure 1-3, policies and actions are at the same level; both
policies and actions are intended to implement objectives. In most
cases, objectives have both implementing policies and actions. How-
ever, it is also possible for an objective to be implemented exclusively
through either policies or actions.
FIGURE I-3 GENERAL PLAN COMPONENTS
   ♦ “Shall” means that conformance is mandatory.
   ♦ “Should” means that conformance will be strongly encouraged by
      the City and that the particular policy or action is intended to be a
      recommendation about how to meet the goals and objectives of
      the General Plan.

  ♦ “May” indicates that a policy is permissive, and that the City has
     latitude regarding whether the subject action will occur.
A land development project or City action is considered to be consis-
tent with this General Plan if it furthers the Plan's objectives and poli-
cies and does not obstruct from their attainment. Because objectives
and policies in this General Plan reflect a range of competing interests,
they must be balanced when applied to a specific land development
project or City action.
Additionally, goals, objectives and policies that address the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions or encourage sustainable practices are de-
noted with an earth symbol (à). In part, the City of Tracy is re-
sponding to the Global Warming Solutions Act (California Assembly
Bill 32), passed in August 2006, which establishes a statewide emissions
cap of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020. In general, these goals,
objectives and policies focus on ways to offset greenhouse gas emis-
sions as the city grows through urban form, growth patterns, alterna-
tive transportation modes and sustainable energy options.

2 LAND USE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the future physical
  development of the City of Tracy and to preserve, protect and en-
  hance Tracy’s current quality of life.
  As required by California Government Code Section 65302(a) and
  Public Resources Code Section 2762(a), the Land Use Element of the
  General Plan addresses the following:
     Distribution, location and extent of the uses of land for housing,
      business, industry, open space, natural resources, recreation and
      enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and
      grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities and other cate-
      gories of public and private uses of land.
     Standards of population density and building intensity for the
      land use designations.
  The Land Use Element sets forth specific goals, objectives, policies
  and actions to guide land use for the City of Tracy. The General Plan
  Land Use Map, which is also part of this element, graphically repre-
  sents the City’s vision for the future development of the City and the
  Sphere of Influence (SOI), the area that the City expects to grow into
  in the future. The Land Use Element also includes goals, objectives,
  policies and actions for the Planning Area, the areas outside of the
  City’s boundaries that bear a relation to the City’s planning but are
  under the jurisdictional control of San Joaquin County.
  The Element is divided into five sections.
     Background. Provides background information on existing land
      uses, approved plans and Planned Unit Developments (PUDs),
      and other related City policies and plans.
                                                                      2-1

   General Plan Land Use Designations. Describes the characteris-
     tics and intensity of each land use designation and a map of the
     application of these designations in the City of Tracy.
   Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions. Provides guidance to
     the City related to land use decisions.
   Areas of Special Consideration. Provides policy guidance for ar-
     eas of the City that are expected to change over the General Plan
     timeframe.
   Urban Reserves. Describes policy guidance for the areas outside
     the City limits with the Urban Reserve land use designation.
A. Background
1. Existing Land Uses
This section provides qualitative and quantitative descriptions of ex-
isting land use in the City of Tracy. Data on existing land use is
based on information collected by the San Joaquin County Assessor
and verified by the City of Tracy. Figure 2-1 shows a map of the ex-
isting land uses in the City as of the end of 2003 and Table 2-1 lists
the acreage in each category.
   Residential — Single-Family Dwelling unit. This classification
     describes parcels that contain one residential unit with possible
     related structures such as secondary residential units, a garage or
     shed. Ninety-one percent of residential units within Tracy’s City
     limits and the SOI are single-family dwellings. There are a total
     of approximately 3,588 acres in this category, 3,218 in the City
     limits and 371 in the rest of the SOI.

2. Growth Management Ordinance
The City of Tracy adopted a residential Growth Management Ordi-
nance (GMO) in 1987, which was amended in 2000 by the voter-
initiated Measure A. In general terms, the goal of the GMO is to
achieve a steady and orderly growth rate that allows for the adequate
provision of services and community facilities, and includes a balance
of housing opportunities. Under the GMO, builders must obtain a
Residential Growth Allotment (RGA) in order to secure a residential
building permit. The GMO limits the number of RGAs and building
permits to an average of 600 housing units per year for market rate
housing, with a maximum of 750 units in any single year. There are
exceptions for affordable housing.1
Implementation of the GMO to meet the goals and policies of the
General Plan, including concentrated growth, infill development, and
          1
            Through implementation of this General Plan and the GMO, Tracy is
projected to have a population of approximately 109,000 people in the year 2025.
This number is based on an estimate of the number of residential units allowed per
year multiplied by the number of years multiplied by the number of people per resi-
dential unit (units x years x people per unit), and adding that to the population of
Tracy in 2000, which was approximately 57,000 people, according to the US Census.
            Between the years 2000 and 2025, the number of residential units allowed
under the City’s Growth Management Ordinance is 15,000 units (600 per year times
25 years). Exceptions to allow for additional affordable housing is included. The
General Plan Housing Element has a target of 1,200 affordable units during this same
time period, bringing the total number of units to 16,200, resulting in an additional
52,000 people (using a multiplier of 3.21 persons per household), or a total popula-
tion of 109,000 in the year 2025.
                                                                                  2-9

affordable housing as high priorities, is through the Growth Man-
agement Ordinance Guidelines, which are adopted by resolution of
the City Council. The GMO Guidelines include a map that estab-
lishes an “RGA Eligibility Area” showing the area where property
owners are eligible to apply for RGAs. The Guidelines also include
specific qualitative and quantitative criteria for the allocation of
RGAs with said criteria periodically updated as provided by the reso-
lution.
3. Specific Plans and Large Planned Unit Developments
Numerous Specific Plans and large-scale PUDs have been adopted
within the Tracy City limits and SOI. Descriptions of each plan, its
geographic area and adopted uses are outlined below:
    Tracy Residential Areas Specific Plan. Created in 1987, the Plan
      guides the development of 1,480 acres within the City limit. The
      land is grouped into three planning areas or neighborhoods, two
      on the southern side of the City and one in the northwest, and is
      largely built out.
    Plan C. Formed in 1998, Plan C represents an infrastructure fi-
      nancing area comprised of approximately 1,417 acres of land.
      Plan C includes areas located in the west, south and southeast
      portions of the City. Plan C is comprised of many separate
      PUDs which are predominantly in place to guide the develop-
      ment of single-family homes with accompanying parks and
      schools. Plan C is largely built out, but still has several vacant
      parcels which are zoned for multifamily housing and commercial
      development.
    I-205 Corridor Specific Plan. The I-205 Specific Plan includes
      approximately 714 acres of land on the northwest and northeast
      sides of Tracy, adjacent to I-205. The site is split into two plan-

  ning areas and currently contains working and dormant agricul-
  tural uses, with commercial uses close to the intersection of
  Grant Line Road and I-205. The Specific Plan has designated
  835,000 square feet of shopping centers and auto plazas, 1,057,000
  square feet of general commercial/retail, 834,000 square feet of
  service commercial, 165,000 square feet of freeway commercial
  and 1,688,000 square feet of light industrial uses. There are also
  approximately 200 acres of residential development, including
  216 high density units and 733 medium and low density units.
 Northeast Industrial PUD. This PUD addresses 870 acres in the
  northeast corner of the City. Anticipated land uses include a
  mixture of manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution uses in-
  cluding rail-dependent industries and “flex-tech” light industrial.
 Industrial Areas Specific Plan (ISP). The Industrial Areas Spe-
  cific Plan covers approximately 685 acres of total land, mostly in
  two locations: the northeast quadrant of the South Tracy Boule-
  vard – Linne Road intersection, and the northeast quadrant of
  the MacArthur Drive – Eleventh Street intersection. The area is
  designated for general, light industrial, office and “flex-tech” uses.

  Park, which cater to small to medium sized companies, have al-
  ready been developed in this Specific Plan area.
 Tracy Gateway PUD. The 538-acre Tracy Gateway project is lo-
  cated at the western edge of the incorporated City boundary, and
  south of I-205 at the Eleventh Street off-ramp. The proposed de-
  velopment consists of 5.8 million square feet of office uses, com-
  mercial uses and retail uses that support the Tracy community
  and an anticipated 20,000-person business population. The pro-
  posed project also includes a multi-story hotel and a golf course.

    Tracy Hills Specific Plan. The Tracy Hills Specific Plan area, lo-
      cated on the southwest side of the City, covers 6,175 acres, ap-
      proximately 2,700 acres of which falls within the City limits and
      is planned with residential, commercial, office, industrial and rec-
      reational land uses, and approximately 3,550 acres located outside
      the City limits and within the Sphere of Influence planned as
      permanent open space for habitat conservation and managed
      grazing. Of the 2,700 acres within the City limits, proposed land
      uses include approximately 1,300 acres at a mixture of densities
      with a maximum of 5,499 residential units. Approximately 600
      acres with up to 6 million square feet of space are planned for
      commercial, office and industrial uses. Roughly half of the re-
      maining 800 acres of the Specific Plan area within the City limits
      is designated to accommodate neighborhood parks, schools, rec-
      reational uses and other open space, while the other half is de-
      voted to roads and canals.
    Ellis Specific Plan. The Ellis Specific Plan, located at the north-
      west corner of Corral Hollow and Linne Roads, consists of 321
      acres of Traditional Residential and Commercial land uses, allow-
      ing for up to 2,250 residential units and a Village Center com-
      mercial site. The proposed project also includes parks and a fam-
      ily-oriented swim center.
4. Sustainability Action Plan
The City of Tracy adopted a Sustainability Action Plan in 2011 as
part of the City’s on-going efforts to transform Tracy into a leader
for environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The Sustain-
ability Action Plan is a detailed, long-range strategy to achieve sus-
tainability in the sectors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy,
transportation and land use, solid waste, water, agriculture and open
space, biological resources, air quality, public health, and economic

lated to a variety of sustainability topics, and sets forth measures that
will assist the City of Tracy in reaching those goals.
B. General Plan Land Use Designations
The General Plan Land Use Designation Map, shown in Figure 2-2,
illustrates the allowed types of land uses throughout the City of
Tracy. Acreages of each land use designation are presented in Table
2-2. Land use designations represent the intended future use of each
parcel of land within the City limits and the SOI. Land use designa-
tions are developed to provide both a vision of the organization of
uses within the City in the future and a flexible structure to allow for
changes in economic conditions, community visions and environ-
mental conditions. In other words, designations should generally
state what the future use should be but are not intended to be so rigid
as to prohibit changes in the future.
For each land use designation, the uses allowed and the standards of
density and intensity are specified. Densities and intensities in all
cases are based on gross acres. Development density for residential
land use is reflected as the average number of dwelling units per acre
over the entire site and may include a mix of residential densities to       Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is calcu-
achieve that average. Densities permitted on individual sites will de-       lated based on the proportion of
pend on many factors, including but not limited to architectural de-         total building floor area to the
sign, the method of addressing parking needs, landscaping, street lay-       size of the building’s lot. Exam-
out and neighborhood compatibility. For non-residential uses, in-            ples 0.5 FAR and 1.0 FAR are
                                                                             illustrated above.
cluding commercial, office and industrial uses, intensity is expressed
as an average Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is calculated based on

total building floor area in proportion to the size of the building’s lot.
Specific land use designations are described below. Zoning regula-
tions are implementing tools of the General Plan Land Use Designa-
tions, and set further guidelines for the development of land, includ-
ing but not limited to permitted uses, minimum yard areas, lot area
and coverage, parking, building height, and open space.
1. Residential (VL, L, RM, RH and TR)
The five residential land use categories allow for residential uses rang-
ing from very low-density single-family homes to multi-family build-
ings of several stories. Residential land should be developed with
well-designed mix of single- and multi-family uses forming neighbor-
hoods that are oriented around a focal point, which is a public space
such as a park or school. Neighborhoods should be physically con-
nected to one another via a series of roadways, bikeways and pedes-
trian paths, and all residents should be within a short walk, bike ride
or drive of retail and other services. Commercial uses and Village
Centers, as described later in this Element, may be located at the pe-
riphery of neighborhoods and should be integrated with, rather than
separated from, residential uses.        When developing residential
neighborhoods, emphasis should be placed on high quality construc-
tion and innovative architecture that reinforces the City’s small-town
feel. All neighborhoods should be designed to provide a “sense of
place” and preserve the City’s hometown feel while offering a choice
of densities and costs. Many of the goals, objectives, policies and ac-
tions necessary to achieve this sense of place are found in the Com-
munity Character Element.
Residential land use designations may also allow for other land use
types that serve residents of the community. Examples of uses that
may be allowed include places of worship, schools, parks and recrea-
                                                                        2-17

tion facilities, fire stations, libraries, day care facilities and community
centers. The precise location of such facilities will be determined
upon the submittal of detailed plans for individual properties.
Residential land uses are divided into five designations to provide for
development of a full range of housing types.
   Residential Very Low (RVL) and Residential Low (RL). Single-
     family dwelling units are the principal type of housing stock al-
     lowed in these areas. Attached units, zero lot line and clustered
     housing are also permissible and are encouraged within the over-
     all framework of each community. These housing types can help
     to meet the City’s desire to create unique neighborhoods and en-
     hance the character of the community. Allowable densities are
     from 0.1 to 2.0 dwelling units per gross acre in the Residential
     Very Low designation and 2.1 to 5.8 units per gross acre in the
     Residential Low designation.
   Residential Medium (RM) The characteristic housing for the
     Residential Medium designation includes small lot single-family
     detached homes, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses,
     apartments and includes condominiums as an ownership type.
     Densities in the Residential Medium designation are from 5.9 to
     12 dwelling units per gross acre.
   Residential High (RH). The characteristic housing for the Resi-
     dential High designation includes triplexes, fourplexes, town-
     houses, apartments, and includes condominiums as an ownership
     type. Densities in the Residential High designation are from 12.1
     to 25 units per gross acre.
   Traditional Residential (TR). TR areas consist of a mix of resi-
     dential densities and housing types reminiscent of traditional
     neighborhoods (often seen in older urban and suburban settings),
2-18

                                            L A N D U S E E L E M E N T
ranging from single-family detached housing to attached medium
and high density housing types, sometimes adjacent to (or above)
retail, commercial or other compatible uses. TR allows a mix of a
wider range of housing types, lot sizes, and density ranges com-
pared with typical Residential Very Low (RVL), Residential Low
(RL), Residential Medium (RM), and Residential High (RH). TR
also allows the establishment of building and design criteria that
allows for a more traditional look, including items such as mod-
erate building setbacks, picket fences and sitting porches, an in-
terconnected street network, pedestrian accessibility and trail sys-
tems, and the organization of residential units around a series of
centrally-located active and passive "themed" neighborhood parks
and/or recreation uses. TR areas are intended to be used primar-
ily for residential Urban Reserves, though not exclusively, and
are encouraged to be located adjacent to Village Centers. At least
four (4) important residential criteria shall be established at the
time a property is designated to "TR" through a General Plan
Amendment so that dwelling unit and population density, design,
and neighborhood compatibility standards can be established: (1)
The maximum and minimum number of residential units allowed
in the TR area and the average number of people per unit; (2) The
density ranges allowed in terms of dwelling units per acre, and the
maximum and minimum numbers of each such residential hous-
ing type allowed in the TR area; (3) A "Design Book" to ensure
design quality, interesting and diverse architectural treatments,
and an attractive streetscape; and (4) The criteria that will be used
to establish the location/mix of residential design and housing
types in the TR area to encourage an interesting and compatible
neighborhood and to discourage the domination of a sub-area
with only one or a few residential housing types and designs.
Park and recreation uses shall be established as part of the TR
                                                                   2-19

     planning process. The re-designation of a property to the TR des-
     ignation shall be implemented only in combination with the par-
     ticular project's development-level planning process (e.g., Specific
     Plan process, or if no Specific Plan is required, through the City's
     zoning process) that addresses the residential criteria set forth
     above. In other words, a property shall not be re-designated to
     the TR designation unless and until a particular project's residen-
     tial criteria as set forth above are known and determined. Once a
     property secures a TR designation, the designation shall be
     known as “TR-[the name of the project].”
   Traditional Residential – Ellis (TR-Ellis). The Traditional Resi-
     dential – Ellis (TR-Ellis) designation applies to the majority of,
     but not all of, former Urban Reserve 10. As set forth above, the
     TR designation requires that the specific TR-Ellis designation es-
     tablish at least four residential criteria. In order for development
     of the TR-Ellis property to proceed, it is a mandatory obligation
     of this TR-Ellis designation that the City first adopt a Specific
     Plan that implements the following criteria. The first criterion
     requires a determination of the minimum and maximum number
     of residential units. The TR-Ellis designation shall include be-
     tween 1200 and 2250 total residential units, for an overall site
     density of between 4 and 7 units per gross acre. (The General
     Plan establishes an average of 3.21 persons per household, as set
     forth in the Land Use and Housing Elements.) The second crite-
     rion requires a determination of the density ranges allowed,
     measured in terms of dwelling units per acre, and the maximum
     and minimum number of units of each such residential density
     type allowed. The TR-Ellis designation shall include three resi-
     dential sub-designations (Zoning Districts): "Residential Mixed
     Low," "Residential Mixed Medium," and "Residential Mixed
     High." Between 256 and 976 residential units and approximately

122 acres shall be allowed for the Residential Mixed Low designa-
tion (2.1 – 8 units per gross acre), between 372 and 1488 residen-
tial units and approximately 93 acres shall be allowed for the
Residential Mixed Medium designation (4 – 16 units per gross
acre), and between 250 and 780 residential units and approxi-
mately 31 acres shall be allowed for the Residential Mixed High
designation (8 – 25 units per gross acre). The foregoing densities
overlap by design in order to allow for flexibility of housing
types, and to ensure a wider mix of residential types within close
proximity of each other throughout the Ellis site. Additionally,
up to 50 of the 2250 residential units shall be allowed in the adja-
cent Village Center (4 to 16 units per gross acre for approximately
7 acres). Finally, the TR-Ellis area shall include approximately 18
acres of parks. Also, there is a possibility of an additional 16 acres
(approximately) of Community Park. The Community Park can
informally accommodate active recreational programming needs
such as, but not limited to, ballfields and a multi-use soccer field,
as well as tennis, volleyball, basketball courts, and a family-
oriented swim center (“Swim Center”). The third criterion re-
quires the adoption of a "Design Book" to ensure design quality,
interesting and diverse architectural treatments, and an attractive
streetscape. The "Ellis Pattern Book," which sets forth the archi-
tectural and site design guidelines for the TR-Ellis area consistent
with the requirements set forth herein, shall be adopted by the
City Council in connection with the Council's adoption of the
TR-Ellis designation. The fourth criterion requires that the TR-
Ellis designation establish the location/mix of residential design
and housing types in the Traditional Residential area to encour-
age an interesting and compatible neighborhood and to discour-
age the domination of a sub-area with only one or a few residen-
tial housing types and designs. TR-Ellis shall consist of three
                                                                     2-21

     residential neighborhoods, each with its own distinct sense of
     place, reinforcing the traditional, hometown feel. Blocks shall be
     sized to support a mix of housing types – modest to compact sin-
     gle-family homes, townhouses, secondary residential units,
     apartments, and condominiums, all designed to accommodate a
     wide range of incomes and family needs. The TR-Ellis area will
     be constructed using traditional neighborhood design principles,
     creating a pedestrian-friendly network of streets and parks. In
     most cases, garages will be located off the street and will be ac-
     cessed by way of rear alleys. Other land uses adjacent to, and
     compatible with, the TR-Ellis area shall include, but not be lim-
     ited to, an approximately 7-acre Village Center (with up to 50 of
     the 2250 residential units and up to 60,000 square feet of commer-
     cial uses), and up to 120,000 additional square feet of commercial
     uses (the General Plan establishes a maximum FAR for commer-
     cial uses of 1.0). The Tracy Airport "outer approach zone" shall
     be limited in uses to those authorized in the San Joaquin County
     Airport Land Use Plan as amended in 1998.
     The owner of the Ellis property is willing to provide the City a
     substantial financial contribution towards the design, construc-
     tion, operation and maintenance of the Swim Center (that far ex-
     ceeds the owner's fair share responsibility and therefore what the
     City could otherwise legally require the owner to contribute to-
     wards the Swim Center) in return for certain City commitments
     that the City is not otherwise legally required to provide. For
     example, the City's Growth Management Ordinance and Guide-
     lines recognize that a process can be established through a freely-
     entered statutory development agreement whereby the City
     could provide commitments to the owner to potentially issue up
     to a set maximum amount of residential growth allocations
     (RGAs) to a project that absent that development agreement the

    City might not have to issue. The Ellis property owner and the
    City have negotiated a proposed statutory development agree-
    ment that would set forth the Ellis property owner's Swim Cen-
    ter contribution as well as the City's commitments in exchange
    for that Swim Center contribution. It shall be in the parties' sole
    and exclusive discretion as to whether to execute such an agree-
    ment.
Residential Medium and Residential High designations are most often
located near commercial uses and high activity areas or near or within
Village Center and the Downtown designations. These locations
provide the best access to goods and services. These designations are
also often located near transit amenities such as the ACE station and
the future multi-modal terminal in the Downtown. Issues of pedes-
trian orientation of buildings, direct and safe connections with nearby
uses, access to transit facilities and integration with residential
neighborhoods of different densities are critical with Residential Me-
dium and Residential High designations.
2. Commercial (C)
The Commercial designation allows for a relatively wide range of
uses but focuses primarily on retail and consumer service activities
that meet the needs of Tracy residents and employees as well as pass-
through travelers. Office uses are allowed in commercially designated
areas. Mixed-use development is also permitted in the Commercial
designation. Appropriately scaled and designed residential develop-
ment in the density ranges permitted in Residential High (RH) may
be allowed, and other residential densities may be allowed in Com-
mercial districts in Areas of Special Consideration. In addition, parks
are allowed in the Commercial designation. Regardless of configura-
tion, there should be an attempt in both locational criteria and design
                                                                        2-23

criteria to be as accessible and appealing to the pedestrian as possible
to encourage walking and biking. Commercially designated land may
have a maximum FAR of 1.0.
Specific categories of commercial activity within this designation in-
clude general commercial, regional commercial and highway com-
mercial. The specific location of each type of commercial use will be
provided in the zoning code.
General commercial uses include grocery and convenience stores, sa-
lons, professional offices, restaurant, fast-food establishments, auto
service stations, drug stores, dry cleaners, day care centers, and banks.
Adequate access, compatibility with other surrounding uses, and con-
sistent design with the community are all necessary for these uses.
They should be located in centralized areas capable of serving the
greatest number of households with the least travel distance and best
access to alternate modes of transportation and freeways.
Regional commercial uses (such as the I-205 Regional Commercial
Area), include factory outlets, discount stores, regional shopping
malls, automobile sales, office uses, medical facilities and home im-
provement centers. These uses should be located in areas with the
highest level of automobile access but should also contain a safe pe-
destrian environment.
Highway commercial uses serve the needs of the traveling motorist
and should be located in close proximity to freeway ramps. Appro-
priate uses include hotels and motels, restaurants, and motor vehicle
and gasoline service stations that provide services to the traveling
public and allow for convenient freeway access. Since these areas are

visible from the interstate and function as gateways to the commu-
nity, it is important to ensure that they are well designed.
Existing suburban commercial strip development is typically desig-
nated as Commercial. As these uses redevelop, they should take on
the characteristics of Village Centers and Corridors described in the
Community Character Element, including a mix of uses and support-
ing a vibrant pedestrian environment.
3. Office (O)
The purpose of this designation is to provide for the maintenance and
expansion of the job and economic base of the City of Tracy and to
provide more Tracy residents with the potential to work in the City.
Office parcels may have a maximum FAR of 1.0. The Office designa-
tion provides sites for office and research and development uses that
accommodate high-tech, medical/hospital, legal, insurance, govern-
ment and similar users. Commercial uses such as restaurants, exclud-
ing restaurants with drive-thrus, retail stores, dry-cleaners, daycare
centers, public assembly and banks may be allowed within individual
buildings or projects as supports for the allowed uses. In addition,
parks are allowed in the Office designation.
Generally, development in areas with Office designations is relatively
large in scale, but can accommodate smaller offices in older parts of
the City where parcel sizes and businesses tend to be smaller. Land
designated as Office should be located along major transportation
corridors. While these areas will be primarily accessible by automo-
bile, efforts should be made to integrate transit facilities into the de-
sign of the project, create a safe pedestrian environment and provide
connections to other uses such as nearby neighborhoods, commercial
uses and Village Centers.

4. Downtown (D)
Tracy’s existing Downtown is the cultural and historical heart of the
city. The purpose of the Downtown land use designation is to pro-
vide specific policy guidance to support and reinforce the role of the
downtown area as the heart of the city. Uses allowed in the Down-
town designation include a mix of retail, office, high-density residen-
tial, cultural and public-serving uses (such as post offices, libraries,
places of worship, museums, art centers, parks, plazas or common
space for gatherings, day care facilities, medical buildings, fire de-
partments and police sub-stations) arranged in a manner that results
in a strong sense of place for Tracy’s residents, workers and visitors.
Characteristics of the Downtown include a pedestrian-oriented envi-
ronment, vertical mixed-use development, a diverse mix of public and
private uses, streets on a grid or modified grid, multi-modal street de-
sign, and direct pedestrian and bicycle connections to residential
neighborhoods. Residential development is strongly encouraged in
the Downtown and allowed at a density of 15 to 50 units per gross
acre. Non-residential (e.g., retail, service commercial and office) may
have a maximum FAR of 1.0.
More information on the Downtown can be found in the Commu-
nity Character Element.
5. Village Center (VC)
Village Centers are relatively small retail or mixed-use areas. This is a
new concept and designation; there are currently no Village Centers
in the City as of 2004. Areas designated for Village Centers generally
range in size from 10 to 20 acres, and are to be designed as “Main
Streets” serving one or more neighborhoods. Connectivity to adja-
cent neighborhoods or business/industrial development projects and
a mix of uses are defining features of Village Centers. Residential de-

velopment is strongly encouraged in Village Centers and allowed at a
density of 12.1 to 25 units per acre. Non-residential (e.g., retail, ser-
vice commercial and office) may have a maximum FAR of 1.0. Resi-
dential and non-residential uses may be combined on individual par-
cels. A higher FAR may be permitted where upper-story housing,
off-site or structured parking, and/or pedestrian amenities are pro-
vided.
Allowable uses in Village Centers include, but are not limited to, gro-
cery stores, drug stores, banks, restaurants, retail stores for durable
goods, small-scale professional offices or services such as travel agen-
cies, beauty salons, daycare facilities, gyms, parks, and high density
residential development, along with other neighborhood-serving uses.
More information on Village Centers can be found in the Commu-
nity Character Element.
6. Industrial (I)
Specific uses allowed in the industrial category range from flex/office
space to manufacturing to warehousing and distribution. Industrial
parcels should have a maximum FAR of 0.5. Ancillary uses, such as
restaurants, consumer services and parks, may be allowed to serve the
daily needs of the workers.
Industrial uses are located to provide proper truck access, buffering
from incompatible uses and proximity with rail corridors and transit
links.
7. Urban Reserve (UR)
The Urban Reserve designation is applied to relatively large, contigu-
ous, geographic areas where comprehensive planning must occur
                                                                       2-27

prior to urbanization. The purpose of assigning the Urban Reserve
designation to these large, undeveloped areas rather than specific land
use designations to various parcels is to provide guidance regarding
the vision and types of land uses allowed while still allowing flexibil-
ity in location of these uses.
Each area with an Urban Reserve designation will require compre-
hensive planning and the preparation of a Zoning District, Specific
Plan or PUD. In conjunction with a Zoning District, Specific Plan or
PUD, a General Plan amendment will be necessary to establish spe-
cific General Plan land use designations for each parcel of land. The
Zoning District, Specific Plan and/or PUD shall include a vision,
goals, objectives and images that describe the most important qualities
that the built development should have when completed. In addition,
a concept plan must be included in order to show the location and
intensity of the land uses.
A brief discussion of the vision for each Urban Reserve and specific
principles for its development are provided below in Section E. A
statistical profile of the expected land uses and allowed density and
intensity of development for the Urban Reserves is also provided.
While not included in the statistical profiles, all Urban Reserves are
likely to include schools, community facilities such as places of wor-
ship, public facilities and/or parks and open spaces. The statistical
profiles are guidelines for the approximate mix of land uses. Detailed
land uses will be analyzed and considered at the time of approval of a
Zoning District, Specific Plan or PUD.
8. Public Facilities (Pub)
The purpose of this designation is to provide locations for uses that
support government, civic, cultural, recreational, health, and infra-
2-28

structure aspects of the community. Uses that are recognized to be
consistent with this land use designation include public educational
institutions (including colleges and schools, and their administrative
offices), community and group meeting centers, fire stations, parks,
cemeteries and libraries. Private schools are not included in this des-
ignation; rather, private schools, when not associated with places of
worship, are designated as commercial uses.
This designation also includes large-scale public facilities such as the
Tracy Municipal Airport, stormwater detention/retention facilities,
water treatment plants, solid waste transfer stations, recycling facili-
ties, multi-modal facilities, transit station, corporation yards, cemeter-
ies, landfill sites, which need to be in satellite locations to take advan-
tage of natural environmental characteristics such as topography or
winds and to avoid conflict with other land uses.
Public facilities may also be located in other land use designations.
The central location of the Downtown is the most appropriate loca-
tion for many public uses, such as City Hall, museums, an art center,
administrative offices, court house, police and fire headquarters, main
post office and transit offices. Other appropriate locations for these
public uses are Village Centers.
9. Parks (P)
This designation provides for current and future locations for public
parks of all sizes in the City. Examples of specific land uses that are
appropriate within this designation include active playing fields,
parks and recreation facilities, urban parks and plazas, bicycle and
walking trails, fountains, landscaped areas and corridors, natural open
space and wildlife areas, water recharge and detention facilities (that
are also used as public parks when they are not flooded) and renew-
                                                                           2-29

able energy and/or alternative energy uses. Park facilities and open
space are also allowed in areas with Public Facilities and Residential
designations.
The location of park uses within these other designations occurs only
after specific site design when additional entitlements are required to
support the larger project aims and to begin development. However,
it is expected that all residential neighborhoods will be located within
¼- to ½-mile walking distance to one or more parks.
10. Open Space (OS)
The Open Space designation provides for areas that have minimal or
no development and serve as visual buffers, natural open space and
wildlife corridors, water recharge and detention/retention facilities,
recreational facilities such as hiking and biking trails and other land-
scaped areas. Some open space uses are integrated into recreation cor-
ridors along major arterials to serve for buffering and aesthetic pur-
poses. These “recreation corridors” also serve to link the Village
Centers, the Downtown and residential areas and offer access to
schools, parks and recreation areas and other public facilities. Subject
to conditional review by the City, golf courses may be allowed in
areas with the Open Space designation; golf courses can provide man-
aged open space and create environmental entities such as habitats for
endangered wildlife, if properly designed. Renewable energy and al-
ternative energy facilities, such as solar farms and wind turbines, are
also allowed within the Open Space designation.
Open Space areas are generally associated with large scale projects
that have the financial capability to develop, maintain and otherwise
be responsible for the management of open space areas. Open space
areas are either owned by a public agency or a private or non-profit

entity dedicated to open space preservation, or have been dedicated
by their private owners for open space use, generally as part of a lar-
ger land development project.
11. Agriculture (Ag)
These lands are not anticipated for any use other than agriculture dur-
ing the life of this Plan.
Allowable land uses within this general agricultural designation in-
clude livestock ranges, animal husbandry, field crops, tree crops,
nurseries, greenhouses, agricultural related residences and structures,
public parks and recreational areas, farm employee residences and
agricultural offices. Application of treated effluent is also allowed on
land with this designation.
12. Aggregate (Agt)
Aggregate designated lands lie directly south of the existing urbanized
City of Tracy generally south of Linne Road. The geographic loca-
tion is dictated by the alluvial fan that formed at the bottom of the
Corral Hollow Canyon depositing the sands and gravels of market
quality. Under the State Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA),
local jurisdictions must identify reserves and take necessary steps to
preserve aggregate resources for future use. The Tracy General Plan
designates those lands with production quality reserves with the des-
ignation of Aggregate. Once aggregate mines are no longer in use, the
land may be reused for industrial or recreational purposes.
                                                                        2-31

                the Downtown and the I-205 Regional Commercial
                Area. Each is defined as follows: 
                   Neighborhoods are residential areas of the city that
                     are approximately ½ mile in diameter and centered

                     open space.
                   Employment Areas are the job-centers of the city
                     and include office districts, retail centers and indus-
                     trial areas.
                   The Downtown provides a focal point of commu-

             a mix of uses.
           The I-205 Regional Commercial Area is a special
             district north of I-205 that contains big-box retail,
             automobile sales establishments and a large, re-
             gional shopping mall.

        and extent of land uses throughout the City and Sphere
        of Influence is shown on Figure 2-2.
Actions
A1.     Amend the zoning code and map for overall consis-
        tency with the General Plan.
A2.     Initiate process to adjust Sphere of Influence proposed
        in this General Plan with the Local Agency Formation
        Commission (LAFCo) and with the community mem-
        bers in the affected areas.
A3.     Conduct a formal review the General Plan every five
        years, or more frequently if necessary. In particular,
        the Land Use Designation Map should be reviewed to
        ensure that the amount and location of land designated
        in various categories meets community goals.

               tively large, contiguous geographic areas where com-
               prehensive planning is expected to occur.
       P2.     The City shall periodically review and modify Urban
               Reserve areas as needed to ensure an adequate, long-
               term supply of developable land and balance of land
               uses.
       P3.     The first application for development in each Urban
               Reserve shall be responsible for preparing a General
               Plan amendment to establish specific land use designa-
               tions for each parcel of land within the Urban Reserve
               and a Zoning District, Specific Plan or PUD for the en-
               tire Urban Reserve area. When the development in-
               tended for areas within an Urban Reserve is initiated
               solely to accommodate schools, parks, and public facili-
               ties, then the requirement to prepare comprehensive
               Zoning Districts, Specific Plans or PUDs for the entire
               area does not apply until development of commercial,
               industrial, office or residential development is pro-

     Policies
      P1.      The City shall maintain, implement and monitor the
               Sustainability Action Plan, and adjust the Sustainability
               Action Plan as needed based on monitoring results and
               as funding becomes available. 
     Actions
     A1.       Implement the Sustainability Action Plan and monitor
               its effectiveness as funding allows, ideally every five
               years, by conducting a greenhouse gas emissions inven-
               tory. Adjust the Sustainability Action Plan as needed
               every five years and as funding allows based on these
               calculations to ensure that the City is on track to meet
               its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. 
D. Areas of Special Consideration
In addition to land use designations and goals, objectives, policies and
actions, the General Plan identifies numerous Areas of Special Con-
sideration. These are specific areas of the city where more detailed
design and development guidance shall be applied. These Areas of
Special Consideration are shown in Figure 2-4 and are discussed be-
low.
1. The Bowtie
This vacant land, approximately 45 acres in size, is located at the in-
tersection of two Union Pacific Railroad lines in the southern part of
the Downtown. Development in the Bowtie area can help to revital-
ize the Downtown.

          tial in close proximity to retail, are encouraged.
                                                                          2-53

     2b. A park should be built in this area to serve new residential
          uses.
     2c. New residential development should have direct pedestrian
          access to the Village Center without accessing Valpico Road.
3. Grant Line Road and Corral Hollow Road Area
     The vision for this area is for a medical office area that takes ad-
     vantage of the proximity of the Kaiser Medical Center.
     3a. Commercial uses that support the medical industry may be
          allowed in areas designated as Office.
     3b. High density residential development, including projects for
          senior citizens, may be allowed on a case-by-case basis to
          take advantage of the close proximity to medical and retail
          services.
4. Larch Clover
This area of approximately 364 acres is divided into 189 assessor par-
cels. The majority of the area (approximately 85 percent) is devel-
oped with residential ranchettes, numerous scattered businesses and
several places of worship. Due to the area’s visibility and access from
I-205 and its proximity to other existing commercial development,
the long term vision for the Larch Clover area is that it will gradually
transition to commercial uses. However, given the existing deficien-
cies in public infrastructure in the area, new commercial development
is not expected to occur in this area for some time into the future.
When development does occur, the following additional General Plan
policies apply:
     4a. No commercial or more intense development or subdivision
          of property shall occur in this area without necessary infra-

          structure studies and review of development proposals by
          the Planning Commission and City Council.
    4b. Landscaping should be provided along I-205 to provide a vis-
          ual amenity to the City.
5. I-205 Entryways
Areas around I-205 off-ramps, including areas on Eleventh Street,
Grant Line Road, Tracy Boulevard and MacArthur Drive, serve as
entryways to the City. Special attention should be given to the types
of uses and design of these areas to ensure that development is visu-
ally attractive.
    5a. Entryway locations include, but are not limited to: Paradise
          Road, Chrisman Road, Lammers Road, MacArthur Drive,
          Grant Line Road and Eleventh Street, where these streets in-
          tersect I-205.
    5b. Follow the guidance for entryways in the City’s Civic Art
          Plan.
6. Potential Village Centers
As described in Section B of this Element and in the Community
Character Element, Village Centers are intended to be designed as
“Main Streets” that consist of small pedestrian-oriented retail or
mixed-use areas that serve surrounding neighborhoods. Three areas
have been given the Village Center land use designation, as shown on
the General Plan Land Use Designation map (Figure 2-2). Three
other areas have been identified as potential future Village Centers
and specific guidance on the futures uses of these areas is presented
below. Three potential Village Center locations are listed below and
shown in Figure 2-4.
                                                                     2-55

   Tracy Boulevard and Schulte Road
   Eleventh Street and Corral Hollow Road
   Tracy Boulevard and Grant Line Road
The potential Village Centers areas have existing, viable commercial
uses, however, they do not necessarily exhibit all of the qualities that
define a Village Center. Over time, these areas can be redeveloped as
Village Centers with a mix of uses including retail, office and high-
density housing. The following policy guidance is provided for these
areas:
     6a. If any of the areas are substantially or completely redevel-
          oped in the future, they should be designed in accordance
          with Village Center principles, as detailed in the Commu-
          nity Character Element, and contain a mix of uses to the ex-
          tent possible.
     6b. In the absence of large-scale redevelopment, all future retail
          and service commercial uses should be designed to create a
          pedestrian-oriented and walkable environment.
     6c. Modifications to the existing commercial uses alone, without
          substantially redeveloping the potential Village Center area,
          including the adding new buildings or refurbishing existing
          buildings, shall not necessarily trigger the conversion of the
          parcel to the Village Center designation.
7. Holly Sugar Agricultural Area
The Holly Sugar site was purchased by the City in 2003 and consists
of approximately 1,200 acres.
     7a. Approximately 300 acres are designated as Park.

    7b. The other approximately 900 acres are designated as Agricul-
         ture with provisions to allow for the land application of
         treated effluent, effluent cooling, and public facilities uses.
    7c. The portion of the site with existing structures may be used
         for public facilities uses such as service yards.
    7d. The City shall consider using part of this site as a publicly-
         accessible open space area, or as a City park, as long as public
         access does not negatively affect adjacent properties, such as
         levees that support farming operations.
    7e. This site shall not be developed with commercial or residen-
         tial uses.
8. Tracy Hills Specific Plan Area
As described in section A.3 above, the Tracy Hills Specific Plan area,
located on the southwest side of the City, covers 6,175 acres with ap-
proximately 2,700 acres falling within the City limits, which are
planned with residential, commercial, office, and industrial and rec-
reational land uses. Approximately 3,550 acres located outside the
City limits and within the Sphere of Influence planned as permanent
open space for habitat conservation and managed grazing.
    8a. Of the 2,700 acres falling within the City limits, the Tracy
         Hills development shall include approximately 185 acres of
         land for open space.
    8b. The land use designations shown on Figure 2-2 represent the
         current land use designations within the Tracy Hills Specific
         Plan area. At the time of updating the Tracy Hills Specific
         Plan, the exact location of General Plan land use designa-
         tions within the Specific Plan area shall be established in
         such a way as to achieve the goals, objectives, and policies of
                                                                         2-57

     8c. Interim or phased infrastructure that is consistent with exist-
          ing City approvals shall be allowed within the Tracy Hills
          Specific Plan Area.
9. Chrisman Road Property
The Chrisman Road property represents approximately 113 gross
acres on the northeast corner of Chrisman Road and Eleventh Street.
The property is envisioned to develop as a public-private educational
focused project with mixed use commercial, public and private educa-
tional facilities, recreational, hospitality, and office elements enhanc-
ing and complementing the educational experience. The following
policy guidance is provided for these areas:
     9a. Public – Private partnerships with regard to funding and
         shared-use facilities are encouraged to maximize site utiliza-
         tion.
     9b. Educational, recreational and commercial developments shall
         create pedestrian linkages enhancing site utilization.
     9c. Educational institutions locating within the project site shall
         participate, to the extent possible, in efforts to connect course
         programming with local business needs.
     9d. The City shall consider developing a portion of the site as a
         future multi-modal station for regional connections to ACE,
         BART, High Speed Rail or other future passenger rail oppor-
         tunities.
10. Ellis/Tracy Airport Outer Approach Zone Property
The Ellis/Tracy Airport Outer Approach Zone property is a rectan-
gular shaped property, as shown in the applicable San Joaquin

County Airport Land Use Plan. As the name suggests, the property
is part of what is known as the “Ellis” property, which consists of
approximately 321 acres generally bound by Lammers Road to the
west, Corral Hollow Road to the east, and the Union Pacific Railroad
to the south. The Ellis/Tracy Outer Approach Zone property is
identified in the applicable San Joaquin County Airport Land Use
Plan.
E. Urban Reserves
As discussed above, this General Plan assigns an “Urban Reserve” des-
ignation to undeveloped areas at the city’s periphery instead of spe-
cific land use designations to various parcels. The Urban Reserve des-
ignation is intended to provide guidance regarding the vision and po-
tential mix of land uses while allowing flexibility in the location of
these uses.
Areas with the Urban Reserve designation will require comprehen-
sive planning. A General Plan amendment with specific land use des-
ignations will be required as each of these Urban Reserves develops in
order to reflect the appropriate land use designation. The preparation
of a Zoning District, Specific Plan and/or PUD will also be required
prior to development.
Ten Urban Reserves have been identified in Tracy, as shown in Fig-
ure 2-2, the land use designation map. A brief discussion of the vision
for each Urban Reserve, principles for its development and a statisti-
cal profile of the expected land uses are provided below. The statisti-
cal profiles are guidelines for the approximate mix of land uses. The
acreages assigned to land uses in the statistical profile for each Urban
                                                                        2-59

Reserve are intended as guidelines; the overall distribution and mix-
ture of residential densities and commercial/industrial intensities may
change. Detailed land uses will be analyzed and considered at the
time of approval of a Zoning District, Specific Plan or PUD. Modifi-
cations are expected in the Zoning District/Specific Plan/PUD proc-
ess. Schools, community facilities, such as places of worship, and
other public facilities and/or open spaces are likely to be included in
the Urban Reserves but are not included in the statistical profiles. In
addition, the statistical profiles include estimates of the assumed den-
sity or FAR and the approximate number of homes and non-
residential square feet. These numbers are not intended to reflect the
exact amount of development allowed in each Urban Reserve.
The adjusted gross acres of each land use type, as estimated in the Sta-
tistical Profiles show that approximately 15 percent of the land area
may be used for infrastructure such as roads and utilities. This per-
centage is an estimate and is subject to change as development applica-
tions are reviewed for each Urban Reserve. The resulting developable
acres in each Urban Reserve will be adjusted through the Specific
Plans, Zoning Districts, or PUDs as necessary.

1. Urban Reserve 1
This area, located on the eastern side of the City of Tracy, is ap-
proximately 780 acres. The vision for this area includes primarily
residential uses, with a small amount of commercial uses, parks and
public schools to support the residential neighborhoods. When de-
velopment does occur, the following additional General Plan policies
apply:
     1a. Higher density residential uses should be located close to
           MacArthur Drive in order to take advantage of proximity to
           the Downtown.
     1b. The density of residential development shall feather towards
           the eastern boundary of this Urban Reserve at Chrisman
           Road, where the designation should be Residential Very
           Low.
     1c. The use of cluster development on the eastern side of this
           Urban Reserve is encouraged to create a soft edge to the
           City.
     1d. Commercial uses should be located and designed in a way to
           serve new neighborhoods and should not compete with the
           Downtown.
     1e. Siting and layout of uses at the interface of the eastern edge
           of Urban Reserve 1 and the Defense Depot (e.g., south of
           Schulte Road on Chrisman Road) should be designed with
           appropriate landscaped buffers and/or setbacks such that
           residential uses are not negatively impacted visually by their
           adjacency to the Defense Depot.
     In the future, the City should explore using the area along the
     Union Pacific Railroad corridor as a neighborhood amenity such
     as a bicycle and pedestrian trail to Downtown.

2. Urban Reserve 2
This 40-acre, triangular area on the northwestern side of the city is
bounded by Grant Line Road to the north, Lammers Road to the east
and Byron Road and the Union Pacific Railroad to the southwest.
Given its proximity to the I-205 Regional Commercial Area and
frontage along major arterials, a majority of this area is envisioned as
primarily commercial with some office uses. When development oc-
curs, the following additional General Plan policies apply:
     2a. Consideration should be given to the relationship between
          the location, intensity of land uses and site layout along the
          boundary shared by this Urban Reserve and adjacent areas,
          including Urban Reserve 4 and the surrounding parcels des-
          ignated as Commercial.
     2b. Development along Byron Road should incorporate urban
          design features that enhance this area as an entryway to the
          city.

3. Urban Reserve 3
This Urban Reserve, which is commonly referred to as the Catellus
property, consists of approximately 700 acres. It is located to the
north of I-205 and to the northwest of the developed portion of
Tracy. The vision for this area is for industrial and office uses with
the potential for some low-density residential uses. When develop-
ment occurs, the following additional General Plan policies apply:
     3a. Industrial, office and commercial uses shall be located closest
          to I-205.
     3b. Office uses should be located closest to the I-205 Regional
          Commercial Area.
     3c. Residential Very Low uses could be located in the north and
          west of the area, away from industrial and commercial areas
          and near the adjacent existing single family residential uses in
          San Joaquin County. An alternative is to create a significant
          landscape buffer on the west and north of at least 100 feet
          outside of the public right-of-way with low maintenance
          landscaping and equestrian trails. Structures on the western
          and northern edges of the areas should not be more than one

     3d. Due to limited access from Urban Reserve 3 as a result of I-
          205, the Union Pacific Railroad line, a loop street network
          should be created southwest of Byron Road.
     3e. Development along Byron Road should incorporate urban
          design features that enhance this area as an entryway to the
          city.

As shown in Figure 2-2, Urban Reserve 4 is approximately 190 acres
and is located to the east of the future freeway interchange at Lam-
mers Road. Future intended uses in the Urban Reserve includes high
density residences and office supported by commercial uses. When
development occurs, the following additional General Plan policies
apply:
     4a. Appropriate setbacks and landscaping along I-205 should be
          developed in order to provide an aesthetically pleasing en-
          tryway to the city and to protect residents and workers from
          the negative impacts of traffic.
     4b. Appropriate setbacks and landscaping shall be provided
          along the Eleventh Street edge of this Urban Reserve to pro-
          vide an attractive visual entryway to the city.
     4c. Highway-oriented Commercial uses should be located near
          the I-205 interchange to serve the needs of travelers.
     4d. Residential High uses should be located along Lammers
          Road.
     4e. Office and Commercial uses should be located along Elev-
          enth Street and I-205 to take advantage of visibility and ac-
          cess.
     4f. The Lammers Road extension shall be located to ensure that
          parcels are large enough to create viable commercial areas
          and residential neighborhoods.

5. Urban Reserve 5
This area, located south of Eleventh Street and east of Lammers Road,
is approximately 170 acres. The vision for this area is for residential
uses at a mix of densities and some supporting retail. When devel-
opment occurs, the following additional General Plan policies apply:
     5a. Residential High and Residential Medium uses should be lo-
          cated along Eleventh Street and the portion of Lammers
          Road north of the school site to take advantage of proximity
          to Tracy Gateway.
     5b. Direct vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian connections to exist-
          ing and proposed development should be provided.
     5c. The acreages assigned to land uses in the statistical profile for
          this Urban Reserve are intended as guidelines; the overall dis-
          tribution and mixture of residential densities may change.
     5d. Future development in this Urban Reserve should strive to
          create neighborhoods that have a well-integrated mixture of
          housing types with an average density of at least 6 dwelling
          units per acre in the residential areas.
     5e. Development in this area should be coordinated with devel-
          opment in Urban Reserves 7 and 8, and the surrounding par-
          cels designated as Residential Low to ensure adequate transi-
          tions between the location, site layout and intensity of land
          uses.

6. Urban Reserve 6
Urban Reserve 6, which encompasses approximately 1,730 acres, is
commonly known as Cordes Ranch. The majority of the property is
designated for industrial uses. The vision for the area is that the in-
dustrial uses would occupy the interior portions of the property,
while the properties abutting Mountain House Parkway and I-205
would consist of higher identity businesses with an emphasis on
commercial, low-rise office and office/flex uses. When development
occurs, the following additional General Plan policies apply:
     6a. Direct vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian connections to
          Tracy Gateway to the east should be provided.
     6b. Direct connections to I-205 and I-580 via Mountain House
          Parkway should be provided.
     6c. Parcel sizes should vary in size in order to accommodate a
          range of uses including high density housing, large-scale in-
          dustrial uses such as regional warehouse and distribution fa-
          cilities, as well as smaller-scale uses such as commercial, of-
          fice, office-flex and industrial-flex businesses.
     6d. Development proposals should include land for public facili-
          ties, parks and/or open spaces to ensure consistency with the
          standards established in the Community Character Element
          of this General Plan.
     6e. Appropriate setbacks and landscaping along I-205 should be
          provided to create an aesthetically pleasing visual entryway
          to the city.
     6f. Industrial uses on the eastern side of this Urban Reserve
          should be designed with adequate buffers from residential
          uses.

             or higher-quality space, rather than warehousing and distri-
             bution uses, to capitalize upon their proximity to entryways
             of the city.

3 COMMUNITY CHARACTER ELEMENT
  Located in the heart of the Central Valley and just east of the San
  Francisco Bay Area, the City of Tracy began as an agricultural com-
  munity built at the confluence of several rail lines. Over the years,
  and especially during the past three decades, the City has evolved from
  an agricultural heritage to a more urban environment driven by
  growth in the Bay Area. Today, the City of Tracy is known through-
  out the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area as a great place
  to live, raise a family and do business. Much of this reputation is due
  to the physical design of the City, which is best characterized as a
  small town with ample residential neighborhoods, job centers, and
  shopping districts. Tracy’s urban form is a result of a strong planning
  and design vision by the City and its citizens.
  In an effort to preserve and enhance Tracy’s “hometown feel” and to
  incorporate that feel in new growth and development, the General
  Plan includes this Community Character Element. This Element
  translates the two-dimensional Land Use Element into the third di-
  mension by specifying how new development should look, feel and
  function. The Community Character Element includes important
  concepts and guidelines that apply to the type, location and character
  of both private and public development projects for new and existing
  areas of the City. This Element includes principles, goals, objectives,
  policies, actions and concepts to maintain and enhance the City of
  Tracy’s unique character, or “sense of place,” as it relates to both the
  physical design of the city and quality of life.
  This Element is organized into four sections as follows:
    ♦ A brief overview of Tracy’s urban design characteristics.
    ♦ A discussion of urban design principles.
    ♦ Definitions of the basic “building blocks” of the city.
                                                                       3-1

C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
  ♦ Goals, objectives, policies and actions for the City as a whole and
     for the various “building blocks.”
A. Background
The urban form of the City can be divided into several distinct seg-
ments:
  ♦ Tracy’s Downtown has a compact, grid street system and serves as
     the historical heart of the City. There are numerous historical
     buildings that enhance the City’s identity, walkable main streets
     with a diverse mix of uses, and a small town urban fabric.
  ♦ The I-205 Regional Commercial Area is generally north of the I-
     205/Grantline Road interchange and serves as the retail and auto-
     mobile shopping area for South San Joaquin County, Alameda
     County and East Contra Costa County.
  ♦ Traditional residential neighborhoods built around the time of
     World War II surround the Downtown. These neighborhoods are
     generally built on a grid pattern with narrow, tree lined streets.
     The homes are of a variety of styles that include bungalows and
     ranch-style homes.
  ♦ Contemporary residential subdivisions are spread along arterials
     to the south and west of the Downtown. Older contemporary
     neighborhoods have modest ranch-style homes that are integrated
     with the traditional residential neighborhoods. The newer resi-
     dential subdivisions have larger homes that are built on wider cur-
     vilinear streets, and utilize cul-de-sacs to a large extent.
  ♦ Retail and commercial areas outside the Downtown and the I-205
     Regional Commercial Area are characterized by suburban scale
     shopping centers, typically with supermarkets as anchors, and

                                                          G E N E R A L P L A N
                                C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
    some strip commercial development along major arterial road-
    ways. These areas are generally automobile-oriented, and are
    physically separated from nearby residential areas.
  ♦ The industrial areas on northeast and south sides of the city pro-
    vide a strong and diversified economic base for Tracy. These areas
    have relatively low intensity warehouse, distribution and manufac-
    turing facilities located on large parcels with some flex-office/flex-
    tech space developed along a few arterial roadways.
  ♦ Agricultural and other undeveloped lands surround the City and
    provide a source of identity for the City’s residents. Some of these
    lands are targeted for future residential, commercial and industrial
    development, while others should be preserved.
Taken together, these urban form elements contribute to what Tracy
residents call a “hometown feel.” This is a general term used to define
the quiet residential neighborhoods where children can play in the
streets and people know their neighbors, a transportation system that
provides easy access to goods, services and jobs in cities near and far, a
downtown that is rich in history and tradition, and an abundance of
parks and schools that serve as focal points of community life.
B. Urban Design Principles
Urban design addresses the image or character of the City’s built envi-
ronment. It considers the relationship between the location of uses,
and the visual appearance and character of the built environment with
the ultimate goal of attaining a strong sense of place.
                                                                              3-3

C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
Urban design principles that should be followed to attain a sense of
place include human-scale design, community focal points, edges,
landmarks, siting buildings to “hold corners,” and pedestrian-
orientation. To the extent possible, these principles should be applied
at all scales of the city from individual buildings to larger development
projects and should apply to new development, as well as the redevel-
opment of existing areas. However, it is frequently not possible to
incorporate all principles into every development. Basic urban design
principles are discussed in detail below.
1. Human-Scale Design
People feel most comfortable and secure in environments that are de-
signed at the scale of the individual. At a neighborhood level, this
translates into shorter block lengths that are walkable and provide
more connections throughout a neighborhood. At a site or building
design level, human-scale design involves the massing of buildings, ar-
ticulation of building facade, organization of buildings on a site, land-
scaping of public and private areas, and use of color and materials.
Generally, this means avoiding or minimizing the use of soundwalls
and cul-de-sacs in future residential development and ensuring that fu-
ture retail, office and commercial development presents an attractive
“face” to the street.
2. Focal Points
Focal points are locations that serve as meeting places where people
gather. Examples of focal points include shopping areas, restaurants,
plazas, parks or community centers. Lincoln Park or the Tracy
Community Center would be considered focal points in the city. Fo-
cal points are important components of a community because they
provide a common location for people to meet, talk, shop and play.
They are locations to sit and relax, read or converse.

Edges help to define space and in built environments they can be cre-            From top to bottom: Conceptual
ated by buildings or rows of trees. Edges can have differing degrees of          diagrams illustrating urban de-
                                                                                 sign principles of Focal Points,
permeability. For example, an edge created by a wall would be con-
                                                                                 Edges, Landmarks and Entry-
sidered “impermeable.” A building can create a “semi-permeable” edge
                                                                                 ways, and Holding Corners.
with a feature such as a columned arcade, which allows people visual
and physical access between the sidewalk area and the private prop-
erty. Ensuring that buildings, trees or other architectural features
provide edges or definition to the street enhances the vitality and feel-
ing of safety and security in urbanized areas. Edges are particularly
important in areas with high pedestrian traffic, such as the Down-
town. Cities, as a whole, are also defined by their edges. In general,
edges can be “hard,” where there is an abrupt or clearly defined transi-
tion between urban and rural or undeveloped uses or “soft,” where the
transition between urban and rural is more gradual or smooth.
4. Visual Landmarks and Entryways
A visual landmark or entryway is an element by which people orient
themselves and can help create a unique identity for an area. Examples
of visual landmarks include statues, major works of public art, historic
buildings, water towers, significant landscaping or land forms, and
other easily identifiable features. Entryway design treatments can in-
clude fountains, attractive signage or natural features such as rows of
trees. Tracy is at the crossroads of three Interstate highways that carry
many visitors, in addition to residents, through the city. Thus, aes-
thetically pleasing entryways and visual landmarks that signal a sense
of arrival to Tracy are important components that contribute to the
City’s character.
5. Building Siting to Hold Corners
Building siting to “hold corners” refers to the practice of placing de-
velopment on sites located at the corner lots of intersections built close
                                                                             3-5

                                  C I T Y O F T R A C Y
                                  G E N E R A L P L A N
                                  C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
                                  to or at the lot line. Strategically placing development on corner sites
                                  gives better definition to an intersection, which makes pedestrians feel
                                  less exposed to the adjacent traffic. Ensuring that buildings in Tracy
                                  are designed to hold the corners of key intersections will enhance the
                                  visual quality and the safety of the pedestrian environment as com-
                                  pared to development that provides “a sea of asphalt” to passersby.
                                  6. Pedestrian Orientation
                                  Designing places that are pedestrian-oriented rather than automobile-
Mixed-use typically refers to a
                                  oriented often contributes to creating a sense of place because it en-

                                  Increasing pedestrian-orientation not only enhances the attractiveness
                                  and safety of an area, it also provides greater opportunities to some

building blocks for the City. These building blocks— Neighborhoods,
Village Centers, the Downtown, the I-205 Regional Commercial Area,
Corridors and Employment Areas—are interrelated. Critical land use,
transportation and urban design decisions must be made in each loca-
tion in order to achieve the desired outcomes of hometown feel,
community livability, quality of life and increased economic develop-
ment.
The concept of building blocks is intended to augment the informa-
tion provided by the Land Use Designation Map (Figure 2-2) by pro-
viding a broader overview of Tracy’s physical form. Specific building
block concepts relate to certain land use designations to further clarify
that the policies developed for the building blocks apply citywide and
not solely to new large scale development. The Building Blocks Map
(Figure 3-1) offers a citywide perspective on how the various already
developed parts of Tracy fit together to create a cohesive community.
Specific goals, objectives, policies and actions for each building block
are included later in this Element. The characteristics of each building
block are described below.
1. Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods are residential development areas that are located
around a park, school or retail use that serves as a source of identity
for local residents. Neighborhoods should generally be bounded by
edges such as arterial roadways, railroad tracks and utility corridors.
Neighborhoods are areas that have a residential General Plan land use
designation (Residential Very Low, Low, Medium, High or Tradi-
tional Residential). They also allow for a variety of other designations
including parks, public facilities and open space.

Neighborhoods are comprised of two components:
  ♦ Development Areas. The majority of the physical area of a
     neighborhood should be devoted to residential development.
     These development areas should have direct, pedestrian connec-
     tions with their focal points. Depending on size, a Neighborhood
     may be composed of one or more residential “subdivisions” that
     share a focal point.
  ♦ Focal Points. The focal point of a Neighborhood should be a
     park, school, plaza or open space or a combination thereof. Focal
     points should contain public spaces where people can meet their
     neighbors; they also serve as a nucleus for neighborhood life. The           Neighborhoods should be
     Focal Point for several Neighborhoods can be a Village Center.               developed around a Focal Point
Neighborhoods should be of a size where the majority of residents are
within a reasonable walking or biking distance of a focal point, which
generally means that Neighborhoods should be no more than a half-
mile across in any direction. An illustrative map of the City’s existing
Neighborhoods is shown in Figure 3-2.
2. I-205 Regional Commercial Area
The I-205 Regional Commercial Area, located north of I-205, between
Lammers Road and Corral Hollow Road, provides a unique setting in
Tracy where the West Valley Mall, big-box retailers, large scale food
stores, and hotels are concentrated in close proximity to create a retail
center that serves the city and region. It has become the regional
shopping destination for the growing communities in South San Joa-
quin County and areas in eastern Contra Costa and Alameda Coun-
ties, due to its easy freeway access for shoppers and the variety of retail
opportunities it offers. The I-205 Regional Commercial Area is desti-
nation-oriented and serves as the City’s primary retail environment

outside of the Downtown.         Parcels in this area are designated as
Commercial.
This General Plan recognizes that it is difficult to emphasize “home-
town feel” as the overarching design objective in the I-205 Regional
Commercial Area due to the function of the center as a regional desti-
nation, the predominance of large scale buildings, and geographic sepa-
ration from the largely residential areas to the south. However, future
expansion should integrate physically to the existing uses. Develop-
ment and expansion should also continue to emphasize high quality
architecture, landscaping, and site planning.
3. The Downtown
As described in the Land Use Element, Tracy’s Downtown is the cul-
tural and historic heart of the City as a whole. The Downtown is
both a General Plan land use designation and a key building block of
the City. Within the Downtown land use designation, a variety of
land use types are allowed, including commercial, residential and office
uses, public facilities and parks. Characteristics of the Downtown in-
clude a pedestrian-oriented environment, mixed-use development with
a backbone of retail use, streets on a grid or modified grid, multi-             A view of Tracy’s Downtown
modal street design, and direct pedestrian and bicycle connections to
residential neighborhoods.
4. Village Centers
Village Centers are both a General Plan land use designation and a
building block of the city. As described in the Land Use Element, Vil-
lage Centers should be relatively small retail or mixed-use areas. A
variety of land use types are allowed in Village Centers, including
high-density residential, commercial and office uses, public facilities
and parks. They generally range in size from 5 to 20 acres, are de-
                                                                            3-11

                                 Connectivity to adjacent neighborhoods or business/industrial devel-
                                 opment projects and a mix of uses are defining features of Village Cen-
                                 ters.
                                 The Village Center designation has been applied to four existing va-
Vision of a Village Center as a  cant areas within Tracy, as shown on the Land Use Designation Map
“Main Street” with a mix of uses (Figure 2-2). Three other areas with existing retail shopping centers
that serves one or more          have been identified as potential future Village Centers. These areas
Neighborhoods                    have existing, viable commercial uses, however, they do not necessar-
                                 ily exhibit all of the qualities that define a Village Center. Thus, these
                                 areas have not been given the Village Center land use designation. In-
                                 stead, additional policy guidance is provided for these areas in Section
                                 D of the Land Use Element so that over time, these areas can be rede-
                                 veloped as Village Centers. Future Village Centers may also be devel-
                                 oped in Urban Reserve areas, which are described further in the Land
                                 Use Element.
                                 5. Corridors
                                 Corridors are linear areas located along arterial roads, typically one lot
                                 deep on either side of the road, that contain a mix of retail, office and
                                 other commercial uses. Thus, these areas have General Plan land use
                                 designations including Commercial, Residential Medium, Residential
                                 High and Office. Not every arterial roadway in the city is identified
                                 as a Corridor. Roadways with residential development that back onto
                                 arterials are not considered as Corridors.
                                 Three Corridors have been identified in Tracy:
                                 a. Eleventh Street (from Lincoln to MacArthur Drive)
                                 b. Grant Line (from Tracy Boulevard to MacArthur Drive)
                                 c. Tracy Boulevard (from Lowell Avenue to I-205)
                                 3-12

                                                       C I T Y O F T R A C Y
                                                        G E N E R A L P L A N
                              C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
In the future, all corridors should be multi-modal and balance the
needs of automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians. Corridors also present
significant opportunities in the future for transit and new transit-
oriented housing and shopping, as well as potential focal points for
nearby Neighborhoods.
6. Employment Areas
Employment Areas are primarily non-residential areas that serve as the
City’s primary economic development and job-producing locations.
The bulk of land uses in these areas should be office, service, retail and
industrial uses. This building block may have areas with General Plan
land use designations including Office, Commercial, Industrial and
Village Center. Employment Areas should provide safe, attractive and
easily accessible environments for Tracy’s working population. Al-
though Employment Areas are primarily non-residential use areas,
residential uses that are compatible with adjacent uses may be allowed.
To the extent possible, development within Employment Areas
should be oriented around a Focal Point, which consists of a place
where people gather. The Focal Point of an industrial, commercial
and/or retail development project should be a small retail use or open
space, such as a park or plaza. Appropriate transitions in scale, archi-
tectural design and land use between non-residential uses and residen-
tial uses is also important. While it is difficult to emphasize “home-
town feel” as the overarching design objective in Employment Areas
due to the scale of the buildings, it is possible to provide high quality
architecture, landscaping and site planning.
                                                                           3-13

Policies
 P1.     Strongly oppose the urbanization within the City of
         Tracy’s Planning Area as defined by this General Plan or
         the San Joaquin County General Plan, whichever is
         more restrictive, particularly between the City of Tracy
         and the adjacent communities of Mountain House and
         Lathrop. à
 P2.     To the extent feasible, the City shall use land use desig-
         nations and open space preservation techniques to create
         appropriate transitions. A variety of techniques can be
         used to create the soft or hard edges to the City includ-
         ing the following:
          ♦ Buffer Zone. Soft edges can be created with buffer
            zones such as natural open space, large setbacks and
            landscaped areas, as a means to separate urban from
            rural uses. Buffer areas shall be planted and main-
            tained by the property owner, tenants or homeown-
            ers association and may include passive and active rec-
            reation areas such as picnic areas, bridle, and walking
            trails. Golf course development may also be an op-
            tion in areas where a soft edge is desired.
          ♦ Cluster Development. Clustered development is a
            method of site planning in which structures are clus-
            tered on a given site in the interest of preserving open
            space or creating a buffer. Areas with clustered de-
            velopment typically have low gross residential densi-
            ties and high minimum open space requirements to
            encourage the clustering of structures.
                                                                       3-21

                                                 ♦ Feathering of Density. A gradual reduction in resi-
                                                   dential density can be used to establish a smooth tran-
                                                   sition between urban and rural uses.
                                      P3.       The City shall encourage the location of new parks
                                                around the edge of the SOI to help create and support a
                                                soft edge to the city.

                               The goals, objectives, policies and actions below are designed to ensure
                               that Neighborhoods are consistent with the ideas of “hometown feel”
                               and that existing Neighborhoods are enhanced to increase physical and
                               visual linkages with surrounding areas. In addition to new Neighbor-
                               hoods, new residential development that occurs at a scale smaller than
                               at the Neighborhood level, or that occurs on parcels of land not large
                               enough to create an entire Neighborhood, shall also adhere to the fol-
                               lowing policies, as these smaller areas will eventually become part of
                               Neighborhoods.
                               Goal CC-5          Neighborhoods with a recognizable identity and

Neighborhoods should be de-
signed around a Focal Point           P1.       Every Neighborhood should have at least one Focal
that is within a ¼ mile from                    Point, which should be a park, school, plaza, clubhouse,
any point in the Neighborhood.

  P2.    Neighborhoods should not be bisected by a physical
         barrier, such as an arterial street, a railroad track or a ma-
         jor drainage way. à
  P3.    Design streets in Neighborhoods to enhance the sense of
         place and create a safe and comfortable pedestrian envi-
         ronment. à
  P4.    In most instances, block lengths should be short, typi-
         cally no more than 400 feet, to create an easily navigable
         street pattern that allows for multiple routes through a

       P6.       Alleys are encouraged for access to garages, as well as to
                 enhance Neighborhood appearance and to facilitate the
                 inclusion of secondary units over garages. Alleys shall

         fourplex, townhomes and apartments.
 P3.     Land use and product types shall not be isolated. There
         shall be a discernible, inclusive neighborhood pattern as
         to how single-family, townhouse, and multifamily uses
         relate to each other.
 P4.     Blocks within neighborhoods should contain a mix of
         lot sizes and house sizes. Some lots may be designed to
         accommodate one-story houses, which generally require
         greater lot width to avoid front elevations of houses that
         are dominated by garages.
 P5.     In neighborhoods, secondary units shall be allowed be-
         hind the primary residential structure or above garages
         to the extent feasible.
 P6.     Multi-family housing design shall be in scale with or
         transition in scale from adjoining or adjacent single fam-
         ily areas through the use of similar setbacks, complimen-
         tary building arrangements and architecture, gradual
         changes to building heights, buffer yards and the avoid-
         ance of overwhelming building scale and visual obstruc-
         tions.

       P7.       Multi-family housing shall generally front on a public
                 street with varying setbacks to provide visual interest,
                 opportunities for transitional landscaping and varying
                 shadow patterns.
       P8.       The paving of front yards shall be discouraged.
     Objective CC-6.2         Design neighborhoods to foster interactions
     among residents and to be responsive to the human scale.
     Policies
       P1.       Houses, townhomes and multifamily units should be
                 oriented to the street, parks, or a shared commons.
       P2.       Lot size and building placement on lots shall be designed
                 to reduce the appearance of large homes close together
                 on small lots.
       P3.       Residential building setbacks from the street should be
                 minimized and varied, except in areas with a Residential
                 Very Low designation, where setbacks from the street
                 may be larger and more consistent.
       P4.       Garages for new single-family houses, duplexes, and
                 townhouses should be subordinate in visual importance
                 to the house itself, especially the entry. This shall be
                 achieved by locating garages toward the back of proper-
                 ties, constructing alleys, limiting the width of the garage
                 to two car spaces, building garages as separate structures
                 from the house, requiring garages to be set back from the
                 front facade of the house, and encouraging the orienta-
                 tion of garage doors at 90 degrees to the street.

       P3.       Landscaped and bermed setbacks should be used as the
                 preferred sound attenuation methods for residential de-
                 velopments.
       P4.       New development projects should not physically divide
                 established neighborhoods.
       P5.       The impacts of large-family day care facilities and child
                 care centers on residential neighborhoods shall be mini-

4 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to provide a
  framework to guide Tracy’s economic growth for the next 10 years.
  As such, it serves as a source of information and statement of public
  policy to aid residents, businesses, government agencies, and City offi-
  cials in making recommendations or decisions on matters relating to
  economic development. The Economic Development Element is
  closely linked to other elements in the General Plan, including Land
  Use and Housing, among others.
  The Economic Development Element, which provides a macro-level
  approach to goals and strategies to advance the City’s economic aims,
  is derived from the City’s Economic Development Strategy. Drafted in
  2002 and adopted by the City Council in April 2003, (Resolution
  #2003-097), the Strategy’s purpose is to provide a living, breathing
  document that can be updated over shorter periods of time to respond
  to Tracy’s changing economy.
  The Economic Development Element provides background informa-
  tion on the economic conditions in Tracy, followed by goals, objec-
  tives, policies and actions for economic development on a macro level.
  The goals, objectives, policies and actions are intended to encourage
  the development of the kinds of business and commercial activities
  deemed to be desirable for Tracy’s quality of life and economic vital-
  ity, while also preserving Tracy’s small-town character. Detailed ac-
  tions and policies on economic development are provided in the Eco-
  nomic Development Strategy.
  A. Background
  Tracy has long been known as a pleasant residential community, with
  a diverse array of entry-level, move-up, and luxury housing types. The
                                                                      4-1

City has an affordable lifestyle, a close-knit community, a pleasant
“small town” center, a well-organized and business-friendly local gov-
ernment, and many other amenities. Yet, many of Tracy’s residents
commute to surrounding communities with stronger office and indus-
trial economic bases and higher wage jobs. Some of Tracy’s residents
shop, dine, or seek entertainment opportunities away from the com-
munity. A more fully developed local economy, with expanded high
wage job opportunities, a complete array of shopping and dining op-
tions, and a range of entertainment venues would enhance residents’
overall quality of life. This enhanced level of economic development,
particularly if it included substantial attraction of higher wage jobs,
would also better balance the jobs and housing ratio in Tracy.
For purposes of analysis, data on employment and Tracy’s real estate
market has been compared to that of San Joaquin County as a whole,
and a “commute region” defined as the combined Alameda, Contra
Costa and Santa Clara Counties. The “Commute Region” has been
included in the analysis in order to better understand trends in the lar-
ger region to which many of Tracy’s current employed residents
commute for higher wage and higher skill job opportunities. Eco-
nomic trends and opportunities are provided in detail in the City of
Tracy’s Economic Development Strategy prepared in September 2002.
1. Demographics
The following discussion presents an overview of levels of employ-
ment, educational attainment and commute times for Tracy’s working
population.

a. Employment and Unemployment
Between 1990 and 2000, the labor force in Tracy grew by almost 50
percent, compared to approximately 6 percent in San Joaquin County
and the Commute Region, as shown in Table 4-1.
Unemployment rates for Tracy have been historically more similar to
San Joaquin County than to the Commute Region. In 1990, Tracy’s
unemployment rate was 8.1 percent, compared to 9.7 percent for the
County and only 4.0 percent for the Commute Region. However, in
2000, Tracy’s unemployment rate of 5.8 percent more closely mir-
rored the Commute Region (4.7 percent) than San Joaquin County
(10.3 percent). Low unemployment rates in both Tracy and the
Commute Region reflected an exceptionally strong economy and de-
mand for labor.
Unemployment rates in all three geographies climbed again in 2002 to
above their 1990 levels. Tracy and San Joaquin County had unem-
ployment rates of 8.4 and 10.9 percent, while the Commute Region’s
unemployment rate increased to 5.1 percent. Thus, in the most recent
economic cycle, Tracy’s economy has moved from mirroring the Bay
Area to more closely resembling the County.
b. Educational Attainment
According to the 2000 U.S. Census data, educational levels of Tracy
residents are relatively less advanced than for the Commute Region.
While 27 percent of Tracy residents had some form of college degree
(including an Associates degree and higher), almost 45 percent of the
Commute Region’s residents attained this level. Moreover, only 4.3
percent of Tracy’s residents had earned graduate or professional de-
grees in 2000, compared with more than 14 percent of the Commute
Region’s residents. These recent data underscore the importance of
                                                                              4-3

seeking expanded local higher educational opportunities for Tracy
residents.
c. Resident Occupations
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 41.8 percent of Tracy residents
were employed in sales, administrative support and service occupa-
tions. These occupations accounted for 41.7 and 36.8 percent of em-
ployed residents in San Joaquin County and the Commute Region,
respectively. Residents in the Commute Region were much more
likely to be employed in executive/managerial and professional occu-
pations (44.7 percent of all residents, compared to 30.7 percent in

Tracy and 27.1 percent in San Joaquin County). The proportion of
residents employed in executive/managerial and professional occupa-
tions has increased in all three geographies, but most notably in Tracy,
since 1990. At that time, only 18 percent of residents were employed
in executive/managerial and professional occupations.
d. Commute Time
Tracy residents had significantly longer commute times to their work-
places in 1990 than residents in San Joaquin County or the Commute
Region. Approximately 46 percent of Tracy commuters traveled 30
minutes or longer to work, compared to 37 percent of Commute Re-
gion residents and 25 percent of San Joaquin County residents.
For Tracy, median commute time (42 minutes) exceeded the Com-
mute Region (30 minutes) and San Joaquin County (also 30-minute
median commute time).
2. Economic Trends
Between 1990 and 2000, Tracy’s employment base grew from an esti-
mated 11,112 jobs to an estimated 20,972 jobs, an impressive increase
of 9,860 jobs during the period. Within this overall job growth, there
were significant changes in the composition of Tracy’s employment
base as the agriculture and transportation sectors declined in impor-
tance, while the services and retail sectors experienced strong growth.
Overall, Tracy’s economy contains a mix of transportation, services,
and retail trade employment. In all of these major sectors, there are
industries that produce high value-added services and products, as well
as those that pay relatively low wages and generate relatively little re-
turn to the local economy (e.g. fast food restaurants, convenience
stores, low-end warehouse and distribution facilities). Perhaps most
                                                                              4-5

promising for Tracy is the local economy’s burgeoning finance, insur-
ance, and real estate (FIRE) sector, as well as the emerging business
services and the still strong transportation sectors.
3. Tracy’s Real Estate Market
Underlying land values and current rent structures are relatively inex-
pensive in Tracy, compared to Livermore, the more developed parts of
the Tri-Valley area, and Silicon Valley. For firms requiring large tracts
of land for expansion at low costs, Tracy compares favorably to almost
any Northern California sub-region.
Tracy is striving to develop new product types to attract different in-
dustries than those presently forming its economic base. As new busi-
ness parks are built in Tracy, the City will be competing with develop-
ing properties in Livermore, as well as the broader Bay Area and
Northern California markets. In recent years, the I-580/I-680 corridor
has experienced this evolving process, first with more traditional “back
office” space and then with the attraction of companies related to Sili-
con Valley. The Tri-Valley area is rapidly building out with new de-
velopments already attracting planned users and absorbing prior to
completion of the development entitlement process. However, given
other new business centers planned in the Bay Area, the City will need
to be vigilant in following the goals, objectives, policies and actions in
this General Plan, and in the City’s Economic Development Strategy.

5 CIRCULATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide the general loca-
  tion and extent of existing and proposed roadways, bicycle and pedes-
  trian facilities, public transit, and freight movement facilities. This
  element balances the need to provide efficient and reliable ways to
  move people and goods by multiple transportation modes and routes
  with the overall vision of Tracy as a safe, attractive community with
  walkable neighborhoods, vibrant retail districts and economically
  strong employment areas. The transportation system should accom-
  modate the planned growth of Tracy, minimize environmental degra-
  dation, and complement regional transportation and land use plans.
  The Circulation Element is correlated with the Land Use Element. As
  required by Government Code Section 65302(b), this Element con-
  tains information on the general location and extent of existing and
  proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes and terminals.
  State law also requires that a Circulation Element contain data and
  policies related to the circulation of water, sewage and storm drainage,
  and other public utilities. These components are presented in the Pub-
  lic Facilities and Services Element.
  This Element is divided into three sections. The first section provides
  background information on the existing transportation network in
  Tracy. The second section provides roadway classification standards.
  The third section presents goals, objectives, policies and actions to
  guide the development of the City’s transportation system.
  A. Background
  The existing transportation system in the City of Tracy consists of the
  following major components.
                                                                       5-1

C I T Y O F T R A C Y

C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
   Roadways. There is an extensive network of roadways in Tracy,
      including major freeways (e.g., I-205), arterials (e.g., Eleventh
      Street), collectors and residential streets. These surface streets pro-
      vide both regional and local travel needs.
   Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities. The network of bicycle and pe-
      destrian facilities includes on-street bicycle lanes and off-street fa-
      cilities and multi-use paths. In addition, a high percentage of the
      City’s streets include sidewalks.
   Public Transit. Tracy’s public transit system includes local and
      regional buses and commuter rail access. The commuter bus and
      rail services provide a connection between the residential areas of
      the San Joaquin Valley and the employment areas to the west. Lo-
      cal bus service provides access and mobility around Tracy.
   Freight Movement. Tracy has a significant number of rail facili-
      ties, including several active freight rail lines. These rail lines are
      supplemented through designated truck facilities that route truck
      traffic through the City to the regional roadway network.
Each of these components is addressed below.
1. Roadways
In Tracy, as in most cities of similar size, most travel beyond a block
or two occurs in motorized vehicles, primarily the automobile. This
section discusses the key components of the vehicular circulation net-
work.
The San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) is the designated
Congestion Management Agency for San Joaquin County. Proposi-
tion 111 was a voter approved addition to an existing statewide gaso-
line tax. In order to receive funds from this tax, each county was re-
5-2

                                                        C I T Y O F T R A C Y
                                                         G E N E R A L P L A N
                                             C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
quired to designate a Congestion Management Agency and develop a
Congestion Management Program (CMP). Subsequent legislation re-
moved this requirement, allowing counties to discontinue the CMP by
resolution of the majority of jurisdictions within the county. San Joa-
quin County has not elected to do so, and SJCOG remains the Con-
gestion Management Agency for San Joaquin County. The CMP is
also a requirement of the Measure K Renewal Ordinance approved by
San Joaquin County voters in November 2006. Measure K is the 1/2-
cent sales tax dedicated to transportation projects in San Joaquin
County. The program is aimed at remedying the existing over $1.0
billion deficiency in transportation funding in San Joaquin County
while promoting improved air quality and quality of life. With its
passage in November 1990, Measure K began laying the groundwork
for two decades of funding for a system of improved highways and
local streets, new passenger rail service, regional and interregional bus
routes, park-and-ride lots, new bicycle facilities, and railroad crossings.
Federal planning regulations also require a congestion management
process to receive some types of federal transportation funding.
SJCOG also fulfills that requirement.
The purpose of the CMP is to monitor cumulative transportation im-
pacts of growth on the regional roadway system, establish level of ser-
vice (LOS) standards, indentify deficient regional roadways and de-
velop plans to mitigate deficiencies, facilitate travel demand manage-
ment (TDM) strategies and facilitate operational preservation strategies
for existing and planned development. SJCOG has adopted a two-
tiered LOS standard. The first tier is triggered when a roadway oper-
ates at LOS D; when this tier is triggered, SJCOG begins an effort to
reduce trips or shift trips to alternative transportation modes. The
second tier is triggered when a roadway operates as LOS E or F; when
                                                                             5-3
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
this tier is triggered, a Deficiency Plan is required. Certain roadways
are allowed to be “grandfathered” at their existing LOS.
Although roadway segments operating at LOS D are not considered
“deficient,” this standard triggers the preparation of a plan that ana-
lyzes specific strategies for operational preservation and TDM. These
strategies include ensuring that new development projects include pro-
visions to promote alternative transportation options. SJCOG has
developed a Travel Demand Management Plan that provides further
guidance to local jurisdictions and land developers.
One of the implementation actions of the CMP is that it is SJCOG’s
requirement to analyze and comment on future land uses that may
impact roadways in the CMP network. Based on a Land Use Analysis
Process adopted as part of the 2007 CMP, proposals resulting in a deg-
radation of LOS conditions require the identification and implementa-
tion of mitigation measures to avoid or mitigate identified impacts.
a. Streets and Highways
The roadways in the City of Tracy range in size from highways down
to local residential streets and alleyways. Each level serves a different
function in the system of vehicular movement. Highways serve re-
gional traffic, arterial and collector streets serve city-wide travel needs
and local streets serve the needs of individual neighborhoods. The fol-
lowing is a list of the primary existing roadways in the City of Tracy.
   Interstate 205. I-205 extends from I-580 to I-5 and extends east-
      west through the northern portion of the City of Tracy. Inter-
      changes are provided at West Eleventh Street, Grant Line Road,
      Tracy Boulevard and MacArthur Drive. I-205 has six lanes
      throughout Tracy. The posted speed limit on I-205 is 70 miles per
5-4

  to the west.
 Interstate 580. I-580 extends from the San Francisco Bay Area,
  through the Altamont Pass, and connects to I-5 south of Tracy.
  This facility currently has four lanes in the segments adjacent to
  the City of Tracy with a posted speed limit of 70 miles per hour.
 Interstate 5. I-5 is a major roadway that extends north-south
  throughout the State of California. In San Joaquin County, I-5
  connects Stockton to Tracy and passes through Lathrop and
  Manteca. Those sections adjacent to the City of Tracy have four
  travel lanes with a posted speed limit of 70 miles per hour.
 Grant Line Road. Grant Line Road is a parallel road to I-205 that
  extends through the northern areas of Tracy. The road width var-
  ies from two lanes to six lanes with a majority of the roadway hav-
  ing four travel lanes and a raised median. The six-lane section ex-
  tends from I-205 to Corral Hollow Road. The road is predomi-
  nantly four lanes between Corral Hollow Road and MacArthur
  Drive. Several sections have medians and bike lanes. In other
  segments, such as those found between Holly Drive and Lincoln
  Boulevard, the raised median is replaced with a striped two-way
  left turn lane. In the 1994 Roadway Master Plan, Grant Line Road
  has portions which are designated as both an arterial and an ex-
  pressway. The expressway portion of this roadway extends east
  from Chrisman Road to I-5.
 Eleventh Street. Eleventh Street, which also parallels I-205, is one
  of the major east-west roadways in the City of Tracy. The road-
  way width varies from four to six lanes with most segments con-
  taining a median and bicycle lanes. The posted speed limit varies
  from 35 miles per hour in the urban areas of the city to 55 miles
  per hour east of Chrisman Road. The 1994 Roadway Master Plan
                                                                          5-5

      rial. The segment from Corral Hollow Road to MacArthur Drive
      is classified as a major arterial while the remaining segments of the
      road are classified as an expressway.
   Schulte Road. Schulte Road is an east-west roadway south of
      Eleventh Street. This roadway varies between two lanes and four
      lanes with bicycle lanes and sidewalks on certain sections. The
      roadway is four lanes west of MacArthur Drive and two lanes east
      of MacArthur. The section that extends from Central to Corral
      Hollow Road has on-street bicycle lanes. Schulte Road is classified
      as a major arterial in the 1994 Roadway Master Plan.
   Valpico Road. Valpico Road, which lies to the south of Schulte
      Road, extends from Chrisman Road to Lammers Road. The ma-
      jority of the roadway has four lanes with some two-lane segments
      at the eastern and western boundary of the city. When the road
      has four travel lanes, there is a median present. The posted speed
      limit varies from 35 to 45 miles per hour. The 1994 Roadway
      Master Plan classifies this roadway as a major arterial.
   Linne Road. Linne Road is the southernmost major road in the
      City of Tracy and extends from Lammers Road to east of I-5. The
      road has two lanes throughout the study area with a speed limit
      that varies from 35 to 55 miles per hour. The posted speed limit
      for a majority of the roadway within the City limits is 45 miles per
      hour. Linne Road is classified as a future expressway in the 1994
      Roadway Master Plan west of MacArthur Drive.
   Lammers Road. Lammers Road is a major north-south roadway
      that serves as the western boundary of the existing developed area
      of the City of Tracy. There are two travel lanes on the existing
      sections of Lammers Road. There is no median on these two lane
      segments. There is an on-street bicycle lane on the eastern side of

  speed limit within the City is 45 miles per hour. Lammers Road is
  classified as a future expressway in the 1994 Roadway Master Plan.
 Corral Hollow Road. Corral Hollow Road serves as one of the
  major north-south roadways in the City of Tracy. This roadway
  extends from the San Joaquin/Alameda County border south of I-
  580 to north of I-205. South of Grant Line Road, this roadway has
  four lanes with a posted speed limit varying between 40 and 45
  miles per hour. The segment from Schulte Road to Grant Line
  Road has a raised median of sufficient width to add an additional
  lane in each the northbound and southbound directions. North of
  Grant Line Road, the roadway has two lanes with no median.
  Corral Hollow Road is classified as a major arterial in the 1994
  Roadway Master Plan.
 Tracy Boulevard. Tracy Boulevard, which runs north-south, is
  east of Corral Hollow Road and extends from near I-580 in the
  southern portion of the city past I-205 in the north to State Route

c. Major Intersections
Of the city’s 43 major intersections, 26 currently operate under signal
control. The remaining 17 major intersections operate under stop sign
control. A majority of these unsignalized intersections are found
along Schulte Road, Valpico Road and Linne Road. These stop sign
controlled intersections include side-street stop sign controlled (major
street operates freely) or all-way stop sign controlled intersections (all
approaches must stop for stop signs).
The operation of the intersections was analyzed as a part of the exist-
ing conditions analysis. Operations are evaluated using an LOS sys-
tem. LOS is a letter grade system with LOS A indicating a facility
with little congestion and LOS F indicating a highly congested facility.
The LOS criteria for signalized intersections are provided in Table 5-1.
Criteria for unsignalized intersections use a similar methodology ex-
cept the average control delay is shorter compared to signalized inter-
sections.
The majority of the signalized and unsignalized intersections in the
city operate at LOS C or better. In addition, there are some unsignal-
ized intersections that operate at LOS F. They are Grant Line/Byron
Road, Eleventh Street/MacArthur Drive, and Schulte Road/Lammers
Road.
2. Bicycle System
Bicycle facilities are classified according to a typology established by
Caltrans as documented in “Chapter 1000: Bikeway Planning and De-
sign” of the Highway Design Manual (5th Edition, California De-
partment of Transportation, January 2001) and further specified in the
City of Tracy Bikeway Master Plan. The Caltrans standards provide
                                                                             5-9

for three distinct types of bikeway facilities, as generally described be-
low:
   Class I Bikeway (Bike Path). Provides a completely separate
      right-of-way and is designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and
      pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized.
   Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane). Provides a restricted right-of-way
      and is designated for the use of bicycles with a striped lane on a
      street or highway. Vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-
      flow are permitted.

   Class III Bikeway (Bike Route). Provides for a right-of-way des-
     ignated by signs or pavement markings for shared use with pedes-
     trians or motor vehicles.
There are approximately 9.46 miles of existing Class I bikeway facili-
ties in the city. The longest continuous facility extends from West
Eleventh Street to south of Valpico Road, primarily along Sycamore
Parkway. A second Class I facility runs parallel to North MacArthur
Drive and extends from East Eleventh Street to I-205.
The Class II facilities are generally found along the western portion of
the existing urbanized area. These facilities are found along roadways
such as Corral Hollow Road and Tracy Boulevard. There are Class II
facilities on Grant Line Road and West Eleventh Street to the west of
Tracy Boulevard.
The Class III Bike Route network is most prevalent in the Central
Tracy area. Portions of roadways such as Hickory Avenue, Holly
Drive, and Schulte Road carry these facilities.
While there is an extensive network of bicycle facilities throughout the
city, there are gaps in the bicycle network. For example, Tracy
Boulevard has segments with Class II and Class III designations, with
other segments containing no designated bicycle facilities. Because of
these gaps, it is not possible to fully traverse the city traveling north to
south or east to west using the designated bicycle network.
3. Public Transit System
The public transit system includes both a bus and rail passenger com-
ponent. The bus and rail system provide local and regional connec-
tivity for residents of Tracy.
                                                                              5-11

a. Passenger Bus System
The passenger bus system operating within the City of Tracy includes
the following services:
   Local fixed-route bus service operated by the City of Tracy
      (Tracer)
   Paratransit bus and taxi service to qualifying individuals operated
      by the City of Tracy.
   Regional intercity fixed-route bus service operated by the San Joa-
      quin Regional Transit District (SJRTD).
   Flexible fixed-route service operated by SJRTD.
   Commuter express bus service operated by SJRTD.
Fixed-route services are those that adhere to a strict route and timeta-
ble with scheduled stop locations. Flexible-route service is demand
responsive whereby a driver may deviate from the route to pick up
and drop off passengers. Some transit agencies, such as SJRTD, also
operate flexible fixed-route service whereby fixed-route services may
temporarily deviate from the designated route for elderly and disable
passengers.
b. Local Fixed-Route Bus Service
The City of Tracy operates a fixed-route bus system within the city.
This service is called Tracer and follows two opposing routes that run
in loop fashion in the city using roadways, including Grant Line Road,
Tracy Boulevard, West Eleventh Street and Schulte Road. The end-
points for the route include City Hall and the West Valley Mall. Ser-
vice is currently provided on 60-minute headways with operations be-
ginning at 6:58 a.m. on weekdays and 8:58 a.m. on Saturday. Service

no service on Sundays.
c. Regional Intercity Fixed-Route Bus Service
The SJRTD operates one fixed-route bus line (Route 20) that serves
the City of Tracy. Route 20 connects the City of Tracy to Stockton
and Lathrop along Interstate 5. Within the City of Tracy, Route 20
extends along Grant Line Road and East Eleventh Street. This route
operates Monday through Friday from 5:45 a.m. to 10:22 p.m. Route
20 does not operate on weekends.
d. SJRTD Flexible Fixed-Route Service
SJRTD also operates Route 90, which is a flexible fixed-route line.
Within the City of Tracy, this route extends along Grant Line Road
with stops at major locations such Wal-Mart, West Valley Mall, the
Naglee Park & Ride Facility, and the Prime Outlets on Pescadero
Avenue. Route 90 operates on 1-hour, 45-minute headways in the eve-
nings with 2-hour headways on weekends and holidays.
e. SJRTD Commuter Bus Service
The SJRTD operates a number of commuter bus lines that connect
cities in San Joaquin County with major employment locations in the
San Francisco Bay Area including Pleasanton, Dublin, Livermore,
Mountain View, Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. These various routes pick
up and drop off passengers at the Tracy Park-And-Ride facility. The
pick up times vary from 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. with drop offs ranging
from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
f. Passenger Rail System
Altamonte Commuter Express (ACE) is a passenger rail service con-
necting Stockton to San Jose. The ACE station for Tracy is located on
                                                                         5-13

Tracy Boulevard at Linne Road. There are currently three ACE trains
per day which arrive in Tracy between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. These
trains then return to Tracy between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.
4. Freight Movement
Given its relative location to the San Francisco Bay Area and other
areas of San Joaquin County, the City of Tracy is ideally positioned to
facilitate the movement of regional freight. The City functions both
as a conduit for freight traffic and also as an origin point, particularly
for regional truck traffic. The goods or freight movement system in
the City of Tracy consists of both an extensive rail system and desig-
nated truck routes.
a. Rail System
There are three major rail lines that enter the City of Tracy from the
east, two of which merge and subsequently exit to the west. There are
several minor spur lines along the main lines. One of these spur lines
is south of Linne Road and is used for industrial shipping. The second
extends north from West Eleventh Street to I-205 and was mainly used
by the Holly Sugar factory. This plant is no longer in use and the par-
cel is now owned by the City. These lines are currently owned by
Union Pacific Corporation, which operates freight rail service through
its Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) subsidiary.
The main rail line runs through south Tracy along Linne Road. This
line is used for both an industrial and commuter rail. Approximately
ten freight trains and six commuter rail trains operate daily on the
tracks. The remaining lines run through the center of Tracy. The
northwesterly main alignment travels along Byron Road, is used mini-
mally, and ties into Martinez. The line to the northeast is used for
local freight and ties into Stockton. To the southeast, UPPR leases the

                                            C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
line to California Northern Railroad. The line to the southwest,
whose tracks stop at the county line, is no longer in service and is used
only for storage.
Due to the prevalence of railroad lines, there are 23 existing at-grade
roadway/railroad crossings. These crossings are distributed through-
out the city with two crossings each on Corral Hollow Road, Tracy
Boulevard and MacArthur Drive.
b. Truck Routes
The City of Tracy has a specific ordinance relating to truck routes.
This ordinance defines weight restrictions, specifies the ability of
trucks to enter areas not designated as truck routes, and defines the
truck routes within the city.
The weight restrictions that apply to trucks are specified in Section
3.08.300 of the Tracy Municipal Code. This section of the code states
that trucks larger than three tons must stay on designated truck routes.
Passenger buses under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commis-
sion are exempt from this restriction.
Section 3.08.300 also provides that trucks are allowed to temporarily
deviate from the designated truck routes for purposes of loading and
unloading. Otherwise, trucks are supposed to remain on the desig-
nated routes specified in Section 3.08.310 of the Tracy Municipal
Code.
B. Roadway Classifications and Standards
Each of the roadways in Tracy can be categorized according to a ty-
pology known as functional classification. Functional classification is
                                                                           5-15
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
a method to classify a roadway based on its function. Since the two
major functions of a roadway are to serve through traffic and provide
access to adjacent property, different roadways prioritize these two
functions differently. For instance, freeways prioritize the movement
of traffic at the expense of access to adjacent properties. The City’s
ultimate roadway plan, with general functional classifications, is
shown in Figure 5-1.
The current functional classification for roadways in the City of
Tracy, as well as a brief description of boulevards, is detailed below.
1. Freeways
These facilities are intended to carry traffic efficiently from one end of
the city to the other, serve inter-regional travel, and provide connec-
tions from the City of Tracy to other cities and counties. These
roadways provide no direct property access. The existing freeways are
I-205, I-580, and I-5.
2. Expressways
Expressways generally border the City of Tracy and provide connec-
tivity to adjacent freeway facilities. Expressways are designed to pri-
oritize traffic movement with very limited access. Roadways desig-
nated as future expressways include Lammers Road, Linne Road, Elev-
enth Street (adjacent to I-205), Grant Line Road (east of Chrisman),
and Chrisman Road. These facilities have significant access restric-
tions with ¼-mile minimum spacing of access points and traffic con-
trol at major intersections provided by grade separated facilities.
3. Boulevards
Boulevards are multi-functional major streets that combine central
lanes for efficient through-traffic movement with local access lanes for

property access. The central lanes and access lanes are physically sepa-
rated by raised landscaped islands, except at intersections and occa-
sional mid-block access and egress points. Right-of-way requirements
are similar to those for an Expressway or Major Arterial. No existing
roadways in Tracy are designated as Boulevards, however, the City
should consider using this classification in corridors where there is
substantial need for both through-movement and access to abutting
parcels.
4. Rural Highways
Rural highways are two-lane roadways serving thinly settled areas.
They provide property access at widely spaced locations while serving
through traffic at moderate-to-high speeds.
5. Major Arterials
These roadways are intended to serve as the major routes of travel
within the city. Arterials are designed to link facilities such as free-
ways and expressways (which prioritize traffic capacity) with lower
hierarchy roadways, which provide direct access to parcels. Major ar-
terials should be located about one mile from each other.
Arterials can provide some direct but limited access to adjacent parcels.
These limitations can include restrictions on spacing and turn move-
ments into and out of driveway locations. Major arterials can also
serve as bicycle and pedestrian routes. Major arterials can carry up to
about 50,000 vehicles per day. Tracy’s arterial system includes Tracy
Boulevard, Grant Line Road and Corral Hollow Road.
6. Minor Arterials
These facilities should be spaced at half-mile intervals to supplement
the major arterial system. Minor arterials can provide direct access to
major traffic generators, such as shopping centers, industrial complexes
                                                                           5-19

C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
and large residential subdivisions. These types of arterials can carry
traffic volumes ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day.
7. Collectors
These roadways serve as intermediaries between arterials and local
roads. Traffic is collected from local roads and distributed onto the
arterial system. They should be spaced at quarter-mile intervals. Col-
lector roadways also provide direct access to parcels in both residential
and non-residential areas. The maximum volumes for collector road-
ways generally range from 2,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day. Collector
roadways can be classified as major collectors and minor collectors.
Major collectors carry volumes at the higher end of the collector scale
and provide a high level of connectivity to adjacent areas. Minor col-
lectors carry lower volumes of traffic than major collectors and pro-
vide relatively more access to abutting parcels.
8. Local Streets and Roads
Local roads provide direct access to properties and connect to collec-
tors and minor arterials. Traffic volumes on these roads are very low.
There should be an average of three residential streets between collec-
tors (approximately 1/12-mile spacing).
C. Changes to the Transportation Network
Under the General Plan, the City will implement a significant number
of new roadways and other changes to its roadway network. These
new roadways primarily consist of arterials and new interchanges to
serve future development in the western portion of Tracy, including
connections from I-205 to Byron, Lammers and Grant Line Roads;
and a westward extension of Schulte and Linne Roads. There is a also
a major arterial which connects Chrisman Road to I-205 and Arbor

Avenue to the north, and several minor arterial and collector road-
ways which are proposed for the eastern edge of Tracy. In addition, as
development occurs throughout the more localized improvements to
existing roadways will be necessary. These improvements include the
addition of travel lanes, new signals, widening of intersection and re-
classifications of roadways.
In addition, while General Plan policies below call for regular updates
to plans for the Bicycle, Transit, Freight and other modes, no specific
changes are to these transportation systems are identified in the Gen-
eral Plan.
D. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
Goal CIR-1       A roadway system that provides access and mo-
                 bility for all of Tracy’s residents and businesses
                 while maintaining the quality of life in the com-
                 munity.
    Objective CIR-1.1      Implement a hierarchical street system in
    which each street serves a specific, primary function and is sensi-
    tive to the context of the land uses served.
    Policies
    P1.      The City should develop context-based street designs that
             allow for variations based on the expected function and lo-
             cation of the facility, and the surrounding land use con-
             text. These context-sensitive designs should have the fol-
             lowing aims:
                                                                           5-21

                  Create aesthetically attractive streetscapes.
                  Enhance multi-modal transportation by increasing mo-
                    bility and improving safety for autos, trucks, transit,
                    pedestrians and bicyclists.
      P2.       The City shall preserve rights-of-way needed for future
                roadway and freeway interchange improvements through
                dedication or acquisition as adjacent properties develop or
                redevelop.
      P3.       The City shall continue to apply traffic mitigation fee pro-
                grams to fund transportation infrastructure, based on a fair
                share of facility use.
      P4.       The City should continue to pursue regional, County and
                State funding to fund roadway projects. These potential
                funding sources may include Measure K sales tax revenues,
                a regional or countywide transportation impact fee, and
                other existing and future revenue sources.
      P5.       The City shall continue to participate in regional transpor-
                tation funding decisions, including Measure K reauthoriza-
                tion, regional or countywide transportation fees, and pri-
                oritization of State funded projects.
      P6.       The Roadway Master Plan update shall identify necessary
                improvements to various intersections on I-205 and I-580
                based on land use designations and with particular atten-
                tion to Terminal Access Routes in accordance with Surface
                Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA).

Actions
A1.     Update the Roadway Master Plan upon adoption of the
        General Plan. The Roadway Master Plan should contain
        the following information:
           Improvement needs and ultimate right-of-way for 50
            years, based on development anticipated by the Gen-
            eral Plan and foreseeable development based on pro-
            posed projects, current absorption rates for non-
            residential properties and historical population growth
            rates.
           Appropriate street classifications for arterial and col-
            lector roadways as well as innovative concepts such as
            boulevards and other roadway types not currently
            employed in the City of Tracy. These roadway de-
            signs should reflect context-based design principles.
           Detailed connectivity standards for arterials, collectors,
            and local streets. These connectivity standards should
            further refine minimum and maximum spacing of fa-
            cilities and traffic control devices identified in the
            Roadway Classification Standards in Section B of this
            Element.
A2.     Prepare Precise Plan Line studies for major new roads and
        widenings, and consult with Caltrans for new interchanges
        identified in the Roadway Master Plan in order to define
        the rights-of-way needed to construct future facilities.
A3.     Consult with San Joaquin County and the City of Lathrop
        to ensure that adequate rights-of-way are preserved in the
        City’s Sphere of Influence.
                                                                       5-23

      Policies
      P1.       The City shall ensure that the street system results in a
                high level of connectivity, especially between residences
                and common local destinations, such as schools, Village
                Centers, retail areas and parks. The standard for roadway
                (vehicular) connectivity is defined as appropriate spacing
                of arterials and collectors and local roads as detailed above
                in Section B of this Element “Roadway Classifications and
                Standards.” 
      P2.       The City shall implement a connected street pattern with

      P4.       The City should develop residential street alignments and
                designs that provide connectivity while discouraging high-
                speed cut-through traffic.
      P5.       New development shall be designed with a grid or modi-
                fied grid pattern to facilitate traffic flows and to provide
                multiple connections to arterial streets.
      P6.       Street patterns in hillside areas may reflect existing topog-
                raphy and minimize grading impacts.

Objective CIR-1.3 Adopt and enforce LOS standards that pro-
vide a high level of mobility and accessibility, for all modes, for
residents and workers.
Policies
P1.      To the extent feasible, the City shall strive for LOS D on
         all streets and intersections, with the LOS standard for
         each facility to be defined in the Transportation Master
         Plan in accordance with the opportunities and constraints
         identified through the traffic projections and analysis per-
         formed for that Plan. The following exceptions to the
         LOS D standard may be allowed:
            LOS E or lower shall be allowed on streets and at in-
              tersections within one-quarter (1/4) mile of any free-
              way. This lower standard is intended to discourage in-
              ter-regional traffic from using Tracy streets.
            LOS E or lower shall be allowed in the Downtown
              and Bowtie area of Tracy, in order to create a pedes-
              trian-friendly urban design character and densities nec-
              essary to support transit, bicycling and walking.
P2.      The City may allow individual locations to fall below the
         City’s LOS standards in instances where the construction
         of physical improvements would be infeasible, prohibi-
         tively expensive, significantly impact adjacent properties
         or the environment, or have a significant adverse effect on
         the character of the community, including pedestrian mo-
         bility, crossing times, and comfort/convenience.
P3.      Intersections may be permitted to fall below their adopted
         LOS standard on a temporary basis when the improve-
         ments necessary to preserve the LOS standard are in the
                                                                          5-25

                but not yet constructed.
      P4.       Roadways and freeways that are subject to State and re-
                gional agency oversight and/or are candidates for State-
                funded or federally-funded improvements should conform
                to the operational service requirements of the applicable
                agency.
      P5.       For long-range planning purposes, the LOS of major
                streets shall be determined based on an estimation of peak
                hour conditions using future average daily traffic forecasts
                and standard Tracy relationships between daily traffic and
                peak PM hour traffic.
      P6.       For project-specific development approvals, the LOS at
                major street intersections shall be determined based on the
                direct estimation of peak hour conditions and should re-
                flect the average condition prevailing throughout the peak
                hour of a typical weekday for all traffic using the intersec-
                tion.
      P7.       Traffic studies for new developments within the City may
                be prepared if necessary and appropriate to determine the
                impacts of the project’s traffic on the transportation sys-
                tem.
      P8.       Access control and minimization of median openings shall
                be a key consideration in the design of expressways,
                boulevards, arterials and major collectors.
      P9.       The City shall encourage the use of right-turn-in/right-
                turn-out only turning movements where local and collec-

6 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to ensure
  the comprehensive and long-range preservation and management of
  open space lands in and around the City for the protection of natural
  resources, for economic uses, for outdoor recreation and as a scenic
  resource. The Open Space and Conservation Element seeks to main-
  tain the City of Tracy’s character and economic stability by encourag-
  ing the preservation of viable agricultural lands, natural habitats for
  endangered and threatened species and mineral resources and improv-
  ing the quality of life for residents by providing recreational opportu-
  nities throughout the City.
  This element combines two State-mandated elements—Open Space and
  Conservation—and an optional recreation component into one com-
  prehensive element. The state-mandated Open Space Element is con-
  cerned with the management of open space resources. Open space is
  defined as any parcel or area of public or private land or water that is
  essentially unimproved and undeveloped. Government Code Section
  65560 describes four categories of open space: Open Space for the
  Preservation of Natural Resources, Open Space for the Managed Pro-
  duction of Resources, Open Space for Outdoor Recreation and Open
  Space for Public Health and Safety. The types of open space in each of
  these categories are identified in Table 6-1.
  The state-mandated Conservation Element is concerned with the con-
  servation of natural resources, including plants and animal wildlife,
  water bodies and watersheds, forests, soils, minerals and energy con-
  servation. Since most natural resources are located in open space land,
  the City of Tracy General Plan combines these two elements into one.
                                                                       6-1

in the Land Use Element.
**This category of open space is not discussed in this element; it is covered in the Public Safety
Element.
This Element provides background information and goals, objectives,
policies and actions on a variety of open space and conservation topics
including: threatened and endangered habitat and species, agricultural
lands, mineral resources, and parks and recreational opportunities and

A. Background Information
This section of the Open Space and Conservation Element provides
background information on a variety of topics related to the preserva-
tion and conservation of open space land.
1. Biological Resources
The Tracy Planning Area currently contains a range of vegetation and
habitat types including urban, agricultural, riparian woodlands, sea-
sonal wetlands, farmed wetlands and non-native grasslands. These
vegetation areas and habitats, which are described below, host a wide
range of wildlife and plant species that reflect the diversity in San Joa-
quin County and the Central Valley.
   Agricultural. Much of the Planning Area outside of the Tracy
    City limits is used for agricultural production. This area includes
    land that is currently in agricultural use and lands that have been
    used for agricultural uses in the past but remain un-urbanized.
   Urban. The Urban land use type applies to the built-up portions
    of Tracy. Much of the land in the City limits and parts of the land
    in the SOI are considered Urban.
   Non-Native Grasslands. The majority of non-native grasslands in
    the Planning Area occur within its southern portion.
   Riparian Woodlands. The Great Valley Riparian Woodland
    communities lie in the northern portion of the Planning Area,
    along the Old River and Tom Paine Slough riparian zones, and in
    the southern portion of the Planning Area long the Corral Hollow
    system, which flows northeast.
   Seasonal Wetlands. There are numerous seasonal wetlands
    throughout the Tracy Planning Area.
                                                                              6-3

   Farmed Wetlands. Wetland areas that are currently in agricultural
     uses are defined as farmed wetlands. This type of area occurs in
     the northern portion of the Tracy Planning Area.
There are numerous special status plant and animal species known to
be located in the Tracy Planning Area. Special-status species include
plants and animals that are legally protected under state and federal
Endangered Species Acts or other regulations, as well as species con-
sidered sufficiently rare by the scientific community to qualify for
such listing. Special-status species include the following categories of
plants and animals:
   Plants and animal species listed or proposed for listing as threat-
     ened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act
     (ESA).
   Plants and animal species that are candidates for possible future
     listing as threatened or endangered under the ESA.
   Plants listed under the California Native Plant Protection Act.
   Plants that meet the definition of rare or endangered under the
     California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), including those
     considered by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) to be
     “rare, threatened, or endangered in California.”
   Animal species of special concern to the California Department of
     Fish and Game.
   Animals fully protected in California, as defined in the California
     Fish and Game Code, Sections 3511 [birds], 4700 [mammals] and
     5050 [amphibians and reptiles].
As of 2004, there are six special-status mammals, 24 special-status birds,
six special-status reptiles and amphibians, two special-status inverte-

brates, and twelve special-status plant species potentially occurring in
the Planning Area. These include the San Joaquin kit fox, Swainson’s
hawk, San Joaquin pocket mouse and the giant garter snake.
In an effort to protect sensitive and threatened species throughout the
county, the San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) has pre-
pared the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation and
Open Space Plan (SJMSCP). The purpose of the SJMSCP is to provide
a county-wide strategy for preserving open space, provide for the long-
term management of plant, fish and wildlife species, especially those
that are currently listed or may be listed in the future under the ESA
or the California Endangered Species Act, and provide and maintain
multiple-use Open Spaces that contribute to the quality of life of the
residents of San Joaquin County. The City of Tracy has adopted the
SJMSCP.
2. Agricultural Lands
Agriculture is a major activity within the undeveloped portions of the
Tracy Planning Area. Agriculture uses include: field crops, tree crops,
nurseries, greenhouses, agricultural related residences and structures,
oil and gas exploration, livestock ranges, animal husbandry, public
parks and recreation areas, farm employee residences, agricultural of-
fices, truck farming and roadside stands.
As shown in Table 6-2, there are a total of 41,087 acres of land identi-
fied as Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Im-
portance and Farmland of Local Importance in the Planning Area,
Sphere of Influence (SOI) and City limits combined. Definitions of
each type of farmland are presented in Table 6-3. Of this amount,
4,890 acres are located in the City limits, 7,072 acres are in the SOI
outside of the City limits and 29,125 acres are located in the Planning
                                                                             6-5

Area outside of the SOI. Farmland along the I-580 corridor and the
south side of the City is designated as Farmland of Local Importance,
which is land defined as land of importance to the local economy. In
San Joaquin County, any farmland that does not meet the criteria of
Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance or Unique Farm-
land is designated as Farmland of Local Importance. It could include
land that is currently being used, or has been used in the past, as irri-
gated pasture, dry land farming, confined livestock or dairy facilities,
and dry grazing.
In addition, the Tracy Planning Area includes lands protected under
Williamson Act contracts.1 These contracts preserve land in agricul-
tural use for ten years and are adopted by land owners on a voluntary
basis in exchange for tax benefits. According to the California De-
partment of Conservation, as of January 2003, there are approximately
15,289 acres of agricultural lands under Williamson Act contracts
within the Tracy Planning Area, 3,781 acres within the SOI and 1,489
acres within the City limits, for a total of 20,558 acres holding active
Williamson Act contracts within the entire Planning Area. These
numbers include both lands currently held in active contracts and
those that have filed for non-renewal.
3. Mineral Resources
Within the Tracy Planning Area, sand and gravel deposits represent
important mineral resources, which are used primarily for construc-
tion materials such as asphalt and concrete. Sand and gravel deposits

            Williamson Act contracts provide tax incentives for property owners to
hold their lands in agricultural use for ten years instead of selling it for development.
Placing an agricultural easement on land reduces its market value and therefore lowers
the owner’s property taxes. The contracts also provide financial assistance to munici-
palities who have reduced property tax revenues due to Williamson Act contracts.

4. Parks and Recreational Facilities
In 2002, the City of Tracy adopted the Parks Master Plan. The plan
identifies existing park facilities, analyzes the demand for future parks,
provides standards for new park facilities and identifies goals, policies
and actions for the provision of park and recreation facilities and ser-
vices. The majority of the goals, objectives, policies and actions in this
Element are derived from the Parks Master Plan and refined based on
the 2011 Parks and Recreation Master Plan update that is currently
underway.

In addition, the City’s park dedication ordinance currently requires a
dedication of 4 acres per 1,000 people for all new development pro-
jects. This is intended to ensure that new development provides an
adequate amount of park space to keep pace with demand.
a. Parks
Tracy’s park system is four-tiered as follows:
   Mini-Parks. Small-sized parks, typically 1 to 3 acres, that provide
     basic recreation amenities for nearby residents in a specific
     neighborhood or subdivision.
   Neighborhood Parks. Medium-sized parks, typically 4 to 12 acres,
     that provide recreation opportunities within walking or biking dis-
     tance for residents in one or more neighborhoods.
   Community Parks. Large parks, typically 12 to 50 acres, that in-
     clude a mix of passive and active recreation amenities for the entire
     city or a substantial portion of the city. Community parks in-
     clude, but are not limited to, recreation amenities and facilities
     typically found in mini and neighborhood parks, as well as special-
     ized facilities that provide additional recreation opportunities.
     Community parks may also include natural open space.
   Linear Parks. Elongated park corridors that tie park components
     together, provide people with trail-related recreation opportuni-
     ties, allow for uninterrupted and safe pedestrian and bicycle
     movement throughout the community, and/or protect natural
     open space corridors. Linear parks may be of various lengths and
     widths, and these corridors typically support facilities such as soft
     or hard-surfaced trails, viewing areas, picnic tables, and trailheads.
As of July 2010, the park inventory is comprised of 48 mini-parks, 15
neighborhood parks and eight community parks, providing approxi-
                                                                               6-9

mately 256 acres at 71 sites. The parks inventory is detailed in Table 6-
4 and includes the types of amenities located at each park.
In addition, there are two planned parks totaling approximately 314
acres of parkland. These are listed in Table 6-5. Planned parks are
parks that are in the planning or design phase, but have not been de-
veloped or formally dedicated to the City.
b. Recreational Facilities
The City of Tracy operates several recreational facilities as shown in
Table 6-6. As identified below, several of these facilities are located
within the parks listed in Table 6-4. City-operated recreational facili-
ties (which are leased, not owned) include a gymnastics center and a
multi-purpose activity center.
c. Recreational Corridors
The City also operates a number of recreational corridors as linear
parks, which mainly consist of Class I bikeways. These linear parks
provide recreational and transportation amenities to city residents. In
2004, approximately 14 acres of such facilities exist in the City of
Tracy. This inventory will be updated and included in the revised
2011 Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
5. Energy Conservation
In 2000, California and much of the country experienced an electrical
energy shortage that resulted in high utility rates and rolling blackouts.
This led to a heightened awareness of the need for energy conservation
techniques as a means of saving money and conserving energy.

Energy conservation has numerous benefits besides economic and fi-
nancial savings for individual consumers. The combustion of fossil
fuels to produce heat or electricity, or to power internal combustion
engines, has been linked to poor air quality in the San Joaquin Valley,
global warming and negative impacts on crops. In Tracy, energy con-
servation can be achieved via a reduction in electricity usage and pri-
vate automobile use, encouraging efficient siting and exposure for
buildings, and implementing land use and transportation policies that
encourage fewer and shorter vehicle trips.

7 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
  The Public Facilities and Services Element provides information and
  policy guidance to ensure provision of facilities and services that will
  support existing and new development in the City of Tracy. It ad-
  dresses the changing public services and infrastructure needs of Tracy
  and provides for their logical and timely extension to keep pace with
  growth. Policies supporting quality schools and libraries, excellent
  police and fire services, and well-maintained infrastructure are essential
  to achieve broader development objectives and support the future en-
  visioned by the residents of Tracy.
  Although the Public Facilities and Services Element is not explicitly
  required by State law, the topics addressed here are an integral part of
  the City’s overall planning strategy and a basic consideration in setting
  growth and development policy. In addition, State law does require
  the Land Use Element to include “the proposed general distribution
  and general location and extent of the uses of the land for…solid and
  liquid waste disposal facilities,” and it requires the Circulation Element
  to include information on “the general location and extent of existing
  and proposed… public utilities and facilities.” These components are
  included in this Element, which covers the following topics:
     Fire
     Police
     Schools
     Public Buildings
     Solid Waste and Recycling
     Water Service
     Wastewater
     Stormwater
  The City of Tracy is served by public school districts and San Joaquin
  County. This General Plan aims to build partnerships between the
                                                                         7-1

formation on the major planning issues. The second part contains
goals, objectives, policies and actions related to the specific public ser-
vice or infrastructure category.
I.         FIRE PROTECTION
A. Background Information
The Tracy Fire Department provides fire protection, life safety and
emergency response services to 167 square miles in the southern part
of San Joaquin County. In 1999, the South County Fire Authority
was established to more effectively and efficiently serve the City of
Tracy, the Tracy Rural Fire Protection District and the Mountain
House Community Services District.
The Fire Department currently operates seven fire stations and an ad-
ministrative office. Twenty-four hour a day staffing is provided with
five paramedic engine companies, two basic life support engine com-
panies and one ladder truck company. Three fire stations are within
the incorporated area of the City of Tracy, three are in the surround-
ing rural Tracy area and one is located in the planned community of
Mountain House. Table 7-1 shows the name, location and equipment
housed at each of these stations.
Medical transport is provided by private ambulance. American Medi-
cal Response is the exclusive emergency ambulance service provider in
San Joaquin County.

II.        POLICE
A. Background Information
The Tracy Police Department provides police protection services in
the City of Tracy. The Department operates out of its headquarters at
1000 Civic Center Drive. Currently there are no satellite offices. The
headquarters is expected to remain at its current location.
The Tracy Police Department has 93 sworn officers budgeted in FY
2008/9 including one chief, one deputy chief, one captain, five lieuten-
ants, 13 sergeants and 64 patrol officers. The 2008 ratio of police per
thousand population was just over one per 1,000 population. The De-
partment also has 53 professional staff members, which includes part-
time employees. Professional staff members include administrators,
communications dispatchers, community services personnel, animal
control, a records supervisor and crime scene technicians.
The Department divides calls into three categories, Priority 1, 2, and 3
calls. Priority 1 calls are defined as life threatening situations. Priority
2 calls are not life threatening, but require immediate response. Prior-
ity 3 calls cover all other calls received by the police. Average re-
sponse time for Priority 1 calls within city limits is approximately six
to eight minutes. Response time for Priority 2 and 3 calls is, on aver-
age, 22 minutes.
The Tracy Police Department defines offences for statistical purposes
using the Uniform Crime Reporting Code of California. Crimes are
classified as Part 1 or Part 2 offences, depending on the priority of the
crime. In 2007, 2,675 Part 1 offences, which include homicide, rape,
burglary and larceny, were reported. Larceny, which includes car
break-ins, auto accessory theft and shoplifting, is the most common

crime in Tracy, accounting for over 80 percent of offences in 2007.
The second most common crime in Tracy is burglary, which ac-
counted for 13 percent of crimes in 2007. Between 2006 and 2007, Part
1 offences in Tracy increased by about nine percent.
Police service within the Planning Area outside of Tracy’s City limits
is provided by the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Department, which is
located in French Camp, about five miles south of Stockton. Police
Patrol Service is provided 24 hours a day by 124 uniformed deputies as
of 2004. The County is divided into eight geographical areas or
“beats.” These beats are staffed around the clock, providing emer-
gency response capability to citizens in the unincorporated area.
The Tracy Police Department provides mutual aid to the San Joaquin
County Sheriff’s office when a situation exceeds the capabilities of ei-
ther department. Mutual aid is coordinated by the San Joaquin
County Sheriff’s Office.

V.       SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING
A. Background Information
This section describes the existing solid waste and recycling services
available to City of Tracy residents and businesses. These are under
the supervision of the Parks and Community Services Department.
1. Solid Waste
The City of Tracy contracts with Tracy Disposal Service, a private
company, for solid waste collection and disposal. Solid waste is taken
to the Tracy Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and Transfer Station
on South MacArthur Drive before being sent to the Foothill Sanitary
Landfill on Shelton Road. The MRF, which is operated by Tracy Ma-
terial Recovery and Solid Waste Transfer, Inc., has a daily intake ca-
pacity of 1,000 tons and on average takes in 354 tons per day. The
MRF receives 304 tons per day from Tracy. The transfer station site is
approximately 40 acres.
                                                                                  7-17
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
The total amount of municipal solid waste generated by the City of
Tracy in 2001 was 70,777 tons. The Foothill Landfill receives a major-
ity of Tracy’s solid waste. In 2001, it accommodated 67,704 tons (95
percent) of Tracy’s solid waste. Tracy’s residential solid waste genera-
tion rate for 2001 was 4.32 pounds per person per day. This genera-
tion rate does not include self-hauled waste.
Presently, the permitted capacity of the Foothill Landfill is 102 million
cubic yards. The remaining capacity of the facility is approximately 95
million cubic yards. Current permits indicate a closure in 2054. There
are no plans to expand the Foothill Landfill or build a new one to ac-
commodate Tracy’s waste since the Foothill Landfill is expected to
meet the City’s needs for the foreseeable future.
2. Recycling
The City of Tracy, in coordination with Tracy Disposal Service, also
provides recycling services to city residents and businesses. The City
provides curbside residential collection of recyclable materials. Ac-
ceptable materials include glass containers, all plastics, tin and alumi-
num cans, plastic milk cartons, newsprint, boxboard, corrugated card-
board, bond paper and magazines. Residents may also recycle some
materials at buy-back centers. Special recycling programs include an
electronics waste program; a tire recycling program, which collects
about 60 tons of tires per year; and a twice-per-year residential clean
up program on large items and debris. There are also opportunities to
recycle construction and demolition waste.
The City’s stated diversion goal corresponds to the State’s goal of di-
verting 50 percent of all solid waste from landfills by January 1, 2000
through source reduction, recycling and education. In 2001, the City
of Tracy diverted 53,997 tons of recyclable material. The city’s overall

                    P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
diversion rate was 43 percent. The City is currently in the process of
finalizing a request to the California Integrated Waste Management
Board (CIWMB) to adjust this diversion rate from 43 percent to 69
percent based on a detailed study of waste generation and diversion
authorized by the CIWMB.
3. Composting
Composting in Tracy is carried out through a bi-weekly leaf and yard
waste collection program and through grass-cycling at city parks,
where grass is cut and left as mulch. Backyard or apartment compost-
ing may occur on an individual household basis but there are no City
backyard or apartment composting or composting education programs
in Tracy. Total residential curbside composting in 2001 was reported
at 10,292 tons, while grass-cycling at city parks, where grass is cut and
left as mulch, is estimated at 2,578 tons per year.

VI.      WATER SERVICE
A. Background Information
1. Water Service Area
As of 2005, the City of Tracy provides water service to all of its resi-
dents, approximately 400 residents of the Larch-Clover County Ser-
vices District, and to the unincorporated Patterson Business Park.
Tracy has 22,740 metered service connections, 21,799 of which are sin-
gle-family and multi-family residential users, 527 of which are com-
mercial or industrial users, and 414 of which serve institutional or
landscape irrigation purposes.
                                                                                   7-21

G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
2. Water Supply
The City of Tracy obtains water from both surface and groundwater
sources. The amount from either source as a percentage of the total
water supply used by Tracy varies from year to year based on contrac-
tual agreements, annual precipitation and City policy about how to
expend water resources. The supply of groundwater sources is de-
pendent on the capacity of the Tracy Aquifer. Current water sources
are presented in Table 7-2.
Surface water generally makes up between 50 and 60 percent of the
total water supply for the City of Tracy. The City of Tracy receives
the majority of its surface water supply from the United States Bureau
of Reclamation (USBR). The USBR acts as a water wholesaler to the
City and provides surface water to help fulfill City needs. Tracy’s
groundwater supply is pumped from groundwater resources beneath
the city, which is a portion of the larger San Joaquin Valley groundwa-
ter basin. The groundwater supply comprised 41 percent of the city’s
total water supply in 2003. Since this is a heavily mineralized source
of water, the City would like to reduce daily use and reserve its use for
emergency situations and droughts.
The City is currently in the process of securing additional sources of
surface water. These include the following:
   West Side Irrigation District and the Banta-Carbona Irrigation
     District. The City has negotiated for an additional assignment of
     up to 10,000 acre-feet per year (AFY) from the West Side Irriga-
     tion District and the Banta-Carbona Irrigation District.
    South County Water Supply Project (SCWSP). The City is also
     involved in a collaborative effort with the cities of Manteca, Esca-
     lon and Lathrop, and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District in
     the development of the SCWSP, a project to use water from the

     Stanislaus River. Tracy’s future allocation from the project is up
     to 15 millions of gallons per day (mgd) of treatment capacity and a
     total annual allotment of 10,000 AF of water.
   Byron-Bethany Irrigation District. Since part of the Tracy Hills
     Specific Plan area was annexed into the Byron-Bethany Irrigation
     District, up to 4,500 AFY of water is anticipated from the District
     to serve development in the Tracy Hills area.
3. Water Facilities
The City of Tracy’s existing water system facilities include a water
treatment plant, pump stations, wells, water mains and storage reser-
voirs. The John Jones Water Treatment Plant (JJWTP), which is near
the Tracy Municipal Airport, processes the water from the Delta
Menota Canal (DMC) and distributes it to the city. The JJWTP has
the capacity to treat 30 mgd.
                                                                                         7-23

C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
The City of Tracy also operates nine groundwater wells that pump
from the groundwater aquifer, with a total reliable capacity of 15 mgd.
The City of Tracy water service is provided over an area with signifi-
cant changes in elevation. Therefore, the City has established three
pressure zones for its treated water distribution system. The three
zones total over 390 miles of water mains. The pipes vary in diameter
up to 36 inches. The age of the pipes also varies, dating from any-
where between 1910 to the present.
Finally, the City of Tracy has five storage reservoirs. Three of these
are adjacent to the JJWTP, with a total storage capacity of approxi-
mately six million gallons (mg). An additional reservoir is located at
the Northeast Industrial reservoir with a capacity of 2.2 mg. The fifth
storage reservoir is currently under construction on Linne Road. It
will have a capacity of 7.2 mg.
4. Water Recycling
Water recycling is the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable
(non-drinking) purposes, including industrial uses and landscaping irri-
gation, such as on medians, parks and golf courses. Using recycled
water can increase the availability of potable water supplies.
The City of Tracy has developed a Water Exchange Program to con-
vert several City parks and other large irrigated sites from the City’s
potable water system to a recycled/non-potable supply system. This
will free up potable water for potable demand needs and allow recy-
cled water to be used for non-potable needs. Several schools, parks
and other areas have been identified as potential candidates for conver-
sion. Since many of these sites are located in the developed portions of
Tracy, new recycled/non-potable infrastructure will be needed for the
conversion.

The conversion is expected to occur in phases as funding becomes
available and as CEQA review occurs. It will involve the installation
of distribution mains in several of the city’s main streets, including
Tracy Boulevard, Lammers Road, Corral Hollow Road, MacArthur
Drive and Eleventh Street. Recycled water pump stations and storage
reservoirs may also be required.

VII.       WASTEWATER
A. Background Information
1. Wastewater Collection
The City of Tracy’s wastewater collection system consists of gravity
sewer lines, pump stations, force mains and a Wastewater Treatment
Plant (WWTP). Wastewater flows toward the northern part of the
city where it is treated at the WWTP and then discharged into the Old
River in the southern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
2. Wastewater Treatment
The WWTP is located north of Interstate 205 and between MacArthur
Drive and Holly Drive. The WWTP was constructed in 1930 and has
undergone several major expansions. In 2004, the WWTP had a design
capacity of 9.0 million gallons per day (mgd). The WWTP also in-
cludes an emergency storage pond that provides storage for treated
wastewater that does not meet discharge standards.
Wastewater treatment capacity exceeds demand. In 2003, the average
dry weather flows were 8.1 mgd and the wet weather flows were 8.6
7-30

                                                                C I T Y O F T R A C Y
                                                                 G E N E R A L P L A N
                      P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
mgd. In 2003, the influent of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)1
averaged 14,200 pounds per day and the effluent averaged 925 pounds
per day. Thus, the WWTP removed an average of 13,275 pounds per
day of BOD, or 93.5 percent. The influent of total suspended solids
averaged 14,000 pounds per day in 2003 and the effluent averaged 665
pounds per day. Thus, 13,335 pounds per day of total suspended solids
were removed on average, or 95.3 percent of the total.
3. Wastewater Disposal
The WWTP has a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit that allows the City to discharge up to 9.0 mgd aver-
age dry weather flow (ADWF) of treated effluent to the Old River.
The permit, which is administered by the Regional Water Quality
Control Board (RWQCB), prescribes the maximum allowable dis-
charge rate, effluent quality requirements, discharge prohibitions, re-
ceiving water limitations, pretreatment program requirements, biosol-
ids disposal requirements and self-monitoring requirements.
The WWTP provides secondary-level treatment followed by disinfec-
tion. The WWTP has a system of primary clarifiers, bio-towers, and
trickling filters, coupled with an activated sludge process, which treats
the wastewater. The city’s major industrial wastewater producer, the
Leprino Cheese factory, conveys its wastewater through a separate
force main to a pre-treatment pond that is operated by Leprino, but
located on WWTP property.
After treatment, wastewater is disinfected and dechlorinated and then
conveyed by a 3.5-mile 33-inch outfall pipeline to a submerged diffuser
          1
            “Biochemical oxygen demand” is the amount of oxygen used for biochemi-
cal oxidation by a unit volume of water at a given temperature and for a given time.
BOD is an index of the degree of organic pollution in water.
                                                                                     7-31

G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S A N D S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
for discharge into the Old River. The outfall is designed to carry a
peak flow of about 22.0 mgd.
4. Biosolid Disposal
Waste solids from the wastewater treatment processes are collected and
conveyed to the solids handling facilities so that the biosolids can be
conditioned for disposal. The treatment process for solids includes
thickening, digestion and dewatering to remove organics and inactive
pathogens and reduce the volume of solids to be disposed. Dried bio-
solids are hauled off-site and used for land application for disposal as
alternative daily cover at landfills. This off-site hauling and disposal
practice is expected to continue in the future.
5. Wastewater Treatment Plant Expansion
The existing WWTP is in the process of an expansion of capacity from
9.0 mgd to 16.0 mgd in order to meet expected future demand. The
Final EIR for an expanded WWTP was published in September 2002.
The City submitted all required documentation to the Regional Water
Quality Control Board in 2003 and the revised permit was expected in
2005. This permit will allow the City to expand the existing plant to
16.0 mgd and also provide tertiary treatment meeting Title 22 Re-
quirements. Title 22 is the standard promulgated by the State of Cali-
fornia for water recycling.
The proposed expansion will be completed in four phases. Phase 1 is
under construction with completion by Spring 2007. The remaining
phases will be constructed to match growth in wastewater flows.

VIII. STORMWATER
A. Background Information
The main purposes of a storm drainage system are to control stormwa-
ter runoff in order to prevent flood damage, reduce inconvenience
from excessive flows and to minimize pollution of surface and ground-
water.
Tracy’s storm drainage system is managed by the City’s Public Works
Department. Stormwater drains through open channels, storm drains,
and closed conduits that are owned, operated and maintained by the
City and the West Side Irrigation District (WSID). These systems
drain into three outfalls, the WSID Main Drain, the Westside Channel
Outfall System (that discharges into Old River via a force main) and
the Sugar Cut Outfall. The Sugar Cut Outfall system serves two areas,
Central Tracy and the eastside industrial area. Both areas have their
own outfall systems. These three outfalls discharge storm runoff into
Old River which is a part of the San Joaquin Delta. Pump stations are
used to move water over grades; however, the majority of the system
is gravity operated. The City utilizes detention basins at many loca-
tions to store and meter discharges before they are released into outfall
facilities.

  I.       GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
  A. Background
  There are four Seismic Zones in the United States, which are ranked
  according to their seismic hazard potential. Zone 1 has the least seis-
  mic potential and Zone 4 has the highest seismic potential. All of
  California is in Seismic Zones 3 or 4. Tracy lies primarily within
                                                                      8-1

Seismic Zone 3 with parts of the Tracy Hills Specific Plan area in
Zone 4. The California Building Code contains special standards and
regulations for each zone to ensure that all new construction will
withstand forces associated with a major earthquake.
There are numerous faults within and around the Tracy Planning
Area. Major faults close to, but outside of, the Tracy Planning Area
include the San Andreas, Calaveras, Hayward and Concord-Green Val-
ley faults. These faults have historically been the source of earth-
quakes felt in Tracy. The Carnegie/Corral Hollow fault, considered as
active, runs roughly northeast-southeast along the southern boundary
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Site 300. The Black
Butte and Midway faults, which are potentially active, lie within the
Planning Area boundaries and may pose potential seismic hazards for
the Planning Area. The Tracy-Stockton fault, which passes beneath
the City of Tracy in the deep subsurface, is considered inactive. The
Elk Ravine fault, which is considered inactive, lies between the Carne-
gie/Corral Hollow, Black Butte and Midway faults.
There are a series of specific hazards that are caused by earthquakes,
including ground rupture, ground shaking, liquefaction and expansive
soils. Due to its seismic and geologic conditions, the Tracy Planning
Area is subject to several of these hazards including a moderate poten-
tial for liquefaction and a moderate to high potential for expansive
soils depending on the specific soil conditions and location. The goals,
objectives, policies and actions in this section are designed to reduce
the risks of these hazards.

Code Section 65007 defines an “urban area” as a developed area in
which there are 10,000 residents or more. An “urbanizing area” means
a developed area or an area outside a developed area that is planned or
anticipated to have 10,000 residents or more within the next ten years.
The preliminary 200-year floodplain map for the Tracy area is pro-
vided in Figure 8-2. As shown in this map, the majority of land within
the city limit and SOI is located outside of the 200-year floodplain,
although there are small areas in the northern portions of the city
limit and SOI that are within the preliminary 200-year floodplain
boundary.
In addition, some areas in the northern portion of the city have the
potential to be inundated in the event of a dam failure, such as from
the San Luis Reservoir and New Melones Dam, as shown in Figure
8-3. Although portions of San Joaquin County could be subject to
flooding due to levee failure, the City of Tracy is not in close prox-
imity to the areas most likely to be affected.
2. Development in Flood Hazard Areas
Existing development within flood hazard areas in Tracy mainly in-
cludes portions of the West Valley Mall, some car dealerships, the
City’s wastewater treatment plant, a permanent detention basin, and
some rural residential areas. Future development areas primarily in-
clude areas designated Urban Reserve in the General Plan Land Use
map. As shown in Figure 8-4, there are no Urban Reserves located
within the 100-year floodplain. However, new development and rede-
velopment may occur within the primarily commercial and industrial
designated areas within the 100-year floodplain. These land use desig-
nations are described further in the Land Use Element.

New construction and substantial improvements to structures within
the 100-year floodplain are required to “have the lowest floor (includ-
ing the basement) elevated at least one foot above the base flood level”
or be of flood-proof construction.
3. Flood Protection Legislation and Agencies
According to recent legislation as part of SB 5 (Machado and Walk), SB
17 (Florez) and AB 162 (Wolk), urban and urbanizing areas in the Sac-
ramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley will be required to achieve, or
make adequate progress toward achieving, 200-year protection by the
year 2015 to continue to approve development in the floodplain. Spe-
cifically, AB 162 requires that each local jurisdiction’s Safety Element
include 200-year floodplain maps. Maps must be based on the best
available data on flood protection, including areas protected by State
and federal project levees, and areas outside of these areas.
The Central Valley Flood Protection Board (CVFPB) collaborates
with the US Army Corps of Engineers to manage and control flooding
in San Joaquin County from both the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Rivers. The CVFPB works with local, federal, and State governments
to plan, construct, operate, and maintain flood control projects. The
CVFPB is also responsible for issuing permits for projects potentially
located in areas designated as floodways.
According to California Government Code Sections 65302.9 and
65860.1, every jurisdiction located within the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Valley is required to update its General Plan in a manner consistent
with the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP) within 24
months after the CVFPP’s adoption, which is currently anticipated by
July 1, 2012. In addition, the locations of the State and local flood
management facilities, locations of flood hazard zones, and the proper-
                                                                          8-11

ties located in these areas must be mapped and consistent with the
CVFPP.
The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services (OES) also
manages flood protection by developing emergency preparedness plans
for the county. These plans include the Dam Failure Emergency Plan
and the Delta Flood Plan as well as the San Joaquin County Hazard
Mitigation Plan.
4. Evacuation Routes for Flooding Emergencies
The City of Tracy has identified major arterials to serve as evacuation
routes to Interstate 580 in the event of flooding or dam failure. The
following north/south arterials will serve as evacuation routes: Mac-
Arthur Drive, Tracy Boulevard, Corral Hollow Road, Lammers Road,
and Chrisman Road. The following east/west arterials will serve as
evacuation routes: 11th Street, Schulte Road and Linne Road.
B. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
Goal SA-2           A reduction of hazards related to flooding or in-
                    undation.
      Objective SA-2.1     Minimize flood risks to development.
      Policies
        P1.    Development shall only be allowed on lands within the
               100-year flood zone, if it will not:

     ♦ Create danger to life and property due to increased
       flood heights or velocities caused by excavation, fill,
       roads and intended use.
     ♦ Create difficult emergency vehicle access in times of
       flood.
     ♦ Create a safety hazard due to the unexpected heights,
       velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of
       the flood waters expected at the site.
     ♦ Create excessive costs in providing governmental ser-
       vices during and after flood conditions, including main-
       tenance and repair of public facilities.
     ♦ Interfere with the existing waterflow capacity of the
       floodway.
     ♦ Substantially increase erosion and/or sedimentation.
     ♦ Contribute to the deterioration of any watercourse or
       the quality of water in any body of water.
P2. Public and private development in the 100-year flood
    zones shall have the lowest floor elevated at least 1 foot
    above the base flood level, or be of flood proof construc-
    tion.
P3. The City shall prevent the construction of flood barriers
    within the 100-year flood zone that divert flood water or
    increase flooding in other areas.
P4. Property owners within the 100-year floodplain are en-
    couraged to purchase National Flood Insurance, which re-
    duces the financial risk from flooding and mudflows.

III.     WILDLAND FIRES
A. Background
This section addresses wildland fires. Additional information and
policies regarding urban fires are contained in the Public Facilities and
Services Element.
The risk of wildland fires is related to a combination of factors, includ-
ing winds, temperatures, humidity levels and fuel moisture content.
Of these four factors, wind is the most crucial. Steep slopes also con-
tribute to fire hazard by intensifying the effects of wind and making
fire suppression difficult. Features in some parts of the Planning Area,
including highly flammable vegetation, and warm and dry summers
with temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, create a
situation that results in potential wildland fires. Where there is easy
human access to dry vegetation, fire hazards increase because of the
                                                                          8-15

greater chance of human carelessness. High hazard areas include out-
lying residential parcels and open lands adjacent to residential areas.
To quantify this potential risk, the California Department of Forestry
(CDF) has developed a Fire Hazard Severity Scale that utilizes three
criteria in order to evaluate and designate potential fire hazards in
wildland areas. The criteria are fuel loading (vegetation), fire weather
(winds, temperatures, humidity levels and fuel moisture contents) and
topography (degree of slope).

IV.      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
A. Background
Products as diverse as gasoline, paint solvents, film processing chemi-
cals, household cleaning products, refrigerants and radioactive sub-
stances are categorized as hazardous materials. What remains of a haz-
ardous material after use or processing is considered to be a hazardous
waste. The handling, transportation and disposal of such waste is of
concern to all communities. Improper handling of hazardous materi-
als or wastes may result in significant effects to human health and the
environment.
Many businesses and residents in Tracy use hazardous materials and
generate some amount of hazardous waste. The most common haz-
ardous waste in Tracy are generated from gasoline service stations, dry
cleaners, automotive mechanics, auto body repair shops, machine
                                                                          8-17
C I T Y O F T R A C Y

S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
shops, printers and photo processors, and agriculture. Most of these
wastes are petroleum-based or hydrocarbon hazardous waste and in-
clude cleaning and paint solvents, lubricants and oils. However, medi-
cal wastes, defined as potential infectious waste from sources such as
laboratories, clinics and hospitals, are also included among the hazard-
ous wastes found in Tracy.
Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes in Tracy are heavily regu-
lated by a range of federal, State and local agencies. One of the pri-
mary hazardous materials regulatory agencies is the California Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Con-
trol (DTSC). DTSC is authorized by the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) to enforce and implement federal hazardous mate-
rials laws and regulations.
San Joaquin County has prepared a Hazardous Material Area Plan, in
accordance with the California Health and Safety Code (HSC) (Divi-
sion 20, Chapter 6.95, §25500 et seq.) and California Code of Regula-
tions (CCR) (Title 19, Article 3, §2270 et seq.). The Plan is designed to
protect human health and the environment through hazardous materi-
als emergency planning, response and agency coordination and com-
munity right-to-know programs. The Plan outlines the roles and re-
sponsibilities of federal, State, and local agencies in responding to haz-
ardous material releases and incidents. The City of Tracy’s Police and
Fire Departments work with San Joaquin County to implement this
plan.
The City of Tracy participates with San Joaquin County in a house-
hold hazardous waste program. Approximately 45,642 pounds of
household hazardous waste was collected from the events hosted in
8-18

Tracy. Tracy residents can also access the permanent household haz-
ardous waste consolidation facility located in Stockton.
The County Office of Emergency Services (OES) administers the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know program for the
Tracy Planning Area. Under Chapter 6.95 of the California Health
and Safety Code and the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, any business storing quantities of hazardous materials greater
than 55 gallons of liquid, 500 pounds of solid or 200 cubic feet of some
compressed gasses must file a hazardous materials business plan annu-
ally that establishes incident prevention measures, hazardous material
handing protocols and emergency response and evacuation procedures.

               impact on the natural environment or health and safety of
               future property owners or users.
        P3.    The safe transport of hazardous materials through Tracy
               shall be promoted by implementing the following meas-
               ures:
                ♦ Maintain formally-designated hazardous material carrier
                   routes to direct hazardous materials away from popu-
                   lated and other sensitive areas.
                ♦ Prohibit the parking of vehicles transporting hazardous
                   materials on City streets.
                ♦ Require that new pipelines and other channels carrying
                   hazardous materials avoid residential areas and other
                   immobile populations to the extent possible.
        P4.    Emergency response plans shall be submitted as part of use
               applications for all large generators of hazardous waste.
        P5.    The City shall continue to encourage the reduction of
               solid and hazardous wastes generated within the City, in
               accordance with countywide plans.

V.      AIRPORT SAFETY
A. Background
The Tracy Municipal Airport is a general aviation airport owned by
the City and managed by the Parks and Community Services Depart-
ment. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establishes dis-
tances of ground clearance for take-off and landing safety based on
such items as the type of aircraft using the airport. These areas iden-
tify land uses and dimensional standards for buildings within the ap-
proaches.
                                                                        8-21
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
The Tracy Municipal Airport is subject to the FAA, the California
Airport Land Use planning handbook, the Regional Aviation System
Plan, the San Joaquin County Airport Land Use Plan, and the City of
Tracy Airport Master Plan. These plans identify future improvements
for the Airport to meet future aviation needs and address airport safety
by identifying compatible land uses for adjacent areas. The San Joa-
quin County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) is an advisory
body that assists local agencies with ensuring the compatibility of land
uses in the vicinity of airports. The County ALUC reviews proposed
development projects for consistency with airport land use compatibil-
ity.
Airport operators recognize that uses that encroach upon and conflict
with airports can both reduce the ability of an airport to serve its func-
tion and can, over time, reduce the safety of airport operations and the
people and structures surrounding the Airport.

9 NOISE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and appraise noise
  generation in the community in order to minimize problems from
  intrusive sound and to ensure that development does not expose peo-
  ple to unacceptable noise levels.
  A. Background
  This section provides background information about how noise is
  measured, the regulatory framework governing noise and existing
  noise sources in Tracy.
  1. Understanding Noise
  Noise can be defined as a sound or series of sounds that are intrusive,
  irritating, objectionable and/or disruptive to daily life. Noise varies
  widely in its scope, source, and volume, ranging from individual oc-
  currences, such as a lawn mower, to the intermittent disturbances of
  train whistles, to the fairly constant noise generated by traffic on free-
  ways. Noise is primarily a concern when generated in the vicinity of
  noise-sensitive uses such as residences, schools, places of worship and
  hospitals.
  The objectionable nature of sound could be caused by its pitch or its
  loudness. Pitch is the height or depth of a tone or sound, depending
  on the relative rapidity (frequency) of the vibrations by which it is
  produced. Higher pitched signals sound louder to humans than
  sounds with a lower pitch. Loudness is intensity of sound waves com-
  bined with the reception characteristics of the ear. Intensity may be
  compared with the height of an ocean wave in that it is a measure of
  the amplitude of the sound wave.
                                                                         9-1
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
N O I S E E L E M E N T
In addition to the concepts of pitch and loudness, there are several
noise measurement scales which are used to describe noise in a particu-
lar location. These are listed in Table 9-1. The most basic unit of
measurement is the decibel (dB), which is a unit of measurement
which indicates the relative amplitude of a sound. The zero on the
decibel scale is based on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unim-
paired human ear can detect. Sound levels in decibels are calculated on
a logarithmic basis. An increase of 10 decibels represents a 10-fold in-
crease in acoustic energy, while 20 decibels is 100 times more intense,
30 decibels is 1,000 times more intense, etc. There is a relationship
between the subjective noisiness or loudness of a sound and its inten-
sity. Each 10 decibel increase in sound level is perceived as approxi-
mately a doubling of loudness over a fairly wide range of intensities.
Generally, the human ear cannot perceive a difference between two
noises that are less than three decibels different from one another.
There are several methods of characterizing sound. The most com-
mon in California is the A-weighted sound level or dBA. This scale gives
greater weight to the frequencies of sound to which the human ear is
most sensitive. Representative outdoor and indoor noise levels in
units of dBA are shown in Table 9-2. Because sound levels can vary
markedly over a short period of time, a method for describing either
the average character of the sound or the statistical behavior of the
variations must be utilized. Most commonly, environmental sounds
are described in terms of an average level that has the same acoustical
energy as the summation of all the time-varying events. This energy-
equivalent sound/noise descriptor is called Leq. The most common
averaging period is hourly, but Leq can describe any series of noise
events of arbitrary duration.

Since the sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at
night—because excessive noise interferes with the ability to sleep—24-
hour descriptors have been developed that incorporate artificial noise
penalties added to quiet-time noise events. The Community Noise
Equivalent Level, CNEL, is a measure of the cumulative noise exposure
in a community, with a 5 dB penalty added to evening (7:00 p.m. to
10:00 p.m.) and a 10 dB addition to nocturnal (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.)
noise levels. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn, is essentially the
same as CNEL, with the exception that the evening time period is
dropped and all occurrences during this three-hour period are grouped
into the daytime period.
2. Regulatory Framework
State law requires a Noise Element as part of all city and county Gen-
eral Plans. The Noise Element should provide a systematic approach
to the measurement and modeling of noise, the establishment of noise
standards, the control of major noise sources, and community plan-
ning for the regulation of noise. This Noise Element provides baseline
information on the existing noise environment, including noise meas-
urements taken throughout the city. It also identifies noise sensitive uses
in Tracy. This Noise Element also provides goals, objectives, policies
and actions for controlling noise in existing and future development.
The Noise Element establishes uniformity between City policy and
programs undertaken to control and abate environmental noise. The
Government Code and State Office of Noise Control (ONC) Guide-
lines require that certain major noise sources and areas containing
noise sensitive land uses be identified and quantified by preparing gen-
eralized noise exposure contours for current and projected levels of
activity within the community. Contours may be prepared in terms
of either the Community Noise Equivalent (CNEL) or the Day/Night
                                                                            9-5

Average Level (Ldn) which are both descriptors of total noise exposure
at a given location for an annual average day. The noise exposure in-
formation developed for the Noise Element is incorporated into this
General Plan to serve as a basis for achieving land use compatibility
with respect to noise. Noise exposure information is used to provide
baseline levels and noise source identification for use in the develop-
ment and enforcement of a local noise control ordinance and for en-
suring compliance with the State’s noise insulation standards.
According to the Government Code and ONC Guidelines, the follow-
ing major noise sources should be considered in the preparation of a
Noise Element:
   Highways and freeways
   Primary arterials and major local streets
   Railroad operations
   Aircraft and airport operations
   Local industrial facilities
   Other stationary sources
3. Land Use Compatibility
Land uses deemed noise sensitive by the State of California include
schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term care and mental care facilities.
Many jurisdictions consider residential uses particularly noise sensitive
because families and individuals expect to use time in the home for rest
and relaxation, and noise can interfere with those activities. Some
variability in standards for noise sensitivity may apply to different
densities of residential development, and single-family uses are fre-
quently considered the most sensitive. Jurisdictions may identify
other uses as noise sensitive such as churches, libraries, day care cen-
ters, and parks.

Land uses that are relatively insensitive to noise include some office
and retail developments. There is a range of insensitive noise receptors
which generate significant noise levels or where human occupancy is
typically low. Examples of insensitive uses include industrial and
manufacturing uses, utilities, agriculture, vacant land, parking lots,
salvage yards, and transit terminals.
The ONC has developed a noise/land use compatibility matrix show-
ing noise standards for various land use categories. The noise stan-
dards are intended to provide guidelines for the development of mu-
nicipal noise elements. Depending on the environment of a particular
community, these basic guidelines may be tailored to reflect the exist-
ing noise and land use characteristics of a particular community.
California’s noise insulation standards were officially adopted by the
California Commission of Housing and Community Development in
1974 and became effective on August 22, 1974. On November 14,
1988, the Building Standards Commission approved revisions to these
standards (Title 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). The rul-
ing states: “Interior noise levels attributable to exterior sources shall
not exceed 45 dB in any habitable room. The noise metric shall be
measured in either CNEL or Ldn, consistent with the noise element of
the local general plan.” Additionally, the commission specifies that
residential buildings or structures to be located within exterior Ldn (or
dBA) contours of 60 dB or greater of an existing or adopted freeway,
expressway, parkway, major street, thoroughfare, rail line, rapid tran-
sit line or industrial noise source shall require an acoustical analysis
showing that the building has been designed to limit intruding noise to
an interior Ldn of 45 dB.
                                                                            9-7

4. Existing Noise Sources
The most significant sources of noise in Tracy are vehicular traffic on
Interstate 205 and the local street network. Railroad trains intermit-
tently generate noise levels that are significant along the railroad
tracks. General aviation aircraft using the Tracy Municipal Airport
also contribute to intermittent noise levels in Tracy. Noise is also
generated on individual parcels whether industrial, office, retail or
residential. These noise sources are regulated by the City’s Noise Or-
dinance and do not affect the overall noise environment throughout
the community.
   Daily Noise Measurements. Noise levels were monitored at 10
     locations in Tracy over a period of three days in June of 2003.
     Noise levels were monitored by Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc. at two
     locations along Interstate 205 previously during preparation of the
     Noise Study Report for Improvements to the I-205 freeway. The
     measured data are summarized in Table 9-3.
   Short-Term Spot Measurements. Short-term spot measurements
     were made at 10 locations throughout Tracy in June of 2003 to
     characterize typical daytime noise levels and to collect traffic and
     noise data to be used subsequently in the computation of traffic
     noise contours for the General Plan. The data in Table 9-3 also
     shows the estimated Ldn for the short-term spot measurements
     based on correlations with long-term measurements nearby. The
     average noise levels (Leq) range from about 51 dBA in a quiet rear
     yard up to 63 dBA along MacArthur Drive.
   Roadways. Vehicular traffic on the street network was the domi-
     nant noise source during measurements. There were contributions
     from local neighborhood noise, a tractor at a rural location (ST-3),
     and a train was heard at Location ST-4 along MacArthur Drive
     near Eleventh Street which generated a maximum level of 68 dBA.

     General aviation aircraft at Location ST-5 generated a maximum
     level of 55 dBA but automobiles and motorcycles were typically
     10 dBA louder. At the Schulte Road location (ST-8) distant traffic,
     a distant aircraft, wind in the vegetation, and crows were all audi-
     ble contributing to a quiet rural noise environment in the back-
     yard of this home. Noise contours for roadways are presented in
     Table 9-4.
a. Tracy Municipal Airport
The Tracy Municipal Airport is located in the southern portion of the
City between Tracy Boulevard and Corral Hollow Road, and is a
source of noise in its vicinity. According to the 2009 Airport Land
Use Compatibility Plan, there are currently approximately 60,000 an-
nual airport operations. These are comprised mostly of single-engine
light aircraft (maximum gross weight 12,000 lbs.), some twin-engine
aircraft, and occasional corporate jets. There are no jets currently
based at the Airport. Other activities at the Airport include two hot
air balloon companies, Ultralights, and an area where aerobatic flight
is allowed. The 2009 Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan contains
existing and future CNEL noise contours for Tracy Municipal Airport
as shown in Figures 9-1 and 9-2 on pages 9-15 and 9-16.
b. Railroads
Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) provides passenger rail service
between Stockton and San Jose. The ACE Station for Tracy is located
on Tracy Boulevard at Linne Road. There are currently three ACE
trains per day which arrive in Tracy between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.
and return between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.

There are three major rail lines that enter the City of Tracy from the
east, two of which merge and subsequently exit to the west. The rail
lines are owned by Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR). The main line
runs through south Tracy along Linne Road. This line is used both as
an industrial (10 freights per day) and commuter (via ACE train ser-
vice) rail. Train noise contour distances are shown in Table 9-5 .
c. Truck Routes
The City of Tracy has a specific city ordinance relating to truck routes
(Section 3.08.310 of the Tracy Municipal Code). The ordinance de-
fines weight restrictions, specifies the ability of trucks to enter areas
not designated as truck routes, and defines the truck routes within the
city. The designated truck routes in the city are discussed in the Cir-
culation Element of this General Plan.
B. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
Goal N-1            A citizenry protected from excessive noise.
     Objective N-1.1        Ensure appropriate exterior and interior noise
     levels for new land uses.
     Policies
        P1.       Noise sensitive land uses shall not be located in areas
                  with noise levels that exceed those considered normally
                  acceptable for each land use unless measures can be im-
                  plemented to reduce noise to acceptable levels.

                  ment projects that exceed the following criteria:
                    Cause the Ldn at noise-sensitive uses to increase by
                     3 dB or more and exceed the “normally acceptable”
                     level.
                    Cause the Ldn at noise-sensitive uses to increase 5 dB

                     good condition and appropriate for the equipment.
                    Locate stationary noise-generating equipment as far as
                     possible from sensitive receptors when sensitive re-
                     ceptors adjoin or are near a construction area.

                  Element. Techniques include:
                    Designing landscaped building setbacks to serve as a
                      buffer between the noise source and receptor.
                    Placing noise-tolerant land uses, such as parking lots,
                      maintenance facilities, and utility areas between the
                      noise source, such as highways and railroad tracks,
                      and receptor.
                    Orienting buildings to shield noise sensitive outdoor
                      spaces from a noise source.
                    Locating bedrooms or balconies on the sides of build-
                      ings facing away from noise sources.
                    Utilizing noise barriers (e.g., fences, walls, or land-
                      scaped berms) to reduce adverse noise levels in noise-
                      sensitive outdoor activity areas.
        P6.       The City shall seek to reduce impacts from groundborne
                  vibration associated with rail operations by requiring
                  that vibration-sensitive buildings (e.g., residences) are
                  sited at least 100 feet from the centerline of the railroad
                  tracks whenever feasible. The development of vibration-
                  sensitive buildings within 100 feet from the centerline of
                  the railroad tracks would require a study demonstrating
                  that ground borne vibration issues associated with rail
                  operations have been adequately addressed (i.e., through
                  building siting or construction techniques).

10 AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
   Under California Government Code Section 65302.1, the California
   Legislature determined that the San Joaquin Valley has a serious air
   pollution problem and required that cities and counties include goals,
   policies, objectives, and feasible implementation strategies to improve
   air quality. This Air Quality Element addresses this requirement by
   including updated information on air quality conditions, the regula-
   tory environment, and goals, objectives, policies and actions to im-
   prove air quality in and around the City of Tracy.
   Improving regional air quality is a complex regional problem that will
   involve the cooperation of all branches of local governments, busi-
   nesses, and the public to solve. This Element describes the planning
   efforts that the City of Tracy will implement to help improve air qual-
   ity both at the regional and local levels. Since automobile use is the
   greatest contributor to air pollution problems in the region, strategies
   are primarily aimed at reducing these emissions from current and fu-
   ture development and this information supplements the policies and
   actions in the Land Use, Community Character and Circulation Ele-
   ments. Strategies to protect the public from local sources of air pollu-
   tion are also addressed.
   A. Background
   Tracy is located in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, which is about 35
   miles wide and 250 miles long. Surrounded by mountain ranges, the
   air basin drains to the north, with an opening at the Carquinez Strait
   leading into San Francisco Bay and then the Pacific.
   Wet winters and dry summers characterize the Tracy region’s inland
   Mediterranean-type climate. Climate is temperate, with an average
                                                                       10-1

annual high of 75 degrees and an average low of 47 degrees. Rainfall
totals can vary widely over a short distance with windward mountain
areas west of Tracy averaging over 24 inches of rain and shadow areas,
such as the city proper, averaging about 10 inches annually. During
stormy periods, horizontal and vertical air movement ensures rapid
pollutant dispersal. Rain also washes out particulate and other pollut-
ants. Conversely, during calm periods, pollutant levels can build up to
unhealthy levels.
Winds from March to November typically blow from the west near
Tracy. During winter months, winds are more common and are
caused by colder air from surrounding mountains flowing down into
the valley floor and then out toward the Delta.
Normally, air temperatures decrease with increasing elevations. Of-
tentimes this normal pattern is inverted in the San Joaquin Valley,
with warm air aloft, and cooler air trapped near the earth’s surface.
This atmospheric condition occurs in all seasons. In summer, espe-
cially when wind speeds are very low, a strong inversion will trap air
emissions near the surface allowing high levels of ozone smog to de-
velop. In winter, persistent inversions can trap emissions of particu-
late (e.g. woodsmoke) and carbon monoxide near the surface, resulting
in unhealthful air quality.
The potential for serious summer air pollution in the San Joaquin Val-
ley is strong because of high surface temperatures, plentiful sunshine,
relatively stable air (caused by inversions), and mountains that trap
emissions. In winter, low rainfall, strong inversions and weak winds
allow emissions to build up to high levels. In Tracy, local pollution
sources are augmented by emissions transported from upwind sources.
Conversely, air pollutant emissions created in Tracy can be trans-

ported toward other communities by the wind, and contribute to un-
healthful levels in those areas. Hence controlling air pollution requires
both local and regional efforts and unified programs to achieve clean
air.
B. Regulatory Framework
The federal and California Clean Air Acts have established ambient air
quality standards for different pollutants. National ambient air quality
standards (NAAQS) were established by the federal Clean Air Act of
1970 (amended in 1977 and 1990) for six “criteria” pollutants. These
criteria pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitro-
gen dioxide (N02), particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 mi-
crons (PM10), sulfur dioxide (S02), and lead (Pb). In 1997, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) added fine particu-
late matter (PM2.5) as a criteria pollutant. These air pollutants for
which standards have been established are considered the most preva-
lent air pollutants that are known to be hazardous to human health.
California ambient air quality standards (CAAQS) include the
NAAQS pollutants described above, as well as hydrogen sulfide, sul-
fates, vinyl chloride, and visibility-reducing particulates. These addi-
tional CAAQS pollutants tend to have unique sources and are not
typically examined in environmental air quality assessments. In addi-
tion, lead concentrations have decreased dramatically since it was re-
moved from motor vehicle fuels.
Table 10-1 summarizes the air quality standards and provides a brief
description of the six criteria air pollutants.

1. Federal Regulations
At the federal level, the US EPA administers and enforces air quality
regulations. Federal air quality regulations were developed primarily
from implementation of the federal Clean Air Act. If an area does not
meet NAAQS over a set period of three years, the US EPA designates
it as a "nonattainment" area for that particular pollutant. The US
EPA requires that States which have areas that do not comply with the
national standards prepare and submit air quality plans showing how
the standards would be met. If the States cannot show how the stan-
dards would be met, they must demonstrate progress toward meeting
the standards. These plans are referred to as State Implementation
Plans (SIPs). Under severe cases, the US EPA may impose a federal
plan that would ensure progress toward meeting the federal standards.
The US EPA also has programs for identifying and regulating hazard-
ous air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act requires the US EPA to
set standards for these pollutants and sharply reduce emissions of con-
trolled chemicals. Industries are classified as major stationary sources
if they emit certain amounts of hazardous air pollutants. The US EPA
also sets standards to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants
through mobile source control programs. These programs include
reformulated gasoline requirements, national low emissions vehicle
standards, Tier 2 motor vehicle emission standards, gasoline sulfur
control requirements, and heavy-duty engine standards.
The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin is subject to major air quality plan-
ning programs required by the federal Clean Air Act (1977, last
amended in 1990, 42 United States Code [USC] 7401 et seq.) to address
ozone, particulate matter air pollution, and carbon monoxide. The
federal Clean Air Act requires that regional planning and air pollution
control agencies prepare a regional Air Quality Plan to outline the
                                                                          10-5
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
measures by which both stationary and mobile sources of pollutants
can be controlled in order to achieve all standards within the deadlines
specified in the federal Clean Air Act.
2. State Regulations
The California Clean Air Act (1988, amended in 1992) establishes the
CAAQS. These standards address all of the pollutants covered under
the national standards with more stringent thresholds, and addition-
ally regulate levels of vinyl chloride, hydrogen sulfide, sulfates, and
visibility-reducing particulates. The California Clean Air Act outlines
a program for areas in the State to attain CAAQS by the earliest prac-
tical date. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is the State air
pollution control agency and is a part of the California Environmental
Protection Agency. If an area does not meet CAAQS, CARB desig-
nates the area as a nonattainment area. The San Joaquin Valley Air
Basin does not meet the CAAQS for O3, PM10 and PM2.5. CARB re-
quires regions that do not meet CAAQS for O3 to submit clean air
plans that describe a process to attain the standard or demonstrate
progress toward attainment.
In addition to regulations under the US EPA, CARB further regulates
the amount of air pollutants that can be emitted by new motor vehi-
cles sold in California. California motor vehicle emissions standards
have always been more stringent than federal standards since they
were first imposed in 1961. CARB has also developed Inspection and
Maintenance (I/M) and “Smog Check” programs with the California
Bureau of Automotive Repair. Inspection programs for trucks and
buses have also been implemented. In addition, CARB has authority
to set standards for fuel sold in California.

3. San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) is
made up of eight counties in California’s Central Valley, including:
San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and
the San Joaquin Valley portion of Kern. The primary role of
SJVAPCD is to develop plans and implement control measures in the
San Joaquin Valley to control air pollution. These controls primarily
affect stationary sources such as industry and power plants. Rules and
regulations have been developed by SJVAPCD to control air pollution
from a wide range of air pollution sources. Recently, an indirect
source review rule was adopted; this rule controls air pollution from
new land developments. SJVAPCD also conducts public education
and outreach efforts, such as the Spare the Air, Wood Burning, and
Smoking Vehicle voluntary programs. SJVAPCD must routinely re-
port its progress to CARB and the US EPA in attaining ambient air
quality standards in the air basin. It must also periodically revise its
attainment plans to reflect new conditions and requirements.
a. Rules and Regulations
SJVAPCD has several rules and regulations that pertain either directly
or indirectly to land use development projects affected by General
Plans. A list of rules, which may apply to General Plan projects, is
provided below.
i.  SJVAPCD Indirect Source Review Rule
SJVAPCD adopted the Indirect Source Review Rule (ISR or Rule
9510) in 2006 to reduce O3 precursors (i.e. ROG and NOx) and PM10
emissions from new development projects. The Rule is the result of
State requirements outlined in the region’s portion of the State Im-
plementation Plan (SIP). SJVAPCD’s SIP commitments are contained
in the 2004 Extreme Ozone Attainment Demonstration Plan and the
                                                                          10-7

C I T Y O F T R A C Y

A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
2003 PM10 Plan, which identify the need to reduce PM10 and NOx in
order to attain and maintain the ambient air pollution standards on
schedule. New projects that would generate substantial air pollutant
emissions and for which final discretionary approval would be granted
after March 1, 2006, are subject to this Rule. The Rule requires pro-
jects to mitigate both construction and operational period emissions
by applying the SJVAPCD-approved mitigation measures and paying
fees to support programs that reduce emissions. Fees are based on es-
timated costs to reduce the emissions and include expected costs to
cover administration of the program.
ii. Regulation VIII – Fugitive PM10
SJVAPCD controls fugitive PM10 through Regulation VIII (Fugitive
PM10 Prohibitions). The purpose of this regulation is to reduce ambi-
ent concentrations of PM10 by requiring actions to prevent, reduce or
mitigate anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions (i.e. dust that is released
into the air by wind or other forces). This applies to activities such as
construction, bulk materials, open areas, paved and unpaved roads,
material transport, and agricultural areas. Sources regulated are re-
quired to provide dust control plans that meet the regulation require-
ments. Fees are collected by SJVAPCD to cover costs for reviewing
plans and conducting field inspections.
iii. Regulation IV, Rule 4901 – Residential Wood Smoke
SJVAPCD Rule 4901 regulates emissions from residential fireplaces
and wood burning heaters and provides educational information to
reduce wood smoke emissions. The provisions of the Rule apply to
new home construction, existing home retrofit, or homes that are
transferred through a real estate transfer. Wood burning heaters are
required to be EPA Phase II Certified. Wood burning residential fire-
places are prohibited in residential developments with a density greater

                                             A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
than two dwelling units per acre. More than two EPA Phase II Certi-
fied wood burning heaters per acre are prohibited in any new residen-
tial development with a density equal to or greater than three dwelling
units per acre. Only one fireplace is allowed per dwelling unit where
the density is less than two dwelling units per acre.
b. Attainment Plans
The primary criteria air pollutants that affect the Tracy region include
ozone (O3) precursors (i.e. NOx and ROG), carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and suspended particulate matter (PM10 and
PM2.5). Other criteria pollutants, such as lead (Pb) and sulfur dioxide
(SO2), are not substantially emitted in the area; furthermore, air qual-
ity standards for Pb and SO2 are being met throughout the San Joa-
quin Valley Air Basin.
SJVAPCD has adopted O3 and PM2.5 attainment plans. These plans
include all measures (i.e. federal, State, and local) that would be im-
plemented through rule making or program funding to reduce air pol-
lutant emissions. Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) are part
of these plans.
i.   Ozone (O3)
The San Joaquin Valley suffers from high levels of ground-level O3,
which can lead to serious health effects, such as asthma, and harm local
crops. As a result, the area has been designated by the US EPA as a
serious nonattainment area, and CARB has designated the area as a
severe nonattainment area. In response, the SJVAPCD has prepared
several plans since 1994 to address attainment of both the federal and
State O3 standards.
                                                                          10-9
C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
The San Joaquin Valley region’s 2004 Extreme Ozone Attainment
Demonstration Plan addresses the old one-hour O3 national standard.
The region’s 2007 Ozone Plan, addressing the eight-hour O3 NAAQS,
was submitted to US EPA in June 2007 and is currently under review.
This Plan predicts attainment of the O3 national standard throughout
90 percent of the district by 2020 and throughout the entire district by
2024. To accomplish these goals, the Plan would reduce the emissions
of O3 precursor pollutants, including the reduction of NOx emissions
by 75 percent and ROG emissions by 25 percent. The Ozone Attain-
ment Plans also address planning requirements imposed by the State to
show progress toward meeting the State O3 standard. While the 2007
Ozone Plan is under review, commitments made in the 2004 Ozone
Attainment Plan still apply.
ii. Particulate Matter
US EPA recently approved the 2007 PM10 Maintenance Plan and Re-
quest for Redesignation. The San Joaquin Valley region now meets
the NAAQS for PM10 and has an approved plan for maintaining that
status.
The SJVAPCD adopted the 2008 PM2.5 Plan on April 30, 2008, after
which CARB approved it on May 22, 2008. The Plan is now under
review by the US EPA. The goal of this Plan is to ensure that the Val-
ley will attain the 1997 PM2.5 standard and make progress toward at-
taining the new 2006 standard and the State standard. The Plan uses
control measures to reduce NOx, which also leads to fine particulate
formation in the atmosphere. The Plan incorporates measures to re-
duce direct emissions of PM2.5, including a strengthening of the wood-
burning rules. The Plan also contains recent and proposed actions by
CARB to reduce diesel particulate matter emissions from on- and off-
10-10

road mobile sources. Attainment plans for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS
are not required until 2012 at the earliest.1
c. General Plan Guidance
The SJVAPCD also works with cities and counties to develop General
Plans that will help create better air quality in the future. To this end,
the SJVAPCD prepared the Air Quality Guidelines for General Plans
that sets forth 77 goals, policies, and implementation strategies for air
quality. The Guidelines emphasize a comprehensive approach to air
quality planning that would reach the entire community. According
to the SJVAPCD, the Guidelines’ suggestions for General Plans can be
summarized as follows:
   Determine and mitigate project level and cumulative air quality
    impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act
    (CEQA).
   Integrate land use plans, transportation plans, and air quality plans.
   Plan land uses in ways that support a multi-modal transportation
    system.
   Support local and regional programs that reduce congestion and
    vehicle trips.
   Plan land uses to minimize exposure of citizens and workers to
    toxic air pollutant emissions from industrial and other sources.
   Support the SJVAPCD and public utility programs that reduce
    emissions from energy consumption and area sources, including
    water heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces and barbecues.

           In September 2006, the US EPA revised the 24-hour NAAQS for PM2.5
from 65 μg/m3 to 35 μg/m3.

4. Buffers from Sources of Air Pollution and Odors
SJVAPCD and CARB recommend that communities include buffers
between sensitive receptors and sources of air toxic contaminant emis-
sions and odors. In April 2005, CARB released the final version of the
Air Quality and Land Use Handbook, which is intended to encourage
local land use agencies to consider the risks from air pollution prior to
making decisions that approve the siting of new sensitive receptors
near sources of air pollution. Unlike industrial or stationary sources
of air pollution, siting of new sensitive receptors does not require air
quality permits, but could create air quality problems. The primary
purpose of the CARB document is to highlight the potential health
impacts associated with proximity to common air pollution sources,
so that those issues are considered in the planning process. CARB
makes recommendations regarding the siting of new sensitive land uses
near freeways, truck distribution centers, dry cleaners, gasoline dis-
pensing stations, and other air pollution sources (see Table 10-2).
These “advisory” recommendations are based primarily on modeling
information for studies conducted throughout the state and may not
be entirely reflective of conditions in Tracy. Siting of new sensitive
land uses within these recommended distances may be appropriate due
to site-specific conditions (e.g., source strength or meteorology), but
should only be done after site-specific studies are conducted to identify
the actual health risks. CARB acknowledges that land use agencies
have to balance other siting considerations such as housing and trans-
portation needs, economic development priorities and other quality of
life issues. Buffers should be considered with existing and proposed
industrial sources to avoid health, odor and nuisance impacts.

C. Existing Air Quality Conditions
1. Criteria Pollutants
Ambient air quality is affected by the rate and concentration of pollut-
ant emissions and meteorological conditions. Factors such as wind
speed, atmospheric stability, and mixing height all affect the atmos-
phere's ability to mix and disperse pollutants. Long-term variations in
air quality typically result from changes in emissions, while short-term
variations result from changes in atmospheric conditions. There are
several continuous air monitoring stations operated by government
agencies in the Tracy area. Measured air pollutant data indicate that
ground-level O3, PM10, and PM2.5, are the air pollutants of greatest
concern because concentrations in the area exceed health-based stan-
dards each year.
                                                                                      10-13

The monitors in Tracy and Stockton are generally representative of air
quality in this part of the San Joaquin Valley. Ambient air pollution
data typically receives great scrutiny and quality assurance testing, so
final data lags about one year behind the current calendar year. State
and federal air quality standards, as well as the highest local air pollut-
ant levels measured over the past five years (2002-2006) are reported in
Table 10-3.
In general, air quality in San Joaquin County between 2002 and 2006
has been better than other parts of the San Joaquin Valley. During
this time, the State one-hour O3 standard was exceeded 3 to 12 times a
year. The national eight-hour O3 standards were exceeded 1 to 3 days a
year. State PM10 standards are calculated to have been exceeded from
18 to 63 days a year. The 1997 federal PM2.5 daily standards were ex-
ceeded on only one day in 2005. Statistics for the new federal PM2.5
standards have not yet been compiled, since the standard went into
effect in late 2006. Standards for all other criteria pollutants were not
exceeded in the five-year period.
CARB publishes an almanac each year that evaluates air quality trends
statewide. It also makes forecasts about future pollution levels. Ac-
cording to CARB, emission sources for O3 precursors in the San Joa-
quin Valley are from both motor vehicles and industry, with oil fields
at the south end of the Valley producing high NOx levels. Agricul-
ture, fugitive dust from paved and unpaved roads, and waste burning
all contribute to high background levels of PM10.
From 1980 to 2005, population increased 85 percent while Vehicle
Miles Traveled increased 202 percent. Much of this increase is due to
the way communities are designed, as well as housing pricing that en-
courage long commutes. In spite of this dramatic increase in vehicle

travel, controls on stationary and mobile sources improved O3 air
quality. Basin-wide emissions of NOx have decreased by 68 percent
and ROG emissions have been reduced by 27 percent, reducing the
number of days that O3 standards were exceeded by 30 to 40 percent.
Likewise, control measures have reduced PM10 levels by about 30 per-
cent. However, the San Joaquin Valley still has some of the worst air
pollution in the nation.
2. Attainment Status
Areas that do not violate ambient air quality standards are considered
to have attained the standard. Violations of ambient air quality stan-
dards are based on air pollutant monitoring data and are judged for
each air pollutant. The San Joaquin Valley as a whole does not meet
State or federal ambient air quality standards for ground level O3 and
PM2.5. The region recently attained the federal PM10 standard, but still
does not meet the State PM10 standard. The attainment status for the
Valley is described in Table 10-4.
Under the federal Clean Air Act, the US EPA has classified the region
as serious nonattainment for the eight-hour O3 standard. On March
19, 2008, the US EPA posted a final rule in the Federal Register affirm-
ing the Agency’s October 30, 2006 determination that the Valley has
attained the NAAQS for PM10. The Valley is designated nonattain-
ment for the older 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. The US EPA designations for
the new 2006 PM2.5 standards will be finalized in December 2009.
SJVAPCD has determined, as of the 2004-06 PM2.5 data, that the Val-
ley has attained the 1997 24-hour PM2.5 standard; however, the US
EPA has not acted on that finding. The US EPA classifies the region
as attainment or unclassified for all other air pollutants.

At the State level, the region is considered serious nonattainment for
ground level O3 and nonattainment for PM10 and PM2.5, as the Califor-
nia ambient air quality standards are more stringent than the national
standards. The region is required to adopt plans on a triennial basis
that show progress towards meeting the State O3 standard. The area is
considered attainment or unclassified for all other pollutants.
D. California Greenhouse Gases
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, or greenhouse gases (GHGs),
regulate the earth’s temperature. This is known as the Greenhouse
Effect, which is responsible for maintaining a habitable climate.
                                                                                     10-17

C I T Y O F T R A C Y
G E N E R A L P L A N
A I R Q U A L I T Y E L E M E N T
GHGs are emitted by natural processes and human activities. Emis-
sions from human activities, including motor vehicle use, electricity
production, industry, and agriculture, are elevating the concentration
of GHGs in the atmosphere, and have led to a trend of unnatural
warming of the earth’s natural climate, known as global warming or
climate change.
An expanding body of scientific research supports the theory that
global warming is currently affecting changes in weather patterns, av-
erage sea level, ocean acidification, chemical reaction rates and precipi-
tation rates, and that it will increasingly do so in the future. The cli-
mate and several naturally-occurring resources within California could
be adversely affected by the global warming trend. Increased precipi-
tation and sea level rise could increase coastal flooding, saltwater intru-
sion (a particular concern in the low-lying Sacramento–San Joaquin
Delta, where potable water delivery pumps could be threatened), and
degradation of wetlands. Mass migration and/or loss of plant and
animal species could also occur. Potential effects of global climate
change that could adversely affect human health include, but are not
necessarily limited to, more extreme heat waves and heat-related stress;
an increase in climate-sensitive diseases; more frequent and intense
natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and drought; and in-
creased levels of air pollution.
Prominent GHGs that contribute to global warming include the fol-
lowing gases, in addition to ozone and water vapor.
   Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, byproducts of fossil fuel com-
     bustion.
   Nitrous oxide, associated with agricultural operations such as crop
     fertilization.

     tices (e.g. keeping livestock) and landfill operation.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, widely used in the past as refrigerants, pro-
     pellants and cleaning solvents, but their production has been
     stopped by international treaty.
   Hydrofluorocarbons, now used as a substitute for chlorofluoro-
     carbons in refrigeration and cooling.
   Perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride emissions, commonly
     created by industries such as aluminum production and semi-
     conductor manufacturing.
1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
California is the second largest emitter of GHGs in the country and
the fifteenth largest in the world. California GHG emissions or CO2
equivalent emissions was estimated at 484 million metric tons of
equivalent CO2 emissions (MMTCO2e) in 2004, which is about 7 per-
cent of the emissions from the entire United States (CARB 2007).
While California is the second largest emitter of GHGs, behind Texas,
it has the lowest per capita rate of GHG emissions in the country. It is
estimated that the United States contributes up to 35 percent of the
world’s CO2 equivalent emissions. Transportation is the largest
source of GHG emissions in California, contributing about 38 percent
of the emissions. Electricity generation is second at over 23 percent.
Industrial activities account for about 20 percent of the State’s emis-
sions. Under a “business as usual” scenario, GHG emissions are esti-
mated to increase to approximately 600 MMTCO2e. CARB staff has
estimated the 1990 statewide emissions level to be 427 MMTCO2e.
Therefore, in order to meet the AB 32 requirement to reduce GHG
emissions to the 1990 levels by 2020, the State will need to reduce its
2020 “business as usual” emission levels by almost 30 percent.
                                                                           10-19

2. Greenhouse Gas Regulations
The State of California is concerned about GHG emissions and their
effect on global climate change. Possible impacts in California from
this climate change include reduced snow pack, increased risk of large
wildfires, increased flooding and drought potential, and reductions in
the quality and quantity of agricultural products.
California first addressed climate change in 1988 with the passage of
AB 4420 directing the California Energy Commission to study global
warming impacts to the state and develop an inventory of GHG emis-
sion sources. California began adopting regulations to reduce GHG
emissions following the passage of Assembly Bill 1493 in 2002, also
known as the Pavley Bill. This legislation directed CARB to adopt
regulations that achieve the maximum feasible and cost effective reduc-
tion in GHG emissions from motor vehicles.
In 2005, the Governor of California issued Executive Order S-3-05,
which included GHG emission reduction targets. To meet these tar-
gets, the Governor directed State agencies to develop a Climate Action
Plan. A Climate Action Team, led by the Secretary of the California
EPA, implements the global warming emission reduction programs
identified in the Climate Action Plan and reports on progress made
toward meeting the Governor’s GHG emission targets.
In 2006, the Governor of California signed AB 32, the Global Warm-
ing Solutions Act, into legislation. This bill requires that California
cap its GHG emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. This legislation requires
that CARB establish a program for statewide GHG emissions report-
ing, as well as monitoring and enforcement of that program. CARB is
also required to adopt rules and regulations to achieve the maximum
technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG emission reductions.

To meet these regulatory requirements, CARB published a list of dis-
crete GHG emissions reduction measures that can be implemented
immediately. In addition, CARB’s Early Action Plan identified regu-
lations and measures that could be implemented in the near future to
reduce GHG emissions.
California Senate Bill 97, which was signed into law in 2007, acknowl-
edges that climate change is an important environmental issue that re-
quires analysis under CEQA. The bill directs the State to prepare, de-
velop, and transmit to State resource agencies guidelines for feasible
mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions. The
resource agencies are required to adopt these guidelines by 2010.
CARB is targeting other sources of emissions. The main measures to
reduce GHG emissions will be contained in the AB32 Scoping Plan.
A Proposed Scoping Plan was released in October 2008 and adopted
on December 12, 2008. This plan includes a range of GHG reduction
actions. Central to the draft plan is a cap and trade program covering
85 percent of the State's emissions. This program will be developed in
conjunction with the Western Climate Initiative, comprised of seven
states and three Canadian provinces, to create a regional carbon mar-
ket. The plan also proposes that utilities produce a third of their en-
ergy from renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal, and
proposes to expand and strengthen existing energy efficiency programs
and building and appliance standards. The plan also includes full im-
plementation of the Pavley standards to provide a wide range of less
polluting and more efficient cars and trucks to consumers who will
save on operating costs through reduced fuel use. It also calls for de-
velopment and implementation of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard,
which will require oil companies to make cleaner domestically pro-
                                                                        10-21

duced fuels. With adoption of the Scoping Plan, the regulatory proc-
ess began to implement the plan. This will last two years.
Pursuant to SB 97, the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research
(OPR) recently released updated CEQA guidelines to address GHGs.
OPR recommends that each public agency develop an approach to
addressing GHG emissions that is based on best available information.
The approach includes three basic steps: (1) identify and quantify emis-
sions; (2) assess the significance of the emissions; and (3) if emissions
are significant, identify mitigation measures or alternatives that will
reduce the impact to a less-than-significant level. The guidelines en-
courage agencies to consider a number of factors in evaluating GHG
emissions, including the impact of the project on attaining the State’s
goal of reducing GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, as directed in
AB 32, and the extent of potential reductions in GHG emissions from
the proposed project in comparison to the existing setting

B. Terminology
Acceptable Risk
A hazard that is deemed to be a tolerable exposure to danger given the
expected benefits to be obtained. The level of loss, injury or destruc-
tion below which no specific action by local government is deemed
necessary other than making the risk known. Different levels of ac-
ceptable risk may be assigned according to the potential danger and the
criticalness of the threatened structure. The levels may range from
“near zero” for nuclear plants and natural gas transmission lines to
“moderate” for farm structures and low-intensity warehouse uses.

Building Height
The vertical distance from the average contact ground level of a build-
ing to the highest point of the coping, whether a flat roof, the deck
line of a mansard roof, or to the mean height level between eaves and
ridge for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof. The exact definition varies by
community. For example, in some communities building height is
measured to the highest point of the roof, not including elevator and
cooling towers.
Buildout
Development of land to its full potential, or theoretical capacity, as
permitted under current or proposed planning or zoning designations.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

The legal boundaries of the geographical area subject to the jurisdic-
tion of the City of Tracy’s government. For example, development
applications for properties located within the City limits must be re-
viewed by the City.

ally provide two travel lanes for automobiles, and may also have bicy-
cle lanes.
Commercial (C)
A land use designation that allows for a wide range of land use types,
including retail, entertainment and professional offices, often serving
neighborhoods with services and retail goods of interest to residents.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a variety of single-
noise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the
evening (7 PM to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) periods, re-
spectively, to allow for the greater sensitivity to noise during these
hours.
Community Park
A large park, generally 15 acres or more, that includes a mix of passive
and active recreation areas that serve the entire city or a large portion
of the city. A community park should include, but not be limited to,
the facilities that are typically found at neighborhood and mini parks
as well as specialized facilities such as amphitheaters and skate parks.
Compatible
Capable of existing together without conflict or ill effects.
Conditional Use Permit
The discretionary and conditional review of an activity or function or
operation on a site or in a building or facility.
                                                                           12-9

Conservation
The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction or
neglect.
Cul-de-sac
A short street or alley with only a single means of ingress and egress at
one end and with a turnaround at its other end.
Cultural Resources
Includes historic, archaeological and paleontological resources, as well
as human remains.
Cumulative Impact
As used in CEQA, the total environmental impact resulting from the
accumulated impacts of individual projects or programs over time.
Decibel (dB)
A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by
the human ear. The lowest volume a normal ear can detect under
laboratory conditions is 0 dB, the threshold of human hearing. Since
the decibel scale is logarithmic, 10 decibels are ten times more intense
and 20 decibels are a hundred times more intense than 1 db.
dBA
The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels, which weighs
or reduces the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate
human hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loud-
ness even though the noise is actually ten times more intense.
Dedication
The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public
use, and the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental

agency having jurisdiction over the public function for which it will
be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites or other public uses
are often required by a city or county as conditions for approval of a
development. (See “In-Lieu Fee”)
Density
The amount of development or people per unit of area or property.
(See also “Density, residential” and “Floor Area Ratio”)
Density, Residential (du/acre)
The number of permanent residential dwelling units (d.u.) per acre of
land. Densities specified in the General Plan are expressed in dwelling
units per net acreage (du/acre), minus any land dedications, and not
per gross acre. (See “Acres, Gross” and “Acres, Net”)
Density Transfer
The concentration of density on one part of a site to another part of a
site. This technique is used to preserve historic, sensitive or hazardous
areas and to accommodate public facilities, such as schools, parks or
utility easements on an individual parcel or within a specific project.
Development Review; Design Review
The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact on
neighboring properties and the community as a whole, from the
standpoint of site and landscape design, architecture, materials, colors,
lighting and signs, in accordance with a set of adopted criteria and
standards. “Design Control” requires that certain specific things be
done and that other things not be done. Design Control language is
most often found within a zoning ordinance. “Development Review”
usually refers to a system established in the Municipal Code, whereby
projects are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a spe-
                                                                        12-11

Development activities include: subdivision of land; construction or
alteration of structures, roads, utilities and other facilities; installation
of septic systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris or fill materials; and
clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception of agricultural
activities). The construction of a single-family home on an existing
lot, and routine repair and maintenance activities, are exempted.
Disabled
Persons determined to have a physical impairment or mental disorder,
which is expected to be of long, continued or indefinite duration and is
of such a nature that the person’s ability to live independently could
be improved by more suitable housing conditions.
Dry Year
A term used in planning for adequate water supplies. The dry year is
the most infrequent drought year, when the minimum amount of wa-
ter is available. Statistically, this level would occur only once in one-
hundred years. This amount of water is less than or equal to what is
available more than 99 percent of the time. (See also “Below Normal
Year Water Yield” and “Normal Year”)
Duplex

Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
A report required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) that assesses all the environmental characteristics of an
area, determines what effects or impacts will result if the area is altered
or disturbed by a proposed action, and identifies alternatives or other
measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See “California Environ-
mental Quality Act”)
Elderly
Persons 65 years of age or older.
Endemic Species
Species native to, and restricted to, a particular geographical region.
Entryway

Farmland, Prime
Land which has the best combination of physical and chemical charac-
teristics for the production of crops. It has the soil quality, growing
season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields of
crops when treated and managed, including water management, ac-
cording to current farming methods. Prime Farm-land must have been
used for the production of irrigated crops within the last three years.
Farmland of Local Importance
Land other than Prime Farmland, Farmland of Statewide Importance,
or Unique Farmland that is either currently producing crops or that
has the capability of production. This land may be important to the
local economy due to its productivity.
Farmland of Statewide Importance
Land other than Prime Farmland which has a good combination of
physical and chemical characteristics for the production of crops. It
must have been used for the production of irrigated crops within the
last three years.
Farmland, Unique
Land which does not meet the criteria for Prime Farmland or Farm-
land of Statewide Importance that is currently used for the production
of specific high economic value crops. It has the special combination
of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed
to produce sustained high quality or high yields of a specific crop
when treated and managed according to current farming methods.
Examples of such crops may include oranges, olives, avocados, rice,
grapes, and cut flowers.

percent, chance of occurring in any given year.
Floodplain
The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream
regularly subject to flooding.
Floodway
The part of the floodplain capable of conveying the 100-year flood

land area, expressed as a decimal number. For example, a 60,000
square foot building on a 120,000 square-foot parcel would have a floor
area ratio of 0.50. The FAR is used in calculating the building inten-
sity of non-residential development.

A compendium of City policies regarding its long-term development,
in the form of maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a
legal document required of each local agency by the State of California
Government Code Section 65301 and adopted by the City Council. In
California, the General Plan has seven mandatory elements (Circula-
tion, Conservation, Housing, Land Use, Noise, Open Space and Pub-
lic Safety) and may include any number of optional elements the City
deems important.
Goal
A description of the general desired results that Tracy seeks to create
through the implementation of the General Plan. Goals are included
in each element of the Plan and may include the key physical or com-
munity characteristics that the City and its residents wish to maintain
or develop.
Gray Water
The less contaminated portion of domestic wastewater, including wash
water from clothes washers and laundry tubs.
Greenfield Development
Urban development occurring on non-urban land previously used for
agriculture or open space.

Groundwater
Water that exists beneath the earth’s surface, typically found between
saturated soils and rock, and is used to supply wells and springs.
Growth Management
The use by a community of a wide range of techniques in combination
to determine the amount, type and rate of development desired by the
community and to channel that growth into designated areas. Growth
management policies can be implemented through building permit
caps, public facilities/infrastructure ordinances, urban limit lines,
standards for levels of service, phasing, and other programs.
Greenhouse Effect
A term used to describe the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere due to
accumulated carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere.
These gases absorb energy radiated from the Earth’s surface, “trap-
ping” it in the same manner as glass in a greenhouse traps heat.
Habitat
The physical location or type of environment in which an organism or
biological population lives or occurs.
Hard Edge
A clearly defined or abrupt transition between urban and rural uses.
High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
Traffic lanes that are designated and reserved for vehicles with a mini-
mum number of passengers during high-volume commute hours, in
order to encourage carpooling through faster travel. They are en-
forced with fines and traffic tickets.
                                                                        12-17

Household
All persons occupying a single dwelling unit.
Impact Fee
A fee charged to a developer by the City according to the proposed
development project, typically by number of units, square footage or
acreage. The fee is often used to offset costs incurred by the munici-
pality for services and infrastructure such as schools, roads, police and
fire services, and parks.
Impervious Surface
Surface through which water cannot penetrate, such as a roof, road,
sidewalk, and paved parking lot. The amount of impervious surface
increases with development and establishes the need for drainage facili-
ties to carry the increased runoff.
Implementation
Actions, procedures, programs or techniques that carry out policies.
Infill Development
Development that occurs on vacant or underutilized land within areas
that area already largely developed.
In-lieu Fee
Cash payments that may be required of an owner or developer as a
substitute for a dedication of land for public use, usually calculated in
dollars per lot, and referred to as in-lieu fees or in-lieu contributions.
(See “Dedication”)
Land Use
The occupation or utilization of an area of land for any human activ-
ity or any purpose.

Land Use Designation
One particular category in a classification series of appropriate use of
properties established by the General Plan Land Use Element.
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
A voluntary, consensus-based national standard for developing and
rating high-performance, sustainable “green” buildings. LEED pro-
vides a complete framework for assessing building performance and
meeting sustainability goals, such as water savings, energy efficiency,
materials selection and indoor environmental quality. LEED stan-
dards are currently available or under development for: new commer-
cial construction and major renovation projects, existing building op-
erations, commercial interiors projects, core and shell projects, and
homes.
Level of Service (LOS) Standard
A standard used by government agencies to measure the quality or ef-
fectiveness of a municipal service, such as police, fire or library, or the
performance of a facility, such as a street or highway.
Level of Service (Traffic)
A scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or intersec-
tion can accommodate, based on such factors as maneuverability,
driver dissatisfaction and delay.
Level of Service A
A relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on vehicle
movement or speed.
Level of Service B
Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle
movement and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
                                                                         12-19

Level of Service C
Denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with some
limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical
approaches.
Level of Service D
Designates the level where traffic nears an unstable flow. Intersections
still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait
through one signal cycle during short peaks.
Level of Service E
Represents traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent (al-
though momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered
severe, but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent stop-
ping, long-standing queues and blocked intersections.
Level of Service F
Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by “traffic
jams” and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersec-
tions usually have to wait through one or more signal changes, and
“upstream” intersections may be blocked by the long queues.
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo)
A five- or seven-member commission within each county that reviews
and evaluates all proposals for formation of special districts, incorpora-
tion of cities, annexation to special districts or cities, consolidation of
districts and merger of districts with cities. Each county’s LAFCo is
empowered to approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve such
proposals.

Local Street
Provides direct access to properties; generally they carry the lowest
traffic volumes.
Mini-Park
Small sized park, usually 1 to 5 acres, that provide recreation activities
for a specific neighborhood within a ½ mile radius.
Mixed Use
Any mixture of land uses on a single parcel, including mixtures of
residences with commercial, offices with retail, or visitor accommoda-
tion with offices and retail. As distinguished from a single use land use
designation or zone, mixed use refers to an authorized variety of uses
for buildings and structures in a particular area.
Mix of Uses
Any mixture of uses, such as retail, office, residential or general com-
mercial in close proximity spread over a small area.
Mobile Home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, built on a perma-
nent chassis and designed for use as a single-family dwelling unit and
which: (1) has a minimum of 400 square feet of living space; (2) has a
minimum width in excess of 102 inches; (3) is connected to all avail-
able permanent utilities; and (4) is tied down (a) to a permanent foun-
dation on a lot either owned or leased by the homeowner or (b) is set
on piers, with wheels removed and skirted, in a mobile home park.
Mobile Home Park
A parcel of land under one ownership that has been planned and im-
proved for the placement of two or more mobile homes for rental
purposes for nontransient use.
                                                                       12-21

Natural Habitat Area
An area that sustains animal and vegetative biotic resources that has
not been improved or disturbed. Natural Habitat Areas can also be
areas that were previously “disturbed” and have been reclaimed or re-
habilitated.
Neighborhood Park
Medium sized park, usually 5 to 15 acres, that provide basic recrea-
tional activities for one or more neighborhoods within a ½ to ¾ mile
radius.
Noise Contour
A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same
scale. Noise levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured in dBA)
require noise attenuation in residential development.
Non-Conforming Use
A use that was valid when brought into existence, but no longer per-
mitted by later regulation. “Non-conforming use” is a generic term
and includes: (1) non-conforming structures (because their size, type of
construction, location on land, or proximity to other structures is no
longer permitted); (2) non-conforming use of a conforming building;
(3) non-conforming use of a non-conforming building; and (4) non-
conforming use of land. Any use lawfully existing on any piece of
property that is inconsistent with a new or amended General Plan, and
that in turn is a violation of a zoning ordinance amendment subse-
quently adopted in conformance with the General Plan, will be a non-
conforming use. Typically, non-conforming uses are permitted to
continue for a designated period of time, subject to certain restrictions.

Normal Year
A term used in planning for adequate water supplies. Refers to those
years when the City can expect to receive all of the water it has con-
tracted to receive (entitlement). This is because supply conditions
(e.g. the amount of rain and snow collected in reservoirs, groundwater
availability) are normal. Based on historical experience, normal years
occur 63 percent of the time. (See also “Below Normal Year” and
“Dry Year”)
Objective
A specific statement of desired future condition toward which the
City will expend effort in the context of striving to achieve a broader
goal. An objective should be achievable and, where possible, should
be measurable and time-specific. The State Government Code (Section
65302) requires that general plans spell out the “objectives,” principles,
standards and proposals of the general plan. “The addition of 100
units of affordable housing by 1995” is an example of an objective.
Housing Law requires objectives contained in the Housing Element to
be quantified.
Overlay
A land use designation on the Land Use Map, or a zoning designation
on a zoning map, that modifies the basic underlying designation or
designations in some specific manner.
Parcel
A lot, or contiguous group of lots, in single ownership or under single
control, usually considered a unit for purposes of development.
                                                                       12-23

Passive Solar System
A system that uses direct heat transfer from the thermal mass instead
of mechanical power to distribute collected heat. Passive systems rely
on building design and materials to collect and store heat and to create
natural ventilation for cooling.
Pedestrian-Oriented Design
An approach to site and neighborhood design intended to facilitate
movement on foot in an area, as opposed to design that primarily
serves and encourages automobile movement. Examples of pedestrian-
oriented design include pathways following the most direct route from
sidewalk to front door, continuous building streetwalls with shop
windows, outdoor cafes, street trees and benches.
Planned Unit Development (PUD)
A description of a proposed unified development, consisting at a
minimum of a map and adopted ordinance setting forth the governing
regulations, and the location and phasing of all proposed uses and im-
provements to be included in the development.
Planning Area
The Planning Area is the land outside of the City limits and generally
outside of the Sphere of Influence that bears a relation to the City’s
planning and policy direction. The Planning Area does not lead to
regulatory powers outside of the City limits. Instead, it signals to the
County and to other nearby local and regional authorities that City
residents recognize that development within this area has an impact on
the future of their community, and vice versa. (See also “Sphere of
Influence”)

Policy
A specific statement of principle or of guiding actions that implies
clear commitment but is not mandatory. A general direction that a
governmental agency sets to follow, in order to meet its goals and ob-
jectives before undertaking an implementing action or program. (See
“Action”)
Recreational Corridor
Typically linear pathways, bikeways or open space areas that weave in
and around urban uses to provide recreational and transportation
amenities to city residents.
Riparian Corridor
A habitat and vegetation zone which is associated with the banks and
floodplains of a river, stream or lake. Riparian trees and shrubs are
typically phreatophytes, plants whose root systems are in constant
contact with groundwater.
Regional Park
A large park, typically more than 50 acres, that serves the open space
and recreation needs for all users of the entire city and unincorporated
areas surrounding the city. Regional parks contain active and passive
recreation areas and may also include natural open space.
Semi-Public Space
An interior or exterior area that is owned and managed by a private
entity but which is used by the public.
Sensitive Receptors
Uses sensitive to noise such as residential areas, hospitals, convalescent
homes and facilities, and schools.
                                                                        12-25

Soft Edge
A gradual or smooth transition between urban and rural uses. This
can be accomplished through a variety of techniques including the
feathering of density or cluster development.
Specific Plan
Under Article 8 of the Government Code (Section 65450 et seq), a le-
gal tool for detailed design and implementation of a defined portion of
the area covered by a General Plan. A specific plan may include all
detailed regulations, conditions, programs, and/or proposed legislation
which may be necessary or convenient for the systematic implementa-
tion of any General Plan element(s). (See also “Planned Unit Devel-
opment”)
Sphere of Influence (SOI)
The probably physical boundaries and service area of the city, as de-
termined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of
the county.
Steep Slope
An area with a greater than 5 percent slope.
Townhouse/Townhome
A series of residences, often two to three stories in height, that are
connected side by side in a row with each having a separate street-level
entrance.
Traffic Calming
Measures designed to reduce motor vehicle speeds and to encourage
pedestrian use, including:
  ♦ narrow streets
  ♦ tight turning radii

  ♦ sidewalk bulbouts
  ♦ parking bays
  ♦ textured paving at intersections
  ♦ parkways between sidewalks and streets
Transit Oriented Development (TOD)
Residential and commercial areas designed to maximize access by pub-
lic transportation, such as trains and buses. TODs typically have a
neighborhood center with a transit station, surrounded by relatively
high-density development, with progressively lower-density spreading
outwards.
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)
Programs implemented by municipalities to preserve open space and
direct development to urban centers. In order to develop in the City,
a developer must purchase development rights from rural lands outside
of the city for use within the urbanized area. Targeted preservation
and conservation lands are established as “sending areas” from which
land owners sell the development rights of their property to private
developers for use in designated “receiving areas” (infill areas desig-
nated for development or density increases). Property owners retain
the title to the land but the land cannot be built at urban intensities. If
the land is sold, the deed restrictions transfer with the sale.
Triplex
A free-standing house divided into three separate living units or resi-
dences, usually having separate entrances.
Unincorporated Area
Encompasses properties that are located outside of cities. Develop-
ment in the unincorporated area is subject to County jurisdiction.
                                                                         12-27

Urban Reserve
A land use designation applied to relatively large, contiguous, geo-
graphic areas where comprehensive planning will occur in the future
before urbanization occurs.
Use
The purpose for which a lot or structure is or may be leased, occupied,
maintained, arranged, designed, intended, constructed, erected, moved,
altered and/or enlarged in accordance with the City zoning ordinance
and General Plan land use designations.
Use, Non-conforming
(See “Non-conforming Use”)
Utility Corridor
Rights-of-way or easements for utility lines on either publicly or pri-
vately owned property.
Village Center
A land use designation for Tracy that involves relatively small retail or
mixed-use areas that generally range in size from 10 to 20 acres. They
are to be designed as “Main Streets” serving one or more neighbor-
hoods and encourage connectivity to adjacent neighbor-hoods or busi-
ness/industrial development projects and a mix of uses. Village Cen-
ters differ from Urban Centers in that they are smaller in size and do
not have a concentration of public-serving uses.
Wastewater
Water that has already been used for washing, flushing, or in a manu-
facturing process, and therefore contains waste products such as sew-
age or chemical by-products.

Wastewater Irrigation
The process by which wastewater, that has undergone appropriate
treatment, is used to irrigate land.
Wetland
An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater
at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of vege-
tation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly
known as hydrophytic vegetation.
Williamson Act
Formerly known as the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, it
was designed as an incentive to retain prime agricultural land and open
space in agricultural use, thereby slowing its conversion to urban and
suburban development. The program entails a ten-year contract be-
tween the City or County and an owner of land whereby the land is
taxed on the basis of its agricultural use rather than its market value.
The land becomes subject to certain enforceable restrictions, and cer-
tain conditions need to be met prior to approval of an agreement.
Zoning
The division of a city by ordinance or other legislative regulation into
districts or zones, which specify allowable uses for real property and
size restrictions for buildings constructed in these areas; a program
that implements the land use policies of the General Plan.
Zoning District
A designated area of the City for which prescribed land use require-
ments and building and development standards are or will be estab-
lished.

I.       Introduction
The Housing Element represents an awareness of the need to assure that housing is provided
for all economic segments of the community. The Element also satisfies the legal requirements
that housing policy be a part of the General Plan. The Tracy Housing Element is prepared for
the 2015-2023 update cycle for jurisdictions in the San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG)
region.
A.       Community Context
Tracy began as an agricultural community centered on several rail lines, and eventually became
the San Joaquin Valley headquarters for the Central Pacific Railroad. The City was incorporated
in 1910 and grew rapidly after the first irrigation district was established in 1915. Towards the
latter part of the twentieth century, the City transitioned into a primarily residential
community, as more people arrived from the Bay Area seeking affordable housing, a small-
town feel, and a respite from the highly-urbanized San Francisco Bay region.
According to the 2010 Census, the City population was reported at 82,922, an increase of about
46 percent in the ten years since the 2000 Census. During this same period, the housing stock
increased by approximately 44 percent. The growth in population has, in turn, increased
diversity within the City. From 2000 to 2010, Tracy became more racially and ethnically
diverse. The percentage of Whites dropped from 54 to 36 percent, while the proportion of
Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics increased (by two, seven, and nine percentage points,
respectively). The California Department of Finance (DOF) reported an increase in average
household size from 3.21 persons per household in 2000 to 3.48 persons in 2015. This trend can
be partially attributed to the increase in the City’s non-White population, since minority
households are traditionally larger than White households.
The City of Tracy’s housing stock is comprised primarily of newer single-family homes. Single-
family homes make up about 85 percent of all housing units while multi-family housing
comprises about 13 percent. About one-quarter (26 percent) of Tracy’s housing stock is over 30
years old (built before 1980) and approximately one-third (32 percent) is less than ten years old
(constructed since 2000).
Housing prices in Tracy are relatively affordable when compared to the San Francisco Bay
region, but the City’s housing is some of the most expensive in San Joaquin County. The median
price of a single-family home in Tracy was estimated at about $415,000, as of March 2015.
Apartment rents range from $1,150 for a studio apartment to $1,700 for a three-bedroom unit.
Lower and moderate income households in the City will have a difficult time finding affordable
ownership and rental housing options.

B.       Role of the Housing Element
The Housing Element is concerned with identifying ways in which the housing needs of
existing and future residents can be met. The Element covers the planning period of December
31, 2015 through December 31, 2023, and identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
        Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
        Providing adequate housing sites;
        Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
        Removing governmental and other constraints to housing development; and
        Promoting equal housing opportunities.
An important goal of the Housing Element is to continue to enhance Tracy’s reputation as a
great community in which to live, work and play. Drawing on its small town character, the
City will grow in a manner that provides a high quality of life for all current and future
residents and employees. This Housing Element provides policies and programs to address
these issues. The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
        Introduction: An overview of the purpose and contents of the Housing Element.
        Housing Needs Assessment: An analysis of the demographic and housing characteristics
         and trends.
        Housing Constraints: A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental
         constraints to meeting the identified housing needs.
        Housing Resources: An evaluation of resources available to address housing goals.
        Review of Past Accomplishments: An evaluation of accomplishments under the adopted
         Housing Element.
        Housing Plan: A strategy to address the identified housing needs given the City’s
         constraints and resources.
C.       Public Participation
Public participation by all economic segments is critical to the preparation of the Housing
Element.
1. Study Session
A Study Session was conducted before the Planning Commission to review the Draft Housing
Element. The meeting was advertised on the City’s website and special invitations were sent
out to a number of agencies serving low and moderate income households and persons with
special needs. Agencies invited to the Study Sessions are listed in Appendix A.
The study session before the Planning Commission was conducted on August 12, 2015. One
representative from the Building Industry Association of the Delta (BIA) and several residents

attended this study session and provided comments. A summary of their comments can be
found in Appendix A. The Draft Housing Element was again presented before the Planning
Commission on October 28, 2015.
2. Public Review of Draft Housing Element
The Draft Tracy Housing Element was available for public review at the following locations:
        City Hall
        City Library
        City website
3. Public Hearings
Public hearings will be conducted before the Planning Commission and City Council prior to
adoption of the Housing Element.
D.       Data Sources and Methodology
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted. The 2010
Census provides the basis for population and household characteristics. Although dated, no
better source of information on demographics is widely accepted. In addition, the 2010 Census
must be used in the Housing Element to ensure consistency with other regional, State, and
Federal housing plans. However, several sources are used to provide reliable updates to the
2010 Census, including the following:
    •    San Joaquin Council of Governments 5th Cycle Housing Element Data Package
    •    2009-2013 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau
    •    Population and demographic data updated by the State Department of Finance
    •    Housing market information, such as home sales and rents, from CoreLogic,
         Craigslist.org, Apartments.com, Padmapper, Forrent.com, Trulia, and Realtor.com
    •    Lending patterns from LendingPatterns™
    •    Labor statistics from California Employment Development Department
E.       General Plan Consistency
According to State planning law, the Housing Element must be consistent with the other
General Plan elements. While each of the elements is independent, the elements are also
interrelated to a degree. Certain goals and policies of each element may also address issues that
are primary subjects of other elements. This integration of issues throughout the General Plan
creates a strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and achievement of
community goals. The Housing Element is most closely tied to the Land Use Element as

residential development capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated into
the Housing Element.
This Housing Element builds upon other General Plan elements and is entirely consistent with
the policies and proposals set forth by the General Plan. When an element in the General Plan
is amended, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified if necessary to ensure
continued consistency among the various elements. Specifically, State law requires that the
Safety and Conservation Elements include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and
management information upon revisions to the Housing Element. The City of Tracy adopted its
General Plan in 2011, which has incorporated these topics in the Safety Element. The City will
ensure that updates to these Elements achieve internal consistency with the Housing Element.

II.      Housing Needs Assessment
The City strives to achieve a balanced housing stock that meets the varied needs of all income
segments of the community. To understand the City’s housing needs, the nature of the existing
housing stock and the housing market are comprehensively evaluated. This section of the
Housing Element discusses the major components of housing needs in Tracy, including
population, household, economic and housing stock characteristics. Each of these components
is presented in a regional context, and, where relevant, in the context of other nearby
communities. This assessment serves as the basis for identifying the appropriate goals, policies,
and programs for the City to implement during the 2015-2023 Housing Element cycle.
A.       Population Characteristics
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the
future needs of a community. Characteristics such as size, age and race and ethnicity provide a
unique demographic profile of the City.
1. Population Growth Trends
A dominant factor in community planning for Tracy has been the increase in population
between 2000 and 2010, and the associated housing construction. With the population growth,
Tracy has become more diverse racially and ethnically, larger family-households have become
more prevalent, and homeownership rates have increased.
Between 1990 and 2000, the Tracy population increased from approximately 33,558 to 56,929
persons (Table 1). This 70-percent increase in population was the highest of any San Joaquin
County city during the inter-Census period. Other cities in San Joaquin County had high
population growth as well, as shown in Table 1. Lathrop (53 percent) and Escalon (34 percent)
had population growth rates that were more than twice that of California (14 percent). Almost
95 percent of the population growth experienced in San Joaquin County during this time was
within incorporated cities.
By 2010, the City population reached 82,922, according to the Census. The State Department of
Finance (DOF) estimated the current (2015) City population at 85,296, another 2.9 percent
increase since 2010. The recent recession that severely impacted the region between 2008 and
2012 contributed to the limited growth in the City. However, the City is beginning to see
renewed interest in development and population is expected to increase in the future.

 2. Age Characteristics
 A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age
 characteristics of residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and
 sizes, ability to earn incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through each
 stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that the young
 adult population (20 to 34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate cost
 townhomes/condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to 64
 years old) represents the major market for moderate to relatively high cost condominiums and
 single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends to generate demand for
 low to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, group quarters, and mobile homes. In
 order to create a balanced community it is important to provide housing options that suit the
 needs of various age groups.
 Between 2000 and 2010, the number of persons between the ages of 18 and 24 in Tracy
 decreased by one percent (Table 2). This is an age group that, in many communities, is relatively
 transient and is primarily comprised of college students and people just entering the job market.
 The City’s proportion of young adults/early middle-aged individuals also decreased during
 this same time period, while the proportion of persons aged 45 to 64 years increased by
 approximately six percent. A continuation of these trends could be seen through 2013.
 According to the American Community Survey (ACS) data, the age distribution of Tracy
 residents between 2009 and 2013 was as follows: nine percent children under five; 22 percent
 school age children, ten percent college age, 28 percent young adults/early middle age, 23
 percent middle-age/near retirement, and eight percent seniors.
 The City’s age distribution reflects an aging and family-oriented community, where those
 nearing retirement age and seniors make up an increasingly significant portion of the
 population. The lack of affordable smaller housing units in Tracy may become an increasingly
 important issue for the City in the coming years.

that the representation of seniors decline from eight percent of the overall population in 2000 to six percent in 2010.

3. Race and Ethnicity
A community’s racial and ethnic composition may have implications for housing needs to the
extent that different groups have different household characteristics and cultural backgrounds
that may affect housing needs and preferences. Different racial and ethnic groups differ in their
attitudes toward and/or tolerance for “housing problems” as defined by the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including overcrowding and housing
cost burden. Perceptions regarding housing density and overcrowding, as well as the cultural
practices of living with extended families tend to vary among racial and ethnic groups.
Communities with a high proportion of Asian and Hispanic households tend to have a larger
average household size due to the cultural practice of living with extended family members. In
contrast, communities with a high proportion of White households tend to have a smaller
average household size.
Similar to most other jurisdictions throughout the state and the nation, Tracy has become more
racially and ethnically diverse over time. Between 2000 and 2010, the non-Hispanic White
population in the City decreased from 54 percent to 36 percent (Table 3). During the same time
period, the proportion of all other minority residents, except Native Americans, increased in
Tracy. By 2010, Tracy’s racial and ethnic diversity had matched that of both San Joaquin County
and the State (see Figure 2). According to ACS data, the racial/ethnic distribution of Tracy
residents between 2009 and 2013 was as follows: 35 percent White, 39 percent Hispanic, 16
percent Asian, six percent Black, and five percent Other.

B.        Household Characteristics
The Census defines a "household" as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons
sharing living quarters. Therefore, the number of households in a community is the same as the
number of occupied housing units.
For the purpose of conducting demographic research, the Bureau of the Census defines a family
as “a householder and one or more people living in the same household who are related to the
householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household who are related to the
householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household may contain
people not related to the householder.”
Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living
situations are not considered households. Furthermore, the Census classifies households by
type according to the gender of the householder and the presence of relatives. Household
characteristics such as size, type, income and tenure reveal important information about the
housing needs of a community. Different household sizes, types and income levels often prefer
different housing options. Typical household types included in the Census are: family
households versus non-family households (unrelated persons living together). Family
households can include married couples with or without children, single-parent households
with children, or other family households such as grandparents with grandchildren, siblings
living together, or other extended family members living together. Non-family households are

typically unrelated persons living together but also include singles living alone. Average
household size is estimated based on all persons in all households (including singles), whereas
the average family size is based on all related members in family households.
However, for zoning purposes, California court cases have ruled that a definition of “family”
that: 1) limits the number of persons in a family; 2) specifies how members of the family are
related (i.e. by blood, marriage or adoption, etc.), or (3) defines a group of not more than a
certain number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit is invalid. Court rulings
stated that defining a family does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
recognized under the zoning and land planning powers of the jurisdiction, and therefore
violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution. A zoning ordinance also cannot
regulate residency by discriminating between biologically related and unrelated persons.
Furthermore, a zoning provision cannot regulate or enforce the number of persons constituting
a family. Therefore, for the purpose of implementing its zoning regulations, the City recently
amended its Zoning Ordinance to define a family as follows: “"Family" means one or more
persons occupying a single dwelling unit, under no more than one written or oral rental
agreement.”
The following discussions focus on the characteristics of households in the City, based on data
obtained from the Bureau of the Census, and therefore utilize the Census definitions of
households and families. Later in this Housing Element in the Housing Constraints section, the
discussions focus on the City’s zoning regulations and therefore, the City’s zoning definition of
family is used.
1. Household Type and Size
Different household types generally have different housing needs. For example, seniors or
young adults usually comprise the majority of single-person households and tend to reside in
apartment units, condominiums, or smaller single-family homes. Families with children often
prefer single-family homes.
The proportion of family households in Tracy increased one percentage point from 2000 to 2010,
representing 82 percent of all households in the City in 2010. The proportional share of family
households in California, however, did not change. Average family size also increased slightly
in Tracy (Table 4). Compared to California, Tracy has a much larger share of married-couple,
family households with children (38 percent versus 23 percent). However, the overall
proportion of this family type decreased three percent during the 2000s. Among all household
types, other family households experienced the largest growth (four percent) between 2000 and
2010. According to the ACS data, between 2009 and 2013, 81 percent of Tracy households were
family households. Of the City’s households, 51 percent included children under the age of 18,
and 49 percent did not include children. About 14 percent of Tracy residents lived alone and
five percent were other non-family households.
The City’s average household and family size, both of which have historically been higher than
the State average, increased even more between 2000 and 2010. According to Department of
Finance (DOF) estimates for 2015, Tracy’s average household size is 3.48 persons, the second
highest among San Joaquin County cities after the City of Lathrop.

   2. Household Income
   Household income indicates the wealth of a community and therefore is directly connected to
   the ability to afford housing. Median household income compared to neighboring communities
   provides a way to measure income in Tracy against other cities.
   In 2013, households in the County of San Joaquin had a significantly lower median income
   ($53,380) than surrounding counties. However, residents of the County also had a much lower
   cost of living. In general, though, Tracy’s median household income ($76,098) is more
   comparable to the nearby counties of Alameda and San Francisco than its own County. The
   City’s median household income was 43 percent higher than that of San Joaquin County, and 23
   percent higher than the State average (Figure 3).
   The San Joaquin Valley has become a destination for Bay Area workers seeking lower cost
   housing and a lower cost of living overall. This can create difficulty for local workers
   competing for valley housing. Compared to the East Bay counties, the median income in the
   County of San Joaquin is approximately 35 percent lower than Alameda County ($72,112), 72
   percent lower than Santa Clara County ($91,702), 65 percent lower than San Mateo County
   ($88,202), 42 percent lower than San Francisco County ($75,604), and 48 percent lower than
   Contra Costa County ($78,756).

Median household income provides only partial insight into a community’s income profile. A
more detailed breakdown of households by income category can provide more information
about the proportion of households in Tracy whose limited incomes may lead them to have a
higher incidence of housing problems such as overpayment (paying more than 30 percent of
income on housing) or overcrowding (having more than one person per room).
According to ACS data, between 2009 and 2013, a majority of Tracy households earned annual
incomes of $75,000 or more (Table 5). In addition, households earning $100,000 or more
comprised over one-third of households in the City. By comparison, household incomes in San
Joaquin County were more evenly distributed throughout the various income levels—with a
significantly higher proportion of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a
noticeably lower proportion of households earning more than $100,000.

To facilitate the analysis of income distribution among households in communities, the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) groups households into
categories by income. Income categories are determined as a percentage of the Area Median
Income (AMI) and then adjusted for household size in the following manner:
    •    Extremely Low Income – 0 to 30 percent AMI
    •    Very Low Income – 31 to 50 percent of the AMI
    •    Low Income – 51 to 80 percent of the AMI
    •    Moderate Income – 81 to 120 percent of the AMI
    •    Above Moderate Income – above 120 percent of the AMI
Based on the HCD income categories described above, in 2011, approximately 76 percent of
Tracy households earned moderate or above moderate incomes, while 24 percent of households
can be classified as extremely low, very low, and low income households (Table 6).2

and the number of workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a household
can afford. In some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand
(such as in communities with military installations, college campuses, and large amounts of
seasonal agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the
reverse is true when employment contracts.
1. Employment
Between 2008 and 2013, Tracy had an unemployment rate of 9.7 percent—similar to the 10.1
percent unemployment rate for San Joaquin County. The City’s unemployment rate has
increased (by two percentage points) since between 2006 and 2010. The education/health/social
service, manufacturing, and retail industries have employed the most Tracy residents since 2006
(Table 7). While education/health/social service and manufacturing jobs are typically
associated with moderate incomes, retail jobs tend to offer lower wages. Table 8 lists the top ten

    Census Bureau using 2000 Census data. CHAS data does not provide a breakdown of household income for
    those with more than 80 percent AMI as those households are not qualified for federal housing programs.

Housing development in the City is meeting the needs of many Bay Area employees who are
themselves priced out of ownership in the areas where they work. Since local residents
employed in Tracy tend to have lower wages, a housing market dictated by persons commuting
to Bay Area jobs and their willingness (and ability) to pay presents difficulties in meeting the
housing needs of people who live and/or work in Tracy. Table 9 displays mean annual wage
data for occupations compiled by the California Employment Development Department (EDD)
for the Stockton Metropolitan Statistical Area. Table 9 shows that farming, food preparation
and serving, personal care and service, maintenance, and health care support occupations offer

2. Commuting Patterns
Commuting patterns demonstrate the relationship between housing to employment
opportunities. The lack of a geographic match between employment centers and housing leads
to traffic congestion, air quality deterioration, increased transportation infrastructure needs, and
many other adverse environmental and economic problems. Developing housing, particularly
near employment centers, can help reduce the occurrence of these environmental and economic
problems and place people in closer proximity to the services they need. The availability of
housing generally encourages a healthy economy, and could support downtown revitalization
efforts.
According to ACS data, between 2008 and 2013, nearly 55 percent of Tracy’s workforce travels
to another county for employment. This rate is more than double that of San Joaquin County (26
percent) and the highest among surrounding counties (Table 10). While the proportion of long
distance commuters in Tracy remains high, this number has decreased by three percent since
2000. However, this decrease may have been a result of the recession.

   The high rate of residents working in other counties corresponds with longer commute times
   for Tracy residents compared to the rest of the County. Figure 4 summarizes commute times for
   workers age 16 and over in Tracy and San Joaquin County, according to 2009-2013 ACS data.
   Approximately 34 percent of employed Tracy residents either worked at home or lived
   relatively close to their place of employment (had travel times to work of less than 20 minutes).
   An additional 24 percent had commutes between 20 to 44 minutes and the remaining 42 percent
   had commutes of 45 minutes or longer.

The vast majority of Tracy residents (77 percent) drove alone to work between 2009 and 2013. A
similar proportion of County residents also drove to work alone during this time period. In
general, the method of transportation City residents chose to take to work matched countywide
trends (Table 11).

According to the 2013 Interregional Multimodal Commute Trip Planning Study, commuters
from the counties of San Joaquin, Merced, and Stanislaus primarily travel to the Bay Area for
work. To better serve commuters in this tri-county area, the Study has recommended that the
San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG) take the following actions:
        Establish a centralized “one-stop shop” for commuters to get information on travel
         mode alternatives.
        Give information to commuters and other travelers about available options that might
         save them time or money.
        Shift people from single occupant vehicles to other modes, allowing for cleaner air and
         less peak period traffic congestion.
        Provide employers with an additional tool to help them comply with rule 9410 and to
         provide an additional benefit to their employees.
        Provide easy interface with emerging technologies such as smart phones and tablet
         computers to provide commuters with more convenient access to information on travel
         modes and road conditions.
        Help transit operators provide more coordinated service in the region.
        Keep planners informed about current travel patterns and mode choice trends.

        D.          Housing Problems
        The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for HUD
        provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
        households in Tracy. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2007-2011 ACS is displayed in Table 12.
        Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
              •     Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
              •     Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
              •     Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
              •     Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
        The types of problems experienced by households in Tracy vary according to household
        income, type, and tenure; however, general trends include:
              •     Renter-households are more likely to experience housing problems (56 percent) than
                    owner-households (50 percent).
              •     Large renter-families were more likely to experience housing problems than all other
                    household types (79 percent).
              •     Very low income (86 percent) and low income households (82 percent) were
                    significantly more likely than households of other income levels to experience housing
                    problems.

Note: Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in each category usually deviates slightly from
the 100% total due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total households. Interpretations of these data should focus on the proportion of households in need of
assistance rather than on precise numbers.

        2015-2023 Housing Element                                                   21                                                 Public Review Draft

1. Overpayment (Cost Burden)
A household is considered to be overpaying for housing (or cost burdened) if it spends more
than 30 percent of its gross household income on housing. Problems of overpayment occur
when housing costs rise faster than incomes or when households are forced to pay more than
they can afford for housing of adequate size, condition, and amenities to meet their needs. The
prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by income, tenure, household type, and
household size.
CHAS tabulations (based on ACS data) reported that 48 percent of Tracy households (11,417
households) overpaid for housing between 2007 and 2011. Housing cost burden typically varies
by income level, tenure, household type, and household size. In Tracy, renters and owners
were overpaying for housing at a nearly equal rate, whereas in the County as a whole,
overpayment among owners was less prevalent than among renters.
2. Overcrowding
Overcrowding is typically defined as a housing unit occupied by more than one person per
room. Overcrowding typically occurs when there are not enough adequately sized units
within a community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to
share a housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, or when families reside in smaller
units than they need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care.
Overcrowding tends to accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a
reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of
life.
According to the 2008-2013 ACS, approximately six percent of housing units in the City (1,546
units) were overcrowded. Overcrowding disproportionately affected renters (13 percent versus
three percent), indicating overcrowding may be the result of an inadequate supply of larger
sized rental units. While 80 percent of occupied housing units in the City had three or more
bedrooms (the minimum size considered large enough to avoid most overcrowding issues for
large households), only a fraction of these units (22 percent) were occupied by renters.

E.        Special Housing Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to special needs
and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income,
family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics, among other factors.
Consequently, some residents in Tracy may experience a higher prevalence of housing
overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
“Special needs” groups include the following: seniors, persons with disabilities, large
households, single-parent households, farmworkers, persons living in poverty, and the
homeless (Table 14). This section provides a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing
each particular group as well as programs and services available to address their housing
needs.

1. Seniors
Seniors face unique housing circumstances because of three factors: a limited or fixed income;
health care costs; and disabilities. Specifically, people aged 65 years and older often have four
main concerns:
    •     Housing: Many seniors live alone and may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
    •     Income: People aged 65 and over are usually retired and living on a limited income.
    •     Health care: Seniors are more likely to have high health care costs.
    •     Transportation: Many of the elderly rely on public transportation; especially those with
          disabilities.

were headed by seniors. Of these senior-headed households, most (73 percent) owned their
homes; the remaining 27 percent of senior-headed households rented their homes. Housing cost
burden is a significant issue for these households. Approximately 43 percent of senior-headed
households overpaid for housing. Specifically, 38 percent of senior homeowners and 52 percent
of senior renters experienced a housing cost burden.
Aside from housing cost burden issues faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes,
many seniors are also faced with various disabilities. Approximately 35 percent of Tracy seniors
had a disability between 2009 and 2013—a slight decrease from 2000 (when 38 percent of
seniors reported having a disability).
The 2010 Census reported that 75 percent of the City’s elderly residents were living in family
households either with spouse or with other family members (Table 15). However, a significant
portion (18 percent) of these seniors lives alone.

Senior homeowners, particularly elderly women, may require assistance in performing regular
home maintenance or repair activities due to physical limitations or disabilities. These in-home
needs and other senior needs can be met through a range of services, including congregate care,
rent subsidies, shared housing programs, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or
disabled elderly, housing with architectural design features that accommodate disabilities can
ensure continued independent living. Those with a mobility or self-care limitation may require
transportation alternatives or shared housing options.

The City recognizes the extensive housing needs of seniors in the community. There are
currently two affordable senior housing complexes in the City of Tracy—Tracy Garden
Apartments and Tracy Place Senior Apartments. In addition, the City contracts with the San
Joaquin County Housing Authority to provide Housing Choice Vouchers to very low income
households. The City also facilitates housing options for seniors through residential care
facilities. As of June 2015, a total of 16 residential care facilities for the elderly (with a total
capacity of 327 beds) are operating in Tracy.

In addition, the City operates the Lolly Hansen Senior Center, which offers a wide variety of
classes, activities, special events and services, to benefit its senior residents. The Center’s
programs include:
        Senior Link: Specialist provides assistance with access to information, local
         agencies and service providers.
        Lunch Program: Home delivered hot meals available to homebound and/or
         temporarily ill persons.
        Daily Nutrition Lunch: Hot lunches provided for individuals over the age of 60.
        Paralegal Services: Paralegal service is provided free of charge by the El Concilio
         organization.
        Brown Bag: Delivers bags of supplemental groceries to low-income senior citizens
         throughout San Joaquin County provided by Second Harvest Food Bank.
        TRACER: A Fixed Route bus service for seniors and persons with disabilities.
2. Persons with Disabilities
In Tracy and elsewhere, persons with disabilities have a wide range of different housing needs,
which vary depending on the type and severity of the disability as well as personal preference
and lifestyle. Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from
working, restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. “Barrier-free design”
housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group living
opportunities represent some of the types of considerations and accommodations that are
important in serving this group. Also, some residents suffer from disabilities that require living
in a supportive or institutional setting.
According to the 2009-2013 ACS, approximately nine percent of Tracy residents (6,909 persons)
over five years of age had a disability. The ACS tallied the number of disabilities by type for
residents with one or more disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, ambulatory (49 percent)
and cognitive (38 percent) difficulties were the most common (Table 16). However, the
prevalence of certain disabilities does vary by age. For example, cognitive difficulties accounted
for 78 percent of disabilities tallied among five to 17 year olds, while 69 percent of disabilities
tallied among seniors were ambulatory difficulties.

A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by Section 4512 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means “a disability that originates before an
individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined by the State of California’s
Director of Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public
Instruction, this term shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This
term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or
to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall
not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.” This term also
reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living
situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration
on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that
can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates to 1,244 persons in
Tracy with developmental disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population. The Valley
Mountain Regional Center (VMRC) provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities in Amador, Calaveras, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tuolumne counties. According
to VMRC, as of March 2015, VMRC serves 725 Tracy residents. Most of these individuals were
residing in a private home with their parent or guardian (89 percent) and 470 persons (65
percent) were under the age of 18.

Housing options for persons with disabilities also include community care facilities. As of June
2015, the City of Tracy currently has:
    •    Six Adult Residential Care facilities – 35 beds total
    •    One Group Home – 23 beds total
    •    16 Residential Care for the Elderly facilities – 327 beds total
In addition, VMRC is a private, non-profit corporation that contracts with the State of California
to provide diagnostic, evaluation, case management, and early intervention services to people
with developmental disabilities. VMRC purchases services such as respite, out-of-home
placement, adult day programs, transportation, behavior intervention, infant development
services, clinical, and diagnostic services for people with developmental disabilities.
3. Large Households
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These households
comprise a special need group because of the often limited supply of adequately sized and
affordable housing units in a community. To save for other basic necessities such as food,
clothing and medical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in smaller
units, which frequently results in overcrowding.
In 2010, approximately 24 percent of total households in Tracy were considered large
households. Of these large households, approximately 63 percent owned the units they
occupied and 37 percent rented. Finding large rental units (with three or more bedrooms) is a
common problem for large families, particularly large renter households earning lower
incomes. According to the 2009-2013 ACS, of the 24,430 occupied housing units in Tracy, 80
percent had three or more bedrooms (the minimum size considered large enough to avoid most
overcrowding issues for large households). However, only about one-fifth of these units (22
percent) were occupied by renters.
Resources Available
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program extends assistance to large households with
overcrowding and cost burden issues. Homebuyer assistance and housing rehabilitation
programs can also benefit large households with lower and moderate incomes.
4. Single-Parent Households
Single-parent families, particularly female-headed families with children, often require special
consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing and accessible
day care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with children are
considered a vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of their children with work
responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
The 2010 Census showed that single parent households comprised approximately eleven
percent of Tracy households. Of these households, 67 percent (1,827 households) were headed

by females. Female-headed households, and particularly those with children, often have a
higher incidence of poverty when compared to other household types. According to the 2009-
2013 ACS, of female-headed families with children under 18 in Tracy, approximately 22 percent
had incomes below the poverty level. Female-headed households need affordable housing in
areas with access to transit networks, schools and parks, and daily services.
Resources Available
The City offers a number of housing programs and supportive services for lower and moderate
income households in general that can also benefit female-headed households.
5. Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural labor. They have special housing needs because of their relatively low
income and the transient, seasonal nature of their job. The 2009-2013 ACS found that 505 Tracy
residents were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing hunting, and mining industry,
making up approximately 1.4 percent of the population in Tracy.
Resources Available
Because the City’s farmworker population is small, no special housing programs for this group
are necessary. The housing needs of farmworkers in the City can be met through the various
affordable housing programs that are available to all lower income households.
6. Residents Living Below Poverty
Families, particularly female-headed families, are disproportionately affected by poverty.
According to 2009-2013 ACS data, eight percent of the City’s total residents (6,770 persons) were
living in poverty. However, nearly 22 percent of female-headed families with children had
incomes below the poverty level.
7. Homeless
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a person is
considered homeless if he/she is not imprisoned and:
    •    Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
    •    The primary nighttime residence is a publicly or privately operated shelter designed for
         temporary living arrangements;
    •    The primary residence is an institution that provides a temporary residence for
         individuals that should otherwise be institutionalized; or
    •    The primary residence is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as
         a regular sleeping accommodation.

  F.         Housing Stock Characteristics
  A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within the
  jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and condition,
  tenure, vacancy rates, housing costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing
  needs for the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of Tracy to
  identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future residents of
  the City.
  1. Housing Growth
  Tracy experienced rapid housing growth from 1990 to 2005. The total number of housing units
  in the City increased 49 percent between 1990 and 2000 and another 44 percent from 2000 to
  2010. Until 2010, Tracy’s housing growth had consistently outpaced countywide housing
  growth as well as growth experienced in most surrounding communities (Table 18). Much of
  the housing growth that occurred between 2000 and 2010, however, took place in the first half
  of the decade. Residential building permit data indicates that a tremendous amount of housing
  development occurred in Tracy between 2000 and 2004. The City issued over 6,600 residential
  building permits during that four-year time period. Residential development declined sharply
  in 2005 due to decreased housing demand and the voter-approved Measure A initiative, which
  amended the City’s Growth Management Ordinance (GMO) by reducing the number of new
  residential building permits allowed each year from 1,500 to 750. New housing construction
  has declined further since 2007 as a result of the economic downturn and tightening of the
  credit market. By 2010, housing growth in all of San Joaquin County had declined steeply—with
  many communities, including Tracy, experiencing less than one percent growth in their housing
  stock.

Tracy’s housing stock has a higher proportion of single-family homes than the County as a
whole. About 73 percent of housing units in San Joaquin County consisted of single-family
detached homes and nearly 18 percent was made up of multi-family units (Figure 5).

3. Housing Availability and Tenure
Housing vacancy rates and tenure are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing in
a community. Vacancy rates can indicate whether there is a balance between the population and
available housing units. A low vacancy rate means there is a high demand for housing in the
area. A high demand for housing can increase the cost of housing as well as become a
disincentive for property owners to maintain their property. A vacancy rate between three and
five percent is considered optimal for rental housing while two to three percent is ideal for
ownership housing. The City’s overall vacancy rate in 2010 was 4.6 percent (Table 19). Given
the City’s housing mix of primarily single-family homes, this vacancy rate is considered high.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. According to the Census,
approximately 66 percent of Tracy households were homeowners, while the remaining 34
percent were renters (Table 20). The home ownership rate in Tracy was higher than the County
average, but below that of the neighboring cities of Escalon and Lathrop. Furthermore,
comparing this tenure distribution with the composition of the City’s housing stock indicates
that a significant number of single-family homes are used as rentals, reflecting a demand for
rental housing in the community.

According to the ACS, between 2009 and 2013, the owner vacancy rate had dipped to 1.5
percent while the renter vacancy rate was 4.3 percent, indicating a slightly tightened housing
market compared to 2010.
Owner-households are larger in size on average than renter-households. Families with children
usually represent many of the larger households in a community, and these households usually
prefer owner-occupied housing. The homeownership rate in Tracy was higher for all household
size categories compared with the State and the County (Table 21).

Racial and ethnic minorities in Tracy are much more likely to own their homes than their
counterparts elsewhere in California, as shown in Table 22. The difference is especially
apparent for Blacks and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Approximately 56 percent of Black
households in Tracy owned their homes compared to 42 percent in San Joaquin County.
Similarly, about 78 percent of Asian households in Tracy owned their homes compared to only
63 percent countywide. Homeownership rates for these two racial/ethnic groups were even
lower statewide.

4. Housing Age and Condition
Housing age can be an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Like any
other tangible asset, housing is subject to gradual physical or technological deterioration over
time. If not properly and regularly maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage
reinvestment, depress neighboring property values, and eventually impact the quality of life in
a neighborhood. Thus, maintaining and improving housing quality is an important goal for the
City.
Most of Tracy’s housing was built between 1980 and 2009 (Table 23). The housing stock in the
City is significantly newer than housing in the County, State, and nearby cities—indicating that
there is not a critical need for housing rehabilitation in Tracy (Figure 6). A general rule in the
housing industry is that structures older than 30 years begin to show signs of deterioration and
require reinvestment to maintain their quality. An estimated 6,557 units (26 percent of the

housing stock) in Tracy were constructed prior to 1980 and would be of sufficient age to require
maintenance or rehabilitation. According to the City’s Code Enforcement Division, an estimated
several hundred housing units in the City are in substandard condition.

G.       Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of housing cost burden and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Tracy residents.
1. Homeownership Market
Tracy’s for-sale residential market has largely followed the boom-and-bust cycle experienced
throughout California and across the country. Like many other cities, Tracy’s home values
increased steadily between 2000 and 2004 before falling substantially in the subsequent five to
seven years.
The California Association of Realtors (CAR) publishes median home sales price data compiled
by CoreLogic for cities and counties throughout the State. The median home sales price in Tracy
increased by approximately four percent between August 2014 and August 2015 (Table 24).
Median home prices in the City are the highest ($420,000) in San Joaquin County. Home prices
increased approximately nine percent countywide during that same time period. During the
housing market crisis, median home prices were significantly lower in 2009, at $245,000 for
Tracy and $167,000 countywide.

2. Rental Market
As previously noted, while over 85 percent of the City’s housing stock is comprised of single-
family homes, about 66 percent of the households were owner-occupied households. This
would suggest that many single-family homes in the City were being used as rentals. Market-
rate rents for housing in Tracy are summarized in Table 25. Rental rates were compiled based
on a review of over 150 rental listings posted on various online resources in September 2015.
Rents varied significantly by housing type (single-family home versus apartment) and by the
number of bedrooms. The majority of apartments available consisted of one- and two-bedroom
units renting for approximately $1,500-$1,600 per month. The single-family homes available for

3. Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the
City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels.
Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of
housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and
overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine the
maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their respective
income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison
than those at the upper end. Table 26 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for
housing each month without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be
compared to current housing asking prices (Table 24) and market rental rates (Table 25) to
determine what types of housing opportunities a household can afford.
Extremely Low income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the County area median income –
up to $13,950 for a one-person household and up to $28,410 for a five-person household in 2015.
Extremely low income households cannot afford market-rate rental or ownership housing in
Tracy.

Very Low income Households
Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50 percent of the County area
median income – up to $23,250 for a one-person household and up to $35,850 for a five-person
household in 2015. A very low income household can afford homes offered at prices between
$59,304 and $84,148, adjusting for household size. Given the costs of ownership housing in
Tracy, very low income households would not be able to afford a home in the City. Similarly,
very low income renters could not afford market-rate rental units in Tracy. After deductions for
utilities, a very low income household at the maximum income limit can afford to pay
approximately $478 to $693 in monthly rent, depending on household size.
Low income Households
Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the County’s area median
income - up to $37,150 for a one-person household and up to $57,300 for a five-person
household in 2015. The affordable home price for a low income household at the maximum
income limit ranges from $94,237 to $138,127. Based on the asking prices of homes for sale in
2015 (Table 24), ownership housing would be unaffordable to low income households. After
deductions for utilities, a one-person low income household could afford to pay up to $593 in
rent per month and a five-person low income household could afford to pay as much as $871.
In 2015, low income households in Tracy would have trouble finding affordable adequately
sized apartment units (Table 25).
Moderate income Households
Moderate income households earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the County’s Area
Median Income – up to $85,900 depending on household size in 2015. The maximum affordable
home price for a moderate income household is $196,624 for a one-person household and
$296,095 for a five-person family. Moderate income households in Tracy will also have trouble
purchasing adequately-sized homes. The maximum affordable rent payment for moderate
income households is between $1,173 and $1,766 per month. Appropriately-sized market-rate
rental housing may be difficult to secure for households in this income group.

H.       Affordable Housing
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units which are eligible to convert to non-low-income housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the
next ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers a ten-year period from December 31,
2015 through December 31, 2025. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly
assisted housing units in Tracy, analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses,
and analyzes the cost to preserve or replace those units.
1. Assisted Housing
Housing that receives governmental assistance is often a significant source of affordable
housing in many communities. Covenants and deed restrictions are the typical mechanisms
used to maintain the affordability of publicly assisted housing, ensuring that these units are
available to lower and moderate income households in the long term. Over time, the City may
face the risk of losing some of its affordable units due to the expiration of covenants and deed
restrictions.
The City of Tracy has seven publicly assisted housing developments, with a combined total of
659 units that are set aside as affordable for lower income households. These projects are
presented in Table 27. None of the projects are at-risk of converting to market-rate within the
at-risk analysis period.

  Resources for Preserving Affordable Units
  Available public and non-profit organizations with the capacity to preserve assisted housing
  developments include San Joaquin County, San Joaquin County Housing Authority, the City of
  Tracy, and various non-profit developers, including Self Help Enterprises and Bridge Housing
  Corporation. Financial resources available include bond financing, as well as CDBG and
  HOME funds, Section 8 rental assistance, low income housing tax credits, and Proposition 1C
  funds. (See the Housing Resources section later for further details.)
  I.         Future Housing Needs
  Future housing need refers to the share of the regional housing need that has been allocated to
  the City. The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) supplies a
  regional housing goal number to the San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG). SJCOG is
  then mandated to allocate the housing goal to city and county jurisdictions in the region. In
  allocating the region’s future housing needs to jurisdictions, SJCOG is required to take the
  following factors into consideration pursuant to Section 65584 of the State Government Code:
         •   Market demand for housing;
         •   Employment opportunities;

The SJCOG Executive Board adopted its 2014-2023 Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) on
August 28, 2014. The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) covers a ten-year planning
period (from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2023) and addresses housing issues that are
related to future growth in the region. The RHNA allocates to each city and county a “fair
share” of the region’s projected housing needs by household income group. The major goal of
the RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of housing among cities and counties within the San
Joaquin region, so that every community provides an opportunity for a mix of housing
affordable to all economic segments. The housing allocation targets are not building
requirements, but goals for each community to accommodate through appropriate planning
policies and land use regulations. State Housing Element laws are intended to assure that
adequate sites and zoning are made available to address potential housing demand during the
planning period and that market forces are not inhibited in addressing the housing needs of all
economic segments of a community.
Tracy’s share of regional future housing needs is 4,976 units for the January 1, 2014 to December
31, 2023 period. This allocation is distributed into five income categories, as shown below in
Table 28. The RHNA includes a fair share adjustment which allocates future (construction)
need by each income category in a way that meets the State mandate to reduce the over-
concentration of lower income households in one community.

III. Housing Constraints
This section describes various governmental, market, and environmental constraints on the
development of housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of Tracy’s population.
A.       Market Constraints
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing in Tracy, and can pose barriers to
housing production and affordability.
1. Economic Factors
Market forces on the economy and the trickle down effects on the construction industry can act
as a barrier to housing construction and especially to affordable housing construction. During
the 1980s, Tracy experienced a period of major growth as a result of the high cost of housing in
the East Bay area of the San Francisco Bay region. San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and
surrounding areas are continuing to experience a steady upsurge in housing prices—primarily
as a result of the increase in high-income technology jobs and limited housing stock. For many
households, particularly those working in lower-wage sectors, San Joaquin County offers more
affordable housing alternatives than the Bay Area. Today, Tracy is considered an outer suburb
of the Bay area, rather than a small agricultural and industrial town.
In the summer of 2005, the statewide housing market peaked when it experienced an influx of
housing supply coupled with low interest rates. This peak, however, was soon followed by a
severe crash just several years later. The San Joaquin Valley experienced a virtual halt to
residential construction beginning in 2007 and a resulting collapse of the housing market. The
period between 2006 and 2009 reflected a time of significant change as the lending market broke
down and home prices saw significant decreases. From 2007 to October 2009 home prices in
Tracy decreased 52 percent. Along with the gradual recovery of the housing market, home
prices in the City appear to have stabilized and began to increase in recent years (Table 24). The
median price of a home in Tracy recorded in August 2015 ($420,000) represented a four-percent
increase from the previous year. Despite these signs of rebounding, the San Joaquin Valley
remains in prolonged recovery, lagging behind the coastal housing markets which have
recovered more rapidly.
2. Land and Construction Costs
The City of Tracy is located in San Joaquin County, east of the Coastal Range that separates
California’s Central Valley from the San Francisco Bay Area. The City has an adequate supply
of vacant, unconstrained land; however, residential construction in Tracy is limited by the
City’s Growth Management Ordinance (GMO), adopted in 1987 and later amended in 1994,
2000, 2009, 2012, and most recently in April 2013. Significant future housing construction is
anticipated in the City’s Specific Plan areas, including the Tracy Hills Specific Plan, the
Downtown Specific Plan and the Ellis Specific Plan, as well as other residential areas identified
in the General Plan.

Construction costs vary according to type of housing development, with multi-family housing
being generally less expensive to construct than single-family homes. However, variations
within each construction type exist depending on the size of the unit, and the number and
quality of amenities provided. Construction costs can be broken down into two primary
categories: materials and labor. A major component of the cost of housing is the cost of building
materials, such as wood and wood-based products, cement, asphalt, roofing materials, and
pipe. The availability and demand for such materials affect prices for these goods.
An indicator of construction costs is Building Valuation Data compiled by the International
Code Council (ICC). The unit costs compiled by the ICC include structural, electrical, plumbing,
and mechanical work, in addition to interior finish and normal site preparation. The data is
national and does not take into account regional differences, and does not include the price of
the land upon which the building is built. The national average for development costs per
square foot for apartments and single-family homes in February 2015 are as follows:
        Type I or II, Multi-Family: $133.25 to $152.86 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $102.41 to $106.66 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $112.65 to $119.73 per sq. ft.
        The unit costs for residential care facilities generally range between $129.43 and $180.72
         per square foot.
In general, construction costs can be lowered by increasing the number of units in a
development to a certain extent, until the scale of the project requires a different construction
type that commands a higher per square foot cost.
3. Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the
applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases, improvements and
refinancing, whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.
Table 29 summarizes the disposition of loan applications submitted to financial institutions in
20133 for home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans in Tracy. Included is
information on loan outcomes (i.e. the number of applications that were approved and
originated, denied, withdrawn by the applicant, and incomplete).

Home Purchase Loans
In 2013, a total of 1,266 Tracy households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes.
The overall loan approval rate was 77 percent and 11 percent of applications were denied. By
comparison, 75 percent of conventional home loan applications were approved countywide. A
total of 761 applications were submitted for the purchase of homes in Tracy through
government-backed loans (e.g. FHA, VA) in 2013. Among applications for government-backed
home purchase loans in 2013, 76 percent were approved and 13 percent were denied.
Countywide, the approval rate for this type of loan was slightly lower at 73 percent.
Refinance Loans
The vast majority of loan applications filed by Tracy residents in 2013 were for home refinance
loans (5,293 applications). About 67 percent of these applications were approved, while 16
percent were denied. Countywide, 65 percent of refinancing applications were approved.
Home Improvement Loans
Within the City of Tracy, home improvement loans were the least likely to be approved.
Approximately 41 percent of home improvement loan applications were denied and 46 percent
were approved by lending institutions in 2013. The high proportion of denials may be
explained by the nature of these loans. Most home improvement loans are second loans and
therefore more difficult to qualify due to high income-to-debt ratios. Countywide, home
improvement loan applications had an approval rate (45 percent) similar to the City of Tracy.
Foreclosures
Like many cities in San Joaquin County, Tracy experienced a dramatic rise in home foreclosures
beginning in 2007. According to a 2010 Regional Analyst Report on foreclosures completed by
the Eberhardt School of Business in partnership with the San Joaquin Council of Governments,
foreclosure rates were particularly high in south and west Tracy (ZIP Code 95377). The number
of foreclosures began to fall in 2009, in part due to a new State law that went into effect in
September 2008 which required lenders to take added steps to keep troubled homeowners in
their homes. The San Joaquin County GIS Department tracked foreclosure data provided by the
County Recorder from 2007 to 2012. The number of foreclosures in Tracy peaked in 2008 and
steadily declined each year after.

B.       Governmental Constraints
Aside from market factors, housing affordability is also affected by factors in the public sector.
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in
particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement
requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, among other issues may
constrain the maintenance, development and improvement of housing. This section discusses
potential governmental constraints in Tracy.
1. Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element sets forth City policies for guiding local land use development. These
policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of
land allocated for different uses. Table 30 lists the land use designations of the General Plan
that permit residential uses.

Each General Plan land use designation is linked to one or more zone districts. As a result, the
development intensity standards for the residential land use designations are dependent on the
base zoning. In addition, the development density for the residential land use designations
may vary further, depending on the nature of development bonuses granted as part of a
development approval. There is not a one-to-one correspondence between the City’s General
Plan residential land use designations and zoning districts. The General Plan has eight
residential land use designations: Residential Very Low, Residential Low, Residential Medium,
Residential High, Traditional Residential, Traditional Residential-Ellis, Downtown, and Village
Center. However, two of these land use designations (Traditional Residential and Traditional
Residential-Ellis) are to be implemented only in conjunction with a separate development-level

Growth Management Ordinance
The City of Tracy adopted the residential Growth Management Ordinance (GMO) Guidelines in
1987. The GMO was amended from time to time with significant amendments occurring in
1994, 2000, 2009, 2012, and most recently in April 2013. Growth management in the City is
intended to:
        Achieve a steady and orderly rate of residential growth in the City, and encourage
         diverse housing opportunities balanced with the City’s obligation to provide public
         facilities and services with available fiscal resources;
        Regulate the timing and annual amount of new development projects, so that necessary
         and sufficient public facilities and services are provided, and so that new development
         projects will not diminish the City’s level of service standards;
        Encourage concentric (contiguous) growth of the City;
        Encourage development which will efficiently utilize existing, and planned future,
         public facilities;
        Encourage a balance of housing types in the City which will accommodate a variety of
         persons, including affordable housing projects which will accommodate persons of very
         low, low, and moderate income, and persons on limited or fixed incomes;
        Implement and augment the City policies related to the regulation of new development
         as set forth in the General Plan, specific plans, City ordinances and resolutions, master
         plans, finance and implementation plans, and design documents.
Under the GMO, builders must obtain a Residential Growth Allotment (RGA) in order to secure
a residential building permit. The GMO limits the number of RGA’s and building permits to an
average of 600 housing units per year for market rate housing, with a maximum of 750 units in
any single year. The maximum of 750 units includes an annual allocation of 150 units reserved
specifically for affordable housing. The GMO is not intended to limit the production of
affordable housing, small projects, or rehabilitation, therefore a number of exemptions and

2015-2023 Housing Element                           47                           Public Review Draft

exceptions were included in the GMO. The number of building permits issued to projects that
meet the following requirements is not limited by the GMO:
     •   The rehabilitation or remodeling of an existing structure or conversion of apartments to
         condominiums.
     •   The replacement of legally established dwelling units that were demolished.
     •   The project is a fourplex or lesser number of dwelling units developed on a single
         existing lot.
     •   The project is a secondary residential unit.
The City of Tracy has provided Affordable Housing Project Exceptions to all residential
developers who apply for them. Building permits within the normal limits of the GMO (without
seeking Affordable Housing Project Exceptions) are also readily available and residential
developers have not needed to obtain Affordable Housing Exceptions.
The number of building permits available each year as Affordable Housing Exceptions is set at
a maximum of 150. The maximum of 150 was put in place through Measure A, approved by
Tracy voters; therefore, the text in the GMO cannot be amended without another ballot
initiative approved by voters. The City, however, adopted an amendment to the Growth
Management Ordinance in 2013 that would ensure the RHNA could be entirely accommodated,
notwithstanding the numerical limits stated in Measure A or the GMO. Other exemptions in the
GMO include the following: (1) rehabilitation, remodeling or additions to existing structures; (2)
replacement of previously existing dwelling units that had been demolished; (3) construction of
“model homes” until they are converted to residential units; (4) development of a project with
four or fewer dwelling units; and (5) secondary residential units. Residential projects exempt
from the GMO are not counted toward the 600 annual average or the 750 annual maximum.
As mentioned earlier, the GMO has been amended several times since its adoption in 1987. The
following discussion summarizes these amendments:
2006 Revisions
In 2006, the City Council created a policy that authorizes the City to approve as many building
permits for affordable projects as are qualified, effectively negating the maximum building
permit limit of 150.
2009 Revisions
The GMO and the accompanying GMO Guidelines were modified in 2009 to minimize the
prominence of RGAs in the development process. Since RGAs cannot be issued until after a
Tentative Subdivision Map, Vesting Tentative Subdivision Map or (in the case of multi-family
projects) a Development Review permit is approved, RGAs have effectively become a
procedural precursor to building permit issuance and their role to ensure adequate provision of
public facilities and services is minimal.
Accordingly, RGAs are not “carried over” because the provision of public services and utilities
has already been reviewed with approval of the project’s discretionary approval and the public
facilities finance and implementation plan. The fact that RGAs cannot be “carried over” has no

effect on the cost of allocations or the ability to accommodate the City’s RHNA. The costs
associated with residential development are outlined in the project’s finance and
implementation plan, not through RGA allocations. With respect to the supply and availability
of RGAs, the fact that RGAs cannot be “carried over” has no effect on the supply or availability
of building permits to accommodate the RHNA because carryovers would have no relationship
to the number of available building permits.
2012 Revisions
The GMO was amended in 2012 to allow the Ellis and Tracy Hills projects to obtain up to 600
RGAs per year. The 2009 revision also established “Primary Residential Growth Areas,” which
are given first priority (aside from projects vested under any previous GMO Guidelines) when
issuing building permits. An amendment to the GMO in 2012 clarified the order of priority
allocations for RGAs.
RGA Allocation Priorities
    1. Vested Projects
    2. Primary Residential Growth Areas - The Primary Area includes most of the existing City
         limits. Up to 100 RGAs annually are reserved for development in the City’s Primary
         Residential Growth Areas.
    3. Development Agreements - In the event of any conflict between the development
         agreement and GMO Guidelines, the development agreement provisions prevail.
    4. Tracy Hills and Ellis Specific Plan Projects – These specific plan projects are entitled to
         receive the following RGAs annually:
             a. In years where 750 RGAs may be allocated, Tracy Hills shall be eligible to receive
                 406 RGAs and Ellis shall be eligible to receive 194 RGAs
             b. In years where 600 RGAs may be allocated, Tracy Hills shall be entitled to
                 receive 325 RGAs and Ellis shall be entitled to receive 155 RGAs
             c. If either Tracy Hills or Ellis receives less than the number of RGAs described
                 above, the difference between the numbers of RGAs allocated and the numbers
                 of RGAs described above shall be reserved. Either Tracy Hills or Ellis may apply
                 for these RGAs no later than the March 31st GMB meeting. If Tracy Hills or Ellis
                 does not apply for RGAs prior to the March 31st GMB meeting, the RGAs will be
                 made available to other projects.
    5. “Other” Projects - Development sites that “promote efficient residential development
         patterns and orderly expansion of residential areas to maximize the use of existing
         public services and infrastructure” (as identified in the General Plan Objective LU 1.4)
         but are not within the Primary Areas (as defined in the GMO Guidelines). “Other”
         projects are entitled to receive the following RGAs annually:
             a. In years where 750 RGAs may be allocated, “Other” Projects shall be entitled to
                 receive 50 RGAs per year
             b. In years where 600 RGAs may be allocated, “Other” Projects shall be entitled to
                 receive 40 RGAs per year

Any remaining RGAs will be made available to projects for which a complete application has
been submitted. During years when a number of RGAs other than 600 or 750 are available, the
RGAs will be issued in proportionate amounts as established above.
In addition to the priorities established above, the GMO Guidelines outline additional criteria
for development projects within Primary Residential Growth Areas. The Primary Areas priority
allows for infill projects to compete with the typically larger, greenfield developments that lie
outside of the central core of the City. The following criteria was established for determining
which infill projects have priority over other infill projects, should there be demand exceeding
the supply of RGAs in any given year:
    •    Housing Type (in order of importance):
            1) High Density Residential (12.1 du/acre or more)
            2) Medium Density Residential (5.9-12.0 du/acre)
            3) Low Density (up to 5.8 du/acre)
            4) Projects with an affordable component, including moderate and low to very low
                 income categories (RGAs for the affordable component come from the
                 "Affordable Housing Exception" category in the GMO)
            5) Mixed Use and other innovative housing types (i.e mixing products in a single
                 project, cluster housing, mixed-use developments)
    •    Geographic Area (in order of importance):
            1) Village Center
            2) Connection of incomplete infrastructure
            3) Projects that combine several smaller parcels
            4) Compatibility with surrounding area
    •    Project Size and Proximity to Existing Development (in order of importance):
            1) Small Infill-less than five acres and surrounded by development on three sides
            2) Large Infill-over five acres and surrounded by development on three sides
            3) Projects already in progress that need additional RGAs for completion
    •    Project Design (in order of importance):
            1) High level of connectivity—pedestrian and vehicular
            2) Amenities—parks, schools, etc.
            3) Architecture
            4) Energy Efficient Design
            5) Walkability and high intersection density
            6) Building and type and building frontage variation
Priority criteria are utilized for projects within the Primary Area only; they are not utilized for
projects in the Secondary Residential Growth Area. Only when there is competition between
projects in the Primary Area do the scoring criteria apply. There is no impact on the timing of
development due to the criteria because projects are evaluated against the criteria after
Development Review approval and during the period between RGA application submittal
(September) and RGA issuance (typically in October or November). Projects are not rejected,

they are ranked. The criteria do not add to the costs of development because they are not
required and there is no City fee associated with the criteria. Developers choose to design their
projects in accordance with market demands and opportunities; nothing in the criteria is
beyond the developers’ control. For example, high density housing types are addressed by
location through zoning, not the RGA criteria. The geographical area of a project does not
change as a result of the RGA criteria – the project is where the developer chooses to locate it.
The project size and proximity to development is a function of the developers’ lot size, not the
RGA criteria. Project design is evaluated at the time of Development Review approval, not
RGA issuance.
2013 Revisions
The 2009 GMO amendment defined Affordable Housing as a very low, low, or moderate
income unit deed restricted for 55 years. The 2013 GMO amendment reduced this affordability
restriction to ten years.
The 2013 amendment also allowed the City to issue building permits in excess of those allowed
through the GMO in order to meet the City’s RHNA, as required by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD). The maximum number of building permits
issued may be the limit prescribed in the GMO (in general, 600 annual average or 750 per year
max) or the number of units identified in the RHNA (by income category), whichever is higher.
The GMO Guidelines summarized above provide a high level of certainty and predictability for
development. In fact, the GMO process only occurs after Tentative Map or other discretionary
development approval. This allows projects that are closer to obtaining building permits to
obtain RGAs and discourages more speculative projects from obtaining RGAs before the project
is prepared to use them. Also, the City publishes a spreadsheet identifying all RGA
applications being considered, which results in a high level of transparency and predictability
in determining a project’s chances for approval.
Residential Growth Allotment Allocation Process
The City’s Growth Management Ordinance, as amended, sets a schedule of allocating RGAs
once per year, with the application deadline on the first Thursday of September, and the
allocations to be used to obtain a building permit during the following calendar year. The only
exceptions to this schedule occur with applications for affordable housing units (to be processed
immediately as received) and for Development Agreement projects with timelines as
determined within each agreement.
Applications for RGAs are due the first Thursday in September each year. Completeness
determinations are made within 30 days. Allocations are made by the Growth Management
Board (the City Manager, the Development and Engineering Services Director, and the Public
Works Director) before the end of that same year in order to permit the use of the RGAs to
obtain building permits in the following calendar year.
The process to review applications and allocate RGAs would typically last less than 60 days.
This simple, predictable process allows residential developers to wait until near the end of the
calendar year (just prior to the year they intend to begin obtaining building permits) to obtain

2015-2023 Housing Element                       51                            Public Review Draft

RGAs. This allows maximum flexibility for developers to schedule their entitlement process to
coincide with market opportunities.
Furthermore, if a developer obtains Tentative Map approval in the early or mid-portion of the
year before they intend to obtain building permits, they may work on their improvement plans,
final map, grading, utilities, streets, and other in-tract improvements prior to or concurrent with
applying for and obtaining RGAs.
If this program proves inconvenient for developers in the future, GMO Guidelines include
provisions for periodic revisions. This Section acknowledges, in part, that the City recognizes
the GMO Guidelines must be adaptable to evolving needs related to developers’ timing or other
issues. Amending the RGA allocation process by adding a second allocation cycle during the
year, for example, would only require a Resolution of the City Council, and not a change to the
Growth Management Ordinance.
The approval process for RGA issuance relates to the other entitlements in that RGAs are
required prior to building permit issuance but are not required prior to other approvals. The
cumulative impact on timing and costs of development resulting from the RGA allocation
process is that projects have the ability to wait until they are ready to develop before obtaining
RGAs. A typical subdivision map has a “life” of many years, which can be extended at
regularly scheduled public meetings of the Planning Commission or City Council throughout
the year. The costs associated with the RGA process (RGA application fee) are not incurred
until the applicant decides to move forward with their project and obtain RGAs.
Applications for RGAs are only considered for projects that have approved Tentative
Subdivision Maps or other necessary project approvals, if no subdivision will occur. This
ensures that the Growth Management Board only considers the allocation of RGAs to projects
that have access to water, sewer, storm drainage, and other requisite public facilities and
services. The RGAs are allocated based on the criteria as listed in the GMO guidelines.
RGA allocations are determined at a public hearing by the Growth Management Board, which
consists of the City Manager, Development and Engineering Services Director, and the Public
Works Director.
The GMO approval process allows both small and large residential projects to obtain adequate
RGAs. Projects of over 500 units have successfully been built in the past, and two very large
ongoing projects—Ellis (over 2,000 housing units) and Tracy Hills (over 5,000 housing units)—
are set to obtain their RGAs over the course of a number of years. The following examples help
illustrate the availability of RGAs:
    1. The GMO was amended in 2012 to allow the Ellis (194 RGAs) and Tracy Hills (406
         RGAs) projects to obtain up to 600 RGAs per year.
    2. Infill sites: GMO Guidelines state that infill (Priority Areas) sites may receive up to 100
         RGAs annually. Projects in the City’s “Primary Residential Growth Areas” are given
         first priority (aside from projects vested under any previous GMO Guidelines) when
         issuing building permits.

2015-2023 Housing Element                          52                            Public Review Draft

GMO and Affordability
The rate of housing overpayment in Tracy has increased substantially since 2000. Between 2007
and 2011, nearly one-half (48 percent) of Tracy households overpaid for housing compared to 35
percent in 2000 (Table 12). It is unclear, however, what impact the GMO has had on housing
costs in the City. The effect of inclusionary housing ordinances, growth management
ordinances, and urban growth boundaries on the affordability of housing is a prominent topic
for current academic research. There are researchers and scholars with varying and conflicting
ideas of the causal relationship (if any) between growth management and housing affordability.
The incremental effect on housing costs of limiting the number of residential units per year
within a city depends on the position of that city economically and demographically within the
region, the price (and relative price) of land, the existing local supply and types of housing, the
regional and local demand for housing, and the relative level of residential choice and mobility
in the area, among other elements beyond the scope of a housing element. The City does not
believe that, to date, the GMO has had an effect on the cost of housing.
Historically, there are more RGAs and building permits available than the market can absorb in
Tracy. Furthermore, the 2013 amendment to the GMO that established the RHNA exemption
resulted in hundreds of additional building permits being made available in a calendar year
than the 600 annual average or 750 annual limit. Therefore, the annual limits in the past and in
the foreseeable future have not affected (and will not affect) the supply or cost of housing. The
RHNA exemption provision will effectively result in a rolling average for each RHNA cycle in
that to the extent that the City does not achieve its RHNA in any calendar year, the number of
permits to achieve the RHNA will be available in each succeeding year.
Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zone
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zone is designed to allow for greater flexibility and
creativity in site planning for residential, commercial, and industrial uses to achieve greater
efficiency in land use by maximizing open space, preserving natural amenities, and creating
additional amenities. Maximum height and bulk requirements, as well as the minimum setback,
yard, parking and loading requirements are established for each PUD Zone by a preliminary
development plan, which must be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and
City Council to ensure its acceptability.
Density Bonuses
State law requires the provision of certain incentives for residential development projects that
set aside a certain portion of total units to be affordable to lower and moderate income
households. The City grants density bonuses to developers who build housing developments
of five or more units and construct at least one of the following:
        Very low income units: Five percent of the total units of the housing development as
         target units affordable to very low-income households; or
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                         53                             Public Review Draft

        Low Income Units: Ten percent of the total units of the housing development as target
         units affordable to low-income households; or
        Moderate Income Units: Ten percent of the total units of a newly constructed
         condominium project or planned development as target units affordable to moderate-
         income households, provided all the units are offered for purchase; or
        Senior Units: A senior citizen housing development of 35 units or more.
Density bonuses and development incentives are based on a sliding scale, where the amount of
density bonus and number of incentives provided vary according to the amount of affordable
housing units provided.
The City of Tracy updated its density bonus ordinance in 2008 to comply with the requirements
of California Government Code Section 65915 that was in effect as of December 2014. However,
the recently adopted AB 2222 added new requirements to the State’s density bonus provisions,
which took effect in January 2015. Specifically, AB 2222 extends the affordability control to 55
years for the affordable units and requires the replacement of existing affordable units removed
in order to qualify for a density bonus, incentive, or concession. The City will update the
density bonus ordinance again to comply with these additional requirements by 2016.
Specific Plans
The City anticipates that much of its new residential growth will occur in the Tracy Hills and
Ellis specific plan areas.
Tracy Hills Specific Plan
Upon buildout, Tracy Hills will consist of 5,499 dwelling units and will provide a distinct
hierarchy of housing types that accommodate a wide range of housing objectives, buyer needs
and affordability. Planned housing types include custom homes, production homes, smaller
detached homes, town-home units, condominiums and apartments. Table 31 summarizes the
permitted uses within the Specific Plan area.

Ellis Specific Plan
The Ellis community will be characterized by three residential neighborhoods that are all in
close proximity to the Village Center: the Village Neighborhood, Garden Neighborhood, and
Town & Country Neighborhood. The Village Center will be built out over time in response to
market demand. The following is a brief description of the various residential land use
designations that make up the Ellis Specific Plan, while Table 33 summarizes the permitted uses
allowed within each land use category:
        Residential Mixed Low (RML): The Residential Mixed Low designation is intended to
         provide for relatively low-density housing, including single-family, detached one- and
         two-story houses. The allowed density will range from a minimum of 2.1 to a maximum
         of 8 dwelling units per acre (du/acre).
        Residential Mixed Medium (RMM): The Residential Mixed Medium designation is
         intended to provide for medium-density housing, including single-family detached and
         attached units, and will consist of one- and two-story houses and two- and three-story
         townhouses. Densities in this land use category will range from a minimum of 4 to a
         maximum of 16 dwelling units per acre (du/acre).
        Residential Mixed High (RMH): The Residential Mixed High designation is intended to
         provide for high-density housing. The units will be single- and multi-family detached
         and attached units, and will consist of compact housing, townhouses, apartments,
         condominiums, and live/work units generally located adjacent to commercial uses.
         Residential Mixed High densities will range from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 25
         du/acre.
        Village Center (VC): The Village Center designation will accommodate up to 60,000
         square feet of nonresidential uses in the Village Center, as well as up to 50 high-density
         residential units, possibly in a mixed-use configuration with residential over
         commercial. Residential units in the Village Center may be apartments, townhouses,
         condominiums, and /or live /work units.

2. Residential Development Standards
Outside the specific plan areas, the City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of
residential development primarily through the Zoning Ordinance. The following zoning
districts allow residential uses:
    Residential Estate Zone (RE) – 0.0 to 2.0 du/acre
    The Residential Estate (RE) Zone is characterized by open space and very low density
    development. This zone also allows for educational, cultural, institutional, and recreational
    uses serving local residential areas.
    Low Density Residential Zone (LDR) – 2.0 to 5.8 du/acre
    The Low Density Residential (LDR) Zone is intended to be utilized in the areas designated
    low-medium density residential. Mobile homes on individual lots are permitted, and mobile
    home parks are permitted through issuance of a conditional use permit, as are convalescent
    hospitals, rest and nursing homes, and board and care facilities, and planned residential
    developments of one-family dwellings on individual lots.
    Medium Density Cluster Zone (MDC) – 5.9 to 12.0 du/acre
    The Medium Density Cluster (MDC) Zone classification is designed to provide for single-
    and two-family dwellings, dwelling groups, and supporting uses. Dwelling group is
    defined as a group of two or more detached dwellings located on a parcel of land in one
    ownership and having one yard or court in common. Crop and tree farming is also
    permitted by right.           Condominiums, one- and two-family residential planned
    developments, mobile home parks and subdivisions, and attached single-family dwellings
    are permitted through the issuance of a conditional use permit. A minimum of 3,500 square
    feet of net lot area for each dwelling unit is required, and not more than 45 percent of the net
    lot area shall have buildings.
    Residential Mobile Home Zone (RMH) – up to 10.0 du/acre
    The Residential Mobile Home (RMH) Zone is to provide an exclusive district designation
    that is applied to land for use as mobile home parks, and to establish rules and regulations
    by which the City may regulate the standards of lots, yards, or park areas, landscaping,
    walls or enclosures, signs, access, and vehicle parking. A minimum 2,400-square-foot lot is
    required for each unit. Each mobile home park is required to provide 1,000 square feet of
    usable open space plus 150 square feet for each individual trailer space if the mobile home
    park provides more than 10 spaces.
    Medium Density Residential Zone (MDR) – 5.9 to 12.0 du/acre
    The Medium Density Residential (MDR) Zone is designed to provide for apartments,
    multiple-family dwellings, dwelling groups, and supporting uses. One-, two-, an multiple-
    family dwellings are permitted by right in this zone, as are dwelling groups and apartment
    houses, boarding and rooming houses, and crop and tree farming. Mobile home parks and
    subdivisions, condominiums and planned residential developments, attached single-family
    dwellings, board and care facilities, and rest or nursing homes are permitted through
    issuance of a conditional use permit. A minimum 2,900 square feet lot area is required for
    each unit, and buildings shall not cover more than 45 percent of the lot. In addition,
    residential uses proposed for this zone must provide 100 square feet of usable open space
    for each of the first 10 dwelling units, 50 square feet for each of the second 10 units, and 25

    square feet for each unit in excess of 20. Usable open space is defined as lawn, pool, or a
    garden courtyard, and shall not include the required front yard or street side yard, off-street
    parking, driveways, or service areas.
    High Density Residential Zone (HDR) – 12.0 to 25.0 du/acre
    The High Density Residential (HDR) Zone classification is designed to provide for
    apartments, multiple-family dwellings, dwelling groups, and supporting uses. Multiple-
    family dwellings, dwelling groups, apartments, and boarding and rooming houses are
    allowed by right. Crop and tree farming and single-family dwellings are also allowed by
    right in the High Density Residential zone. Mobile home parks and subdivisions,
    condominiums and planned residential developments, and attached single-family dwellings
    are allowed via a use permit. There is no height limit in the HDR zone, but at least 1,400
    square feet of net lot area is required of each unit. The maximum building coverage is 45
    percent and the same usable open space required for development in the MDR district is
    required for the HDR district.
    Professional Office and Medical Zone (POM) – 5.8 du/acre
    The Professional Office and Medical (POM) Zone specialized classification is designed to
    provide for local serving offices supporting uses and facilities consistent with the General
    Plan. This zone permits the development of multiple family dwelling units, with the
    exception of apartment hotels.
    General Highway Commercial (GHC)
    The General Highway Commercial (GHC) Zone is to provide areas for commercial activities
    which are automobile-oriented or for those uses which seek independent locations outside
    shopping centers or other business clusters. Multiple-family dwellings are also conditionally
    permitted in this zone without a maximum prescribed density.
    Central Business District (CBD) - 40 du/ac
    The Central Business District (CBD) Zone is to provide areas in which pedestrian-oriented
    establishments, commercial business, service, and office facilities for the convenience of
    residents of the entire City may locate. Multiple-family dwellings are also conditionally
    permitted in this zone at a density of up to 40 units per acre, as prescribed in the General
    Plan.
Development standards specific to each zone district are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the General
Plan. These standards also serve to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. Specific residential development standards are summarized in Table 33.
Generally, development standards can limit the number of units that may be constructed on a
particular piece of property. These include density, minimum lot and unit sizes, height, and
open space requirements. Limiting the number of units that can be constructed will increase the
per-unit land costs and can, all other factors being equal, result in higher development costs that
may impact housing affordability.

Parking requirements for single-family and multi-family residential uses in Tracy are
summarized in Table 34. Although the provision of off-street parking can increase the cost of
housing, Tracy’s standards are reasonable as requirements for multi-family developments are
equal to or less than requirements for single-family detached dwellings. Furthermore, given the
commute pattern of residents, the parking requirements match the demand in the community.
Guest space requirements for multi-family developments are also reasonable because these
types of developments do not have private driveways for each unit to accommodate parking for
guests as is required for new single-family homes. Nonetheless, because the increased cost of
off-street parking can make financing the development of senior housing and housing
affordable to lower and moderate income households more difficult, reduced parking and other
incentives, concessions, or waivers and modifications of development standards are available
for developers of affordable projects that are eligible for a density bonus.

The City recently adopted amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to incorporate Affordability
by Design principles. For example, any use, including multi-family residential, may request a
reduction in required parking based on a study or survey that illustrates that required parking
is not warranted. Applicants may receive up to a 20 percent reduction of the otherwise required
number of parking spaces pursuant to T.M.C. Section 10.08.3470(e). The City of Tracy has also
relaxed the required distance between structures in the HDR Zoning District from the average

   height of the two buildings to 10 feet. This has provided for greater flexibility for the allowance
   and maximum usage of residential sites.
   3. Provision for a Variety of Housing Opportunities
   Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
   available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
   development of a variety of housing types for all economic segments of the population. This
   includes single-family homes, multi-family housing, second units, mobile homes, and
   residential care facilities. Table 35 below summarizes the various housing types permitted
   within the City’s zoning districts.

Notes: P = Permitted C = Use Permit Required
   One-Family Dwellings
   A “one-family dwelling” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as a detached building arranged,
   designed, or used for, and intended to be occupied by, not more than one family, and which
   building has not more than one primary kitchen and not less than one bathroom. Single-family
   dwellings are permitted in all of the City’s residential zones, with the exception of the RMH
   zone.
   Secondary Residential Unit
   Second units may be an alternative source of affordable housing to lower income households
   and seniors. A “secondary residential unit” is defined as a separate residential unit containing
   sleeping, kitchen, and bathroom facilities, and created on a lot in the Low Density Residential
   Zone (LDR) zone which already contains one legally created residential unit. A secondary
   residential unit may be created by the conversion of a portion of, or an addition to, an existing
   dwelling or by the construction of a new structure.
   The passage of AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires cities to use a ministerial process to
   consider second units in effort to facilitate the production of affordable housing state-wide.
   Second units must be permitted in all residential zones where a primary single-family unit
   already exists. The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning

Ordinance that will permit the development of second units in the RE, LDR, MDC, MDR, and
HDR zones. This amendment was reviewed by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and
adoption is anticipated in 2015.
Manufactured and Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing and mobile homes can be an affordable housing option for low and
moderate income households. The California Department of Finance reported in 2009 that
Tracy’s housing stock included 476 mobile homes, or approximately two percent of the total
housing units in the City. A mobile home built after June 15, 1976, certified under the National
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Act of 1974, and built on a permanent foundation
may be located in any residential zone where a conventional single-family detached dwelling is
permitted subject to the same restrictions on density and to the same property development
regulations.
Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance defines manufactured housing as “a home which
conforms to the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of
1944.” The City also includes a definition of factory-built housing and mobile home in the
Zoning Ordinance. Factory-built housing is defined as “a home which conforms to the
standards of the California Factory Built Housing Law of 1969.” Mobile home is defined as “a
vehicle or trailer designed or used as permanent or semi-permanent housing for human
habitation, including any kind of mobile living or sleeping quarters.”
The City’s Zoning Ordinance conditionally permits mobile home parks in all of its residential
zones, with the exception of the RMH zone where they are permitted by right. The City of Tracy
is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to permit the development of
manufactured homes in the RE, LDR, MDR, and HDR zones. This amendment was reviewed
by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and adoption is anticipated in 2015.
Multiple-Family Housing
According to the American Community Survey, multiple-family housing comprised
approximately 13 percent of the housing stock in Tracy between 2009 and 2013 (Table 19 on
page 31). Multiple-family housing is permitted within the MDC, MDR, HDR and POM zones.
Conditional use permits are required for the construction of multiple-family housing in the
GHC and CBD zone districts.
Residential Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Sections 5115 and 5116) of the
California Welfare and Institutions Code declares that mentally and physically disabled persons
are entitled to live in normal residential surroundings. The use of property for the care of six or
fewer persons with mental disorders or disabilities is required by law. A State-authorized,
certified or authorized family care home, foster home, or group home serving six or fewer
persons with disabilities or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is
considered a residential use to be permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can impose
stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes (commonly referred to as
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                        60                              Public Review Draft

“group” homes) of six or fewer persons with disabilities than are required of the other
permitted residential uses in the zone.
In accordance with the Lanterman Act, all residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons
are permitted without discretionary review in Tracy wherever a single-family home is
permitted. In addition, the City allows residential care facilities of seven or more persons in all
of its residential zones with a Conditional Use Permit. Despite this policy, the City’s Zoning
Ordinance makes no specific provisions for residential care facilities of any size. The City will
amend its Zoning Ordinance to fully comply with the provisions of the Lanterman Act by 2016.
It should be noted, however, that the lack of explicit provisions for residential care facilities in
the Zoning Ordinance has not precluded the development of this housing type in the City.
According to the State Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division, as of
June 2015, one licensed group home with six beds, 16 licensed residential care facilities for the
elderly with a combined capacity of 368 beds, and seven licensed adult residential facilities with
a combined capacity of 95 beds, are located in Tracy.
Emergency Shelters
Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to identify one or more
zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without discretionary review. The statute
permits the City to apply limited conditions to the approval of ministerial permits for
emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least
one year-round shelter and accommodate the City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless
population. Tracy’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population is estimated to be 32
individuals.
The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that will add
a definition of emergency shelters to the Municipal Code and permit their development in the
MDC, MDR, and HDR zones by right without discretionary review. Emergency shelters will be
subject to the following additional development standards:
        Concentration. An emergency homeless shelter may not be located closer than 300 feet
         from another emergency homeless shelter.
        On-site resident manager. An emergency homeless shelter shall have a resident, on-site
         manager.
This amendment was reviewed by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and adoption is
anticipated in 2015.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
State law (AB 2634 and SB 2) requires local jurisdictions to address the provisions for
transitional and supportive housing. Under Housing Element law, transitional housing means
buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
requirements that require the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to
another eligible program recipient at a predetermined future point in time that shall be no less

than six months from the beginning of the assistance (California Government Code Section
65582(h)).
Supportive housing means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
target population and is linked to an onsite or offsite service that assists the supportive housing
resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. Target population means persons
with low incomes who have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV/AIDS,
substance abuse, or other chronic health condition, or individuals eligible for services provided
pursuant to the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5 (commencing
with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may include, among other
populations, adults, emancipated minors, families with children, elderly persons, young adults
aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and
homeless people (California Government Code Sections 65582(f) and (g)).
The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that will add
a definition of transitional housing and supportive housing to the Municipal Code. Transitional
housing will be defined as “a building configured for rental housing, but operated under
program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted
unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time that is not
less than six months from beginning of assistance. Transitional housing that is provided in
single-family, two-family, or multi-family dwelling units will be permitted, conditionally
permitted or prohibited in the same manner as other single-family, two-family, or multi-family
dwelling units under this code.”
Supportive housing will be defined as “housing with no limit on the length of stay, that is
occupied by persons with disabilities and individuals or families that are homeless at the time
approved for occupancy, and that is linked to on-site services that assist the supportive housing
resident in retaining the housing, thereby improving the residents health status, and
maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible and applicable, work in the community.
Supportive housing that is provided in single-family, two-family, or multi-family dwelling
units will be permitted, conditionally permitted or prohibited in the same manner as other
single-family, two-family, or multi-family dwelling units under this code.”
This amendment was reviewed by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and adoption is
anticipated in 2015.
Single Room Occupancy Units (SROs)
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen
and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many
SROs have one or the other and could be equivalent to an efficiency unit. AB 2634 mandates
that local jurisdictions address the provision of housing options for extremely low income
households—specifically the provision of SROs.

The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that will add
a definition of SROs to the Municipal Code and permit their development in the MDR and HDR
zones. SROs will also be conditionally permitted in the MDC zone. This amendment was
reviewed by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and adoption is anticipated in 2015.
Farmworker Housing
The California Employee Housing Act requires that housing for six or fewer employees be
treated as a regular residential use. The Employee Housing Act further defines housing for
agricultural workers consisting of 36 beds or 12 units be treated as an agricultural use and
permitted where agricultural uses are permitted.
The City of Tracy permits crop and tree farming in the A, LDR, MDC, MDR, and HDR zones.
However, farm employee housing is not similarly permitted in these zones. The City’s Zoning
Ordinance also has no provisions for employee housing. City staff will amend the Zoning
Ordinance by 2016 to include provisions for farm employee housing and employee housing
pursuant to the California Employee Housing Act.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.
modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling. The City conducted an analysis of the zoning ordinance, permitting
procedures, development standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for
housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s policies and regulations regarding housing for
persons with disabilities are described below.
Land Use Controls: Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka
Lanterman Act), small licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be treated
as regular residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts.
All residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted without discretionary
review in Tracy wherever a single-family home is permitted. All residential zones also allow
residential care facilities of seven or more persons with a Conditional Use Permit. The City will
amend its Zoning Ordinance by 2016 to reflect this current policy and fully comply with the
provisions of the Lanterman Act.
Definition of Family: Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing
to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a
restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related
and unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the development and siting of
group homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing families that are similarly sized

or situated.6 The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance
that will modify the definition of “family” to “one or more persons occupying a single dwelling
unit, under no more than one written or oral rental agreement.” This amendment was reviewed
by the Planning Commission in October 2015 and adoption is anticipated in 2015.
Building Codes: The Building and Safety Division actively enforces 2013 California Building
Code provisions that regulate the access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons
with disabilities. No unique restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities. Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10
percent of the total dwelling units in multi-family buildings without elevators consisting of
three or more rental units or four or more condominium units subject to the following building
standards for persons with disabilities:
     •    The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted
          by site impracticality tests.
     •    At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
          served by an accessible route.
     •    All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
          route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
          may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
          bedrooms, or hallways.
     •    Common use areas shall be accessible.
     •    If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
Reasonable Accommodation: Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons
with disabilities to waive a setback requirement or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to
ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification
is reasonable depends on the circumstances. The City of Tracy is currently considering an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that will add a formal reasonable accommodations
procedure to the Municipal Code. This amendment was reviewed by the Planning Commission
in October 2015 and adoption is anticipated in 2015.
6    California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have
     ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by
     blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated persons as a single
     housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes between
     blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or useful objective or purpose
     recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality, and therefore violates rights of
     privacy under the California Constitution.

4. Development and Planning Fees
Residential developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to process permits and
provide necessary services and facilities as allowed by State law. In general, these development
fees can be a constraint to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing because
the additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased housing unit cost.
However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public
services and facilities in the City. The City’s permit processing and development impact fee
schedule for residential development are displayed in Table 36. Most permit processing fees are
levied on a full cost recovery basis to recoup actual administrative costs incurred to the City
during the development review process. Development impact fees are levied to offset fiscal
impacts of new developments.

A typical development is also expected to pay a variety of impact fees to ensure the adequate
provision of infrastructure, services, and facilities. The exact fees to be paid depend on the
location of the projects. Typical application processing costs to the City for a residential project
range between $15,000 to $40,000. Technical studies (such as traffic, sewer, water, or CEQA) can
cost between $10,000 to $60,000 per residential subdivision or apartment complex. Development
impact fees for a recent 21-unit single-family subdivision totaled approximately $50,000 per
unit. For a recent 300-unit multi-family development, fees totaled approximately $25,000 per

unit. Appendix C shows the development impact fees for a typical single-family unit and a
typical multi-family unit.
While the City’s fees are tied to the costs of providing necessary services, they can impact the
development of affordable housing. The City has several policies in place to facilitate the
development of affordable housing, including: increased priority under the Growth
Management Ordinance, decreased construction costs through reduced standards (i.e. reduced
parking, etc.), and reduced fees.
5. On- and Off-Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence of existing
improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed development. In general, the City
requires the following improvements and facilities for new developments:
        Frontage improvements. The frontage of each lot is required to be improved consistent
         with the geometric sections of the Roadway Master Plan, including street structural
         section, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, driveway approaches, transitions, landscaping and
         street lighting
        Storm drainage. Stormwater runoff must be collected and conveyed by an approved
         storm drain system that provides for the protection of abutting and off-site properties.
         Off- and/or on-site storm drain improvements and/or detention or retention basins
         may be required to satisfy this requirement.
        Water supply. Each unit or lot must be served by the City water system, with a separate
         water meter.
        Underground utilities. All existing and proposed utilities must be placed underground.
         Street lighting must also be provided to the standards specified in the City's design
         documents. Developers must deposit with the City sufficient money to pay for the
         energy and maintenance of such street-lighting for a period of 18 months or secure
         funding for lighting through a landscape and lighting maintenance district.
        Other improvements. Other improvements, including but not limited to, street lights, fire
         hydrants, signs, street trees and shrubs, landscaping, irrigation, and monuments, or fees
         in lieu of any of the above may also be required.
        Street Design. The City of Tracy street design criteria are summarized in the table below
         (Table 37). Alternative street designs are permitted within specific plan areas.

6. Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the cost of housing. The City
currently implements the 2013 California Building Codes, which are based on the International
Building Codes. The California Building Codes establish standards and requires inspections at
various stages of construction to ensure code compliance and minimum health and safety
standards. Although these standards may increase housing production costs, these standards
are mandated by the State of California and are intended to provide structurally sound, safe,
and energy-efficient housing.
7. Local Permits and Processing Times
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is
commonly cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of
housing. Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the time
that elapses from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors that
can affect the length of development review on a proposed project include: completeness of the
development application submittal, responsiveness of developers to staff comments and
requests for information, and projects that are not exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), require rezoning or general plan amendment, or are subject to a public
hearing before the Planning Commission or City Council.
Certainty and consistency in permit processing procedures and reasonable processing times is
important to ensure that the development review/approval process does not discourage
developers of housing or add excessive costs (including carrying costs on property) that would
make the project economically infeasible. The City is committed to maintaining comparatively
short processing times. Total processing times vary by project, but most residential projects are
approved in two to four months. Table 38 provides a detailed summary of the typical
processing procedures and timelines of various types of projects in the City.

The processing time for the most common residential development applications are
summarized in Table 39. These applications are often processed concurrently. Depending on
the level of environmental review required, the processing time for a project may be
lengthened. Given the relatively short time periods required for processing residential

Development Review
A Development Review Permit is required for all housing developments or improvements that
require a building permit, except for single-family and two-family residences. An application,
including an initial environmental study and site/architectural plans, must be submitted to the
City’s Development and Engineering Services (DES) Department. Site plan and architectural
reviews are completed within the Development Review process. The DES Director reviews
applications and has the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application. In
reviewing and evaluating an application, the Director considers the following aspects:
        Conformity with various zoning provisions;
        The height, bulk, and area of buildings;
        The types of buildings and installations;
        The physical and architectural relationship with the existing and proposed structures;
        The site layout, orientation, and location of the buildings and relationships with open
         areas and topography;
        The height, materials, colors, and variations in boundary walls, fences, and screen
         plantings;
        The location and type of landscaping, including, but not limited to, off-street parking
         areas; and
        The appropriateness of the sign design and exterior lighting.
Conditional Use Permit
In all zoning districts, specified conditional uses are permitted subject to the granting of a
Conditional Use Permit. Because of their potentially incompatible characteristics, conditional
uses require special consideration so that they may be located properly with respect to their
effects on surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the Planning Commission
has the authority to grant or deny applications for use permits and to impose reasonable
conditions upon the granting of Conditional Use Permits.
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                                   68                         Public Review Draft

A public hearing is required for each application for a conditional use permit. Hearings must be
held within 30 days after the date the application was filed. Notice of the public hearing must
given at least 10 days, but not more than 20 days, prior to the date of the hearing. At the public
hearing, the Commission reviews each application and receives applicable evidence and
testimony concerning the proposed use and the proposed conditions. The Commission must
decide on each application within 40 days of the closing of the public hearing.
In recommending the approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the Commission can impose a
variety of conditions that are deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Such conditions may include:
        Special yards, spaces, and buffers;
        Fences and walls;
        The surfacing of parking areas and provisions for surface water drainage, subject to City
         specifications;
        Requiring street dedications and improvements, including service roads or alleys when
         practical;
        The regulation of the points of vehicular ingress and egress;
        The regulation of signs;
        Requiring the maintenance of the grounds;
        Requiring landscaping and the maintenance thereof;
        The regulation of noise, vibration, odors, and other similar characteristics;
        The regulation of the time for certain activities to be conducted on the site;
        The time period within which the proposed use shall be developed;
        A bond, deposit of money, or letter of credit for the completion of the street
         improvements and other facilities or for the removal of such use within a specified
         period of time to assure faithful performance on the part of the applicant.
8. State Tax Policies and Regulations
Proposition 13
Proposition 13 is a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except when there is a
transfer of ownership. This initiative may have increased the cost of housing by forcing local
governments to pass on more of the costs of housing development to new homeowners.
Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs, resulting from fees charged by local
government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analysis and from
delays caused by the mandated public review periods, are also added to the cost of housing and
passed on to the consumer. However, the presence of these regulations helps preserve the
environment and ensure environmental quality for Tracy residents.
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                         69                              Public Review Draft

C.       Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
A community’s environmental setting affects the feasibility and cost of developing housing.
Environmental issues range from the availability of water to the suitability of land for
development due to potential exposure to seismic, flooding, wildfire and other hazards. If not
properly recognized and accommodated in residential design, these environmental features
could potentially endanger lives and property. This section summarizes these potential
constraints on residential development in Tracy.
1. Geologic and Seismic Hazards
There are four Seismic Zones in the United States, which are ranked according to their seismic
hazard potential. Zone 1 has the least seismic potential and Zone 4 has the highest seismic
potential. The City of Tracy lies primarily within Seismic Zone 3, while parts of the Tracy Hills
Specific Plan area lie in Zone 4. The California Building Code contains special standards and
regulations for each zone to ensure that all new construction will withstand forces associated
with a major earthquake.
There are numerous faults within and around the City of Tracy. Major faults near the City
include the San Andreas, Calaveras, Hayward and Concord-Green Valley faults. These faults
have historically been the source of earthquakes felt in Tracy. The Carnegie/Corral Hollow
fault, considered active, runs roughly northeast-southeast along the southern boundary of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Site 300. The Black Butte and Midway faults, which
are potentially active, lie near the City’s boundaries and may pose potential seismic hazards for
the Planning Area. The Tracy-Stockton fault, which passes beneath the City of Tracy in the deep
subsurface, is considered inactive. The Elk Ravine fault, which is considered inactive, lies
between the Carnegie/Corral Hollow, Black Butte and Midway faults.
There are a series of specific hazards that are caused by earthquakes, including ground rupture,
ground shaking, liquefaction and expansive soils. Due to its seismic and geologic conditions,
the City of Tracy is subject to several of these hazards, including a moderate potential for
liquefaction, as well as a moderate to high potential for expansive soils depending on the
specific soil conditions and location. The Safety Element of the City’s General Plan includes
goals, policies, and actions that are designed to reduce the risks of these hazards, including
requiring underground utilities and geotechnical reports.
For all new construction, the City requires geotechnical reports and other analyses, where
necessary, to analyze potential soils or geologic hazards. The California Building Code,
enforced by the City’s Development and Engineering Services Department, contains design and
development regulations to ensure that all new construction will withstand forces associated
with geologic and seismic hazards.
2. Flooding
Floodplain zones are determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
used to create Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) that designate these zones. These maps assist
cities in mitigating flooding hazards through land use planning and building permit
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                        70                            Public Review Draft

requirements. FEMA outlines specific regulations for any construction, whether residential,
commercial or industrial within 100-year floodplains. The floodplain is the relatively level land
area on either side of the banks of a stream subject to flooding. The 100-year floodplain is the
area subject to flooding based on a storm event that is expected to occur every 100 years on
average, based on historical data.
The most recent FIRM for the City of Tracy is dated October 16, 2009. According to this FIRM,
the majority of land within City limits is included in Zone X, the designation for lands outside
of the 100-year floodplain. Two areas along the northern portion of the City fall within FIRM
Zone AE, which indicates the 100-year floodplain. Furthermore, the majority of land within the
city limit and SOI is located outside of the 200-year floodplain, although there are small areas in
the northern portions of the city limit and SOI that are within the preliminary 200-year
floodplain boundary. New construction and substantial improvements to structures are
required to “have the lowest floor (including the basement) elevated at least one foot above the
base flood level” or be of flood-proof construction.
The Safety Element of the City’s General Plan also includes goals and policies that are designed
to reduce the risks of flooding hazards in the City. These policies include:
        Limiting development on lands within the 100-year flood zone
        Preventing the construction of flood barriers within the 100-year flood zone that divert
         flood water or increase flooding in other areas
        Encouraging to purchase National Flood Insurance, which reduces the financial risk
         from flooding and mudflows
        Implementing floodplain overlay zones provided by FEMA
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) determines the locations of floodplains
and designates the locations of flood zones on Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Specific regulations
are enforced by the City on all new construction to ensure that the lowest floor is at least one
foot above the base flood level or that the structure is flood-proof. All sites zoned for residential
development or identified to provide sites to meet the RHNA, however, are outside the 100-
year floodplain.
3. Wildland Fires
The risk of wildland fires is related to a combination of factors, including winds, temperatures,
humidity levels and fuel moisture content. Of these four factors, wind is the most crucial. Steep
slopes also contribute to fire hazard by intensifying the effects of wind and making fire
suppression difficult. Features in some parts of the Planning Area, including highly flammable
vegetation, and warm and dry summers with temperatures often exceeding 100 degrees
Fahrenheit, create a situation that results in potential wildland fires. Where there is easy human
access to dry vegetation, fire hazards increase because of the greater chance of human
carelessness. High hazard areas include outlying residential parcels and open lands adjacent to
residential areas.
To quantify this potential risk, the California Department of Forestry (CDF) has developed a
Fire Hazard Severity Scale that utilizes three criteria in order to evaluate and designate potential
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                         71                              Public Review Draft

fire hazards in wildland areas. The criteria are fuel loading (vegetation), fire weather (winds,
temperatures, humidity levels and fuel moisture contents) and topography (degree of slope).
The Safety Element of the City’s General Plan also includes goals and policies that are designed
to reduce the risks of wildland fire hazards in the City. These policies include:
        Limiting development in areas with steep terrain
        Requiring new developments to satisfy fire flow and hydrant requirements
        Incorporating drought-resistant and fire-resistant plants in areas subject to wildland
         fires.
        Regularly training the City of Tracy Fire Department for urban and wildland firefighting
         conditions.
High fire hazard areas include outlying residential parcels and open lands adjacent to
residential area. All new development in Tracy is required to satisfy fire flow and hydrant
requirements. No sites improved with residential development to meet or exceed the RHNA
are in a high fire hazard area.
4. Hazardous Materials and Waste
Products as diverse as gasoline, paint solvents, film processing chemicals, household cleaning
products, refrigerants and radioactive substances are categorized as hazardous materials. What
remains of a hazardous material after use or processing is considered to be a hazardous waste.
The handling, transportation and disposal of such waste is of concern to all communities.
Improper handling of hazardous materials or wastes may result in significant effects to human
health and the environment.
Many businesses and residents in Tracy use hazardous materials and generate some amount of
hazardous waste. The most common hazardous waste in Tracy are generated from gasoline
service stations, dry cleaners, automotive mechanics, auto body repair shops, machine shops,
printers and photo processors, and agriculture. Most of these wastes are petroleum-based or
hydrocarbon hazardous waste and include cleaning and paint solvents, lubricants and oils.
However, medical wastes, defined as potential infectious waste from sources such as
laboratories, clinics and hospitals, are also included among the hazardous wastes found in
Tracy.
Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes in Tracy are heavily regulated by a range of federal,
State and local agencies. One of the primary hazardous materials regulatory agencies is the
California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC).
DTSC is authorized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce and
implement federal hazardous materials laws and regulations.
San Joaquin County has prepared a Hazardous Material Area Plan, in accordance with the
California Health and Safety Code (HSC) (Division 20, Chapter 6.95, §25500 et seq.) and
California Code of Regulations (CCR) (Title 19, Article 3, §2270 et seq.). The Plan is designed to
protect human health and the environment through hazardous materials emergency planning,
response and agency coordination and community right-to-know programs. The Plan outlines
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                         72                              Public Review Draft

the roles and responsibilities of federal, State, and local agencies in responding to hazardous
material releases and incidents. The City of Tracy’s Police and Fire Departments work with San
Joaquin County to implement this plan.
The City of Tracy participates with San Joaquin County in a household hazardous waste
program. Tracy residents can also access the permanent household hazardous waste
consolidation facility located in Stockton.
The County Office of Emergency Services (OES) administers the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know program for the Tracy Planning Area. Under Chapter 6.95 of the
California Health and Safety Code and the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
any business storing quantities of hazardous materials greater than 55 gallons of liquid, 500
pounds of solid or 200 cubic feet of some compressed gasses must file a hazardous materials
business plan annually that establishes incident prevention measures, hazardous material
handing protocols and emergency response and evacuation procedures.
The Safety Element of the City’s General Plan also includes goals and policies that are designed
to reduce the risks associated with hazardous materials and waste in the City. These policies
include:
        Requiring developers to conduct the necessary level of environmental investigation to
         ensure that soils, groundwater and buildings affected by hazardous material releases
         from prior land uses and lead or asbestos potentially present in building materials, will
         not have a negative impact on the natural environment or health and safety of future
         property owners or users.
        Requiring new pipelines and other channels carrying hazardous materials avoid
         residential areas and other immobile populations to the extent possible.
        Maintaining formally-designated hazardous material carrier routes to direct hazardous
         materials away from populated and other sensitive areas.
Most hazardous wastes in Tracy include cleaning and paint solvents, lubricants and oils.
Medical wastes are also included among the hazardous wastes found in Tracy. The City works
with appropriate County and State agencies to ensure compliance with all hazardous materials
and waste safety regulations. No new residential development will be subject to significant
risks from hazardous materials or waste.
5. Water Supply
Tracy obtains water from both surface and groundwater sources. The City has access to up to
39,000 acre-feet of water per year from both surface and groundwater sources combined and
utilizes less than half that amount each year. Furthermore, the City is pursuing additional
water supplies to accommodate future growth. The amount from either source as a percentage
of the total water supply used by Tracy varies from year to year based on contractual
agreements, annual precipitation and City policy about how to expend water resources. The
supply of groundwater sources is dependent on the capacity of the Tracy Aquifer.
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                        73                             Public Review Draft

The City of Tracy receives the majority of its surface water supply from the South County
Surface Water Supply Project (SCSWSP), a partnership with the cities of Manteca, Lathrop, and
Escalon and the South San Joaquin Irrigation District. The SCSWSP delivers up to 10,000 acre-
feet per year of treated Stanislaus River water to the City.
Another 10,000 acre-feet per year is available through a Bureau of Reclamation contract from
the Delta Mendota Canal. An additional 10,000 acre-feet of less reliable supply is available from
the Delta Mendota Canal through agricultural water contracts the City purchased from the
Banta-Carbona Irrigation District and the West Side Irrigation District.
Finally, the City owns and operates eight wells through which it has historically pumped up to
9,000 acre-feet per year for municipal use. Since obtaining access to surface water supplies, the
City only uses well water for meeting peak demands or during the annual maintenance outage
of the City’s Water Treatment Plant. The well water is less desirable because it is heavily
mineralized.
In addition to the current water supply sources indicated above, the City is pursuing thousands
of additional acre-feet per year for future urban growth from the Byron-Bethany Irrigation
District, the Plain View Water District, water recycling, aquifer storage and recovery, and out-
of-area storage through the Semitropic Water Banking project.
The City of Tracy provides water service to all of its residents. In 2009, the City used
approximately 17,000 acre-feet of its 39,000 acre-feet supply. Upon General Plan buildout,
potable water demand is projected at about 36,300 acre feet per year. The City’s water supply
comes from both surface and groundwater sources and totals approximately 38,000 acre feet per
year. The City will have adequate water to accommodate projected water demands at buildout
of the General Plan.
6. Wastewater Capacity
The City of Tracy’s wastewater facilities include a collection system consisting of gravity sewer
lines, pump stations, force mains, and a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Wastewater
flows toward the northern part of the City where it is treated at the WWTP and then discharged
into the Old River in the southern Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The City of Tracy is the wastewater treatment service provider in Tracy. Wastewater treatment
capacity exceeds demand. In 2012, the average dry weather flow for the entire City was 7.6
million gallons per day (mgd). This flow is treated at the City’s WWTP which has a design
capacity of 10.8 mgd and a planned expansion to 16 mgd. Through existing facilities and
approved expansions, the City will have adequate wastewater treatment capacity to meet and
exceed the RHNA.
7. Habitat Protection
The Tracy Planning Area currently contains a range of vegetation and habitat types including
urban, agricultural, riparian woodlands, seasonal wetlands, farmed wetlands and non-native
grasslands. These vegetation areas and habitats, which are described below, host a wide range
City of Tracy
2015-2023 Housing Element                        74                            Public Review Draft

of wildlife and plant species that reflect the diversity in San Joaquin County and the Central
Valley.
There are numerous special status plant and animal species known to be located in the Tracy
Planning Area. Special-status species include plants and animals that are legally protected
under state and federal Endangered Species Acts or other regulations, as well as species
considered sufficiently rare by the scientific community to qualify for such listing.
As of 2009, there are six special-status mammals, 24 special-status birds, six special-status
reptiles and amphibians, two special-status invertebrates, and twelve special-status plant
species potentially occurring in the Planning Area. These include the San Joaquin kit fox,
Swainson’s hawk, San Joaquin pocket mouse and the giant garter snake.
In an effort to protect sensitive and threatened species throughout the county, the San Joaquin
Council of Governments (SJCOG) has prepared the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat
Conservation and Open Space Plan (SJMSCP). The purpose of the SJMSCP is to provide a
county-wide strategy for preserving open space, provide for the long-term management of
plant, fish and wildlife species, especially those that are currently listed or may be listed in the
future under the ESA or the California Endangered Species Act, and provide and maintain
multiple-use Open Spaces that contribute to the quality of life of the residents of San Joaquin
County. The City of Tracy has adopted the SJMSCP. Sites used to fulfill the RHNA are not
impacted by the SJMSCP.
There are numerous special status plant and animal species known to be located in the vicinity
of Tracy. In an effort to protect sensitive and threatened species, the City of Tracy participates
in the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation and Open Space Plan (SJMSCP).
The SJMSCP allows development to occur in the City limits while land is conserved elsewhere
in San Joaquin County for long-term management of plant, fish, and wildlife species. The
SJMSCP provides habitat mitigation for sufficient amounts of land for Tracy to exceed the
RHNA.

IV. Housing Resources
The extent of housing needs in a community often exceeds the resources available. The City of
Tracy must pool together limited resources and use them efficiently in order to address the
current and projected housing needs of its residents. This section of the Housing Element
provides an overview of resources available to the City.
A.       Regional Housing Needs Allocation
1. Projected Housing Needs
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate a share of the
region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is important because State law mandates that jurisdictions
provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic
segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is measured by the
jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to accommodate the RHNA. The San Joaquin
Council of Governments (SJCOG), as the regional planning agency, is responsible for allocating
the RHNA to individual jurisdictions within the region.
The RHNA is distributed by income category. For the 2015 Housing Element update, the City
of Tracy is allocated a RHNA of 4,976 units as follows:
    •    Extremely Low (up to 30 percent of AMI): 513 units (10.3 percent)
    •    Very Low Income (31 to 50 percent of AMI): 467 units (9.4 percent)
    •    Low Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 705 units (14.2 percent)
    •    Moderate Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 828 units (16.6 percent)
    •    Above Moderate Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 2,463 units (49.5 percent)
Credits toward the RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2014 as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing
Element planning period of 2015‐2023, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new
units built or issued certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2014. As of May 2015, 1,896
market-rate housing units are under construction or have been approved in Tracy (Table 40).
The location of these developments is illustrated in Figure 10. Overall, the City has a remaining
RHNA of 2,513 units, including 980 extremely low/very low income units, 705 low income
units, and 828 moderate income units.

2. Residential Sites Inventory
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the land
inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional growth. The City
is committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The State, through
AB 2348, has established “default” density standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes
that a density standard of 20 units per acre for suburban jurisdictions, such as Tracy, is
adequate to facilitate the production of housing affordable to lower income households.
Therefore, in estimating potential units by income range, it is assumed that:
    •    A density of 0 to 10 units per acre (primarily for single-family homes) is assumed to
         facilitate housing in the above moderate income category;
    •    A density of 11 to 19 units per acre (primarily for medium density multi-family
         developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the moderate income category; and
    •    A density of 20 or more units per acre (primarily for higher density multi-family
         developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the extremely low, very low and low
         income categories.
Residential Development Potential in Specific Plan Areas
The City anticipates that much of its future residential growth will occur within two Specific
Plan areas—the Tracy Hills Specific Plan and the Ellis Specific Plan. These Specific Plan areas
have the potential to yield over 6,600 units and are described in detail below:
Tracy Hills Specific Plan
The Tracy Hills Specific Plan was adopted in 1998 and encompasses approximately 2,731 acres
within the southern portion of the City surrounding the existing interchange at Corral Hollow
Road and the proposed Lammers Road interchange on Interstate 580. The specific plan area is
anticipated to include 5,499 housing units. In addition to the residential component, areas have
been designated for commercial, industrial and office uses. The Specific Plan offers four housing
densities for a diverse range of residential opportunities: Residential Estate (0.5 to 2.0 units per
acre), Low Density Residential (2.1 to 5.8 units per acre), Medium Density Residential (5.9 to
12.0 units per acre), and High Density Residential (12.1 to 25.0 units per acre).
Full development of the Tracy Hills Specific Plan area may take up to 20 years or more to
complete, depending on market conditions. Conceptually, it will be phased generally from east
to west or from the Corral Hollow Road end of the site to the western portions of the planning
area. The first phase of development is currently under review and expected to be considered
by the City Council in 2016 (Figure 8). This development application also includes an
amendment to the 1998 Specific Plan that proposes to rearrange the land uses within the
planning area. The total number of proposed dwelling units will not change; however, the
distribution of units (by land use category) will be modified. Table 41 below reflects the new
distribution of housing units, according to the proposed Tracy Hills Specific Plan amendment

   that is anticipated to be considered in 2016. The first phase of Tracy Hills is currently under
   review (Table 40) and these 1,162 units, proposed on the Specific Plan’s LDR parcels, have been
   removed from the residential development potential calculations below. Furthermore, in order
   to provide a more conservative estimate of Tracy Hills’ development potential, only one-half of
   the 2,014 units anticipated in the Specific Plan’s MDR parcels will be counted toward the City’s
   moderate-income RHNA, even though the maximum allowable density on these properties
   makes them suitable for the development of moderate-income housing units.

Ellis Specific Plan
The 2011 Tracy General Plan established a separate and distinct land use classification for the
Ellis Project entitled Traditional Residential-Ellis (TR-Ellis). In December 2011, the developer
filed applications with the City for a modification and amendment to the Original Ellis
Development Agreement (DA); a modification and amendment to the Original Ellis Specific
Plan; and Petition for Annexation and Pre-Zoning and General Plan Amendment (collectively
referred to as the “Modified Project”).
The Modified Ellis Specific Plan (ESP) pertains to 321-          acres-designated
                                                                            - as -Traditional
Residential-Ellis (TR-Ellis), Commercial, and Village Center (VC) in the City of Tracy General
Plan. The area is located between Lammers Road and Corral Hollow Road along the north side
of the Union Pacific rail line. The vision for Ellis is to create a village with a broad mix of
residential housing types and densities, neighborhood parks, and an opportunity to include a
Family-Oriented Swim Center (Family Swim Center) serving as a Community Park. Ellis will be
a pedestrian-friendly, compact, planned development. A Village Center with commercial and
office/professional uses will be located adjacent to the proposed Family Swim Center and will
serve as the focal point of community activities. These uses will all be within walking distance
of each other.
The Modified Ellis Specific Plan identifies two land use designations that allow for residential
development: Residential Mixed (4.0 to 9.0 units per acre) and Village Center (up to 9.0 units
per acre). Upon buildout, the plan will accommodate a maximum of 2,250 residential units
(minimum 1,000 units), not including secondary residential units.

The Ellis site currently has 100 RGAs, and is anticipated to receive more in the future, in
accordance with the Growth Management Ordinance (GMO). The first phase of development
within the Ellis Specific Plan was approved in 2014 and construction began in 2015. The specific
plan area has a remaining capacity of 1,131 units.

 Notes: Potential number of dwelling units is estimated as the midpoint of the dwelling unit range specified in Specific Plan.
Residential Development Potential on Vacant Sites
In addition to the Specific Plan areas discussed above, future housing units can also be
accommodated on various vacant sites located throughout the City. The sites inventory includes
several vacant sites designated for lower density residential uses (up to 12 units per acre). The
residential capacity on these sites is counted towards the City’s moderate- and above moderate-
income RHNA.
The City plans to accommodate the majority of its lower income RHNA on land designated as
Downtown (D) and Residential High (RH) by the General Plan. Residential development
within the RH designation can occur at a density of up to 25 units per acre, while the
Downtown designation can accommodate up to 40 units per acre. Senior housing is allowed
within the Downtown designation at a density of up to 50 units per acre. The Downtown
properties included in the sites inventory (detailed in Table 43 and illustrated in Figure 10) all
have zoning in place that accommodates residential development. Altogether, the City has
identified 35 acres of this high density land, with a total capacity of 1,054 lower income units.
City staff used their extensive knowledge of the City to select these particular vacant properties
based on a variety of factors, including parcel size, location, and redevelopment potential.
These vacant sites were previously identified in the City’s 2009-2014 Housing Element and are
currently still vacant and available for future residential development.

    Proposed Rezoning
    The City’s existing inventory of vacant sites has a shortfall of approximately 500 lower income
    units for meeting its RHNA obligations. To meet the RHNA for the upcoming planning period,
    the City will rezone adequate acreage within the City. Specifically, the City will rezone four
    properties (totaling over 31 acres) designated Residential High by the General Plan to HDR. The
    location of these parcels is illustrated in Figure 10.

    These four parcels are currently zoned Light Industrial; however, the Light Industrial zoning on
    these sites became obsolete when they were re-designated by the General Plan for residential
    uses. As a matter of land use policy, the General Plan is the guiding land use document in the
    City. The rezoning of these four properties is, therefore, technical in nature in order to maintain
    consistency with the General Plan and will be accomplished within two years of the adoption of
    the 2015-2023 Housing Element. The rezoning of properties to accommodate the City’s RHNA
    shortfall will also meet the following requirements:
            Sites must be rezoned to permit owner-occupied and rental multi-family housing by
             right without discretionary review of the use or density; and
            Sites must be zoned with a minimum density of at least 20 units per acre.
    Recent Development Trends
    Residential development capacity in the specific plan areas are based on the approved number
    of units in the specific plans. In vacant sites within the City’s downtown area, the capacity is
    estimated based on 80 percent of allowable densities. Table 45 presents examples of currently
    under construction or recently approved projects. These projects demonstrate that the City’s
    development standards are reasonable and that developers are able to achieve over 80 percent
    of the maximum density permitted.

     Comparison of Sites Inventory and RHNA
     In addition, to nearly 5,000 housing units already approved, under construction, or in review,
     the City of Tracy has the capacity to accommodate over 7,000 housing units within specific plan
     areas, vacant sites, and properties proposed for rezoning (Figure 10). This capacity exceeds the
     City’s RHNA of 4,976 units. Table 46 provides a summary of the City’s residential capacity and
     RHNA status.

B.       Financial Resources
As a small city, Tracy has limited access to financial resources for affordable housing. The
following list presents the realistic funding available to the City.
1. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
CDBG is the largest federal housing-related program for affordable housing. It is a "pass-
through" program that allows local governments to use federal funds to alleviate poverty and
blight. HUD makes allocations based on a formula that takes population, poverty, and housing
distress into account. CDBG funds are used for a variety of housing efforts including activities
aimed at reducing costs for private development (helping fund site acquisition, improvement,
and other soft costs); housing acquisition and rehabilitation through short and long-term loans,
grants or loan guarantees; direct payment of rent or mortgage and housing counseling services;
and fair housing activities.
Tracy receives CDBG funds through the San Joaquin Urban County program. The City uses 15
percent of its CDBG funds for public services with the remainder of the allocation going toward
public facilities. Tracy is typically allocated -
                                                approximately
                                                     - -       $450,000
                                                                   -in CDBG funds annually.
2. HOME Investment Partnership Act (HOME)
HOME, like CDBG, is a formula-based block grant program. HOME funds must be spent only
on housing, and are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition, construction, and
rehabilitation of affordable rental and home ownership. HOME requires local governments to
provide matching funds, though the matching ratio depends on the specific uses to which
HOME funds are to be put. The federal-to-local matching ratio for tenant assistance is currently
four-to-one, while the match for rental construction is two-to-one.
The City participates in the HOME program through San Joaquin County and receives
approximately
-        -$60,000 -in HOME funds annually.
3. Housing Choice Voucher Assistance (Section 8)
The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8) is a federal program that
provides rental assistance to very low-income persons in need of affordable housing. The
Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the
payment standard and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). The
voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, with the
tenant paying the extra cost. The Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin (HACSJ)
administers the HCV program for a number of communities in the County, including Tracy.
Approximately 150 Tracy households are currently being assisted with Housing Choice
Vouchers. However, the HCV waiting list has been closed since 2009.

C.       Administrative Resources
The following agencies and organizations can assist the City of Tracy in implementing the
housing programs and activities contained in this Housing Element, including preserving
affordable units that are at risk of converting to market-rate housing.
1. Development and Engineering Services (DES) Department
The Development and Engineering Services (DES) Department enhances and maintains the
community character of Tracy through application of the City's General Plan goals and
objectives. The DES Department comprehensively reviews and processes land development
applications for compliance with land use and design standards adopted in the Tracy Municipal
Code, Specific Plans, and other design standards and guidelines. The DES Department also
coordinates review of development applications between the project applicant, internal
divisions and departments, and outside agencies.
2. Finance Department
The Finance Department ensures the fiscal foundation and information systems necessary to
deliver community services and is responsible for City budget preparation and compliance,
accounting and financial reporting, debt issuance and management, accounts payable, City
employee payroll preparation, utility billing, business licensing, accounts receivable, cashiering
and sales, and information systems. The Finance Department also includes the elected office of
City Treasurer who oversees the investment of City funds and the Information Systems
Division.
3. Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin (HACSJ)
The Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin (HACSJ) is the agency responsible for
providing decent, safe, and affordable housing for low-income families, elderly, and the
disabled. HACSJ manages the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, providing rent
subsidies in the form of housing assistance payments to private landlords on behalf of eligible
families. The HCV program provides housing assistance to extremely low and very low-income
families, senior citizens, and disabled or handicapped persons. Its objective is to provide
affordable, decent and safe housing for eligible families, while increasing a family’s residential
mobility and choice.
HACSJ currently assists more than 19,000 people through distribution of 4,800 housing
vouchers (including single family homes spread throughout the County) and by managing and
maintaining 1,071 units in the County’s public housing developments. The HCV program also
includes programs such as Family Self-Sufficiency and Welfare to Work. These are designed to
assist families in becoming economically self-sufficient.

 4. Non-Profit Housing Developers
 Due to the high cost of housing development, many communities have found that partnerships
 with non-profit housing developers are an effective tool for creating affordable housing units. In
 Tracy, several affordable housing developments have been made possible through close
 coordination and partnership with non-profit housing developers.
 Visionary Home Builders of California
 Visionary Home Builders (VHB) is an organization whose mission is to create stable, vibrant
 communities through the development of affordable housing and provision of related programs
 and services for low and moderate income families, seniors and people with special needs. VHB
 began as a small group of farm workers in 1983 whose sole purpose was to improve the living
 environment for farm workers living in public housing. VHB is a prominent leader in the
 development and renovation of housing in the Central Valley region. VHB has developed over
 1,000 units of rental housing and 350 single-family homes, including the affordable 37-unit
 Mountain View Townhomes in the City of Tracy. VHB also offers homebuyer education classes
 to residents of San Joaquin County.
 CFY Development, Inc.
 CFY Development, Inc. is a committed community developer with over 25 years of experience
 acquiring, developing, building and rehabilitating workforce housing. The company’s portfolio
 includes 29 projects in 18 cities, with approximately 2,605 units under management. In addition
 to specializing in affordable housing, the company is also active in mixed-use and mixed-
 income development. The Tracy Community Development Agency entered into a below
 market deferred loan agreement with CFY Development, Inc. to provide gap financing for a 50-
 unit affordable senior housing complex, the Tracy Place Apartments. The complex was
 completed in 2008.
 Bridge Housing
 BRIDGE creates high-quality, affordable homes for working families and seniors. With over
 13,000 homes and counting, BRIDGE has become the leading affordable housing developer in
 California. Recently, BRIDGE acquired a 90-unit apartment complex in the Kentfield
 neighborhood of Stockton as part of a coordinated neighborhood revitalization program
 initiated by the City of Stockton. The City had identified the Kentfield Apartments as severely
 distressed and BRIDGE began a major rehabilitation of the property in 2008.
 Eden Housing
 Eden Housing is an affordable housing developer whose mission is to build and maintain high-
 quality, well-managed, service-enhanced affordable housing communities that meet the needs
 of lower income families, seniors and persons with disabilities. Though traditionally based in
 Alameda County, Eden has by now partnered with 20 cities in six counties to develop
 affordable housing and is expanding its geographical operations at a rapid pace to new
 communities, including the San Joaquin Valley. In 1996, the Agency assisted Eden in the

development and construction of 72 low income family apartments, the Stone Pine Meadow
complex, located at 229 W. Grant Line Road.
5. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing. While state
building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency requirements for new
development, the City and utility providers are also important resources to encourage and
facilitate energy conservation and to help residents minimize energy-related expenses.
City Programs and Policies
In Tracy, energy conservation can be achieved via a reduction in electricity usage and private
automobile use, encouraging efficient siting and exposure for buildings, and implementing land
use and transportation policies that encourage fewer and shorter vehicle trips. The City’s Open
Space and Conservation Element identifies the following goals, objectives, policies, and actions
to make efficient use of energy resources throughout the City of Tracy:
        New development projects should be designed for solar access and orientation.
         Maximum efficiency is gained by siting homes on an east-west axis.
        New development projects should include measures to reduce energy consumption
         through site and building design, material selection and mechanical systems.
        Use of on-site alternative energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) cells for commercial,
         residential and industrial users to install shall be encouraged.
        The City will encourage businesses to replace diesel vehicles with less polluting
         alternatives such as compressed natural gas (CNG), bio-based fuels, hybrids and electric
         cars.
        Study programs that encourage “green” building, such as the LEED (Leadership in
         Energy & Environmental Design) program developed by the US Green Building
         Council, and consider code amendments that encourage “green” construction.
        Develop a program to educate the public about energy efficiency technologies and
         practices for homes and businesses, such as solar panels and low-energy appliances.
        Partner with public utilities to establish and promote a program for home
         weatherization and solar retrofit.
        Develop design guidelines for residential construction to address the placement solar
         panels.
        New vehicles purchased and leased by the City should be alternatively fueled to the
         extent feasible. Common alternative fuel technologies include hybrid, electric bio-based
         fuels and compressed natural gas (CNG).
        The City will promote the development of alternative energy systems, including but not
         limited to solar thermal, photovoltaic and other clean energy systems, directly into
         building design and construction.

         The City will support public and private efforts to develop and operate alternative
          systems of wind, solar and other electrical production that take advantage of local
          renewable resources.
         Future development projects are expected to consider the following design features,
          during the Specific Plan, PUD, subdivision, and design development review: solar
          access and orientation, natural ventilation, energy efficient landscaping and energy
          efficient and conserving building design and technologies.
         The City shall encourage and support voluntary retrofit energy programs for residential,
          commercial, and industrial buildings.
         The City shall pursue the implementation of energy efficiency measures of existing and
          future City facilities as opportunities arise.
         The City shall support land use patterns that maximize energy efficiency, both by
          minimizing transportation and by making use of existing capital improvements.
         Develop or otherwise make available information to developers and citizens on energy
          efficient and conserving building design and technologies, including enhanced wall and
          ceiling insulation, thermally efficient glazing, and efficient heating and cooling
          equipment and household appliances.
         Review, and revise if necessary, the zoning ordinance and building codes, to allow for a
          variety of energy efficiency technologies so long as the revisions do not adversely
          impact human health or safety or conflict with other goals in this General Plan.
 Utility Provider Programs
 PG&E offers energy efficiency rebates to property owners and managers of multifamily
 dwellings. The program encourages owners of existing properties to upgrade to qualifying
 energy-efficient products in individual tenant units and in the common areas of residential
 apartment buildings, mobile home parks and condominium complexes. PG&E also offers an
 Energy Efficiency Savings Assistance Program that provides qualified customers with energy-
 saving improvements at no charge.

V.       Review of Past Accomplishments
State law (California Government Code Section 65588(a)) requires each jurisdiction to review its
housing element as frequently as appropriate and evaluate:
    •    The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
         attainment of the state housing goal;
    •    The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing
         goals and objectives; and
    •    The progress in implementation of the housing element.
The evaluation provides valuable information on the extent to which programs have been
successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and to which these
programs continue to be relevant to addressing current and future housing needs in Tracy. The
evaluation provides the basis for recommending modifications to policies and programs and
the establishment of new objectives in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
This section summarizes the City’s accomplishments in implementing the 2009-2014 Housing
Element. A program-by-program review is contained in Appendix B. Table 47 summarizes
Tracy’s quantified objectives for the 2009-2014 Housing Element period and compares the City’s
progress in fulfilling these objectives.

 VI. Housing Plan
 The City of Tracy’s long-term housing goal is to provide housing that fulfills the diverse needs
 of the community. In the short term, this will be accomplished with the objectives, policies, and
 programs set forth in this Housing Plan. The goals, policies, and programs in the Plan build
 upon the identified housing needs in the community, constraints confronting the City, and
 resources available to address the housing needs, and will guide City housing policy through
 the 2015-2023 planning period.
 Goals are statements of community desires which are broad in both purpose and aim, but are
 designed specifically to establish direction. Policies provide specific standards and/or end
 states for achieving a goal. Essentially, goals represent desired outcomes the City seeks to
 achieve through the implementation of policies. Further articulation of how the City will
 achieve the stated goals is found in the programs. Programs identify specific actions the City
 will undertake toward putting each goal and policy into action. Quantified objectives identified
 in particular programs are estimates of assistance the City will be able to offer, subject to
 available financial and administrative resources.
 To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community,
 the programs in the Housing Plan aim to:
     •    Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock;
     •    Assist in the development of housing for low- and moderate-income households;
     •    Identify adequate sites to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for
          all income levels;
     •    Address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints
          to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
     •    Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
 Table 48 at the end of this section summarizes the quantified objectives of the various housing
 programs for the period of December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2023.
 A.       Conservation of the Existing Supply of Housing
 Conserving and improving the housing stock is an important goal for the City of Tracy. The
 City supports neighborhood preservation and improvement through code enforcement.
 Goal 1.0         Conserve and improve the condition of the existing housing stock, especially
                  affordable housing.
 Policy 1.1       Promote the continued maintenance and enhancement of residential units.
 Policy 1.2       Work to preserve affordable units in publicly assisted housing developments
                  that are at risk of converting to market-rate housing.

Policy 1.3      Facilitate the removal of existing housing that poses serious health and safety
                hazards to residents and adjacent structures.
Policy 1.4      Work with property owners and nonprofit housing providers to preserve
                existing housing for low and moderate income households.
Policy 1.5      Promote energy conservation in housing.
Program 1: Housing Rehabilitation
The City previously offered several housing rehabilitation programs, including the Downtown
Rehabilitation Loan Program and the Downtown Rehabilitation Grant Program. However, due
to the dissolution of the Tracy Community Development Agency in 2012, the City eliminated
both programs due to lack of funding. Housing rehabilitation programs offered by the County
of San Joaquin have also been suspended with no timeline for reinstatement. The City will
work to identify and pursue additional funding sources to reinstate a housing rehabilitation
program, if feasible.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Annually consult the HCD and HUD websites to identify and pursue potential
            funding opportunities that may be available and appropriate to reinstate a housing
            rehabilitation program.
           Refer property owners in need of rehabilitation assistance to the San Joaquin County
            Neighborhood Preservation Division who administers the County's HUD Grant
            programs, which include housing rehabilitation programs (currently suspended).
         Responsible Agency: Tracy Economic Development Division
         Funding Sources:       General Fund
Program 2: Code Enforcement
The Code Enforcement Division handles the enforcement of the City's zoning regulations and
building and housing codes. Complaints received are investigated for possible violations and
compliance is handled first by direct person to person visit or by telephone to discuss the
violations and obtain voluntary compliance. The Code Enforcement Division also works with
other city departments and outside state and county agencies.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to investigate possible code violations.
           Continue to disseminate information on available housing rehabilitation assistance
            to address code violations and other housing issues.

Program 3: Graffiti Removal Program
The majority of graffiti is done by graffiti vandals known as "taggers." They are motivated by
the need to be recognized. The City of Tracy operates a Graffiti Removal Program. Residents
can report any graffiti they happen to see around the City on public or private property to the
City’s Graffiti Hot Line. This hot line is available 24 hours a day and completely anonymous.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to operate the Graffiti Hot Line.
         Responsible Agency: Public Works Department
         Funding Sources:      General Fund
Program 4: Affordable Housing Monitoring
The City has a large inventory of affordable housing units with different terms of affordability
covenants. None of the City’s affordable units are at-risk of converting to market rate during
the planning period; however, the City will continue to monitor the status of affordable units
with the objective of preserving the affordable housing stock.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Monitor status of affordable units annually by maintaining contact with property
            owners and HUD Multi-Family Housing division.
           Solicit interest and participation of nonprofit housing developers to acquire and
            preserve housing to be maintained as affordable units.
         Responsible Agency: Tracy Economic Development Division
         Funding Sources:      General Fund
B.       Assist in the Development of Affordable Housing
Providing affordable housing is essential for a healthy community. In addition to a diverse mix
of housing types, it is necessary to make available housing for residents of all income levels.
Seeking funding from varied sources increases the opportunities for development of affordable
housing units. The Tracy Development and Engineering Services (DES) Department actively
works with both non-profit and for-profit developers in the production of affordable for-sale
and rental housing. Recognizing that homeownership plays a significant role in establishing
strong neighborhoods and a sense of community pride, the City supports programs that make
purchasing a home a realistic option for lower and moderate income households.
Goal 2.0        Assist in the provision of housing that meets the needs of all economic
                segments of the community.
Policy 2.1      Facilitate homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income
                households.

Policy 2.2       Use density bonuses and other incentives to facilitate the development of new
                 housing for extremely low, very low, and low income households.
Policy 2.3       Work with non-profit and for-profit developers to maximize resources available
                 for the provision of housing affordable to lower income households.
Policy 2.4       Address the housing needs of special populations and extremely low income
                 households through a range of housing options, including emergency shelters,
                 transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
Policy 2.5       Promote the use of energy conservation features in the design of residential
                 development to conserve natural resources and lower energy costs.
Program 5: Down Payment Assistance (DAP) Loan Program
The City of Tracy Down Payment Assistance (DAP) Loan Program provides deferred
downpayment assistance loans to low income, first-time homebuyers for the purchase of homes
in the City of Tracy. The loans are intended to bridge the gap between the cost of a home and
what a low income household can afford by providing 10 percent of the home sales price (up to
$15,000, whichever is the lesser) to qualified households. All first-time home buyers must be
certified as first-time home buyers by a HUD approved agency (i.e., Visionary Home Builders).
The DAP is administered by the San Joaquin County Neighborhood Preservation Division.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to provide down payment assistance to qualified lower income households
            (up to 80 percent AMI).
           Disseminate information to prospective first-time homebuyers on the DAP Loan
            Program.
           Assist three households (an estimated one very low income and two low income
            households) annually.
         Responsible Agency: San Joaquin County Neighborhood Preservation Division
         Funding Sources:       HUD funds
Program 6: Homebuyer and Financial Literacy Training
Homebuyer and financial literacy education represents a key step to introducing households to
the challenges, responsibilities, and benefits of homeownership. These programs also serve as
critical components of asset-building, helping families build wealth – savings and equity –
rather than living paycheck to paycheck. In particular, homebuyer education programs help
first-time buyers evaluate their financial readiness, understand the home buying process,
explore different financing options, access homebuyer assistance programs, resolve credit
issues, and avoid predatory lending practices. Other asset-building education programs
address financial literacy more broadly. Homebuyer and financial literacy programs are best
offered in tandem with demand-side initiatives such as a down payment assistance program.

         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to require a “Certificate of Completion” from a HUD-approved
             homebuyer class in order to participate in the City’s DAP Loan Program.
            Partner with qualified local non-profit agencies to offer homebuyer education classes
             and publicize the availability of these classes to residents.

Program 7: Affordable Housing Development
Local governments can support the production of affordable and workforce housing by
contributing capital funds to local affordable housing developments. This financial assistance
can come in a variety of ways. Many jurisdictions defer, waive, or reimburse local permitting
fees for affordable units, either in 100 percent affordable developments or in mixed-income
inclusionary projects. While jurisdictions cannot legally waive impact fees, which are meant to
mitigate impacts generated by the project, they may offer financial assistance to cover these
costs. Alternately, cities can pay for the necessary infrastructure improvements to prepare a site
for residential development, in lieu of collecting impact fees. Below-market rate loans for land
acquisition and predevelopment can prove vital for affordable housing developers with limited
capital. The State also offers a number of funding sources for acquisition and predevelopment
costs.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to prioritize the allocation of RGAs to affordable housing projects
             (particularly for those projects that set aside units for extremely low income
             households and persons with special needs, including those with developmental
             disabilities).
            Proactively encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing by non-
             profit organizations for lower income households, particularly those with special
             needs including large households, seniors, extremely low-income (ELI) households,
             and households with persons who have disabilities or developmental disabilities.
            Continue to provide density bonuses and other incentives to developers who
             provide affordable units.

Program 8: Housing Choice Voucher Program
The City of Tracy contracts with the Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin (HACSJ)
to manage the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, which provides rent subsidies in the
form of housing assistance payments to private landlords on behalf of eligible families. The
HCV program, funded by HUD, provides housing assistance to extremely low and very low
income families, senior citizens, and disabled or handicapped persons. Its objective is to provide

affordable, decent and safe housing for eligible families, while increasing a family’s residential
mobility and choice. The Voucher Program also includes programs such as Family Self-
Sufficiency and Welfare to Work. These are designed to assist families in becoming
economically self-sufficient.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Disseminate information to the public regarding the HCV program and promote
            participation by rental property owners.
           Annually contact the HACSJ to obtain information on the status of the HCV program
            and other available resources.
           Continue to support HACSJ’s petition for increased funding from HUD.
           Continue to work with HACSJ to provide HCVs to Tracy residents.
           Continue to work with the HACSJ to assist households through the Family Self-
            Sufficiency Program.

Program 9: Sustainability Program
The City adopted a Sustainability Action Plan in 2011. The Sustainability Action Plan provides
the City with a guide to reduce GHG emissions, reduce consumption of nonrenewable
resources, improve public health, promote economic vitality, implement the General Plan, and
engage residents. Implementation of the Sustainability Action Plan will also place Tracy at a
competitive advantage in attracting new job industries. The Plan identifies opportunities for
Tracy to be a destination of local employment centers and green jobs, an emerging field that
diversifies Tracy’s economic base and attracts complementary industries. Approximately every
five years following the adoption of the Sustainability Action Plan in 2011, or as funding is
available, the City will conduct a comprehensive update to the greenhouse gas emission
inventory and release a progress report. The progress report will list the measures that have
been implemented to date and summarize the results of periodic reviews that have been
conducted.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to implement the Sustainability Action Plan.

Program 10: Affordability by Design
“Affordability by Design” refers to a series of zoning and site design standards that regulate
building form to promote the construction of affordable housing. These standards facilitate
more efficient use of land, thereby lowering a development’s per unit costs without sacrificing
construction or building design quality. Although Affordability by Design concepts do not

guarantee the provision of affordable housing, they do establish a regulatory environment
wherein affordable units may occur.
The City recently adopted amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to incorporate Affordability
by Design principles. For example, any use, including multi-family residential, may request a
reduction in required parking based on a study or survey that illustrates that required parking
is not warranted. Applicants may also receive up to a 20 percent reduction of the otherwise
required number of parking spaces pursuant to T.M.C. Section 10.08.3470(e). The City of Tracy
has also relaxed the required distance between structures in the HDR Zoning District from the
average height of the two buildings to 10 feet. This has provided for greater flexibility for the
allowance and maximum usage of residential sites.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to implement the recently adopted Zoning Amendments that incorporate
            affordability by design concepts described in the General Plan.
          Promote Affordability by Design principles by placing information on City website
            and at public counters by 2016.

C.       Provide Adequate Housing Sites
A key element in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community is the provision
of adequate sites for all types, sizes and prices of housing. Persons and households of different
ages, types, incomes, and lifestyles have a variety of housing needs and preferences that evolve
over time and in response to changing life circumstances. Providing an adequate supply and
diversity of housing accommodates changing housing needs of residents. The Tracy General
Plan and Zoning Ordinance, as well as Specific Plans, establish where housing may locate. To
provide adequate housing and maximize use of limited land resources, new development
should be constructed at appropriate densities that maximize the intended use of the land.
Goal 3.0        Provide suitable sites for housing development which can accommodate a
                range of housing by type, size, location, price, and tenure.
Policy 3.1      Provide for a range of residential densities and products, including low-density
                single-family uses, moderate-density townhomes, and higher-density
                apartments, condominiums, and units in mixed-use developments.
Policy 3.2      Encourage development of residential uses in strategic proximity to
                employment, recreational facilities, schools, neighborhood commercial areas, and
                transportation routes.
Policy 3.3      Encourage compatible residential development in areas with recyclable or
                underutilized land.

Policy 3.4       Promote the adaptive reuse of existing commercial/industrial buildings as a
                 conservation measure.
Policy 3.5       Promote flexible development standards to provide for a variety of housing
                 types.
Program 11: Provision of Adequate Sites
The City is committed to ensuring that adequate sites at appropriate densities remain available
during the planning period, as required by law. The City will maintain an inventory of vacant
sites to accommodate the City’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) of 4,976 units.
Specifically, the City already has 4,856 housing units under construction, approved, or under
review since January 1, 2014—leaving a remaining RHNA of 2,513 lower and moderate income
units. The City will ensure that an adequate supply of vacant sites, at appropriate densities and
development standards, are available during the planning period to accommodate the
remaining RHNA.
Most of this lower income RHNA can be accommodated on vacant sites throughout the City
that are currently zoned to allow higher density residential uses. The City will also rezone a
group of four adjacent properties, totaling over 31 acres, from Light Industrial to HDR. These
four parcels, located at the intersection of Valpico Road and Mission Court, are already
designated Residential High by the General Plan. The rezoning of these four properties is,
therefore, technical in nature in order to maintain consistency with the General Plan and will be
accomplished within two years of the adoption of the 2015-2023 Housing Element. The rezoning
of properties to accommodate the City’s RHNA shortfall will also meet the following
requirements:
    •    Sites must be rezoned to permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily housing by
         right without discretionary review of the use or density; and
    •    Sites must be zoned with a minimum density of at least 20 units per acre.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Complete rezoning of the four parcels on Valpico Road within two years of the
             adoption of the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
            Monitor and update the sites inventory annually to assess its adequacy for meeting
             the RHNA, particularly for sites capable of facilitating the development of lower
             income housing.
            Make the inventory of vacant sites available to interested developers after adoption
             of the Housing Element.
            Should properties identified in the residential sites inventory become unavailable
             during the planning period, resulting in a shortfall in sites for meeting the RHNA,
             the City will identify additional sites per Government Code § 65863.

Program 12: Property Acquisition and Improvement
The City will continue to identify and seek partnerships with organizations and the County in
order to acquire, improve, and develop affordable housing.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to identify and seek partnerships with organizations and the County in
            order to acquire, improve, and develop affordable housing
           Continue to assist in site acquisition for affordable housing. As funding permits,
            prioritize funding assistance to affordable housing projects that set aside units for
            seniors, persons with disabilities, and extremely low income households.

Program 13: Inclusionary Housing
Inclusionary programs are established through local ordinances that require market rate
residential developers to set aside a certain portion of units in a development for income-
restricted affordable housing (both rental and homeownership). In order to make affordable
housing more accessible to workforce-income households, the City could consider ways to
incorporate voluntary inclusionary housing incentives into the GMO to increase the supply of
low, moderate, and/or workforce income units.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to explore the potential and set the stage for a voluntary inclusionary
            housing program that includes an extremely low income housing component.
           Monitor the City’s affordability conditions and identify an inclusionary housing

D.       Remove Governmental Constraints
Pursuant to State law, the City is obligated to address, and where legally possible, remove
governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. Removing constraints on housing development can help address housing needs in the
City by expediting construction, and lowering development costs.
Goal 4.0        Mitigate any potential governmental constraints to housing production and
                affordability.
Policy 4.1      Review and adjust as appropriate residential development standards,
                regulations, ordinances, and processing procedures that are determined to
                constrain housing development, particularly housing for lower and moderate
                income households and for persons with special needs.
Policy 4.2      Allow more than 150 affordable housing units as exceptions under the GMO.
Program 15: Zoning Ordinance
The City of Tracy is currently considering an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance that includes
updated provisions for emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, SROs,
manufactured housing, and second units. The amendment will also update the City’s definition
of “family” and establish a formal reasonable accommodations procedure. The Planning
Commission reviewed this amendment in October 2015 and adoption by the City Council is
anticipated in 2015.
Additional revisions related to density bonuses, residential care facilities, farmworker housing,
and employee housing will be completed by 2016. The City will also continue to evaluate its
Zoning Ordinance for any potential constraints to the development of housing on an ongoing
basis and process amendments as necessary.

           Complete Zoning Ordinance amendments to address the provision of density
            bonuses, residential care facilities, farmworker housing, and employee housing by
            2016. Specifically:
            -  Density Bonus: Update Density Bonus Ordinance to reflect the requirements of

               incentive, or concession.
            -  Residential Care Facilities: to In accordance with the Lanterman Act, amend the
               Zoning Ordinance to permit residential care facilities serving six or fewer
               persons as a single-family residential use. In addition, consistent with City
               practice, amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow residential care facilities of seven
               or more persons in all residential zones with a Conditional Use Permit.
            -  Farmworker Housing: The California Employee Housing Act further defines
               housing for agricultural workers consisting of 36 beds or 12 units be treated as an
               agricultural use and permitted where agricultural uses are permitted. The City of
               Tracy permits crop and tree farming in the A, LDR, MDC, MDR, and HDR zones.
               The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to address the provision of
               farmworker housing consistent with the Employee Housing Act.
            -  Employee Housing: The California Employee Housing Act requires that housing
               for six or fewer employees be treated as a regular residential use. The City will

Program 16: Growth Management Ordinance (GMO)
The City of Tracy adopted the residential Growth Management Ordinance (GMO) and the
Guidelines in 1987. The GMO was amended from time to time with significant amendments
occurring in 1994, 2000, 2009, 2012, and most recently in April 2013. Under the GMO, builders
must obtain a Residential Growth Allotment (RGA) in order to secure a residential building
permit. The 2013 amendment ensured that the RHNA could be entirely accommodated,
notwithstanding the numerical limits stated in Measure A or the GMO. Other exemptions in the
GMO include the following: (1) rehabilitation, remodeling or additions to existing structures; (2)
replacement of previously existing dwelling units that had been demolished; (3) construction of
“model homes” until they are converted to residential units; (4) development of a project with
four or fewer dwelling units; and (5) secondary residential units. Residential projects exempt
from the GMO are not counted toward the 600 annual average or the 750 annual maximum. The
City will continue to monitor the GMO for any potential constraints to the development of
housing on an ongoing basis and process amendments as necessary.

         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Annually monitor and evaluate the Growth Management Ordinance for the impacts
            on the cost, supply and timing of housing including seeking input from residential
            developers and affordable housing stakeholders in reviewing the effects of the GMO.
            The review will reflect the RHNA as a minimum and consider impacts on overall
            housing supply in addition to accommodating the RHNA. Information will be
            included and evaluated as part of the annual Growth Management Status report,
            published in the fourth quarter of each calendar year.

E.       Provide Equal Housing Opportunities
To meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing Plan includes a
program to promote housing opportunities for all persons consistent with Federal and State fair
housing laws. The City works with the Stockton-San Joaquin Community Housing Resource
Board, which provides several fair housing and tenant/landlord services.
Goal 5.0        Continue to promote equal housing opportunity in the City’s housing market
                consistent with Federal and State fair housing laws.
Policy 5.1      Provide fair housing services to Tracy residents, and ensure that residents are
                aware of their rights and responsibilities regarding fair housing.
Policy 5.2      Provide equal access to housing for special needs residents such as the homeless,
                elderly, and disabled.
Policy 5.3      Promote the provisions of disabled-accessible units and housing for mentally
                and physically disabled.
Program 17: Fair Housing
The City actively furthers fair housing in the community. Specifically, the City contracts the San
Joaquin Fair Housing Association to promote fair housing and provide fair housing services for
its residents. The City refers complaints regarding fair housing and housing discrimination to
the agency, whose office is located in downtown Stockton, and maintains this service using
CDBG funds.
         Objectives and Timeframe:
          Continue to support the San Joaquin Fair Housing Association, or other qualified fair
            housing agencies with CDBG funds and refer residents seeking fair housing
            assistance.
           Advertise the services provided by the San Joaquin Fair Housing Association (or
            other qualified fair housing agencies) in City buildings and other public buildings

3. Public Comments
Planning Commissioners Mitracos and Ransom commented on the need for affordable housing,
particularly the need for senior housing. The City should continue to outreach to the seniors to
discuss housing needs and also to developers to discuss opportunities.
Several residents attended the Study Session and commented on the need for affordable
housing, including housing for the homeless and for the seniors. The City should explore other
housing options such as micro units. Senior housing in the City has long a waiting list. The City
may consider the “housing first” model such as in Utah where the state pays for housing for the
homeless. Adequate roads to serve the new house should also be a consideration; Tracy
Boulevard and Carrol Hollow Road are packed. Another resident commented on the need for
housing for persons with developmental disabilities.
Representative from the Building Industry Association (BIA) of the Delta also attended the
meeting and suggested a new approach to zoning regulations to facilitate housing development
by enforcing the minimum density instead of maximum density, and by allowing small lots in
existing neighborhoods.
