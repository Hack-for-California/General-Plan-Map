Introduction
The Land Use and Urban Design Element addresses the major issues that affect the
physical form and development of the
community. It offers policy guidance that will
help preserve and enhance the quality of life in
the City of La Mesa, where the population has
been forecast to increase from 58,000 (2010) to
approximately 66,000 (2030) during the next
twenty years. To support a livable community,
the City will need to blend the enduring
qualities of the existing community with
anticipated growth. This means balancing the
                                                                     La Mesa Vista
preservation of established neighborhoods and
new developments. The Goals and Policies of this Element emphasize the following five
concepts:
    •   The City’s neighborhoods and facilities should be preserved and improved.
    •   New development and redevelopment should exhibit high quality design and fit the
        characteristics of the City’s neighborhoods and Districts.
    •   Land use decisions should support sustainability by conserving valuable resources
        and planning for future generations.
    •   Promote local job creation and retention by encouraging new business
        opportunities.
    •   Land Use and Urban Design are integrated in this Element to ensure that the
        physical forms, patterns, and aesthetics of future development advance La Mesa’s
        goals for high quality of life and a more sustainable future.
A Glossary of technical terms is located in the final pages of this Element.
Purpose
California Law requires cities to adopt specific elements in their general plans. This
Element fulfills the requirement for Land Use, as defined in Section 65302(a) of the
Government Code. The City of La Mesa does not have significant agricultural land,
mineral resources, forests, or areas subject to flooding; therefore these topics are not
discussed in this Element. Although not required, this Element includes Goals and Policies
about urban design. Most future development will be infill or redevelopment of
underutilized sites. An Urban Design Program ensures that future development fits in to
the existing community.

The Land Use and Urban Design Element serves as a guide for planners, decision makers
and the general public about the ultimate pattern of development for the City of La Mesa.
This Element’s Policies provide the context for short-term actions involving development,
public works, and zoning decisions, as well as the long-term vision. The City’s General Plan
goal is to preserve the past while allowing a level of growth necessary to sustain a viable
community. Table LD-1 summarizes the existing and projected population, housing and
job growth for the 2030 horizon year of this General Plan and looks ahead to 2050.

Organization and Content
The Land Use and Urban Design Element is comprised of general land use goals, urban
design goals and related objectives and policies. It is valuable to inventory and map land
uses to assess current patterns and anticipate future growth and infrastructure needs in
La Mesa. The Planned Land Use Map (page LD-28) sets the City’s vision for growth. The
land use categories listed in the map’s legend describe the land use potential of each parcel
and reflect existing land use patterns where development has occurred.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Land Use and Urban Design Element shares topic areas with the other General Plan
Elements and integrates the policies from those Elements of La Mesa’s General Plan with
the proposed land use patterns designated on the General Plan Land Use Diagram. The
Circulation Element outlines goals and policies for a complete transportation system that
will be supported by policies in this Element. The Conservation and Sustainability
Element, and Recreation and Open Space Element contain policies that protect valuable
natural and recreational resources that need to be considered in land use planning. Table
LD-2 provides a full summary of shared topic areas. All Elements were prepared together
to ensure internal consistency.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                              2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Physical and Community Characteristics
The City of La Mesa is 9.2 square miles in area and is located 14 miles inland from the
Pacific Ocean (See Figure LD-1). It is immediately adjacent to the eastern boundary of the
City of San Diego, along both sides of Interstate 8, and 11 miles from Downtown San
Diego. The City also shares borders with the cities of El Cajon and Lemon Grove, and an
unincorporated section of San Diego County.
La Mesa is located in an ecological transition zone between the coast and foothills, in a part
of western San Diego County dominated by a series of geologic features known as marine
terraces. Over the past 2.5 million years, stream erosion cut canyons through these
terraces defining communities and sub-regions. Alvarado Creek and Chollas Creek, which
are located in La Mesa, are examples of terrace cutting streams. Elevations in La Mesa
range from slightly less than 400 feet to over 1000 feet above sea level in the eastern
portion of the City. The majority of La Mesa is located between 500 and 700 feet above
sea level.
Major transportation corridors and natural scenic resources such as Mt. Helix and Mt.
Nebo define the geography of the City and surrounding areas. The City is divided by
Highway 125 (north/south) and Interstate 8 (east/west). The transportation network also
includes two light-rail trolley lines.
In La Mesa, distinctive street patterns influence
how individual sites relate to the public realm and
to surrounding private land. The street grid
network containing smaller lots is found between
I-8 and State Route 94, particularly in west La
Mesa. These neighborhoods are more conducive
to multiple modes of circulation and mixed-use
development, primarily along University Avenue
and El Cajon Boulevard. The street grid pattern
promotes high connectivity and flexibility for new      Alvarado Creek provides natural drainage.

La Mesa is known as the Jewel of the Hills with its tree-lined neighborhoods, its Downtown
Village, and its walkable streets. Figure LD-2 shows La Mesa’s neighborhoods. The City is
enriched by families with deep roots and a long history in the community. Neighborhoods
are highly developed and need to be well-served by conveniently located commercial
districts and community services and facilities, such as parks, schools, childcare facilities,
and religious institutions. Infill develop-
ment can revitalize the community if
consistent with the surroundings and
ecologically designed. While certain neigh-
borhoods in La Mesa show signs of
deterioration, this Plan’s goals and policies
are designed to address long-term neigh-
borhood conservation and improvement.
Many of the oldest neighborhoods are
served by infrastructure that may be
undersized or has reached the end of its
useful life.
Future development may need to upgrade

the development review process. When
surveyed on community priorities, most residents indicated increased neighborhood police
patrols, better enforcement of the speed limit and prevention of drug traffic regardless of
where in the City they lived. Increased participation in neighborhood initiatives is
encouraged to educate, renew, and reenergize communities so that all residents may
benefit from La Mesa’s natural setting, sustainable practices, high quality of life, economic
opportunities, and unique neighborhoods.
During the next 20 years, the population in the region and in the City will continue to grow.
Recent surveys indicate that residents want neighborhood revitalization to emphasize a
network of mixed-use transportation corridors and to use commercial nodes as gateways
into La Mesa. When walkable destinations and sidewalk infrastructure are lacking, social
isolation, limited recreation opportunities and automobile dependence can occur. Because
the street pattern is unlikely to change significantly over the next 20 years, the City will be
challenged to evaluate proposed development projects relative to what already exists to
identify opportunities to connect a project to nearby land uses.

Historic Context
The City of La Mesa was settled in the late 1800’s
after California was annexed to the United States.
The City provided a convenient way station for
travelers and shipments going east, especially after
gold was discovered in Julian. When La Mesa was
incorporated in 1912, it had only 700 residents.
La Mesa Village was a cluster of residences and
businesses centered on the intersection of
Lookout Avenue and Chollas Road. Today's
University Avenue, then called Chollas Road, was
the original wagon road along Chollas Creek and               Downtown La Mesa 1915
Lookout Avenue is now La Mesa Boulevard.
The City grew to 2,500 people in 1930; however, growth was stifled during the Great
Depression until World War II. The Post-War period resulted in tremendous growth
throughout Southern California. In 1950, La Mesa’s population was approximately 11,000
and by 1960 it had nearly tripled to over 30,000. Residential neighborhoods developed
along the University Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard corridors, and on the north side of
the City. La Mesa grew in size as well as population during this period. Figure LD-3 shows
the annexation history of the City.
Commercial development activity increased in La Mesa after World War II. In the 1950s
the City subdivided and sold land that it owned in the area that is now an industrial area,
north of I-8 and southeast of the trolley tracks. In 1961 the 65-acre Grossmont Shopping
Center was developed. Today, both the Grossmont Shopping Center site and properties
within the industrial area represent potential redevelopment opportunities. As vacant land
was consumed by single-family neighborhoods,
rising land costs in the older parts of town
created an opportunity for higher density
residential development.
Neighborhoods built in the 1950s and 1960s
along the north side of Interstate 8 tend to
have wider, curvilinear streets, which
sometimes end as cul-de-sacs. The northern
and eastern suburbs of La Mesa characterized
by curvilinear street          patterns make
connections and the transformation to other                 Downtown La Mesa 2012
land uses more difficult.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                                     2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Low density single-family neighborhoods on large hillside lots are located south of
University Avenue and extend east into unincorporated County land; connections and the
transformation to other land uses in this area is also difficult. Thus, large portions of the
City are envisioned to remain as stable neighborhoods to be maintained and enhanced as
opportunities arise.
For a period of time in the 1950s and 1960s, apartment developments began to encroach
on some of La Mesa's historic residential neighborhoods. This trend was reversed in the
1970s as citizens took a more active interest in preserving the heritage of their City. The
results of this interest are reflected both in this Element and in the policies contained in the
Historic Preservation Element of La Mesa’s General Plan.
In the 1970s, large-scale, suburban residential development occurred along with the
construction of new public facilities, including La Mesita Park, which opened as La Mesa's
Bicentennial Park. The Baltimore Drive Bridge over Interstate 8 was constructed, reuniting
north and south La Mesa.
By 1980, with a population of approximately 50,300 residents, it became apparent that
certain areas of the City were in need of redevelopment. The City invested in new public
infrastructure including streets, sidewalks and storm water management facilities. The mid-
1980s also brought light-rail transit through La Mesa. The San Diego Metropolitan Transit
System (MTS) constructed the Orange Line Trolley and four stations within the City limits.
In 1992, the City completed award-winning improvements along Fletcher Parkway in order
to attract quality businesses to La Mesa. These improvements resulted in millions of dollars
of new private investment along Fletcher Parkway between Grossmont Center Drive and
the west City limits.
The City's last large piece of vacant land, 150-acres, located north of SR-94, was developed
during the decade of 2000. The "Serramar" project contains 228 large single-family
dwellings and a 50-acre open space preserve.
In 2000, construction began on the Green
Line trolley service from the Old Town
Transit Center to the Grossmont Trolley
Station. Completed in 2005 the Green Line
added a new station at 70th Street, the fifth
trolley station in La Mesa. In 2005, the 23-acre
Junior Seau Sports Complex was completed,
and redevelopment of the La Mesa Civic
Center began.                                            Five trolley stations are located in La Mesa.
The advent of trolley service in La Mesa has encouraged the concentration of planning
efforts around the transit stations to encourage mixed use, Transit-Oriented Developments

(TODs). Examples include the La Mesa Village Plaza in Downtown La Mesa on the west
side of Spring Street and the La Mesa Archstone apartment project near the Amaya station.
The most recent example of a TOD in La Mesa is the Pravada and Alterra apartment
project at the Grossmont Trolley Station. These projects help La Mesa to continue
fulfilling the Regional goal to locate housing and employment opportunities close to transit
services.
La Mesa’s history has influenced the City’s land use by establishing transit corridors and
community character. Moving forward to the General Plan horizon year of 2030, much of
the development proposed in the intervening years will consist of “infill” development.
Infill development is the use of vacant or underutilized sites within a previously developed
area. This sustainable form of land development was also recommended in the last
General Plan Update (1996) because it recycles developed land in context with existing
features of the City.

Land Use
Land use decisions must further the welfare of people and their neighborhoods by creating
healthful, sustainable, and attractive environments for present and future generations. This
Element integrates land use policies that will ensure that the physical forms, patterns, and
aesthetics of future development and redevelopment advance La Mesa’s desire for a high
quality of life and a more sustainable future.
Sustainability and Climate Change
Climate Change Legislation
Promoting sustainability in the City will have a positive effect on quality of life and help the
City meet the requirements set forth by recent climate change legislation. Climate change is
a shift in the "average weather" that a given region experiences. This is measured by changes
in the aspects that we associate with weather, such as temperature, wind patterns,
precipitation, and storms. The aim of most climate change legislation is to reduce GHG
(Greenhouse Gas) emissions, which are released into the atmosphere naturally and through
human activity. The increasing presence of heat-trapping gases is the result of burning coal,
oil, and natural gas, as well as the destruction of forests and other human activities.
In 2006, the State Legislature took a proactive stance against the challenges of climate
change with the adoption of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB
32). The California Air Resource Board (CARB) was charged with developing regulations
and market mechanisms that would reduce the State’s GHG emissions to 1990 levels by
2020. This represents a 25 percent reduction Statewide, with mandatory caps for
significant emission sources that began in 2012.
The Sustainable Communities and Climate
Protection Act (SB 375), which passed in
2008, is designed to help coordinate land use
and transportation planning in an effort to
promote sustainability and reduce vehicle
miles traveled (VMT). The law requires
regions to meet their target for reducing GHG
emissions associated with passenger vehicle
travel. The California Air Resources Board
determined that the San Diego Region needs

13% by 2035. Some of the main strategies for
reducing emission in La Mesa and the region include supporting mixed-use development,
encouraging alternative transportation, promoting energy efficiency, and using Green
Building Techniques.

SANDAG’s 2050 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
(RTP/SCS) outlines a blueprint for ensuring mobility, enhancing quality of life, supporting
a prosperous economy, and promoting sustainability, in San Diego County. The 2050
RTP/SCS lays out a plan for investing an estimated $214 billion in local, State, and Federal
transportation funds expected to come into the region over the next 40 years. Building on
the existing transportation system, the plan outlines future improvements for all
transportation types that will put in place an integrated multi-modal system by mid-century.
Sustainability
While previous versions of the General Plan have supported sustainable practices such as
mixed-use development and resource conservation, this update includes a more
comprehensive approach to sustainability that seeks to reduce our impact on the
environment and promote healthy living. La Mesa’s efforts to reduce its contribution to
global climate change will promote sustainability within the City and meet Regional and
State-level targets for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.
For the City of La Mesa, improving sustainability includes policies to reduce Greenhouse
Gas Emissions, protect the water supply, create vibrant public spaces, support a strong local
economy and promote health and wellness for all residents. Land use and urban design
decisions influence sustainability because distribution of land use types, their design,
accessibility, and intensity has a profound effect on energy use, water use, and
transportation choices. Decisions that positively affect the natural environment should work
together with the economic environment and also address social equity concerns.
2011 marked the 31st consecutive year that
the City of La Mesa has been named a
Tree City USA community by the National
Arbor Day Foundation, the National
Association of State Foresters, and the
USDA Forest Service.              The award
acknowledges the City’s commitment to an
effective, ongoing community forestry
program. Residents recognize that trees in
the City’s landscape help to consume
carbon dioxide so that people can breathe

easier. Trees also help to conserve water
and provide habitat for wildlife. Most importantly, while increasing property value, more
trees will reduce energy use and the heat island effect where building and road surfaces
retain the heat from sunlight.
La Mesa benefits from excellent access to transportation infrastructure (including three
freeways, five light-rail trolley stops and five bus routes) and has a history of providing
compact, mixed-use development along its major transportation corridors. Despite these

strides, the City can continue to make improvements. The City’s 2005 GHG emissions
inventory showed that the transportation sector generates approximately 70% of the
La Mesa’s total emissions. At current rates, emissions are projected to increase 20 percent
by 2020. The benefits from emission reductions accrue incrementally over time, so it is
important for the City to support programs and policies that reduce GHG emissions.
GHG reduction measures will have important
benefits for the environment and community.
La Mesa can reduce GHG emissions through
land use and transportation planning decisions
that link jobs and residences to alternative
modes of transportation. Walking, biking and
transit have a positive impact on air quality while
offering healthier, more social ways to travel
compared to a private automobile.

The region’s path towards living more
sustainably is clear: focus housing and job growth in urbanized areas where there is an
existing, and planned transportation infrastructure. Most importantly, invest in a
transportation network that provides residents and workers with transportation options that
reduce GHG emissions and implement the Plan through incentives and collaboration.
SANDAG’s RTP/SCS encourages a land use pattern that accommodates the region’s
future employment and housing needs. For
example, Sharp Grossmont Hospital is one of La
Mesa’s leading employers, as well as the only
Regional hospital in the East County. The
hospital is located in the Grossmont area, an
urban node that allows residents to live, work and
conduct business within the City. The Regional
Growth Forecast projects that La Mesa’s
population will grow by 13.5% by 2030. Nearly
3,000 homes and 3,000 jobs will be added during
this period. As residential density increases, local

job creation and economic growth help to
maintain the quality of life in La Mesa.
The City encourages development that will attract Regional employers to locate in
La Mesa. Quality jobs with higher than average wages lead to increased incomes for
residents. Figure LD-4 depicts employment density within the City and helps to identify
opportune areas for this development. For example, the Industrial Center is ideally
located. If revitalized, this District could increase the number of jobs available. La Mesa’s

compact geography and plentiful transportation routes are appealing to retail, professional
and industrial businesses serving all of East County. Additionally, local businesses are
connected to a market of nearly one half-million persons in a 5-mile radius.
As La Mesa develops into an established Regional employment center, a balanced
transportation system is increasingly important, and the City will need to aggressively work
to maintain access to Regional bus networks that link to other transit systems and Regional
employment centers. The biggest impact can be made by the employer. Transportation
demand management plans encourage the reduction of single-occupancy vehicle use
during rush hours by providing people with enhanced travel choices. These choices refer
to travel mode, travel route and trip departure time. Reducing traffic congestion requires
planning for supportive land uses and roadway networks that are conducive to serving
alternative modes of transportation. The City can provide this support by (1.)
incorporating alternative modes of transportation into improvements proposed in
development applications; (2.) allowing for requests for reductions in off-street parking
requirements for projects that have a transportation demand management program; and
(3.) providing information to residents and business owners on opportunities for walking,
bicycling, ride-sharing, and transit. The Conservation and Sustainability and Circulation
Elements provide further discussion of sustainable transportation options.

Existing Land Use
The existing Land Use Map (Figure LD-5) records 2010 development patterns and served
as a basis for developing the Land Use Plan. The City’s crossroads location is a destination
for Regional-serving land uses. Most of the nine square miles within the City limits are
devoted to two main uses: single-family homes on individual lots and transportation rights-
of-way. While large tracts of single-family developments are located north of I-8, in the west
end of the City and on hillsides; over half of the housing units in La Mesa are a part of
multi-family developments located in clusters near major arterial streets. Table LD-3
illustrates the general distribution of Existing
Land Uses in the City.
Commercial developments include suburban
shopping centers, a Regional shopping center,
a Downtown shopping village, and strip
commercial areas. Within the well-established
land use patterns of La Mesa there will be
areas needing protection to preserve the
community’s quality of life and areas that will
need reinvestment and redevelopment to                          La Mesa Village Plaza features
remain viable in the region.                                       mixed-use development.
In 2011, a State-mandated revision to the Housing Element of the General Plan was begun.
As part of that revision, the estimated residential development potential for vacant and
underdeveloped parcels under current policies is 674 dwelling units. A few vacant sites are
scattered throughout the City in small parcels, generally less than an acre in size. Since all
the easily developed land within La Mesa has been built upon, many land use policies
relate to infill development on difficult sites. There is very little industrial development
located within the City – 34 acres divided into 78 parcels north of Interstate 8 and east of
Spring Street. This land could benefit greatly from redevelopment and modern office
buildings in order to enhance its potential as the City’s employment area. The remaining
land within the City is used for a variety of public or private institutions including schools,
parks, and churches. For the most part, the existing land use pattern will remain the same.

Planned Land Use
The City of La Mesa is highly developed; therefore, future growth will include
redevelopment and the recycling of land and buildings as new uses are proposed. In 2012,
there were approximately 130 acres of vacant property on 234 parcels, which equals 2.2%
of the total land area in La Mesa. Development potential exists near the City’s transit
stations, within mixed-use corridors, the focus area surrounding the Grossmont Shopping
Center and additional opportunity sites discussed on page LD-23.

Transit Stations
La Mesa transit stations are hubs of activity and are anticipated to be used more intensively
in coming years. New infill development is encouraged near each station.
     La Mesa Boulevard Station - The Downtown location of this Station intersects major
     bus routes and provides transit access to the Civic Center, Village Commercial and
     surrounding residential areas. The Station has limited parking available. The old
     Police Station, old Post Office site, and Civic Center parking lot areas offer the
     opportunity to develop compact new uses
     that complement the variety of uses in the
     heart of Downtown.
     70th Street Station - There is redevelopment
     potential for more intensive mixed-use
     projects located near the 70th Street Trolley
     Station in the Alvarado Creek area. Sites in
     this area are designated for Regional Serving
     Commercial uses to contribute to the local
     economy, such as office, hotel, multi-family
                                                       The Green Line trolley stops at 70th street station.
     or mixed-use development.
     Amaya Station - There is potential for infill development on nearby vacant parcels and
     development opportunity on the north side of Amaya Drive where there is an under-
     utilized shopping center with lots of surface parking. The south side of the Station
     features older properties with redevelopment potential.
     Spring Street Station – This Station is near 300 military housing units. Additional
     mixed-use infill development could occur in
     the area surrounding the Trolley Station.
     Grossmont Station – This is a transfer
     station between the Green and Orange
     Lines of the Trolley. In 2010, the Pravada
     and Alterra apartments opened at the
     Station. Improvements to the Station
     platform began, including new elevator
     access from Grossmont Center Drive. With
     anticipated growth of the Grossmont
     Medical Campus and Grossmont Shopping
     Center sites, this Station may remain the          The Pravada Apartments at Grossmont Station
     heaviest used stop in the City.

Mixed-Use Corridors
Mixed-use development brings safety and vitality
to the City’s streets and neighborhoods. There is
potential for compact redevelopment along the
City’s main corridors. El Cajon Boulevard and
University Avenue are bus transit corridors that
have underutilized parcels ripe for redevelopment.
The “Mixed-Use Urban” land use designation is
used along the City’s urbanizing transportation
corridors, allowing up to 40 units per acre.
In 2003, the City adopted a Mixed-Use Overlay               Mixed-Use Project at Lemon Avenue
Zone for lots designated “Mixed-Use Urban,”
along University Avenue, El Cajon Boulevard, portions of La Mesa Boulevard, and near
the Spring Street Trolley Station. The Overlay Zone is intended to revitalize older
commercial corridors, increase opportunities for infill housing, encourage innovative retail
that is less automobile dependent, and help to create pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods
where local residents have services, shops, jobs and access to transit within walking distance
of their homes.
For new development within the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone, new amenities such as wider
sidewalks and street trees are required to create a pedestrian realm. A reduction in the
number of parking spaces required may be permitted for mixed-use projects that contain
retail, restaurants, office, and other neighborhood-serving uses on the ground floor.
Recreation and leisure space must be provided for each residential or Mixed-Use project
containing residential uses. The maximum building height within the Overlay Zone is 46
feet, unless the Planning Commission grants a height increase by issuance of a Special
Permit. New development and major renovations within the Overlay Zone are subject to
design review by the City’s Design Review Board. Separate Design Guidelines for
properties within the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone have been prepared to insure quality design
that is sensitive to surrounding properties. The City’s Mixed-Use Corridors encourage
multiple activities within these neighborhoods and create opportunities for interaction,
economic growth and increased quality of life.
Grossmont Shopping Center Focus Area
The General Plan’s Regional Serving Commercial land use designation is applied to areas
in the City such as Grossmont Shopping Center, which is suitable for more intense urban
activities drawing customers from outside, as well as inside, the City. Grossmont Shopping
Center is a Regional-serving mall containing approximately 940,000 square feet of building
area including major anchor stores and a movie theater. The Center is located on a 64 acre
site bounded by Center Drive to the north, Grossmont Center Drive to the east, Murray
Drive to the south, and Jackson Drive to the west. Grossmont Shopping Center was first

developed in the early 1960’s, with mall buildings surrounded by surface parking lots and
smaller satellite buildings. Since most buildings are located in the middle of the property,
various options exist for future expansion or redevelopment with new uses. There is an
opportunity for new development on this property to define new vehicular and pedestrian
access and circulation patterns, locate new buildings and landmarks within the highly visible
site, and unify the architectural and landscape design of the site through the City’s Design
Review Process as remodeling occurs. The General Plan envisions that this site will
become a focus of redevelopment activity within the City’s Grossmont Specific Plan area.
Additional Opportunity Sites
Specific parcels in the City will require further evaluation to align the land use designation
with the zone classification.
The site of the former Police Station at the northeast corner of Allison Avenue and Nebo
Drive is also an opportunity site. Current General Plan designation and zoning
classification is Civic Use. If these were changed to Downtown Commercial, a mixed-use
development could be constructed.

includes an extensive analysis of properties that satisfy the City’s need for sites to
accommodate new housing development. Analysis of these sites shows that La Mesa has
adequate capacity to meet our share of the growth in the region’s housing stock.
As future private development proposals are received by the City, the appropriate use of
the land will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Figure LD-6 shows these development
opportunity sites, including the areas covered by the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone.

Population Density
Density Standards for each zone establish the development pattern for the community by
considering the number of dwelling units and the
size of each unit. When discussing population
density, it is important to consider the changing
average household size. Between 2000 and 2010,
the average household size in La Mesa increased
from 2.2 to 2.3 persons per household. The City’s
average household size is estimated to reach 2.35
by 2030. Another factor which affects the
population density in residential areas is infill
development. Infill development may occur on
                                                          La Mesa’s average household size is

oversized lots that have the potential to be
subdivided and redeveloped. Additional information about population characteristics and
housing needs in La Mesa can be found in the Housing Element of this General Plan.
Density Bonuses
State Government Code allows density bonuses for developments that provide affordable
housing and senior housing. The amount of the State-granted bonus is based upon the
percentage of specialized housing provided. The City will abide by the provisions of State
Density Bonus Law (California Government Code Section 65915 – 65918) as amended
from time to time. Projects which employ these provisions would be subject to review to
ensure that they meet the City’s goals of providing housing to underserved communities
and the maintenance of neighborhood character and cohesion.
     Accessory Dwelling Units
     The State has also mandated that second units, as defined by the Government Code
     and the Zoning Ordinance, shall not be counted against the density limits of the Land
     Use Element. In La Mesa these second units are referred to as Accessory Dwelling
     Units and are reviewed and approved subject to the Development Standards of the
     Municipal Code.
     Planned Residential Developments
     Within all single-family residential categories, development can occur using the
     Planned Residential Development (PRD) provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. The
     development standards for a PRD allow the clustering of development on a site,
     resulting in projects which can better achieve the objectives of the Urban Design
     Program. However, the PRD regulations require projects to be compatible with
     surrounding uses and stay within the density provisions of the underlying zone or the
     applicable General Plan category.

     part of this strategy is commitment of more of the region’s transportation resources to
     improve the public transit system. Transit systems work best in neighborhoods
     characterized by dense residential and commercial development. The La Mesa
     General Plan encourages Transit-Oriented Development, by permitting an
     intensification of a mix of uses adjacent to trolley stations and along transit corridors.
     Mixed-Use Projects
     Mixed-use projects may be proposed that include residential components at a density
     higher than multi-family residential land use designations and zones. Mixed-use can
     mean a combination of two or more uses on one site or within one structure
     (residential, retail, office, or institutional). It is envisioned that a typical mixed-use
     project would have a density of 40 dwelling units per acre, consistent with the densities
     permitted in La Mesa’s Mixed-Use Overlay Zone. However, projects of greater density
     could be considered on their individual merits. Discretionary review of Site
     Development Plan applications or review as part of the specific plan process can be
     used to more precisely establish these standards prior to development. Such projects
     would still have to meet development standards, design criteria, and be compatible
     with surrounding uses.
Building Intensity
State of California General Plan Guidelines require that cities address building intensity in
addition to population density. Building intensity generally refers to the bulk and scale of
development; factors including lot coverage and building height are considered in regard to
building intensity. Quantifiable standards of building intensity for each land use
designation define the most intensive use that will be allowed under each designation. The
concentration of use can be defined by one or more quantitative measures that relate
directly to the amount of physical development that will be allowed. Building height
limitations are an example of a commercial development standard.
A key goal of the General Plan is to insure that new development fits within the context of
existing neighborhoods. The “fit” of a proposed project is determined through the
development review process and includes a review of specific development standards as
well as aesthetic considerations. Non-residential development is regulated in part by the
City’s Zoning Ordinance, which lists various permitted uses by zone classification as well as
Development Standards, including building setbacks and minimum parking ratios. These
development standards are used to control the density and scale of development.
Aesthetics are reviewed in accordance with adopted City policies such as those contained in
the City’s Urban Design Program.

Land Use Designations
A primary expression of land use policy in the La Mesa General Plan is the Land Use
Map, which illustrates the planned land uses throughout the City (Figure LD-7). The land
use designations shown on the map illustrate the spatial arrangement of residential,
commercial and public uses, which are intended to achieve the Goals and Policies of this
General Plan. The Land Use Map utilizes 16 separate designations which provide a wide
range of land uses and development intensities. The Land Use Map is used to illustrate the
planned distribution of land use patterns throughout the City. A table which correlates
each land use designation to its implementing zone classification is shown below as Table
LD-4.
The Land Use Map is an expression of the Land Use Goals and Policies of the General
Plan and should be thought of as a policy statement of the Land Use and Urban Design
Element as well. The application of the Land Use designations provides one of the primary
tools for implementing the General Plan. Amendments to the Land Use Map will be
treated as an amendment of the General Plan and will be required to follow the proper
procedures for such changes. Amendments to the Land Use Map will be required to
consider the policies of the Land Use and Urban Design Element and must also be found
to be internally consistent with the policies within the other Elements of the General Plan.

A summary of each Land Use designation is provided below:
1. Open Space
This land use designation is assigned to those few remaining areas in and around the City
that have value as natural preserves or passive
open spaces. Areas within this land use category
will be limited in their development options due
primarily to environmental and topographical
factors. The Open Space Land Use designation
has been applied to retain existing desirable
natural lands as a permanent open visual asset.
The City continues to monitor and protect 50
acres of open space set aside in 2003 as part of
the Multiple Species Conservation Program
(MSCP) Implementing Agreement in the
                                                                 Tungsten Canyon
Serramar neighborhood to protect a variety of
species including the California gnatcatcher. The
open space designation also applies to parcels under a variety of ownerships in a narrow
band south of and parallel to Interstate 8.
2. Rural Residential (1-2 DU/AC)
This land use designation is assigned to recognize the large-lot residential estate
development in the Grossmont-Mt. Helix area. Development can occur at densities of
between one and two dwelling units per acre; however, areas with steep slopes may realize
densities less than one unit per acre. Rural characteristics and natural terrain are to be
preserved through utilization of grading practices, which create natural appearing land-
forms. Mature landscaping shall be preserved when feasible.
3. Semi-Rural Residential (3 DU/ac)
This land use designation is assigned to neighborhoods with single-family detached homes
on lots of 14,000 square feet or larger. An example of this designation is the area southeast
of State Route 125 known as La Mesa Highlands. Areas in this designation still enjoy some
rural characteristics, which are to be preserved in the same manner described in the Rural
Residential designation.

4. Suburban Residential (4 DU/acre)
This land use designation is assigned to suburban
neighborhoods with lots of 10,000 square feet or
larger, which result in lower density
developments with space between residences and
relatively large yards. Areas such as Eastridge and
the lower slopes of Mt. Helix are examples of
this type of development. Development in this
category will be limited to minor infill resulting
from the subdivision of existing lots.
                                                            Single-family homes in the Serramar
5. Urban Residential (7-10 DU/acre)                                    development.
This land use designation is assigned to the
broadest cross-section of single-family neighborhoods in the City. Most areas are fully built
out, with existing development consisting primarily of single-family detached homes on
6,000 square foot lots. Minor infill development may occur in these neighborhoods;
however, new development must be compatible with surrounding neighborhoods in terms
of density and structure type. In the Rolando Knolls area west of 70th Street, a density of 10
units per acre may be achieved on larger lots as permitted by the zone, which has historically
permitted 2 dwelling units per lot.
6. Restricted Multiple Unit Residential (14 DU/acre)
This ;and use designation is assigned to duplex and other small scale multiple-family type
developments within the City. It is intended that the Restricted Multiple Unit Residential
designation serve in some cases as a buffer between single-family residential areas and more
intensive uses such as apartments or commercial developments. In those situations,
developments in this designation will be reviewed carefully to ensure that they do not
intrude or adversely impact adjacent single-family neighborhoods.
7. Multiple Unit Residential (18 – 23 DU/acre)
This land use designation is assigned to
moderately high-density residential development
consisting of apartments and multiple-family
condominium developments. Areas assigned this
land use designation shall generally be located
adjacent to streets, which are shown as Major
Collector, Arterial, or Arterial Parkway in the
Circulation Element. Higher density residential
development is also encouraged in areas with            Apartments a short walk from Amaya Station.

commercial development.

Some existing developments within this designation, built prior to 1977 under different City
standards, may have residential densities in excess of 40 dwelling units per acre. New
development in these areas will generally be limited to 18 dwelling unit per net acre, unless
density bonus provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or State Law are employed.
The City’s current Zoning Ordinance allows for an increase of density in the Multiple Unit
residentially zoned properties of 5 additional dwelling units per net acre (for a maximum of
the 23 dwelling units per net acre). This bonus is granted to those projects which provide a
higher level of amenities such as additional open space area or enclosed off-street parking.
8. Mixed Density Residential (7 - 23 DU/acre)
This land use designation is assigned to the unusual residential mix in the area between El
Cajon Blvd and Interstate 8. The intent is to recognize areas which have begun a transition
from primarily single-family homes to some higher density residential development. For
areas in this designation, the City will attempt to create a pattern of single-family and
multiple-family zoning districts, which will allow new development without adversely
affecting existing viable neighborhoods. In areas where the single-family residential
characteristics are to be preserved, densities above 7 DU's/ac will not be allowed.
9. Local Serving Commercial
This land use designation is assigned to a range of retail commercial and personal service
activities which respond to the needs of nearby residential neighborhoods. This designation
generally includes shopping centers that offer potential for redevelopment as mixed-use,
including residential use. Auto-oriented uses should be limited to gas dispensing and minor
maintenance services that do not require extended outdoor storage of vehicles or materials.
Building types permitted in this designation generally include one and two-story buildings,
either freestanding or in small-scale neighborhood shopping centers.
10. Downtown Commercial
This land use designation promotes a
concentrated blend of pedestrian-oriented
shops, personal services, professional and
government offices, cultural activities, and
residential uses. Mixed use that supports the
pedestrian character of the Village is
encouraged. Cultural activities that engage
residents and visitors are encouraged
Downtown. Residences above the first floor
commercial uses are encouraged. The
Downtown Village Specific Plan offers further            Antique Alley in the Downtown Village
elaboration on these policies.

11. Mixed Use Urban (40 DU/acre)
This land use designation is assigned to the City's transportation corridors such as
University Avenue, El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. It is intended to allow a
more intensive level of commercial development than Local Serving Commercial, but not
the high volume Regionally significant activities found in Regional Serving Commercial. By
allowing a mixture of residential and commercial uses along established transit routes, the
City hopes to encourage new housing that is less dependent upon the automobile for access
and creates a livable urban environment.
Uses proposing outside sales and storage, auto-related uses (including vehicle sales, rental
and maintenance services) and drive-through facilities are conditionally permitted. Because
this designation allows such a variety of uses, which in most cases will be adjacent to
residential areas, new developments will be carefully studied during the Design Review
Process to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses. In some areas the mix of uses and the
scale of development may be limited to reflect adjoining land use patterns or specific plan
policies.
12. Regional Serving Commercial
This land use designation is assigned to those areas of the City which are suitable for more
intense urban activities, such as high volume retail sales, and other sales and services which
are expected to draw local and Regional customers. Areas designated Regional
Commercial are served by convenient freeway access and public transportation. Grossmont
Center, Fletcher Parkway and Alvarado Road are examples of areas where the designation
is applied.
Examples of uses intended in the Regional Commercial designation include retail shopping
centers, large office complexes and uses providing services to the traveling public such as
restaurants, service stations, hotels, and motels. Entertainment uses such as movie theaters
and nightclubs may be conditionally permitted. Within larger areas of the City, which have
been designated Regional Serving Commercial; there may be areas which are suitable for
mixed-use or high density residential developments. The appropriate mix of uses permitted
within these areas will be determined on a case-by-case review or by the amendment or
adoption of a specific plan which will also establish the appropriate residential density.

Goal LU-7: A City that maintains strong relationships across
jurisdictions.
Objective LU-7.1: Open communication, cooperation, and collaboration with
neighboring communities and relevant agencies.
     Policy LU-7.1.1: The City of La Mesa will actively participate in Regional planning

     development and redevelopment of property. The City will coordinate with utility
     providers as needed.
Inter-Jurisdictional Coordination
La Mesa will remain a participant in Regional efforts to coordinate the exchange of
information between governmental agencies and utility providers leading to mutual
agreement upon public and private development activities. In order to make effective land
use and transportation planning decisions, La Mesa collaborates with the County of San
Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), the San Diego County
Regional Airport Authority and the neighboring cities of El Cajon, Lemon Grove, and San
Diego. Development activity within neighboring cities will be of interest to La Mesa as they

                                                                                           2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
improve the economic climate of the area. The City will be assisted in this effort by a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by all local jurisdictions in 1990. This
MOU commits cities in the County to provide notices to adjacent jurisdictions when
development is proposed which might impact the neighboring agency.
County of San Diego
The County of San Diego and the City of La Mesa have a Memorandum of
Understanding, which provides for review of projects near the County boundary. The City
also uses Regional Standards, established by the County, for project review within the City.
La Mesa’s Community Development Department coordinates with County agencies such
as the Health and Human Services Agency Department of Environmental Health
Hazardous Materials Division and the Air Pollution Control District.
San Diego County Regional Airport Authority
One of the responsibilities of the San Diego
County Regional Airport Authority is to serve as
the San Diego County Airport Land Use
Commission (ALUC) which is responsible for
airport land use compatibility planning in the
vicinity of the 16 public use and military airports in
San Diego County. The City of La Mesa falls
within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) for
Montgomery and Gillespie Fields.
Most of La Mesa lies within Montgomery Field                       Gillespie Field Airport
Airport Influence Review Area 2, which is an
airport over-flight notification area applicable to new residential development. If any future
home development or redevelopment occurs within Airport Influence Review Area 2, a
real estate professional is required to disclose, upon property transaction, the fact that
airplane over-flights occur from Montgomery Field (see Figure LD-8).
The northeastern edge of La Mesa is within Gillespie Field Airport Influence Review Area
2. This area of the City consists of developed single-family residential neighborhoods that
cross the municipal boundary between La Mesa and El Cajon. If new housing or housing
redevelopment were to occur in this neighborhood, real estate professionals are required to
disclose to buyers the fact that airplane over-flights occur from Gillespie Field. The
Gillespie Field ALUCP requires the recordation of an overflight notification or, in some
cases, an avigation easement to the County of San Diego. The recordation of an overflight
notification applies only to new developments, whereas avigation easements apply to any
new use of property (see Figure LD-9).

SANDAG’s 2050 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy
(RTP/SCS) will implement a long-range vision for highways, bus and trolley service, rail
lines, bicycle travel, pedestrian travel, and the movement of goods. La Mesa will directly
benefit from local trolley, bus, and freeway improvement projects, while projects across the
region will improve connections and accessibility for La Mesa residents traveling outside
the City. Senate Bill 375 requires preparation of a Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS)
as part of the region’s transportation plan. The SCS shows how future development
patterns, infrastructure investments, and transportation policies will allow the region to
meet GHG emission reduction targets set by the California Air Resources Board. To help
meet the reduction targets for the region, La Mesa supports infill development, alternative
transportation, and conservation of energy and water resources.
San Diego Local Agency Formation Commission
Sphere of Influence
The San Diego Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCO) exercises both regulatory
and planning functions. LAFCO’s major planning task is the establishment of "Spheres of
Influence" for the governmental bodies within its jurisdiction. As described by Section
56076 of the Government Code, the Sphere is to be "a plan for the probable physical
boundaries and service area of a local government agency." In the late 1980’s, studies of

the unincorporated area to the east of the City were made to see if additional property
should be annexed into the City of La Mesa. Due to fiscal impact concerns, additional
lands annexed into the City were limited to single-family home sites with failing septic
systems. The City’s Sphere of Influence aligns with the municipal boundary. LAFCO
determined that the City’s Sphere of Influence is co-terminus with the La Mesa municipal
boundary.
The City of La Mesa works with San Diego’s Local Agency Formation Commission on
requests for annexation from private property owners who reside beyond the City. Most
annexation cases have come about as requests to access City sewer facilities. In lieu of
annexation, requests to connect to City sewer facilities may be considered when septic
systems are failing. When a Sphere of Influence is updated, LAFCO performs a Service
Review Determination for any changes in municipal services.
Urban Design
To complement La Mesa’s beautiful
natural setting, the City seeks design
excellence within its business districts,
residential neighborhoods, and public
areas. Urban Design addresses the
design of buildings and their
relationship to neighboring buildings,
open space, streets, and transportation
corridors. This Element provides the

basis for aesthetic review and
regulation of public and private land and structures. The process of Urban Design helps
maintain and create quality in the built environment of La Mesa.
In addition to its physical setting, the City takes pride in preserving its historical image as a
distinct suburban community within the San Diego Metropolitan Area. As the region has
grown and urban growth has engulfed La Mesa, it has taken more of an effort from the City
to maintain its identity as a singular community with its own memorable attributes. An
important function of this Plan is to establish policies and programs that forge the image of
the City as growth continues to occur.
Purpose
The City’s Urban Design Program and related Design Guidelines will be used to ensure
the built environment contributes to the qualities that distinguish La Mesa as a unique
place to live, work, and recreate.
Sustainable infill development and redevelopment that build upon existing neighborhoods
will be encouraged due to La Mesa’s limited supply of vacant land.

City Policies on urban form and design are a tool to address the natural environment and
target new growth to transportation corridors.
Community Image
To guide decisions about individual development projects and assure that they fit within
the context of the community, the Community Development Department uses the concept
of “Community Image” developed by Kevin Lynch, a noted expert on urban form.
Community Image is a planning tool consisting of
an association of visual images which collectively
help to identify a city's physical form and
character. The Community Image vocabulary
includes nine elements briefly outlined in Table
LD-5. Image studies of this type reflect individual
perspectives of a community, but are also a means
of recording a general consensus about existing or
planned urban design elements of a city. The
following major Elements make up La Mesa’s

    •   The Trolley lines are a major circulation path through the City.
    •   The freeways and Fletcher Parkway are major paths with edges that define major
        portions of the City.
    •   The major arterials in the City, University Avenue, La Mesa Boulevard, El Cajon
        Boulevard, Spring Street, Baltimore Drive, Jackson Drive, and 70th Street are
        major paths, edges and boundaries for the City's Districts.
    •   Mount Helix is a major landmark to the east of the City.
    •   The Grossmont Center and Grossmont Medical Campus comprise a major
        District. These sites will continue to develop with new uses in future years and
        represent opportunities for innovative, sustainable design.
    •   The Downtown Village and Civic Center are major nodes. Both of these areas will
        be enhanced with new streetscapes and uses for increased pedestrian mobility.
    •   Many of the "gateways" to the community are poorly defined and do not serve the
        identifying function they should.
    •   There are many panoramic views from along and on top of the City's hills.

Using these major Elements of Community Image, an image map of La Mesa is shown in
Figure LD-10. This map is one of many possible images of the community as the City
continues to evolve.
How and where new development occurs may affect the overall image of the City. The
design success of new development will also be measured within the context of its
immediate neighborhood, on specific site criteria, and on its architectural merits. The
Urban Design Goals, Policies and Programs listed herein are meant to insure successful
design for the progression of projects in the City as measured on a community-wide,
neighborhood, and site specific scale.

Table LD-5. Community Image Elements
                 Paths are the channels through the city along which the observer moves. They may be
                 streets, walkways, transit lines, or railroads. People observe the city while moving
       PATH      through it, and along these paths the other environmental elements are arranged and
                 related.
                 Edges are linear elements such as shores, steep slopes, edges of development, or
       EDGE
                 walls that serve as boundaries between two phases or breaks in continuity. Such
                 edges may be barriers which close one region off from another, of they may be seams
                 along which two regions are related and joined together.
                 Landmarks are usually either physical objects such as signs, isolated towers, unique
    LANDMARK
                 buildings; or natural features such as a hill or lake. They may be within the city or at
                 such a distance that they symbolize a constant direction.
                 Districts are the medium to large sections of the city which are recognizable as having
     DISTRICT
                 some common, identifying character. The district character is often identifiable by the
                 unity of land uses and development.
                 Nodes are the strategic spots in a city into which an observer can enter, and which are
       NODE
                 the intensive foci to and from which people travel. Many nodes, by nature, are both
                 junctions of paths and polarizing centers for districts. Nodes are well defined and
                 recognized by a cohesive design theme using architectural treatment or street
                 hardware.
                 Groupings are small-to-medium sections of the city that are similar in relation to
    GROUPING
                 districts. They are a collection of similar units that bridge gaps left between districts
                 and nodes. A grouping may be buildings of similar character, use, or history, or be
                 non-structural such as a park or open space.
                 Gateways serve as the visual entries or exits between a district, grouping, or denote an
     GATEWAY
                 access through an edge. A gateway may be characterized by natural or man-made
                 features, usually in conjunction with traveling along a path. The use of gateways helps
                 to define entries by portraying positive community characteristics or elements that are
                 easily recognizable.
                 Panoramic views provide an overall image of a large portion of the city or outlying
    PANORAMIC
                 region. The location may be within or adjacent to the city and from an easily access
       VIEW      point such as a hill top, pass, or atop a landmark.
                 Vista is similar to panoramic views but with a much narrower angle. These views are
       VISTA
                 characterized by long vertically defined spaces that open to allow sight of a few select
                 elements. Common examples occur along streets, corridors, or groves that open on to
                 views of the ocean, a major building, or a square.

Community Design and Sustainability Guidelines
Place-making in urban areas with all too frequent
generic developments is a continuous challenge.
In revitalized and new special places, community
and consumer interests are heightened.
Sustainability practices can be incorporated into
all phases of the Development Process, from
project conceptualization and choice of site, to
building design and construction.
Sustainable Development is development that
meets the needs of the present without                      Gateway Sign on Fletcher Parkway
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable
Development approaches are gaining recognition as not only feasible, but preferred
options to conventional forms of development. Activities in support of Sustainable
Development can be pursued through collaborative working relationships that address the
following twelve principles:
    •   Select environmentally friendly materials, build more compactly to save land, mix
        uses and provide connections to adjoining development.
    •   Respect geography by conserving and retaining natural systems such as streams,
        wetlands, native vegetation and habitat, and provide open space for urban respite.
    •   Reuse and recycle land and buildings as successive uses locate within the City.
    •   Design buildings to use natural heating and
        cooling and to minimize the need for
        mechanical equipment. Use energy efficient
        mechanical systems for low energy use.
        Consider condensing furnaces for residential
        heating, centrifugal chillers for commercial
        cooling, energy recovery and economizer
        equipment, variable speed motors, gas-fired
        water and air heating systems.
    •   Reduce energy consumption through the              Re-Used Buildings along Fletcher Parkway
        use of additional wall and roof insulation,
        and building practices that optimize heating and cooling management.
    •   Select high performance windows to reflect or transmit heat and orient windows
        properly relative to the sun.
    •   Use sun-reflective roofs and skylights for energy savings.

                                                                                                2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
     •  Replace inefficient lighting which can account for a substantial share of energy costs
        with low energy lighting systems such as compact fluorescent light emitting diodes
        or task-oriented lighting with occupancy sensors and on/off scheduling.
     •  Incorporate passive solar systems and active solar energy production into building
        designs to meet a substantial portion of heating and cooling needs.
     •  Design for walking, cycling and transit use to reduce dependence on the
        automobile and minimize land area dedicated for parking.
     •  Make distinctive places and incorporate amenities that foster community cohesion.
     •  Conserve water resources utilizing climate appropriate landscaping and on-site
        storm water management.
Sustainable or “Green” Building is the process of designing and building efficient structures
that minimize the use of energy, water, and material resources. The application of
sustainable site design principles can create
commercial and residential projects that are
efficient and affordable. Workplaces that are sited
with access to transit, and have clearly defined
pedestrian routes, encourage opportunities for
walking to work and for minimizing traffic
congestion       and   related     economic      and
environmental costs. A building’s location and
context are important factors to reduce energy
demand while increasing opportunities for                 New development fits within the context of
improved personal health and social interaction.                     the community.
The most sustainable developments are those that meet the needs for daily life and work.
Progress towards a sustainable community can be made by encouraging “green”
redevelopment and new projects that improve the built environment and quality of life for
the City’s citizens.
The Urban Design Program
The Urban Design Program utilizes principles of good urban design in a review process
intended to insure that new development fits into the fabric of the community. The
Program establishes a system to evaluate both public and private projects based on the
Community Image Concept and hierarchy of land use ranging from Regional to site
specific plans. The design review process is a key method of implementing the Land Use
Element of the General Plan as development review occurs. Projects subject to design
review include new or substantially renovated commercial properties, multi-unit residential
developments, projects within the City’s Mixed-Use corridors, and sites within the
Downtown Village Specific Plan area.

The Urban Design Program is geared toward consideration of individual buildings and
sites, with the idea that incremental redevelopment and renovation will enhance the overall
quality of the built environment and improve the aesthetic quality of life in the community.
This focus on private development also considers, however, the larger urban context and
public realm. For both private and public realms, consideration of Development
Guidelines and use of sustainable design techniques are key factors in the project review
and approval process. As new technologies and new design methods become available,
existing Design Guidelines should periodically be reviewed and updated for improvements.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
La Mesa’s Urban Design Goals, Policies, and Objectives are in line with the following
principles:
1. Development pattern, form, and structure are crucial to creating a sense of place.
2. Well designed development is sustainable, visually appealing, and designed to fit within
the current or planned context of the surrounding area.

Implementation
The General Plan is a policy document adopted by City Council Resolution. In order to
implement its policies, other plans and programs must be adopted. A variety of these plans
and programs have been used in La Mesa to implement Land Use Policy; including
Specific Plans, redevelopment project areas, development regulations, the Urban Design
Program, and a collection of related activities. This section briefly describes how each of
these plans and programs work within La Mesa.
Specific Plans
Specific plans are used in many California cities to
establish a link between implementing policies of
the General Plan and the individual development
proposals in a defined area. The content of a
Specific Plan remains consistent with the General
Plan, and usually includes an examination of
current conditions, a forecast of future conditions,
a list of goals and policies, needed public
improvements, and a set of development
regulations tailored to the unique characteristics
and planning issues in an area. In La Mesa,                     Grossmont Medical Center
Specific Plans have been adopted in four areas:
Grossmont Specific Plan
Grossmont Center and Grossmont Hospital are part of a high density Commercial District
serving the City and region with a variety of commercial uses and professional services
including retail, restaurants, medical offices, and a hospital. The Grossmont Specific Plan

area is generally bounded by Interstate 8 to the south, Jackson Drive to the west, Parkway
Drive to the north, and Amaya Drive to the east. This area comprises the largest
Commercial District in La Mesa. The Plan envisions the area developing with fairly high
densities, taking advantage of the variety of available transportation options (trolley, bus,
freeway access) for continued economic growth. The Plan was first adopted in 1985 and
the area has received numerous improvements, such as the construction of a Trolley
Station and improvements to surrounding commercial property, including Regional
Serving Uses, such as the Grossmont Medical Campus.
Within the Specific Plan area, it is anticipated that the Grossmont Shopping Center will
redevelop during the time span of this General Plan. This Regional shopping center site
contains 64 acres and represents the largest single development opportunity site in La Mesa.
Downtown Specific Plan
Although the Downtown La Mesa Village area is already developed, reuse, conversion, and
modernization of existing development is anticipated as property owners lease their sites to
new businesses locating to La Mesa. The Downtown Village Specific Plan, adopted in
1992, establishes Policies for development within its subarea. Distinctive site and building
designs are encouraged to create pleasant public realms and memorable places for
residents and visitors alike. The purpose of this General Plan update is to define the
policies, programs, and public improvements needed to preserve the Downtown District as
the symbolic center of La Mesa.
West Central Specific Plan
The West Central Specific Plan was adopted in 1987 and the Goals and Policies of this
Plan have been replaced by the Mixed-Use Urban Overlay Zone and the Downtown
Specific Plan. As a result, the West Central Specific Plan has been rescinded by the above
referenced documents.
Eastridge Specific Plan
The Eastridge Specific Plan, located in the south central portion of the City, was adopted in
1989. The area consists of 192 acres generally bounded by Murray Hill Road to the west,
SR-94 to the south, Spring Street to the east, and existing residential neighborhoods to the
north. The site is generally steeply sloping and includes vegetated areas with coastal sage
scrub and chaparral. It is the intent of the Eastridge Specific Plan to provide for new
housing while retaining hillside areas as natural open space. The Specific Plan includes
text and diagrams specifying the distribution and location of land, including open space,
and facilities proposed to be located to support the land uses described within the Plan, as
well as standards for the conservation of natural resources. At the time of its adoption, the
Eastridge Specific Plan area was the largest undeveloped land in the City. Subsequently,
this specific plan area has been largely built-out with new residential development and
includes a 50 acre open space preserve.
These four specific plans are detailed in Figure LD-11.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                        2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Development Regulations
Development regulations for La Mesa include the Zoning Ordinance, the Subdivision
Ordinance, and the Uniform Building Code. Each of these sets of regulations are adopted
by the La Mesa City Council as part of the Municipal Code, therefore violations of these
Codes are subject to both civil and criminal prosecution. These Codes are important tools
used to implement the Goals and Policies of the General Plan. As such, it is important for
the City to review and amend these Ordinances as necessary with each succeeding General
Plan update. It is intended that with the current update of the General Plan, the City will
revise the development regulations as necessary to reflect adopted Policies and keep up to
date on new practices and trends. This process will give the City an opportunity to review
existing regulations for consistency and relevance. The following is a brief description of
the function of each Ordinance:
1. Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance regulates the use of all land within the City. Every parcel of land is
located within a Zoning District. Each Zoning District has specific regulations regarding the
use of land, the minimum lot size for subdivision, as well as limitations on the location,
height, amount of parking, and bulk of buildings on lots. According to State law, the
Zoning Ordinance must be consistent with the General Plan. Since the City’s Zoning
Ordinance dates to the 1970’s, the regulations regarding development of land should be
reviewed and modified as appropriate to ensure consistency with this General Plan.
While the General Plan provides policy statements relating to the general uses of land and
the desired results of any future development, it is the Zoning Ordinance which has the
most direct influence on development by specifying the distances between buildings, the
height of buildings, landscaping, parking, and other regulations which combine to create
the desired urban environment.
The City of La Mesa Zoning Ordinance will be updated for consistency with the Gillespie
Field Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan. This Plan requires the recordation of an
overflight notification applicable to new residential development and avigation easements
applicable to any new use of property. These recordation requirements can apply on if the
City of La Mesa adopts a Municipal Ordinance which mandates such recordation
consistent with the ALUCP. Without such an Ordinance, the County Recorder’s office
does not have the authority to make such recordations.
In addition to Development Regulations established by the City’s base zones, a number of
Overlay Zones have been applied to particular areas of the City where supplemental
Permitted Use and Development Standards are merited. The Urban Design Overlay
Zone, adopted in 1987, is used to supplement the required land use regulations reviewed
under the standard provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Projects developed within this
Overlay Zone will be evaluated on their compliance with both the unique design criteria

that pertain to the visually sensitive areas within the City and Development Guidelines
established by the Urban Design Program.
The Scenic Preservation Overlay Zone established regulations for the recognized scenic
areas in the City, the character of which could be permanently damaged by actions
involving the development and use of land without special regulations. The Brier Tract
Overlay Zone establishes Development Standards for a unique residential area of the City,
including lots fronting on Brier Road, Bramble Road, Briercrest Drive, and Nokomis
Street in the Brier Tract which is a relatively rural area with a rustic atmosphere.
The Grossmont Specific Plan Overlay Zone, which was adopted in 1985, establishes
Standards and Regulations for a unique area of the City consisting of the Grossmont
Hospital, Grossmont Shopping Center, two transit station sites, and related surrounding
uses. This area has been highly impacted by the route SR 8/125 interchange, an extension
of route 125 to the north. This area will develop as a relatively high density urban sub-
center with allowable densities at the upper end of ranges feasible under market demands.
To accomplish this and retain compatibility with surrounding land uses the Overlay Zone
and Grossmont Specific Plan establish additional Development Standards and Guidelines.
The Floodway Overlay Zone is intended for those areas of the City within floodways or
water courses in which flood control structures and facilities are required or planned to be
installed.
The Murray Hill Overlay Zone, which was adopted in 1982, establishes Standards and
Regulations for the reasonable development of a unique area of the City, the Murray Hill
area. This Overlay Zone includes modified Regulations and special Development
Standards. The Hillside Overlay Zone, which was adopted in 1980, establishes Standards
and Regulations for the reasonable development of hillside areas in order to reduce the
impact of such development on adjacent residential areas.
The Neighborhood Plan Overlay Zone, which was adopted in 1979, establishes
Development Standards for a unique residential area of the City. Unlike other single-
family residential neighborhoods in La Mesa, this area has exceptionally large lots which
cannot be subdivided in a conventional manner. This Overlay Zone is established to
provide regulations of said lots. The Neighborhood Plan Overlay Zone Number Two,
which was adopted in 1980, establishes Development Standards and Regulations for the
American Avenue neighborhood and surrounding area. The Bowling Green Overlay
Zone, which was adopted in 1985, establishes Development Standards and Regulations for
the Bowling Green Drive area. These three Overlay Zones were relevant to the widening
of SR-125. Now that the freeway widening project is complete, the relevance of these
Ordinances will be addressed by the City.
The Mixed-Use Overlay Zone was adopted in 2008 and establishes Development
Standards and Regulations for uses, structures and lots within the Overlay Zone boundary.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                        2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Mixed-Use Design Guidelines apply to all remodeling of, or additions to, existing structures
exceeding 2,500 square feet in size, and any change in occupancy exceeding 2,500 square
feet in size. Site Plan Review and Urban Design Review are required for all new
development and major renovation of existing development in the Mixed=Use Overlay
Zone. The Overlay Zone provides a mechanism to revitalize older commercial corridors,
increase opportunities for infill housing, encourage new housing and innovative retail that is
less automobile dependent, and help create pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods.
2. Subdivision Ordinance
The State Subdivision Map Act provides the uniform standards for determining when a
subdivision map must be filed with the appropriate local agency and contains Regulations
regarding minimum Design Requirements for subdivisions. Additionally, it specifies
appropriate findings for approval and disapproval, and outlines time limits for review of
subdivision applications.
La Mesa has adopted its own Subdivision Ordinance which specifies local review and
approval procedures and provides Regulations which are optional in the State law. One
example of an optional regulation is La Mesa's control of the number of apartments that
may convert to condominiums. The Subdivision Ordinance provides an important
function in controlling the density of development in residential categories of the General
Plan.
3. Sign Ordinance
The intent of the La Mesa’s Sign Ordinance is to regulate signs in a way that balances their
means of conveying information against the needs to protect the visual environment. Sign
regulation serves the interest of community aesthetics, commerce and tourism, and traffic
and pedestrian safety, to name a few. Commercial centers which use comprehensive sign
programs have more uniform signage serving their multiple tenants. As part of the
implementation of the Scenic Overlay Zone and the City-wide Sign Ordinance, the City
will continue to prohibit the placement of new billboards in La Mesa. The City’s sign
regulations are meant to further the Goals and Policies of the General Plan while
expressing the community’s pride, Design Standards, culture, and sense of order, giving it a
distinctive appearance and reinforcing the character of La Mesa.
4. Parking Standards
While La Mesa encourages alternative transportation (transit, biking, walking), the majority
of trips around the City are still made by automobile and these trips need to end with a
place for the car to be stored. La Mesa’s Municipal Code and Parking Standards ensure
that properties have adequate off-street parking areas. Parking lots provide for adequate
capacity and circulation patterns to reduce traffic congestion, facilitate movement, enhance
public safety, and support high standards of environmental quality. The City’s Parking
Standards make provisions for the required number of parking spaces for a particular use,
the parking of recreational vehicles, and the use of shared parking within a development.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                             2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
The Downtown Specific Plan contains Design Guidelines for off-street parking facilities in
the Village, mostly focusing on the use of landscaping to minimize the visual impact of
large, paved parking areas.
5. Landscape Standards
Landscapes are essential to the quality of life by
providing areas for active and passive recreation
and enhance the environment by cleaning air and
water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection,
and replacing ecosystems. However, landscape
design, installation, maintenance and management
must be water efficient. In response to low annual
precipitation and extensive periods of drought,
and in an effort to reduce the City’s water
consumption, La Mesa adopted Water Efficient                 New Water-Efficient Landscaping
Landscape Regulations in 2010. The regulations
limit water waste through the Maximum Applied Water Allowance (MAWA), which sets
an upper limit for water use in irrigation systems. These regulations apply to most
developments with landscaped areas equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet and to new
single-family residences with over 5,000 square feet of landscaping.
6. Building Codes
Title 14 of the La Mesa Municipal Code contains all the regulations regarding the
construction of buildings in the City. Within Title 14 are chapters containing the
International Building Code, the International Residential Code, the Uniform Mechanical
Code, the Uniform Plumbing Code and the National Electrical Code. Additionally,
La Mesa also adopts the California Green Building Standards Code. These International,
Uniform and National codes are model codes published by nationally recognized building
code organizations, such as the International Code Council (ICC), and recommended to the
State. Once adopted by the State, local jurisdictions will usually adopt their own versions
with appropriate modifications. All of these codes are regularly updated by the code writing
organizations with addenda published annually. La Mesa utilizes the most current versions
of these codes once adopted by the State.
     Housing Regulations
     The City enforces the State Housing Law and
     the Uniform Housing Code. The method of
     enforcing the Housing Regulations is through
     inspection done on a complaint basis. The City
     follows the adopted Code Enforcement Policy,
     and the procedures in Uniform Housing Code,

     Enforcement of Mobile Home Parks Act
     The City of La Mesa enforces the State Mobile Home Parks Act as related to the
     installation and placement of manufactured homes and mobile homes in the City.
     The Community Development Department also conducts maintenance inspections of
     mobile home parks, as outlined in State laws, to ensure the safety, health, and welfare
     of the park residents.
7. Storm Water Program
Storm flows from rain are conveyed into the City’s storm drain system in order to prevent
flooding. This system is a network of pipes which are designed to handle large, prolonged
storm events; conveying water underground until eventually discharging into a local channel
or stream. This storm water is comprised primarily of urban runoff which may contain
levels of pollutants, such as bacteria, sediment, trash, dissolved metals, nutrients, and
pesticides. This water is sent to our local channels and creeks untreated, unlike our sanitary
sewer which conveys flows to a treatment plant.
The La Mesa’s Storm Water Program was created in order ensure the City complies with
State and Federal pollution prevention requirements, as well as to administer programs
which attempt to minimize the amount of pollutants reaching our local water bodies. The
Program’s objectives are achieved through various activities such as water quality
monitoring, educational outreach, code enforcement, facility inspections, and development
review. Additionally, source abatement activities are conducted as well as other activities
such as street sweeping and storm drain cleaning.
Development projects are required to employ pollutant source control as well as low
impact development (LID) treatment designs. These requirements were created in order to
minimize the impacts on receiving water quality downstream of proposed development
projects. LID comprises a set of site design approaches and small-scale storm water
management practices that promote the use of natural systems for infiltration and reuse of
rainwater. In cooperation with Regional partners, La Mesa also regularly takes water
quality samples and conducts toxicity tests in waterways.
The City’s Storm Water Program is managed to remain in compliance with applicable laws
related to water quality, including the City’s own Municipal Storm Water Permit and
Federal and State laws such as the Clean Water Act and Porter-Cologne Water Quality
Control Act. The City’s ongoing compliance with these regulations as well as the
implementation of site specific pollution reduction programs demonstrates the City’s
ongoing commitment to the preservation of storm water quality. This preservation
ultimately leads to the sustenance of our quality of life related to the enjoyment of our
beaches, creeks, and ocean.

8. Development Advisory Board
The City’s Development Advisory Board is composed of the Director of Planning,
Director of Building, Public Works/City Engineer, and Fire Marshall. City departments
work together to review and approve development proposals, and make recommendations
to the City’s Planning Commission and City Council.             These departments provide
assistance to the public by reviewing development plans as to their compliance with the
municipal code, and provide inspection services to ensure proper installation of new
buildings and accessory structures that meet code requirements while protecting the public
health, safety, and welfare.
9. Code Compliance
The City’s Code Compliance Program is intended to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare through the implementation of standards relating to building safety, fire code safety,
and property maintenance requirements. In terms of residential property maintenance,
areas which are commonly addressed include yards and setback areas, parking and
inoperable vehicles, as well as accessory structures such as fences. Property owners and
tenants are required to correct violations reported to the City to ensure that private
property is maintained. In regards to commercial development, property maintenance
standards address unauthorized outdoor storage, proper signage, parking circulation, and
landscaping.
In addition to enforcing minimum maintenance standards for the upkeep of private
property, Code Compliance efforts include programs related to, storm water quality, the
proper disposal of restaurant and hazardous wastes, graffiti removal, recycling, and
neighborhood cleanup projects coordinated with other City departments, such as the
Police Department's Community-Oriented Policing Program (COPPS).
10. Maintenance of Public Property
While the Code Compliance Program focuses on private property maintenance issues,
significant resources are devoted to maintain public property. The City’s Public Works
Department is in charge of maintenance within the public right-of-way, including streets,
landscape areas within the City streets, and street lights, while the community services
department is in charge of maintaining public parks. These departments coordinate with
the Police Department in an on-going effort to abate graffiti within the public realm.
Urban Design Program
The Design Review Board and City Council review development to assure compliance with
Design Guidelines, adopted as part of a comprehensive Urban Design Program in 1987.
The Guidelines contain principles of design focused on several different scales of concern;
including, the community as a whole, the neighborhood, the specific site and the building
itself.

The Urban Design Program incorporates a comprehensive approach to urban design
issues, including community-wide, neighborhood and site-specific guidelines for all new
development. The Program identifies sites within La Mesa that are subject to a Design
Overlay Zone. All development proposals within the Design Overlay Zone are reviewed by
the Design Review Board. The Design Review Board is composed of three design
professionals and two members of the Community Development Department. The Design
Review Board reviews development proposals and makes recommendations to the City
Council based on policies and principles established in the Urban Design Program.
Related Activities
In addition to the previous programs, which often focus on new development activity, the
City has the following programs which help in the implementation of the General Plan:
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
The CDBG program involves Federal money granted to cities each year for a variety of
community development activities. Federal regulations require that the majority of these
funds provide verifiable benefits to lower income households. The City will continue to
utilize CDBG funds within the parameters of Federal regulations to implement the
Community Development and Housing Goals of the General Plan. Examples of CDBG
programs include capital improvements and renovations in lower income neighborhoods,
public services to special needs populations including seniors, homeless people, and
people affected by domestic violence and fair housing services to ensure that La Mesa’s
housing environment is accessible to all types of households.
Capital Improvement Program
The City of La Mesa’s Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) identifies improvement
projects, including public buildings, sewer
and storm drain system upgrades, street and
park improvements. Capital improvements
are an important component of General Plan
implementation. The CIP identifies both the
infrastructure needs and the funding sources,
and is a key program for ensuring the quality
of life within our neighborhoods. It is
                                                          Bio-Swale on Allison Avenue
important for the City to coordinate Capital
Improvement efforts with those of private developers to ensure that infrastructure remains
intact and meets expected demand.
Zoning and Land Use Consistency
The General Plan consists of several Elements, including the Land Use and Urban Design
Element. Together, these Elements define the Goals and Policies, which provide the basis

for the programs, projects, procedures, and regulations, which will help ensure the health,
welfare and safety of the community through achieving these Goals. The Elements of the
General Plan serve as a long-term vision for the City’s economic growth, and as a
short-term practical tool to assist in the ongoing decisions needed to operate the City.
State law requires that zoning designations match the land use designations in the General
Plan. Amendments to the General Plan land use designations or zoning classifications will
be considered on appropriate sites in La Mesa through the public hearing process.
The procedures for amending the General Plan will apply to the Land Use and Urban
Design Element, as well as the other Elements of the General Plan. As provided by State
law, amendments to the General Plan may be made no more than four times in one year.
The City Council, the Planning Commission or a member of the public may initiate
amendments. As needed, the Planning Commission will review proposals for amendments
to the General Plan three times a year, at the first regularly scheduled meeting in the
months of February, June, and October. The recommendations of the Planning
Commission will be forwarded to the City Council for consideration at a public hearing
scheduled for the earliest possible date.
The City prescribes procedures and requirements for amendments requested by the
public. Such applications will be consolidated and scheduled for a public hearing by the
Planning Commission at the earliest time as outlined above. The City Council may also
initiate amendments to the General Plan during the same calendar year. Changes to the
General Plan are typically considered during one amendment process adopted by a City
Council resolution.

with La Mesa’s topography, the freeways and trolley tracks restrict travel within La Mesa’s
neighborhoods to a limited number of streets. Neighborhoods are crisscrossed with busy
arterials leading to activity centers and providing access to the freeway network, but these
streets are challenging to bicycle and pedestrian travel. The auto-oriented transportation
network in La Mesa is well established and functionally complete. However, more work is
needed to complete pedestrian and bicycle access in the City. Planning for the future
involves improvements to existing infrastructure to ensure that all modes of travel are
accommodated and mobility and access are balanced.
The Circulation Element establishes Goals and Policies for a complete transportation
system, incorporating all travel modes, including motor vehicle, transit, walking, and
cycling. Links between transportation network components within La Mesa and between
La Mesa, neighboring jurisdictions and the San Diego region are also examined.
An equitable transportation system requires balancing individual mobility and universal
access. This concept is referred to as “Complete Streets.” Different modes of
transportation should work together as a cohesive system. Solutions to transportation
problems must be incorporated within the existing network. The spatial arrangement and

appearance of the transportation system help define the character of La Mesa and
contribute to the perceived quality of life in the community. A safe and efficient
transportation system supports the health and welfare of residents and visitors and is
essential to the economic vitality of the business community.
Purpose
The Circulation Element plans for the
coordinated movement of people and
goods within the City’s network of streets
and transportation services. Location,
design and modes of movement have a
major impact on the City’s physical
environment and appearance. The ability
to move safely and efficiently around the
City must be available to all people
regardless of mode of travel. The City’s
location at the crossroads of major regional
                                                    Bus Terminus at Grossmont Center Trolley Station
transportation infrastructure is both an
opportunity and a challenge. Maximizing the potential and minimizing the impacts of the
transportation system is the purpose of the Circulation Element.
Organization and Content
The Circulation Element examines the existing transportation network and provides policy
direction for implementing the City’s future transportation network. Major topic headings
include Regulatory Setting, Review of Past Performance, Streets & Highways, Public
Transit System, Non-motorized Transportation, and Implementation Programs.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Circulation Element is most directly related to the Land Use and Urban Design
Element because the transportation network must serve the mobility needs associated with
the various land uses. Issues related to housing, sustainability, open space, noise, and
public safety also interact with the goals and policies included in the Circulation Element.

Federal and State transportation agencies regulate the design, location and function of the
region’s transportation infrastructure. The following section includes Federal and State
regulations that mandate a complete streets approach to transportation planning.
Federal
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users
(SAFETEA-LU)
This legislation authorizes Federal surface transportation programs for highways, highway
safety, and transit. It covers a variety of transportation-related issues including financing,
congestion relief, improved safety, improved efficiency, environmental stewardship, and
transportation-related research and studies. It includes the “Safe Routes to School”
program, which funds infrastructure improvement and encouragement programs that
facilitate walking and bicycling to and from school for K-12 students.

State of California
AB 32 – The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006
AB 32 requires the State of California to
reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) to 1990
levels by 2020. The Act charges the Air
Resources Board (ARB) with monitoring and
regulating the State’s sources of GHGs and
establishes a timeline by which ARB is to
complete various specified actions.
SB 375 - Sustainable Communities and
Climate Protection Act of 2008
                                                        La Mesa is divided by three major freeways.
This legislation includes goals to reduce
greenhouse gases from transportation sources and to implement land use strategies that
support greater levels of walking, bicycling, and transit use. SB 375 aligns three critical
policy areas of importance to local government: (1) regional long-range transportation plans
and investments; (2) regional allocation of the obligation for cities and counties to zone for
housing; and (3) a process to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for the
transportation sector. It requires the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (San Diego
Association of Governments) to tie reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and
light trucks to land use and infrastructure planning
AB 1358 – The California Complete Streets Act 2008
The Complete Streets Act requires jurisdictions to make revisions to the Circulation
Element to plan for a multi-modal transportation network. Community residents should be
able to safely travel by transit, bicycle and on foot to reach destinations within the
community and the region. The Circulation Element must identify how routine
accommodation of all users of the roadway, including motorist, pedestrians, bicyclists, users
of public transit, children, seniors and people with disabilities, will be achieved

The completion of the highway and trolley projects closed gaps in the Regional
Transportation System within La Mesa. The City allocates resources to smaller scale
projects such as median landscaping and intersection improvements to enhance the local
street network. The following are on-going challenges to the efficiency of the
transportation system in La Mesa.
     • Topography has determined the street network in the City. Few neighborhoods
         have a grid network of streets.
     • Interstate 8, State Routes 94 and 125 constrain connections between central
         La Mesa and adjacent neighborhoods.
     • There are gaps in the sidewalk network, and sidewalk alignment within the street
         right-of-way is inconsistently located.
     • Many streets do not meet their designated design objectives, and represent areas
         where improvements to the circulation system will be a part of the General Plan
         implementation.
     • Alternative transportation modes are not accorded consistent equal access within
         the street network.
Public opinion polls repeatedly show that La Mesa citizens are concerned about traffic
issues, such as “cut-through” traffic, neighborhood speeding, and road conditions.
Throughout La Mesa, many panoramic vistas can
be viewed from the street network and from the
freeways passing through the community. These
visual resources can be preserved and enhanced.
With freeways crisscrossing La Mesa and no major
heavy industry, motor vehicle travel is a major
contributor to green house gas emissions in
La Mesa.
Active transportation, walking and biking, support
public health goals for combating the epidemic of
obesity. Creating a supportive environment for             La Mesa’s streets are multi-modal.
active transportation is a challenge within the
existing network of streets and highways.
Streets & Highways
This section is an overview of the overall system of roadways serving La Mesa. As the
primary component of the circulation network, streets and highways define the shape and
character of La Mesa more than any other public investment. One quarter of La Mesa land
area is devoted to transportation right-of-way. On-going roadway maintenance and

construction of future improvements represent a significant commitment of resources from
the City’s Capital Improvement Program. The streets of most concern are the transition
streets linking low volume local streets with high volume regional transportation streets.
Collector and arterial streets will require new investment to balance motor vehicle functions
with other transportation uses of the street.
A key feature of the Circulation Element is the classification of the streets based on
function. The classification system is a statement of policy and design criteria that guide
decisions related to street improvements and future development.
It is important to recognize that La Mesa’s street system is complete. There are few
opportunities to add new streets or change the function of the existing street network.
Improvements to traffic flow and safety will be made through techniques such as changes to
traffic signal timing at key intersections, intersection modifications or improvements to
transit services. Programs to encourage carpooling, walking and bicycling will also increase
mobility throughout the City, as well as reducing traffic congestion. Based on a
community-wide pubic input process, the City’s Sidewalk Master Plan establishes priorities
for complete street improvements to address the pedestrian circulation within the public
right-of-way.
The following Table CE-3 summarizes the existing street network by type of street. The
Circulation Plan map in Figure CE-1 shows the locations of the streets classifications within
the City.

Transportation Demand Management
Capital Improvements can take many years and significant resources to implement, but
managing the demand for various forms of transportation, also known as transportation
demand management (TDM), can provide flexible and cost-effective solutions. Typical
TDM programs include ridesharing initiatives such as carpooling, vanpooling, promoting
alternative work schedules, telecommuting, and promoting bicycling, walking, and the use
of public transit. These programs reduce the overall number of vehicle miles traveled
(VMT), making more efficient use of our existing roadways and maximizing the movement
of people and goods.
Public Transit System
La Mesa’s central geographic location within the greater San Diego metropolitan area, and
location at the gateway to the East County sub-region, places the City in a position to
benefit significantly from public transit services. Bus route 7 has served the community for
decades, connecting La Mesa to San Diego via University Avenue. Opening of the East
Line Trolley has also improved public transit services in the City. The Circulation
Element recognizes the importance of providing quality public transit services to provide
access and mobility to those who are unable to drive; and as a transportation alternative to
the single occupant vehicle to reduce traffic congestion on the region’s roadways. Transit
system components are described below and Figure CE-2 shows a map of the City’s transit
resources.
Light Rail
The mid-1980s brought light-rail transit to
La Mesa, operated by the Metropolitan Transit
System (MTS), the region’s service provider in the
southern half of San Diego County. The agency
opened the Orange Line Trolley with four stations
in the City. In 2005, the Green Line was
completed, adding a fifth station at 70th Street and
providing a transit link through the Mission Valley
corridor. Trolley service provides a commuter
alternative to the congested Interstate 8 freeway
corridor.                                                 The 70th street station was completed in 2005.
MTS has an ongoing effort to find the appropriate level of security measures necessary to
provide a safe environment for riders of the trolley, and to effectively monitor security at
trolley stations. The City and MTS are working together to provide the services necessary
to maintain a safe and desirable transit service.
The standard MTS trolley station consists primarily of a shelter and, in some cases, a
telephone. Lack of amenities such as restrooms and concession stands has resulted in
                                                                     Circulation Element | CE-9

problems around some stations. The City works with MTS to provide better facilities at
stations within La Mesa’s boundary.
Orange Line Trolley
The Orange Line operates between Downtown San Diego and Santee. Four Orange Line
stations are located within La Mesa: Spring Street, La Mesa Boulevard (Downtown),
Grossmont and Amaya Drive. The Downtown location of the La Mesa Boulevard Station
intersects with bus service and provides transit access to the Civic Center, the Village
Commercial District and surrounding residential areas. The Grossmont Transit Center
Station is a transfer station between Orange and Green line service and bus services.
Improvements to the Grossmont Station platform were completed in 2011, including
elevator access and a pedestrian bridge.
             The La Mesa Boulevard Station provides trolley access to the Village and the Civic Center.
Green Line Trolley
The Green Line connects Santee to the Old Town Station via La Mesa, San Diego State
University, and Mission Valley. In La Mesa, the 70th Street Station exclusively serves the
Green Line trolley as the line travels along Interstate 8. The opening of the Green Line
completed a trolley service loop linking many neighborhoods. La Mesa, at the eastern end
of the loop, enjoys the best Trolley access outside of Downtown San Diego. La Mesa
transit stations are hubs of activity and are anticipated to be more intensely used in the
future as transit-oriented development is implemented in neighborhoods adjacent to the
stations.
Buses
Feeding into the regional transit systems and providing transportation within the City of
La Mesa is a public transit network consisting of fixed route buses. Effective bus service is
critical in La Mesa to support the regional light rail system, to provide access within
La Mesa’s neighborhoods, and to make efficient transit connections. MTS provides bus
service including routes 1, 7, 14, 851, and 855. The City will continue to work with MTS
to ensure that bus service is maintained and expanded to meet the community’s
transportation needs.

As the Trolley system expands to new areas, bus routes are evaluated by MTS and
modified when necessary. The City will need to be attentive to this evaluation process to
make sure that modifications proposed by MTS do not reduce the effectiveness of bus
service to the community.
Another incentive for transit use would be the installation of bus shelters at high volume
stops. Shelters not only increase the comfort of bus users, but also improve the
appearance of bus stop areas because maintenance is provided. Under an existing program
operated by MTS, shelters are provided at about a dozen bus stop locations. La Mesa
contracts with Coast United Advertising for the bus benches provided at most other stops.

Pedestrian Infrastructure
La Mesa has long recognized that sidewalks are
an essential pedestrian amenity. Sidewalks also
improve the appearance of neighborhoods and
the community by providing an edge line for
lots. Blocks without sidewalks experience
neighborhood conflicts when separation
between the public street area and private yard
areas is poorly defined.
In Downtown La Mesa, sidewalks can also

which add to the pedestrian ambiance of the
“village” environment. The City’s Downtown Village Streetscape Improvement Project
focuses on upgrading street and sidewalk areas to improve the access and connectivity to
adjacent retail establishments.
The key to safe and efficient pedestrian circulation is the design, construction, and
maintenance of walking facilities. Increasing sidewalk widths, landscaping, street furniture
and parking in commercial areas all work to help separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic
while improving the appearance of the community and assist in supporting retail storefronts
and restaurants.
La Mesa’s sidewalks are inconsistent in width, location, and condition. In 2008, the City
conducted a Walkability Study. An inventory of existing sidewalk locations was created
and recommendations were developed that lead to the creation of a Sidewalk Master Plan.
Based on this data, a total of 274 miles of
sidewalk were mapped. Sixty-two percent of
areas with the potential for sidewalk placement
already have sidewalks. Comments gathered
from an online survey and public workshops
indicate that missing sidewalks and sidewalk
gaps were the top issues people had regarding
the pedestrian environment. The Sidewalk
Master Plan (Figure CE-3) shows La Mesa’s
existing sidewalk infrastructure, as well as
where new sidewalks are planned. In order to
maintain rural character in some sections of       The Downtown Streetscape Improvement Project

High speed, high volume, wide streets represent barriers because of the length of waiting
time between traffic signal cycles and the overall crossing distance. These roadway-related
barriers affect connectivity. In 2006, the City developed a “Walkability” Plan that
recommended improvements in the walking environment. Implementation of the Plan’s
recommendations has resulted in several projects that have improved pedestrian
infrastructure at key intersections.
Sidewalk improvements along Allison Avenue, near City Hall, the Library, and the Trolley
Station are an example of the City’s effort to enhance the pedestrian realm. Recent efforts
have been made to reduce intersection crossing times for pedestrians by widening
sidewalks and creating safe zones for pedestrians within the public right-of-way.
La Mesa is unique in that three freeways bisect the City. Most freeway crossings,
constructed many years ago, lack pedestrian and bicycle facilities. A Freeway Crossing Plan,
approved by the City in 2008, addresses these issues, including recommended
improvements for several of the City’s freeway bridges, on- and off-ramps. Future
implementation of these recommendations will restore connectivity for pedestrians and
bicyclists across the freeway right-of-way.
Bicycle Infrastructure
La Mesa’s varied terrain provides vistas which make the City such a desirable place to live
and work. From the bicyclist’s perspective, this terrain is a challenge. Steep and narrow
streets limit the routes available for easy and direct access to key destinations and cross-
town travel. Bicyclists want to find direct routes with the least challenging grades through
the City and to access neighboring jurisdictions
and regional destinations. The Bicycle
Facilities Plan Map (Figure CE-4) shows
existing and proposed bicycle facilities, major
destinations and trolley stations. A Capital
Improvement Plan for bicycle infrastructure is
included in the Bicycle Facilities & Alternative
Transportation Plan, adopted in 2012. When
fully implemented, these projects will improve
the bicycle travel experience.
For a bikeway network to be used to its full
potential, secure bicycle parking should be

provided at likely destination points. Bicycle
thefts are common and lack of secure parking is often cited as a reason people hesitate to
ride a bicycle to certain destinations. The same considerations should be given to cyclists
as to motorists, who expect convenient and secure parking at their destinations.

Currently bicycle racks can be found at most major destination points. Although bicycle
parking exists at these locations, it is limited. For example, bicycle parking in Downtown
La Mesa consists of a few racks while other bikes were secured to trees or benches. At the
Grossmont Shopping Center, bicycle parking was limited to a few racks spread around the
Shopping Center. A few amenities such as shaded bicycle parking do exist at the
Grossmont Shopping Center. Along University Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard, bicycle
parking is limited to just a few racks at certain retail stores. Bike lockers are present at the
Amaya Drive, La Mesa Boulevard, and Spring Street Trolley Stations. Additional bicycle
racks are also present at the La Mesa Boulevard Trolley Station. The Grossmont Center
and 70th Street Trolley Stations do not have any bicycle racks or bike lockers.

Neighborhood Traffic Management Program (NTMP)
Routine speeding, traffic volume, and failure to
obey traffic control devices cause residents to
become concerned about the safety of their
neighborhoods and quality of life. Traffic
calming measures are used to discourage cut-
through traffic and decrease travel speed. The
Neighborhood Traffic Management Program
is divided into three phases. The first phase
gathers data and investigates the severity of the
problem. If the implementation of simple Stop signs and bulb outs slow traffic in neighborhoods.
measures, such as improved signage or striping,
is not effective, the second phase is a more intense study of the traffic problems. In the
third phase engineering solutions are developed, the preferred solution is chosen by the
stakeholders, funding is allocated, and the traffic calming measures are installed. After the
measures have been installed further data is collected to assess their effectiveness.
Caltrans
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Caltrans is the State agency
responsible for highway, bridge, and rail transportation planning, construction, and
maintenance. For administrative purposes, Caltrans has divided the State of California into
12 districts supervised by district offices. Caltrans District 11 serves the San Diego region
with offices in Old Town San Diego. Caltrans provides and maintains freeways and bridges
within the City limits. Coordination is required between Caltrans and City maintenance
crews doing work on or near ramps in order to control traffic and ensure safe circulation.
Caltrans also conducts periodic maintenance inspections on public facilities and makes
recommendation to the La Mesa Public
Works Department on City-owned bridges and
other facilities. Caltrans administers certain
State and Federal funding sources that the City
may seek, such as “Safe Routes to School”

MTS determines the routing, stops, frequency of service, and hours of operation for its
existing services. MTS is responsible for the maintenance and operation of La Mesa’s five
Trolley Stations and within the right-of-way along the trolley tracks.
Non-motorized Transportation
Policies of the Bicycle Facilities and Alternative Transportation Master Plan are intended
to provide a range of public improvements to benefit cyclists and pedestrians. The policies
attempt to balance the need for non-motorized use of the public right-of-way with the
physical limitations of the street network in some neighborhoods. In many cases, older
streets developed in hillside areas have little or no chance for the installation of bike lanes
and sidewalks. In other areas, a lack of existing improvements may make it difficult for
these types of facilities to be installed on a continuous basis without leaving a piecemeal
system. This occurs especially with infill development which is typical of most of the
anticipated residential development. For these reasons, transportation policies providing
flexibility in placement of non-motorized infrastructure improvements are included.
Downtown Streetscape
The Downtown Village Streetscape Improvement project will replace and enhance aging
infrastructure, including sidewalks, landscaping and lighting within the Downtown Village.
The project is intended to improve public access and mobility to adjacent retail
establishments, reduce pedestrian exposure at intersection crossings, and provide new
facilities and added landscaping for a pleasant walking environment. Design plans are
anticipated to be completed in 2012, with construction commencing as early as 2013.
Intersection Improvement
The City of La Mesa coordinates with local schools to implement the “Safe Routes to
School” program. This program concentrates on providing sidewalks, intersection controls,
lighting and volunteer efforts on those routes felt to be the safest for leading children to and
from schools. In addition to sidewalk improvements and crosswalk enhancements,
            Improvements at the intersection of University Avenue and Allison Avenue enhance walkability.

properly timed pedestrian crossing signals should be provided at all signalized intersections
with pedestrian access. This is particularly important at major streets with wide roadways
which may be difficult for senior citizens and disabled people to cross. Balancing the needs
of pedestrians with the need to move vehicular traffic will require the City’s constant
attention.
La Mesa’s Bicycle Facilities and Alternative Transportation Master Plan establishes the
City’s goals and policies regarding the importance of providing bicycle facilities within the
overall circulation network. This bicycle plan includes an implementation plan for existing
and planned facilities. The intent of the Bicycle Facilities Plan is to:
     • Improve safety for bicycle riders through education, encouragement and
        enforcement programs;
     • Encourage bicycle ridership as a viable transportation alternative to the car through
        education, encouragement and enforcement programs;
     • Identify funding sources for planning and constructing bicycle facilities;
     • Help make La Mesa a more livable place; and
     • Help educate the public about the importance of sharing the street with cyclists.
Since there are not extensive opportunities for off-street shared-use bike paths because of
La Mesa’s built-out nature the Bicycle Facilities Plan focuses primarily on the integration
and coordination of bicycle facilities within the existing street network. When opportunities
for land acquisition, road diets and redevelopment occur, off-street bike paths should be
investigated as part of the development review process.

Introduction
The City of La Mesa has experienced a substantial transformation as it has grown along
with the surrounding Region. The community has evolved from being primarily a semi-
rural suburban bedroom community to its current status as an East County urban sub-
center. Approximately 98% of the City's land area has been developed with residential and
commercial land uses. La Mesa does not have many of the resources typically discussed in
a Conservation Element, such as significant natural habitat areas, bodies of water, coastal
zones, agriculture or mineral resources. These resources are important to the community
in a Regional context though, and the goals and policies in this Element reflect this interest
in supporting both local and Regional resource conservation efforts.
Sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the
needs of future generations. Sustainable community planning helps to control cost of living
                                              Conservation & Sustainability Element | CS-1

and to reduce future expense. A sustainable community is one which has the following in
place:
    •   Local and Regional development
        patterns that expand housing choice
        and employment opportunity for all
        persons.
    •   A healthy environment and social
        climate that function in harmony with
        natural ecosystems and allow people to
        lead healthy, productive, and enjoyable
        lives.                                                      La Mesa Vistas
    •   Resilient, diverse, and self-sufficient local economies that meet the needs of
        residents and build on the unique characteristics of the community.
    •   A transportation network that provides residents with connectivity and commuting
        options.
Purpose
The City’s population is forecasted to increase
from 58,000 (2010) to approximately 66,000
(2030) during the next 20 years. This will place
new demands on renewable and non-renewable
resources. If current trends continue in San Diego
County, by 2050 average annual temperatures will
rise between 1.5-4.5˚; the County will require 37%
more water than it currently uses; occasionally
poor air quality will increase respiratory and
cardiac health problems; and peak electric demand
will grow by over 70%, according to a climate
change impact assessment commissioned by the
San Diego Foundation, “San Diego’s Changing
Climate: A Regional Wake-Up Call.” The
Conservation & Sustainability Element establishes
goals, objectives, and policies which address the
                                                                La Mesa’s Natural Canyons
conservation and enhancement of our local
resources, safeguard human health and the environment, maintain a healthy and diverse
economy, and improve the livability and quality of life for all the La Mesa citizenry.

Resource Conservation
Natural resources and energy conservation is achieved by managing materials more
efficiently. This Element recognizes that while growth will occur, the use of land, water,
and energy can be more sustainable.
Open Space and Land Use Planning
While La Mesa is highly urbanized, the remaining open space in the City is important
because it provides visual relief and respite from the noise and congestion of urban living.
Within the City of La Mesa, natural landforms create a dramatic and varied terrain.
Hillsides, canyons and gently sloping mesas provide many opportunities to enjoy La Mesa’s
natural setting. This varied landform defines the character of La Mesa. Vistas and views
serve a significant role in identifying districts and neighborhoods, adding value to the
community. These features are important in evaluating land use opportunities and
constraints.
Land use patterns influence energy use and
greenhouse gas production, primarily because
of the strong relationship between where we
live and work and our mode of transportation.
Significant efforts in land use planning are
necessary to reduce vehicle miles traveled to
meet the State's emission reduction goals. Land
use planning that promotes infill development,
creates strong neighborhoods with a range of
housing, commercial, and transportation                 Urban Forestry along Fletcher Parkway
options, and makes it possible for communities
to grow in ways that support economic development. Existing and planned infill
development of residential and commercial uses within La Mesa will support sustainable
transportation options such as walking, biking, and transit. As the City continues to grow
and evolve, preservation, reuse and retrofit of developed land and existing structures is an
important component of sustainability.
Urban Forestry
Since 1980 the City of La Mesa has been recognized by the non-profit Arbor Day
Foundation as a Tree City USA community for its commitment to urban forestry. As of
2012, La Mesa had earned this national designation for 32 consecutive years. The City’s
emphasis on urban forestry improves air quality, as well as environmental and human
health. Through shade, trees cool the community and reduce energy use and costs. Trees
also absorb water, thereby reducing storm water runoff and promoting absorption into the
ground. When tree cover is diminished, more costly storm water infrastructure is required
to drain water from paved or impervious surfaces and buildings. Drought tolerant, native

plant material and ornamental landscaping with water efficient irrigation systems add to
quality of life in the City by providing small habitats for species and visual relief for people.
Water Resources
La Mesa is part of a naturally water poor region. An average of 80% of the water supply in
San Diego County is imported from Northern California and the Colorado River.
Imported water is delivered through a complex system of pipelines, pump stations, and
reservoirs. Large energy demand required to move water from outside the Region
generates greenhouse gas emissions. Adding to the complexity are fluctuating political and
legal arrangements.
The Helix Water District supplies
water within the City of La Mesa. The
District’s Urban Water Management
Plan shows the ability to serve the water
needs of La Mesa through 2030.
Although La Mesa is not a water-
providing agency, the City is committed
to the efficient use of water resources.
In San Diego County, residents have
faced mandatory water use restrictions
                                               Water Conserving Landscape & Bio-swale on Allison Avenue
and water rate increases. Increasing
water rates heightens public awareness of San Diego County’s water supply. At the same
time, rising water rates increase the cost-competitiveness of water reuse and other
alternative water sources.
Water conservation is one way of addressing the increased demand for potable water
resulting from population growth. Reducing potable water demand through conservation
helps improve water quality, protect water resources, and maintain aquatic ecosystems. The
efficient use of potable water can also prevent pollution by reducing wastewater flows and
reducing energy demand.
Various household routines require high water usage such as washing clothes or flushing a
toilet. The use of water conserving fixtures is now mandated by the State building code.
Examples include faucet aerators and low flow toilets and shower heads. Both indoor
appliances and outdoor irrigation systems have become more efficient as technology
improves.
Wastewater Treatment
La Mesa does not have a wastewater treatment plant, but directs its wastewater to a plant in
the City of San Diego. The City completed a Wastewater Master Plan in 2008 and

determined that La Mesa is expected to have sufficient capacity to accommodate
anticipated development through 2030.
Storm water that does not soak into the ground becomes surface runoff, which either flows
directly into surface waterways or is channeled into storm sewers, which eventually
discharges to surface waters. Storm water is of concern for two reasons: one related to the
volume of runoff water and potential for flooding and erosion. The other is related to
potential contaminants that the water is carrying.
Residential areas are a common source of runoff water in the San Diego Region.
Landscape chemicals, home remodeling projects, and improper waste disposal are some
activities that pollute our waterways. Streets and parking lots pollute our storm water due
to fuel residue, trash, and other debris. Everything that goes down a storm drain flows
directly to the nearest creek or to the ocean without being treated. As part of the City’s
storm water pollution prevention efforts, four informational kiosks have been installed in
City parks and information is available on the City’s website. Continued code enforcement
and participation in local cleanup efforts contribute to storm water quality.
Energy Conservation
Energy conservation and the use of renewable
energy play an important role in preserving
natural resources. Solar and wind power
systems have long term benefits by reducing
reliance upon fossil fuels.
The City of La Mesa has taken steps towards
improved energy efficiency. In 2011, the City
began working with SANDAG and SDG&E on
an energy audit of public facilities to identify       Solar panels line the roof of the parking garage at
                                                               the Kaiser Permanente Campus.
areas which need improvement. All new City
buildings meet California energy standards and existing buildings will be upgraded with
high performance windows, HVAC systems, and cool roofs as opportunities arise.
Improvements include cleaner, more efficient backup generators at the police and fire
facilities; the retrofitting of traffic signals and street lights for energy savings, and the
purchase of energy-efficient vehicles.
In April 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 2X. This law requires
utilities to obtain one third of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.
Meeting this goal requires cooperation from multiple sectors of the California economy,
including the electricity, natural gas and transportation sectors. Businesses and homes can
be made more energy-efficient by:
     •    Implementing energy efficiency building standards;

                                                                                              2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
     •  Developing ways to streamline energy use in manufacturing, water systems, and
        processing systems;
     •  Educating citizens that wise energy use is a good investment in the economy and the
        environment.
Retrofitting Existing Buildings
In terms of community sustainability, utilization of existing buildings is more resource
efficient than constructing new buildings. Retrofitting existing buildings can be a low risk
investment with long term savings for property owners. Other benefits include improving
the environment, increased health and productivity, and higher property values.
State and Regional efforts are underway to develop new building energy assessment tools
and protocols to rate the energy performance of
existing structures. For example, Assembly Bill AB758
requires the California Energy Commission to develop
a comprehensive energy efficiency program for
existing residential and nonresidential buildings. With
green workforce training, energy assessments, and
building alterations including replacement of

Many historic and older buildings are energy-efficient
because of the quality of construction, and use of passive heating and cooling, while other
buildings require improvements to reduce their environmental footprint. Historic buildings
can include “green” technology or be re-purposed for new uses without compromising
their historic character. Older and historic communities also tend to be centrally located,
highly developed, walkable, and are often mass-transit accessible. These qualities are
promoted by Smart Growth principles as defined in the Land Use and Urban Design
Element and are exhibited in the City’s Date Avenue Historic District.
Environmental and Public Health
There are both natural and man-made environmental factors which cause adverse impacts
to human health and well-being. The City’s conservation efforts focus on waste
management, supporting locally grown and organic foods, reducing air pollution, and
improving air quality.
 Solid Waste Management
San Diego County produces approximately 1.8 million tons of trash each year. Each
person in the County produces approximately 7.5 pounds of trash each day. From a

planning perspective, the key issue is the lack of future landfill space to handle these
projected volumes of trash. State law requires cities and counties to divert at least fifty
percent of their trash away from landfills, whether through waste reduction, reuse or
recycling programs. This includes the familiar forms of recyclable materials such as glass,
paper, aluminum, plastic, and yard cuttings. The City has met its State obligation to divert
fifty percent of the waste stream and continues to explore new opportunities to reduce,
reuse and recycle.
Locally, EDCO Disposal Corporation is contracted for the collection of solid waste and
recyclable materials. Everyone in La Mesa has access to the program and the City’s
recycling ordinance requires all properties and businesses to recycle. A grant-funded
program to improve recycling opportunities for apartment and condominium complexes
began in 2010. Eligible properties can receive recycling materials for use in individual units
as well as shared common areas. Curbside and commercial collection is provided through
the week. This service includes recyclables such as paper, cardboard, cans, bottles, all rigid
plastics, and green waste. EDCO station, a public disposal site located within the City’s
industrial district, accepts electronics, batteries and medical sharps from residents,
Styrofoam, and cooking fats, oils and grease (FOG) for drop-off, in addition to the
recyclables included in the curbside program. Green waste is also accepted. EDCO
periodically revises their collection programs and hosts special events to accept waste based
upon changing consumer needs.
Urban Agriculture
Farmers’ markets feature produce that is
grown locally and organically, providing
opportunities for residents of urban areas
to access fresh produce. Farmers are able
to pick produce at the peak of flavorand
food retains more nutritional value.
Community gardens and other community-
based agriculture help to reduce mass-
produced food packaging and the use of
industry pesticides. Since locally grown
produce does not require long-haul truck
transport, fuel savings benefit both the food           La Mesa’s Weekly Farmer’s Market

In San Diego County there were 29 community gardens for public use as of 2010. The
majority of gardens are run by a volunteer board of directors and managed by a volunteer
manager. Currently there is no organization in San Diego that exclusively manages
gardens, but there is a San Diego Community Garden Network. Cities that have
community gardens provide minor staff oversight by City parks maintenance or
neighborhood services staff. Most gardens have non-profit volunteers who provide day-to-

day oversight. Funding provided by cities varies from no financial support to the provision
of water at no charge.
In 2010, the City began searching for an appropriate community garden demonstration
site. Various public and private properties were considered in proximity to multi-family
and single-family housing. Factors such as property size, access to water, and the potential
to displace other land uses were considered. The City will continue to evaluate potential
locations for a community garden demonstration site.
Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. Some greenhouse
gases occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes while
others are created and emitted solely through human activities such as driving cars. Carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide are examples of greenhouse gases resulting from
human activities. Hazardous air pollutants can cause serious health effects such as asthma.
Many policies and programs are directed toward reducing the impact of emissions on air
quality by reducing air pollution in the Region.
In 2006, the State Legislature took a proactive stance against the challenges of climate
change with the adoption of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB
32). The California Air Resource Board (CARB) was charged with developing regulations
and market mechanisms that would reduce the State’s greenhouse gas emissions to 1990
levels by 2020. This represents a 25 percent reduction statewide, with mandatory caps for
significant emission sources beginning in 2012.
The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act (SB 375) was enacted in 2009.
This legislation addresses the need to integrate land use and transportation planning to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicle trips. The California Air Resources
Board set reduction targets for all regions of the state. For the the San Diego Region, the
target is a reduction in emissions of seven percent by 2020 and thirteen percent by 2035.
SANDAG’s 2050 Regional Transportation Plan contains a Sustainable Communities
Strategy (SCS), a plan to reach the greenhouse gas reduction targets established for the San
Diego Region. The strategy proposes to utilize anticipated funding resources to achieve
transportation and housing goals that reduce green house gas emissions, while protecting
natural resources and open space. Future housing and job growth within the Region are
focused in areas served by existing and planned transportation infrastructure providing
workers and residents with travel options.
La Mesa’s central location, mix of housing stock and employment opportunities align with
the goals of the Sustainable Communities Strategy. An organizing principle of the La Mesa
General Plan is strengthening this alignment by concentrating future mixed-use
development around transit infrastructure and improving pedestrian and bicycle facilities
within transit-rich neighborhoods.

Economic Development
Maintaining a strong economy whose vitality can be relied on well into the future is key to
sustainability. A healthy economy delivers diverse employment opportunities to its
residents, while addressing the environmental and societal impacts of business and
consumer actions. A well-trained workforce, access to an appropriate range and supply of
local jobs and services, and energy-efficient business operations are integral to sustainable
economic development. The Land Use and Urban Design Element includes sustainable
economic development policies.
Transportation
A safe and efficient transportation system supports the health and welfare of both residents
and visitors and is essential to the economic vitality of the business community. Most
people are reliant on private, single-occupant vehicles, which cause pollution and the
release of greenhouse gases into the air. There are more sustainable methods of
transportation that have less of an impact on the environment such as transit, carpooling,
biking, and walking.
Sustainable Transportation
In 2011, SANDAG adopted the 2050 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) which outlines
a plan for investing an estimated $214 billion in local, State and Federal transportation
funds expected to come into the Region over
the next 40 years. The largest proportion of
these funds will go towards transit in an effort
to add sustainable transportation options to the
San Diego Region. Furthermore, SANDAG
was the first agency in California to adopt a
Regional Transportation Plan which included a
Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS)
required by Senate Bill 375. The SCS details
how the Region will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to State-mandated levels over time.
The strategy focuses on increasing the use of Sustainable transportation includes non-motorized
sustainable modes of transportation such as                 travel options such as biking.
biking, walking, and transit.
The 2050 RTP carefully balances the mandate to improve the environment with the needs
of the economy and the desire to construct a multimodal transportation system that works
for everyone. The Plan includes 156 new miles of trolley service, doubled transit service
miles, and increased frequency in key corridors. Furthermore, the Plan dedicates $3.8
billion for Regional and local bicycle and pedestrian projects, and creates new carpool and
tele-work incentive programs to reduce single-occupancy vehicle travel.

Transportation also includes the design of streets for health, safety, livability, sustainability,
and more. Sustainable communities include complete streets which are safe to cross or
walk along, places to meet people, a link to healthy neighborhoods, and a vibrant mix of
retail. Not only does this initiative enhance the safety and security of streets, it reduces the
total amount of paved area, reduces street water runoff into watersheds, maximizes
infiltration and reuse of storm water, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, promotes the
economic well-being of businesses and residents, and reduces energy consumption.

Implementation
U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement
The U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) is the official nonpartisan organization of cities
with populations of 30,000 or more. The primary roles of the USCM are to promote the
development of effective national urban and suburban policy, to strengthen Federal-City
relationships, and to provide mayors with leadership and management tools.
The U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement was passed in June 2005 recognizing
global warming and urges both the Federal and State governments to enact policies and
programs toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement includes 12
target areas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions including emissions monitoring, land
use policies, non-automobile transportation, energy efficiency, building design, waste
treatment and recycling, and outreach. On April 10, 2007 the City Council adopted
Resolution No. 2007-039 endorsing the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement. As
such, the City is committed to:
    •   Urging State governments and the Federal government to enact policies and
        programs to meet or beat the greenhouse gas emission reduction target suggested
        for the United States in the Kyoto Protocol.
    •   Meeting or exceeding Kyoto Protocol targets for reducing global warming pollution
        by taking actions in its own operations and community such as:
            1. Creating an inventory of global warming emissions in City operations and in
                the community, setting reduction targets, and creating an action plan;
            2. Adopting and enforcing land use policies that reduce sprawl, preserve open
                space, and create compact, walkable urban communities;
            3. Promoting transportation options such as bicycle trails, commute trip
                reduction programs, incentives for carpooling, and public transit;
            4. Increasing the use of clean, alternative energy by investing in “green tags,”
                advocating for the development of renewable energy resources, and
                recovering landfill methane for energy production;
            5. Making energy efficiency a priority through building code improvements,
                retrofitting City facilities with energy-efficient lighting, and urging employees
                to conserve energy and save money;
            6. Purchasing only Energy Star equipment and appliances for City use;

              8. Increasing the average fuel efficiency of municipal fleet vehicles, reducing
                  the number of vehicles, launching an employee education program
                  including anti-idling messages, and converting diesel vehicles to bio-diesel;
              9. Evaluating opportunities to increase pump efficiency in water and
                  wastewater systems and recovering wastewater treatment methane for energy
                  production;
              10. Increasing recycling rates in City operations and in the community;
              11. Maintaining healthy urban forests, promoting tree planting to increase
                  shaded areas, and to absorb CO2; and
              12. Helping to educate the public, schools, other jurisdictions, professional
                  associations, and businesses about reducing global warming pollution.
Opportunities for Sustainability
The City will continue to implement sustainability within the community in various ways.
Amenities such as urban walking trails, the safe routes to school program, a City fleet of
hybrid vehicles, the Farmers’ Market, and the rehabilitation of existing buildings all
improve the quality of life for City residents. Additionally, City departments will assist
private property owners through the development review process for those interested in
retrofitting their homes and businesses, or developing new energy-efficient projects.
La Mesa’s Boards and Commissions, including the Environmental Sustainability
Commission, advise City officials and the public on environmental policies, programs, and
projects while promoting public education and fostering community engagement.
Suggestions for a sustainable lifestyle include:
    •    Condense auto trips and replacing trips with biking, walking, or public transit.
    •    Use natural lighting in buildings, such as skylights and replacing old appliances and
         fixtures with high performance ones.
    •    Start a vegetable or herb garden and composting food waste and yard trimmings.
    •    Use drought tolerant landscapes and watering yards in the cool of the evening.
    •    Combine shopping trips and reuse shopping bags.
    •    Recycle packaging and other items for landfill diversion.
    •    Support historic preservation efforts that conserve existing built resources.

Resource Conservation
Land Use and Design Review
Regionally, the San Diego Association of Governments is working to identify smart growth
development opportunities where compact, walkable, and bicycle-friendly urban centers
are sited near transit and bus corridors. The City’s General Plan Land Use Map also
establishes land use opportunities on properties throughout the City to promote this type
of development. The City’s Design Review Program is used as part of the review of
projects including sites that are considered to be environmentally sensitive.
     Grading Ordinance
     Grading construction means excavating or depositing soil materials, either through a
     cut or a fill process. It is usually done to reorient the land for development. The
     Grading Ordinance was adopted to address potential impacts associated with earth
     movement and grading construction; to safeguard the health, safety, and public
     welfare, and to minimize erosion and protect fish, wildlife, and the natural
     environment. A grading permit is required for all but a limited scope of earth-moving
     operations so that these problems can be prevented.
     Habitat Conservation Plan
     In 1999 the City of La Mesa executed an implementing agreement to establish the
     La Mesa Sub-area Plan for Habitat Conservation with the United States Fish and
     Game Service and the California Department of Fish and Game. The La Mesa Sub-
     area Plan lists threatened and endangered species which are subject to conservation
     within the Regional Multiple Species Conservation Plan area (MSCP). The MSCP is
     intended to provide for the protection and conservation of the Region’s heritage while
     continuing to allow appropriate levels of development and growth. As a planning tool,
     these plans protect the Region’s bio-diversity while reducing conflicts between
     development interests and natural resources.
Water Quality
The City of La Mesa participates in San Diego County’s METRO wastewater system,
treating an average of 180 million gallons of wastewater per day. The METRO Wastewater
Joint Powers Authority, comprised of 15 participating agencies, addresses wastewater issues
that ensure fair rates, concern for the environment, and collaboration among all
stakeholders.

      Storm Water Management
      The City of La Mesa’s Storm Water Management Ordinance is intended to protect
      water quality by setting best management practices for new development and enforcing
      the San Diego Regional Water Control Board water quality objectives and
      implementation plans. Implementation of Regional and local storm water quality
      objectives protects the City’s watersheds by prohibiting non-storm water discharges to
      the storm water conveyance system.
Water Supply
The Community Development Department refers development plans to Helix Water
District for review and comment to ensure that water service is available to serve proposed
projects. Helix Water District has completed a report on future water supply. Adopted in
2011, the Urban Water Management Plan is a forecast of future water demand within the
district’s service area.
      Water Efficient Landscaping
      To address outdoor water efficiencies the City of La Mesa adopted a water efficient
      landscape ordinance in 2010 as required by the State of California Water
      Conservation in Landscaping Act. The City’s Ordinance recognizes that, while
      landscaping is essential to the quality of life, landscape design and installation must be
      water efficient. This Ordinance establishes a water budget to encourage water use
      efficiencies.
Energy Conservation
The California Green Building Standards
Code (CALGreen) was implemented in
early 2011, applies to all new residential
and non-residential buildings, and is the
first State-wide mandatory Green Building

    •    Fifty percent (50%) of construction waste diverted from landfills;
    •    Use of building finishes that emit low levels of Volatile Organic Compounds
         (VOC’s); and
    •    Modification of a building’s subsystems for optimum efficiency.
Local jurisdictions, including the City of La Mesa, have adopted these building codes to
implement State goals.
Environmental and Public Health
Air Quality
      San Diego Regional Air Pollution Control District
      The San Diego Regional Air Pollution Control District (APCD) regulates air quality
      within the County and has programs and regulations to control the release of toxic
      substances into the air and to minimize dust and particulates released during
      construction and demolition activities. The Community Development Department
      will implement State air quality standards as part of the development review process
      for new projects. Enforcement of air quality regulations during the construction phase
      and as part of on-going operations is necessary to protect the public health.
Solid Waste Management
City Staff select environmentally friendly options for products and services for use by all
departments. The City’s mandatory Recycling Ordinance is enforced and has a City-wide
compliance rate among commercial businesses
and multi-family properties of 95%. Using a
grant from the Department of Resources
Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), the City
distributes hundreds of recycling cans for
common areas in multi-family properties in
La Mesa along with thousands of recycling bags
and can crushers for individual units.

      which encourages citizens to properly dispose of their unused and outdated
      medications. The “no-questions” drop-off program is preferred to throwing away or
      flushing unneeded prescriptions down the toilet, both of which can be hazardous.
      Fats, Oils, and Grease Control Program
      The Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) Control Program was implemented to help reduce
      blockages within the wastewater system which can lead to sanitary sewer overflows that
      degrade surface water quality and pose a hazard to health and safety. Food service
      establishments are required to participate in the program. EDCO Station in La Mesa
      is providing a FOG recycling program to all San Diegan residents and businesses. The
      EDCO’s FOG recycling program removes oil commodities from landfills while a
      private company refines those substances into biodiesel that can be sold to commercial
      customers to run greener diesel fleets.
Economic Development
The City will work with private developers and businesses to assist and direct them to
Regional resources and programs which encourage sustainable business practices. One
such Regional resource is the non-profit Center for Sustainable Energy, which offers
specific workforce training programs and grants for retro-fitting buildings for energy
efficiency. Opportunities for grants and collaborative programs may vary year to year, but
can be used to minimize local costs of “going green”. The City of La Mesa also works in
collaboration with utility providers, such as SDG&E and Helix Water District, on
implementing sustainability practices for specific development projects.
Transportation
The Circulation Element sets specific policies for action, including implementation of the
Bicycle Facilities and Alternative Transportation Plan. Additionally, the Health and
Wellness Element addresses walkability and Safe Routes to School programs as
transportation alternatives. Governments, special districts, and private businesses should
consider incentives for employee carpooling, use of compressed work week schedules,
telecommuting, and education initiatives as options in support of a more sustainable future.
Through the Sustainable Communities Strategy, SANDAG offers various incentive
programs to encourage people to change their daily commute to reduce Greenhouse Gas
Emissions and improve air quality. Employers play a significant role in transportation
demand management by offering comprehensive commuter programs for their employees.
To encourage reduced automotive use and air pollution, agencies in the County have
promoted programs to recognize those companies or organizations that have taken steps to
improve air quality through innovative projects and programs.

Glossary
Air Basin: A land area with similar meteorological and geographic conditions throughout.
To the extent possible, air basin boundaries are defined along political boundary lines.
California is currently divided into 15 air basins.
Air Pollution Control District (APCD): A county agency with authority to regulate
stationary, indirect and area sources of air pollution within a given county and governed by
a District Air Pollution Control Board composed of the elected county supervisors.
California Air Resources Board (ARB or CARB): The State's lead air quality agency is
responsible for attainment and maintenance of the State and Federal air quality standards,
California climate change programs, and motor vehicle pollution control. It oversees
County and Regional air pollution management programs.
Cap-and-Trade: Cap-and-Trade is a regulatory approach used to control pollution by
setting a firm cap on allowed emissions while employing market mechanisms to achieve
emissions reductions while driving costs down. In a cap-and-trade program, a limit, or cap
is put on the amount of Greenhouse Gases that can be emitted.
Economic Diversity: The mix of industries and businesses in an economy that offer
opportunities for people of differing skill and educational levels to obtain employment.
Emissions: Released or discharged air contaminants in the ambient air from any source.
Greenhouse Gases (GHG): Atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide, methane,
chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide, ozone and water vapor that slow the passage of re-
radiated heat through the Earth's atmosphere.
Retrofit of buildings: The improvement of a building’s infrastructure to increase its energy
efficiency, comfort, safety, health and durability. This could include improving building
components, building operating systems and equipment, and installing energy-efficient
appliances.
Sensitive Lands: Land or natural areas on which development may harm ecological
diversity; areas of special significance for animal, bird or plant life; areas important for
erosion control and water quality; land of aesthetic, cultural or historical significance.
Smart Growth: The concentration of growth in compact, walkable, urban centers.
Sustainability: To meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their needs (WCED 1987). A sustainable community fosters the three
E’s; environment, economy, and social equity by not letting the interest of one be
considered above the others.

The City’s Land Use Policies encourage infill
development near established transportation corridors in order to reduce the pressure for
unnecessary sprawl in suburban and rural areas. The City’s Land Use Policies also provide
for the maintenance and enhancement of recreation and open space amenities. These
Policies are significant because only two percent of the City’s land area remains
undeveloped. Park sites and natural open space areas improve quality of life in La Mesa
and the surrounding Region by providing opportunities for citizens to engage in outdoor
recreation and scenic enjoyment. For the purpose of definition the City's recreation
resources, parklands and open space are provided in the following basic forms:
     •   Urban public parks;
     •   Private recreational amenities and open space;
     •   Regional-serving public lands such as beaches lake shores, forest lands, and regional
         parks; and

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                           2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
     •   Undeveloped private lands, including vacant lots, lands constrained by topography,
         and sensitive habitats.
As the population continues to grow and the availability of vacant land decreases, the
opportunity to meet recreation and open space needs becomes an increasing challenge. In
2012, a Parks Master Plan was prepared to inventory and evaluate all park lands and
address future community needs. Figure RO-1 identifies the current distribution and types
of park facilities provided in the community. The City’s Parks Master Plan creates a
roadmap for upgrades and potential additions to the park system. Reinvestment is needed
in park facilities to insure the safety and appeal of the City’s recreational amenities. Past
examples of this include working with the school districts and adjoining jurisdictions on
projects ranging from joint use facilities to Harry Griffen Regional Park.
Included in this network of recreation and open space for La Mesa is land within private
developments. Design review procedures and development standards insure that new
residential development provides high quality outdoor recreational space within each
project.
Purpose
The California State General Plan Guidelines require an Open Space Element to guide the
comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of “open space land.” This
Element also outlines the City’s intentions for recreational facilities to improve the quality
of life of residents. It is important for the City to maintain a wide range of different types of
parks to assure that outdoor recreational opportunities are accessible to everybody.
Organization and Content
This Element outlines the City’s existing park amenities and their classifications. This
includes discussion of public opportunities provided by the Community Services
Department, as well as private recreational facilities. The Element also covers the City’s
natural open space amenities.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Due to the broad scope of this Element, recreation and open space issues overlap those of
several Elements. The Land Use and Urban Design Element’s issues around natural
resources, recreation, enjoyment of scenic beauty, and public grounds are also covered
within this Element. The Recreation & Open Space Element relates to the Conservation &
Sustainability Element on the managed production of resources and the preservation of
natural resources. This Element also overlaps with the Health & Wellness Element and
the Safety Element on issues of public health and safety. Shared topic areas are
summarized in Table RO-1.

Regulatory Setting
The Recreation & Open Space Element fulfills the requirement that cities include an open
space element in their general plan documents, defined in Section 65563 of the
Government Code. The City of La Mesa has elected to combine the Recreation Element
with the Open Space Element based on overlapping concerns regarding public land and
open space resource protection. By law, the document must contain an “action program”
identifying specific techniques which the City intends to use in implementing its open space
plan (Section 65564 of the Government Code). Examples of such “action programs”
include provisions for open space in specific plans, and public and private acquisition of
open space.
Recreational Facilities
The City’s park facilities are shown on Figure RO-1 and are discussed in detail in the City’s
Parks Master Plan under separate cover. Linkages to public parks, including sidewalks,
crosswalks, and other public access amenities, are important to creating an accessible
network of green space within the City.
Park Classifications
Regional Park
A Regional park typically serves several communities and has substantially more acreage
than parks in individual communities. Regional parks have a variety of recreation facilities
and larger scale uses such as golf courses and swimming pools. These parks typically have
distinctive scenic, natural, historical, or cultural features that attract users.
Harry Griffen Park is a Regional park operated
as part of a Joint Powers Authority composed
of Helix Water District, Grossmont Union
High School District, the County of San Diego,
and the cities of El Cajon and La Mesa. The
park is comprised of 53 acres and includes a
large amphitheater that is utilized for special
events. The park offers individual and group
picnicking, onsite parking, a restroom facility,
and a children’s play structure. An off-leash
dog run is used frequently, as are extensive
hiking and walking trails.                                    The Playground at Harry Griffen Park

Community Park
Community parks serve a larger population within either a single community area or
multiple communities. Both active and passive uses offer recreation opportunities for large
groups of people, such as field sports, individual and group picnicking, play areas, and
community centers. MacArthur Park is a community park located at the corner of
University Avenue and Memorial Drive; it is over 22 acres in size. It includes a municipal
pool, Nan Coots Cottage, which is a historic building used for special events, a community
center; and a recreation center with basketball courts. A nine hole, par three golf course
occupies a majority of the park and includes a driving range and putting and chipping area.
Porter Hall is a historic building located at the park’s entrance and, as of 2011, was leased
to the Foothills Arts Association as an art gallery.
Neighborhood Park
Neighborhood parks serve a smaller population within an area, but still include both
passive and active recreational facilities. These parks include minimum areas for car
parking, which encourages visitors to utilize alternative transportation such as biking or
walking. Neighborhood parks may include tot lots, picnic facilities, and a multi-use court.
Most of the City’s parks are classified as neighborhood parks.
Briercrest Park is the latest park to be renovated within the City. It is a sensory park
developed to provide seniors and the physically challenged with opportunities to explore
and enjoy outdoor recreation and fitness. It includes rolling hills, a rain garden, and non-
traditional children’s play equipment. Parking is shared with the adjacent Dr. William C.
Herrick Community Health Care Library, on Wakarusa Street, which is open to the
public. Adjacent to the improved park are vacant parcels owned by the City of La Mesa
which maybe leased to private interests for non-park uses.
Sunset Park, adjacent to Lake Murray, provides two ball fields and is the site of the
Challenge Center, which provides recreational and rehabilitation opportunities for people
living with severe physical disabilities. The Challenge Center building is owned by the City
of La Mesa and is leased on a year-to-year basis. Access to this park is granted by the City
of San Diego through a right-of-entry permit from Lake Park Drive in La Mesa. Other
areas surrounding Lake Murray are discussed later in the Element under “Other Parks.”
La Mesita Park is adjacent to the Junior Seau Sports complex and the La Mesa YMCA. It
includes open space for informal play, large shade trees, and play equipment. There is a
concrete track used by children to ride bicycles. This park includes lighted tennis courts,
as well as a skate park for skateboarders and in-line skating. The Junior Seau Sports
complex includes full-sized, lighted ball fields and football/soccer fields, available by
permit.
Collier Park, located on the east side of Palm Avenue, includes lighted tennis courts,
children’s play areas, picnic areas, and a restroom facility. The park has been targeted to

receive renovations by the La Mesa Park and Recreation Foundation. In 2011, the City
began work on an Environmental Impact Report to consider project alternatives for
redevelopment of the Park. Collier Park, and the Spring House within the park site, are
registered as local historic landmarks.
Aztec Park, located at the corner of Aztec Drive and Morocco Drive, consists of large,
mature shade trees with large expanses of rolling turf areas for informal play. There are
also group and individual picnic areas throughout, a restroom building, and a children’s
playground. Onsite parking is not available.
Pocket Park
A pocket park is less than one acre in size, and is primarily made up of hardscape-type
plazas and walkways that support a variety of respite and social interaction opportunities.
Figure RO-1 identifies the location of two existing pocket parks. The first is the historic
La Mesa Depot Museum located at 4695 Nebo Drive. The Depot structure was
constructed in 1894 and the Museum now features historical facts and information from
the time when Southern Pacific Railway trains traveled through La Mesa. The second is
La Mesa’s “Walkway of the Stars,” a pedestrian walkway that includes decorative art murals
and seating areas. The park’s theme honors the City’s outstanding volunteers who have
provided 10,000 or more hours of service to the City of La Mesa. “Walkway of the Stars”
is located between the Allison Avenue municipal parking lot and La Mesa Boulevard. The
walkway was renamed “Walkway of the Stars” in 2003 and features decorative stone stars,
embedded in the pavement, with the names of volunteers who have achieved this high
standard.
Urban Walking Trails
La Mesa provides recreational programs to keep
people active, including several walking programs.
Three different urban walking trails respond to
different abilities. The “Stroll” is a flat, one-mile
beginner route and starts at the La Mesa Railroad
Depot. The “Stride” is an intermediate level five-
mile route with slight hills which begins at Jackson
Park. The “Challenge” begins at Highwood Park
and is an advanced level, three and a half miles route    Plaques mark the City’s urban walking trails.
with hills and steps. Each route is marked with color
coded directional markers so that anyone can follow the walk at anytime.
The La Mesa Art Alliance created a two-mile walk highlighting art throughout the
Downtown Village. The route includes elements such as utility boxes that have been
transformed by local artists.

focused on personal enrichment through recreational activities. The La Mesa Indoor
Soccer Facility is located on Murray Drive, north of the SR-125, and offers opportunities
for both youth and adults to participate in community soccer leagues.
Other Parks
There are several park facilities that benefit La Mesa residents that are not within the City’s
boundaries. Mission Trails Regional Park is located to the north of the City of La Mesa
and includes approximately 5800 acres of natural open space and over 40 miles of hiking
trails. It also includes camping at Kumeyaay Lake and a visitor and interpretive center
where visitors can explore the cultural, historical, and recreational aspects of the park. The

park includes Lake Murray, located along the City’s north-westerly border. Lake Murray
provides opportunities for bike riding, jogging, walking, rollerblading, and picnicking with
3.2 miles of shoreline.
Helix Park is located in the Grossmont-Mt. Helix area of unincorporated San Diego
County, between the cities of La Mesa and El Cajon. The park is managed and maintained
by a non-profit organization called The Mount Helix Foundation.
Eucalyptus County Park is 6.5 acres in size, located at the southeast edge of La Mesa. This
park includes facilities such as horseshoe pits, playground, and a pavilion. The park is
often used by La Mesa residents.
Hillside Park and Fletcher Hills Park are located within the Fletcher Hills district of the
City of El Cajon. Both parks are used by nearby La Mesa residents.
Park Development
The Land Use Map of the Land Use and Urban Design Element identifies the City’s
designated recreational land. There are 136 acres of parkland distributed over 14 parks.
The Parks Master Plan sets a 15 minute walk as a standard for future park development.
To achieve this goal, the creation of new pocket- parks, linear parks, and other amenities
within the public realm is recommended by the Parks Master Plan. Park development
opportunities include:
    •   Portions of developable sites dedicated for park or active recreational use;
    •   Inclusion of active recreation internal to these developments;
    •   Inclusion of plazas, linear parks, or community gardens as part of the development;
    •   Pursuit of smart growth funds and other grants to support parkland development in
        association with smart growth, mixed-use, walkable, and transit-supportive projects;
        and

Natural Open Space
The 4,200 square miles of the San Diego Region
encompasses a variety of habitats, including coastal
sage scrub, chaparral, grassland, riparian, woodlands,
forest, and desert. The habitats are home to over 200
species that are listed, or proposed for listing, by
Federal or State governments as endangered,
threatened or rare. The endangered species cover a
broad range of flora and fauna, including birds.
Completed in 1997, the South County Multiple Multi-family projects provide onsite open
                                                                          space.
Species Conservation Program targets approximately
172,000 acres for conservation to protect 85 sensitive plants and animals. In northern
San Diego County, seven incorporated cities make up the Multiple Habitat Conservation
Program (MHCP), which was adopted by the SANDAG Board of Directors in 2003. It
protects 77 species within a 20,000-acre preserve system. The remaining unincorporated
areas of North and East County cover more than one million acres of land. The County of
San Diego is working to set up a habitat preserve that will merge with the other two
programs. The Conservation and Sustainability Element contains goals, objectives, and
policies for the City to preserve its natural resources.
Because La Mesa is highly urbanized, there are no large areas of undeveloped land.
However, Regional open space resources are valuable to the City of La Mesa because they
add to the quality of life as outdoor recreational amenities for citizens. Cowles Mountain,
Mount Helix and Lake Murray are examples of Regional open space resources outside the
City that benefit residents by providing visual enjoyment and recreational opportunities.
The Proposed Land Use Map of the Land Use and Urban Design Element identifies the
City’s designated open space areas. These include open canyon lands south of the I-8 and
a larger open space area within the City’s Eastridge neighborhood located to the north of
the SR-94.
La Mesa’s Open Space Element contains goals and policies concerned with managing all
open space areas, including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Natural
open space areas including canyons and hillsides give form to neighborhoods and add to
quality of life as natural amenities.

Hillside Sites
The La Mesa Zoning Map identifies “environmentally sensitive areas” within the City that
require discretionary review of projects to address the site constraints due to areas visible
from major public thoroughfares. Sites located south of Alvarado Road in an area
characterized by open hillsides and canyons are somewhat visible from Interstate 8 and
make up a portion of the visual open space scene along the south face of the corridor.
This area is one of the few remaining open canyons located in the northwest quadrant of
La Mesa and, due to its visibility and image, it is important that new development be
sensitively designed to address constraints.
The challenge is to find the appropriate level of
development acceptable on sites which are
topographically constrained or designated for open
space. In considering a range of alternative designs
for hillside properties, the City Council decided in
1989 to allow projects on sites designated open
space when approved through the City’s design
review process.          Site designs that avoid
construction of new structures on particularly
constrained lands while retaining the natural
character as a permanent open visual asset are            Tungsten Canyon open space preserve
preferred. Through individual site plan review, the appropriate balance of open space to
developable area on individual parcels can be determined. There are areas that are
undeveloped, ungraded and consist largely of natural slopes and vegetation which are not
expected to significantly change. The policies of the Land Use & Urban Design Element
allow for encroachment into natural open space areas subject to meeting certain
development standards.
Goals, Objectives, and Policies
The following section provides guidelines for the future of park and open space

Implementation
Park Development
The City will actively search for opportunities to acquire and develop new park sites,
including a neighborhood park to serve the western portion of La Mesa, as well as new
pocket-parks and linear-parks. Park development efforts will be guided by the City’s Parks
Master Plan, which discusses details of recreational facilities within reasonable distance to
La Mesa’s residents. Policies and actions identified in the Bicycle Facilities and Alternative
Transportation Plan focus on improving access to parks, open space and recreational
facilities.
Park Maintenance
The City-wide Parks Master Plan provides
recommendations for enhancement of existing
park properties. The Community Services and
Public Works Departments are responsible for on-
going maintenance of the City’s recreation
infrastructure. Significant public resources are
devoted to combating the vandalism of park
amenities on a continuing basis. The Public
Works Department maintains park facilities and
works with the Police Department to minimize

Grants and Other Funding
The City will continue to actively search for potential funding sources for public parks and
recreation facilities through grant applications, partnerships, trusts, and specific fundraising
events and activities.
Natural Open Space
Development review of private property will preserve natural open space areas such as
slopes and hillside sites. The City of La Mesa Urban Design Program contains a section
which defines visually sensitive areas. Design guidelines of the program will be used as part
of the review of projects for sites that are mapped as visually sensitive areas.
Urban Forestry
Trees within the public right-of-way and parks contribute to the visual ambiance of the
City’s neighborhoods and are a consideration when parks are renovated. The Tree Policy
Manual is a reference for existing City of La Mesa guidelines, policies, and standards for
the planting, care, preservation, maintenance, and replacement of trees. The Development
Advisory Board serves as the City Tree Board and reviews and updates the City’s Tree
Policy Manual as required.
Subarea Habitat Conservation Plan
There is a privately owned, 50-acre open space preserve within the Eastridge
neighborhood, north of High Street and south of Shadow Hill Drive, surrounded by single-
family residences and vacant lots. This open space area preserves an area of steep
topography and natural vegetation and provides an additional visual amenity. There is a
50-foot wide fire buffer zone along the perimeter of the open space for fire protection
purposes. This land is managed and monitored in accordance with the City’s Subarea
Habitat Conservation Plan in order to preserve a small population of the California
gnatcatcher in one of the last natural California coastal sage scrub open space areas in the
City of La Mesa.

archaeological, architectural, and social history, and includes historic districts,
neighborhoods, landscapes, and individual artifacts, objects or elements therein, whose
context may be derived from a local, State, Regional, or National level of significance. In
California, where post-WWII-era building stock and infrastructure has achieved historic-
era status, historic preservation efforts are transitioning from a focus on individual eligibility
to that of neighborhoods which reflect a greater combined character, theme, and
expression of place.
Historic preservation policies and methods regulate and advise on designated and eligible
properties and, in this time of transition, may also serve as a guide to historic-era properties
that are not technically significant and found to be ineligible, but that do offer a sense of
place and serve as connective fabric in the urban landscape.

History
Founded in 1869 and incorporated in 1912, the lands comprising present-day La Mesa
were initially within the boundaries of Rancho Mission San Diego de Alcala. The area was
first settled in the American Period, in approximately 1868, when Robert Allison
purchased property for use as a sheep ranch and other animal husbandry activities. The
area’s natural springs provided ample water for the raising of livestock, and with the
additional discovery of gold in the eastern mountains of Julian, La Mesa was recognized as
a convenient stop for eastward movement of people and goods. Mr. Allison, with his
landholdings, was able to take advantage of the speculative real estate activities in the
progressive-era.
Land speculation in La Mesa was also fueled by construction of the flume line, which
brought water down from the Cuyamaca Mountains, and the railroad spur line from San
Diego to East County. The flume was needed because, although spring water was available
for livestock, there wasn’t sufficient water for more intense agriculture and real estate
improvements. The San Diego Flume Company was formed in 1886, immediately raising
capital by subdividing and selling land along present-day El Cajon Boulevard between
College Avenue and Garfield Street. Robert Allison also donated 100 one-acre lots in the
La Mesa Townsite to
the Flume Company
as a means of bringing
much-needed water to
the La Mesa area.
In 1887 Robert Allison
purchased construction
bonds and granted a
right-of-way to the new
San Diego, Cuyamaca,
and Eastern Railroad
Company.         By 1890
service was available
from Lakeside to San
Diego with a stop at the                             La Mesa Parade, 1911.

in the vicinity of present-
day Downtown La Mesa. By 1895, newspapers and periodicals referenced La Mesa as
“Allison Springs,” “La Mesa Springs,” and “La Mesa Colony.” Into the early Twentieth
Century the local economy expanded to include agriculture and citrus orchards with
packing warehouses, health resorts and limited film production facilities. By 1912, at the
time of incorporation, the City’s population had reached 700.

Construction of El Cajon Boulevard, around the time of World War I, provided for an
alternative transportation route between San Diego and La Mesa, which caused a shift of
development from the University Avenue corridor to El Cajon Boulevard. By 1930
La Mesa’s population increased to 2,500, however, as a result of the Great Depression,
little growth occurred
until the onset of
World War II and
beyond, when La Mesa
and        municipalities
throughout the entire
State experienced tre-
mendous growth in the
form of new residential
tracts and suburban
commercial centers.             Railway transportation has served the community since the 1880s and
                                             continues to shape the character of the City.
By 1940 the City’s population reached 3,912. Subsequent to WWII, La Mesa’s
population increased exponentially and the municipality was soon regarded as one of the
fastest growing suburban cities in the San Diego region. i Infrastructure demands and land
annexations characterize the post-WWII period of La Mesa’s history, with the
development of comprehensively constructed residential tracts improved with dwellings in
modernisitc Ranch style, replete with new schools and shopping centers to support the
growing population.
In La Mesa residential neighborhoods developed along the University Avenue and
El Cajon Boulevard corridors and on the north side of the City along Lake Murray
Boulevard and Baltimore Drive. Housing stock and forms changed to reflect the rise of
modernisitc residential subdivision tracts modeled after the Urban Land Institute’s
prescriptive development patterns in the Community Builders Handbook and were
consistent with major residential tracts developed in San Diego, including Linda Vista in
the early 1940s and Clairemont in the 1950s. New suburban tracts developed in or
annexed to La Mesa included Mount Helix Avocado Highlands, Fletcher Hills / Severin
Manor, Rasonia, Rolando Knolls, and Vista La Mesa. ii These new communities were
connected by major transportation corridors developed in the mid-to-late 1950s, including
State Routes 94 and 125, as well as the U.S. 80 Bypass and local thoroughfare Fletcher
Parkway, that spanned through La Mesa and into El Cajon to the east. iii Custom homes
were constructed in the hills of Grossmont and Mount Helix in the mid-century period
with design attributed to noted Master Architects including Cliff May, Lloyd Ruocco, and
Homer Delawie.

By the early 1950s, student population in La Mesa and the surrounding jurisdictions had
peaked with a record enrollment of 3,000 at Grossmont High School. The overcrowding
demanded an immediate solution in the form of two new schools opened in 1952,

consumed by new
single-family neighborhoods; rising land costs in the older parts of town created a demand
for higher-density cost-effective housing which, in the 1950s and 1960s, resulted in the
development of infill apartment buildings in and around established historic-era
neighborhoods. Inconsistent in appearance and form from the preceding historic-era
neighborhoods, these infill projects were constructed in a mix of minimal and Modernisitc
styles, which began to create an incongruous aesthetic and environment for La Mesans and
contributed to the erosion or replacement of some older neighborhoods and buildings.
This trend was reversed in the 1970s as citizens of La Mesa initiated historic preservation
efforts culminating in the adoption of the City’s inaugural Historic Preservation Program in
the mid-1980s, including adoption of the City’s first Historic Preservation Element.
The City was connected to the Metropolitan Transit Development light rail trolley system
in the early 1980s, and capitalized on the new modal option by creating mixed-use projects
west of Spring Street and refocusing attention on the historic-era Village, comprised of one-
and-two-part commercial blocks with facades in the Beaux Arts, Classical Revival, Spanish
Revival, Streamline Moderne, and Modernistic styles.
Today the City continues to integrate historic preservation into the comprehensive urban
planning and development process by recognizing and preserving its past in order to plan
for its future.

To inform this Historic Preservation Element the City of La Mesa held a workshop
attended by citizens and stakeholders who provided input on their vision of historic
preservation by responding to the following questions.
     • What people, places, and events from the Modern-Period (circa 1935-1975) should
        be considered?
     • Which sites and neighborhoods should be surveyed to identify Modern-Period
        resources?
     • How could the Historic Preservation Program be enhanced or changed?
Responses received and discussions with citizens and stakeholders informed the direction
and extent of program enhancements and changes.

Regulatory Setting
The Federal government and the State of California provide a regulatory setting for local
preservation planning program management and decision-making. Historic preservation
concerns are regulated in comprehensive environmental planning laws and in topic-specific
historic preservation legislation enacted at the Federal and State levels. This framework is
implemented locally within the City of La Mesa, and further informs the City’s Historic
Preservation Program.
Federal
The Federal framework for historic preservation planning originates from the 1849
establishment of the United States Interior Department, the 1906 American Antiquities
Act, the creation of the National Park Service in 1916, and the 1935 Historic Sites Act.

Past programs culminated in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 – an enduring
model and the regulatory basis for all historic preservation activities and programs
throughout the United States. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 solidified
the Federal Government’s recognition that historic and archaeological resources are
included within the comprehensive definition of the environment, and mandates review of
effects to historic properties at all Federal undertakings.

National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (As Amended)
The primary purpose of the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act was to declare a
National policy that would encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and
his environment. The Policy, contained within 42 U.S.C. 4321 and 4331-4335 includes
specific language referencing a national perspective on historic preservation including:
    • To assure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and
        culturally pleasing surroundings,
    • To preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage,
        and maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and
        variety of individual choice, and
    • That each person should enjoy a healthful environment and that each person has a
        responsibility to contribute to the preservation of the environment. v
State of California
Historic preservation and resource protection programs have flourished in California from
1895 forward when the Landmarks Club was established in Los Angeles for the
preservation of historical sites throughout California, starting with the Spanish Colonial
Missions at San Diego, San Juan Capistrano and San Fernando. In 1902 the California
Historical Landmarks League was
incorporated in San Francisco for
the purpose of installing memorial
tablets in locations around the State
to commemorate historic places
and events.
Formal State-led programs for
identifying,      protecting,      and
commemorating                historical
resources throughout California

Points of Historical Interest Program (1965), and the California Register of Historical
Resources (1992). The 1970 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was amended
in 1992 to create the California Register of Historical Resources, and to account for, and
include, historical resources within the comprehensive definition of the environment, thus
providing a process for identifying, treating, and managing resources within the local
discretionary project review process where CEQA is applicable.
California Register of Historical Resources (1992)
Established in 1992, the California Register of Historical Resources program encourages
public recognition and protection of resources of architectural, historical, archeological and
cultural significance, identifies historical resources for State and local planning purposes,
determines eligibility for State historic preservation grant funding and affords certain
protections under the California Environmental Quality Act. The California Register is as
an authoritative guide to be used by State and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to
identify the State's historical resources and to indicate what properties are to be protected
from substantial adverse change.
The California Register includes resources that are formally determined eligible for, or
listed in, the National Register, State Historical Landmarks numbered 770 or higher;
Points of Historical Interest recommended for listing by the State Historical Resources
Commission (SHRC); resources nominated for listing and determined eligible in
accordance with criteria and procedures adopted by the SHRC, and resources and districts
designated as City or County landmarks when the designation criteria are consistent with
California Register criteria. Additionally properties may be eligible for inclusion on the
California Register for meeting one of the following criteria.
     1. Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
        patterns of local or Regional history or the cultural heritage of California or the
        United States,
     2. Associated with the lives of persons important to local, California or National
        history,
     3. Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region or method of
        construction or represent the work of a master or possesses high artistic values, and
     4. Has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory
        or history of the local area, California or the nation.
California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA)
With establishment of the California Register and the SHRC, the State legislature amended
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in 1992 to define a historical resource
as:
     • A resource listed in or determined eligible for listing in the California Register; or

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                              2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
     • A resource included in a local register of historical resources; or
     • A resource identified as significant in a historical resource survey that meets certain
         requirements; or
     • Any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript which a lead
         agency determines to be significant.
Generally, a resource is considered to be historically significant if it meets the criteria for
listing in the California Register. However, a lead agency under CEQA is not precluded
from determining a resource is significant that is not listed in (or determined eligible for
listing in) the California Register, not included in a local register, or identified in a historical
resources survey as a historical resource, as defined in the Public Resources Code.
CEQA was further amended to clarify that a project that may cause a substantial adverse
change in the significance of a historical resource is a project that may have a significant
effect on the environment.
While demolition and destruction are obvious significant impacts, it is more difficult to
assess when change, alteration, or relocation crosses the threshold of substantial adverse
change. The State CEQA Guidelines provide that a project that demolishes or alters those
physical characteristics of a historical resource that convey its historical significance, (i.e., its
character-defining features), can be considered to materially impair the resource's
significance. However, a project that conforms to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for the Treatment of Historic Properties can generally be considered to be a project that
will not cause a significant impact.
Archaeological and Cultural Protection
Several State and Federal laws address the importance of Native American involvement in
the development review process and provide requirements for the treatment of human
remains and grave goods and protection of cultural places. Among these laws is the
California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 2001. This Act is
consistent with the Federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, and
was put in place to ensure that all California Indian human remains and cultural items are
treated with dignity and respect. In addition, sections of the California Health and Safety
Code address the discovery of human remains outside a dedicated cemetery and provide
requirements for consultation with appropriate Native American individuals for disposition
of the remains. The Public Resources Code establishes the Native American Heritage
Commission and the State’s Sacred Places List. The requirements for local agencies to
consult with identified California Native American Tribes, as part of the general plan
adoption or amendment process and prior to the dedication of open space, are provided in
Government Code Sections 65352.3, 65352.4, 65562.5, and others collectively referred to
as Senate Bill 18 (SB 18).

City of La Mesa
The City of La Mesa was founded in 1869 and incorporated in 1912. Throughout its
existence, decision-makers and citizens strived to protect and preserve properties that are
associated with important events or persons, or that represent important architectural styles
or patterns of development in La Mesa. The City formally established a Historic
Preservation Program in 1984 with the adoption of a Historic Preservation Element. As
part of that process, the City
recognized the Date Avenue
Historic District and delineated
the District boundaries as
shown in Figure HP-1.
The City’s current Historic
Preservation Program includes
a Historic Preservation Element,
a Historic Preservation Ordi-
nance, the Historic Preservation
Commission, dedicated Historic
Preservation Planning, Munici-
pal Staff, a Register of Desig-
nated Landmarks, an Inventory             Distinctive Date Palms in the Date Avenue Historic District.

Implementation
The City formally established a Historic Preservation Program in 1984 with the adoption
of a Historic Preservation Element. In 1985, with assistance from a Citizens Advisory
Committee, the City adopted a Historic Preservation Ordinance, which created the
Historic Preservation Commission and included a process for designating individual
Historic Landmarks and Historic Districts throughout the City. In 1989 the City of
La Mesa General Plan Citizen Committee reviewed the City’s Historic Preservation
Program and determined that, in its past actions and through the established Historic
Preservation Element and Ordinance, the City made a commitment to the principle that
historic preservation planning is the best interest of La Mesa, and that the City had created
a strong organizational framework for program implementation.
The City’s first Historic Preservation Element was adopted in 1984 and updated in 1989.
This revised Historic Preservation Element continues to establish policy and inform the
actions and mechanisms of historic preservation planning in La Mesa. The Historic
Preservation Element implementation framework includes four components – integrated
Staff and Commission, regulatory, identification and registration, and treatment incentives
and benefits.
Historic Preservation Commission
The Historic Preservation Commission consists of seven members appointed by the Mayor
with the approval of the City Council to act as an advisory body on matters of historic
preservation, including review of development plans and the La Mesa Historic Resources
Inventory. Additional duties of the La Mesa Historic Preservation Commission include:
     • Nominate structures to the Register of Designated Landmarks,
     • Encourage private efforts to protect historic resources, and
     • Provide advice and guidance to property owners of historic resources.

     • Ensure compliance with Mills Act Historic Preservation Property Tax Abatement
       agreements.
     • Conduct outreach and education activities with stakeholders in the preservation
       process.
Regulatory
Historic Preservation Ordinance
The City’s Historic Preservation Ordinance, contained within Title 25 of the La Mesa
Municipal Code, is the primary tool utilized to implement the Historic Preservation
Element. The Ordinance includes language on Historic Landmark designation and project
review for historic-era properties and designated Historic Landmarks.
Additionally, working in conjunction with the Historic Preservation Ordinance, the review
of impacts at historical resources is included within the CEQA project review process for
proposed discretionary actions within La Mesa municipal boundaries.
The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties
Four treatment options exist within the field of preservation planning – Preservation,
Restoration, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation. The four treatment standards are guided
by The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with
Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring & Reconstructing Historic Buildings.
For local discretionary project review, projects that are found to be consistent with The
Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation will be considered to cause minimal
impact to historic properties and, under CEQA, shall be considered to result in impacts
that are less-than-significant.
Resource Management Guidelines
The Resource Management Guidelines were originally included in the 1984 Historic
Preservation Element. The guidelines reference compliance with The Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the associated Standards
for Rehabilitation.
The Resource Management Guidelines provide illustrations of typical architectural features
including windows and porch and porch railing arrangements, and also prescribe site
orientation, exterior color, exterior building materials and textures, directional expressions,
and entrance locations for all properties included on the La Mesa Historic Resources
Inventory and within recognized Historic Districts.
Downtown Village Specific Plan
The Downtown Village Specific Plan was adopted in 1990 with the intent to provide a
vision and direction for the future of Downtown La Mesa. The document is flexible in

nature, including parcel-specific design guidelines in some plan areas, and generalized
recommendations for other locations within the plan area. Relative to the City’s Historic
Preservation Program, the Downtown Village Specific Plan includes the following goals.
     • Retain and Encourage Residential Development: Although over time natural
        economic forces will tend to replace residential development with commercial
        development, the goal for the Downtown Village is to retain a variety of viable
        residential neighborhoods in close proximity as well as within the area, and thus
        provide a balanced community.
     • Encourage Diverse Architecture: A varied and diverse architecture should be
        encouraged without one architectural theme, like a jewel with many facets.
        Buildings should have a small pedestrian / human scale rather than be institutional
        or auto oriented. Neglected buildings should be rehabilitated. Commercial
        buildings in close proximity to residential uses should respect and accommodate the
        residential values.
     • Honor and Respect History: The historic buildings in the area should be honored,
        restored and preserved, and Downtown’s historic role in the community should be
        emphasized. This provides a link with the past (sense of past), creates a pleasant
        ambiance, and adds to the architectural diversity.
Identification and Registration
La Mesa Historic Resources Inventory
The La Mesa Historic Resources Inventory was initially adopted on May 10, 1983.
Subsequent to adoption, the Inventory has been updated through the inclusion of
additional property documentation on State of California Historical Resource Inventory
forms and the current Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR) 523 series forms. The
Inventory is an accounting of some historic-era properties within La Mesa’s municipal
boundaries and includes information on the appearance, condition and ownership /
occupancy history for each documented property, and additionally includes significance
and eligibility conclusions for the documented properties.
The Inventory is intended as a tool for the identification of eligible historic-era properties
and should be regarded as similar to other data collection tools within the comprehensive
urban planning process. It is the primary method and tool for identifying historic-era
properties as significant and eligible for registration as La Mesa Landmarks, or for formal
listing on the California Register of Historical Resources or the National Register of
Historic Places. The City-maintained Inventory of surveyed properties informs the public,
City Staff, and the Historic Preservation Commission of the potential for designation of
La Mesa properties, and for identification as historical resources in a discretionary project

review process. Eligible properties may be voluntarily designated as a City of La Mesa
Historic Landmark and included on the Historic Landmark Register.
Properties previously documented and included within the Inventory may be found either
eligible or ineligible for inclusion on the Register of Historic Landmarks as part of a project
review process. Similarly, properties not previously documented and not currently
included in the La Mesa Historic Resources Inventory, may be found eligible for
designation through intensive level survey activities that include research, observation,
documentation, and eligibility evaluation.
No property included in the Inventory may be altered or demolished except in compliance
with the procedures established in Title 25 (Historic Preservation Ordinance) of the City of
La Mesa Municipal Code. Additionally, a property that is determined eligible on the
La Mesa Historic Resources Inventory is generally considered to meet the definition of a
historical resource unless new information is presented to demonstrate a change in
eligibility or a reduction of integrity such that the property no longer physically conveys its
identified significance.
Register of Historic Landmarks
Pursuant to Title 25, Chapter 25.03, Section 25.03.010 of the La Mesa Municipal Code, a
property may be eligible for designation as a Landmark or as a Historic District (or a
contributing Element therein), if it meets one or more of the following qualifying criteria:
     A. Is identified with persons or events significant in local, State, or National history; or
     B. Embodies distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period, or method of
          construction, or is a valuable example of the use of indigenous materials or
          craftsmanship; or
     C. Represents the notable work of an acclaimed builder, designer, or architect; or
     D. Is identified with a person or persons or groups who significantly contributed to the
          culture and development of the City; or
     E. Embodies elements of outstanding attention to architectural design, detail, materials
          or craftsmanship; or
     F. An archeological or paleontological site which has the potential of yielding
          information of scientific value; or
     G. A geographically definable area possessing a concentration of sites, buildings,
          structures, improvements, or objects linked historically through location, design,
          setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and/or association, in which the collective
          value of the improvements may be greater than the value of each individual
          improvement.

Historic Landmark Recognition
Properties that have been designated as Historic Landmarks by the La Mesa Historic
Preservation Commission may, at the owner’s discretion, display identifying markers or
plaques to promote the property’s history and significance. To encourage the promotion
of local history and to recognize an owner’s preservation efforts, the City provides a
standardized wall plaque design, which can be ordered and installed.
California State Historical Building Code
The California State Historic Building Code (CHBC), contained within Title 24 Part 8 of
the Code of California Regulations, provides regulations to meet the intent of health and
safety hazards, but retains enough flexibility to allow preservation, rehabilitation,
restoration, and reconstruction of Qualified Historical Buildings or Structures. The
CHBC’s standards and regulations are intended to facilitate the rehabilitation or change of
occupancy at qualified buildings or structures so as to preserve their original or restored
elements and features, to encourage energy conservation and a cost effective approach to
preservation, and to provide for reasonable safety from fire, seismic forces or other hazards
for occupants and users of such buildings, structures and properties and to provide
reasonable availability and usability by the physically disabled.
Application of the California State Historical Building Code is subject to approval by the
Community Development Director and the Building Department.
Mills Act Historic Preservation Property Tax Abatement for Historic Landmarks
The Mills Act is State legislation that is administered locally through the City of La Mesa
and the County of San Diego Tax Assessor’s Office. Historic Landmark designation is a
prerequisite for participation in the Mills Act. Participation in the Program provides for a
reduction of property taxes by entering into a ten-year agreement with the City that is
automatically renewable, and that stipulates that all modifications to the property shall be
completed pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code Requirements and consistent with The
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. Mills Act
contracts are binding on all successive owners of the property that they are created for.
Owners of Mills Act participating properties are subject to the provisions stipulated in the
Mills Act contract.
Rehabilitation Loans for Inventory-Listed Properties
Should funds and staffing become available, rehabilitation loans may be made to owners of
Inventory-listed properties. Such loans would be used only for improvements related to
health and safety concerns rather than general improvements. The Historic Preservation
Commission reviews all proposed improvements funded by rehabilitation loans to assure
that maintenance or preservation of the original exterior appearance is a product of the
rehabilitation.

Reduction of Development Review Fees for Inventory-Listed Properties
The City subsidizes a portion of the applicable development review application fees for
work conducted on Inventory-listed and Historic Landmark properties. The reduced fee
is also extended to a portion of the review fees for work proposed on properties located
within historic districts.
Adaptive Reuse of Historic Landmarks
Adaptive Reuse of a designated Historic Landmark occurs through the issuance of a
Conditional Use Permit (CUP), which provides for new uses at a historic building not
permitted under the site’s zoning. Upon approval of the CUP by the Planning
Commission, low traffic volume, non-nuisance type commercial uses, such as professional
offices, specialty retail sales, bed and breakfast inns, specialized restaurants, or apartments
may be established in a residentially zoned area. Adaptive Reuse may occur at properties
originally constructed as residential, commercial, and heavy commercial / light industrial.
Historic single-family properties may be adaptively reused as multiple-family properties
through interior subdivision and associated modifications that are consistent with The
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.
Flexible Parking Standards for Projects at Historic Landmarks
Flexible Parking Standards are utilized in conjunction with an Adaptive Reuse of a Historic
Landmark, allowing its conversion to a new use without having to meet the parking
requirements for the proposed use. The amount of parking required is determined
through the discretionary CUP process.
Density Bonus for Projects at Historic Landmarks
The Density Bonus option provides for inclusion of one additional dwelling unit at projects
where Historic Landmarks are retained and incorporated into multiple-unit residential
zones or in a planned residential community. The Historic Landmark unit is not counted
against the permitted density in the proposed project.
20% Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit
The 20% Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit began in 1976 and is jointly administered by
the National Park Service and the Internal Revenue Service. 20% Federal Rehabilitation
Tax Credits are reviewed for consistency with The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation by the Restoration Architects at the California State Office of Historic
Preservation and the National Park Service. To be eligible to participate in the 20%
Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit, a property must be listed on, or officially determined
eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places, and must be reviewed or
confirmed as eligible by the California State Office of Historic Preservation and the
National Park Service.
The 20% rehabilitation tax credit applies to any project that the Secretary of the Interior
designates a certified rehabilitation of a certified historic structure. The 20% credit is

available for properties rehabilitated for commercial, industrial, agricultural, or rental
residential purposes, but it is not available for properties used exclusively as the owner’s
private residence.
La Mesa properties that are participating in the 20% Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit
process may receive a streamlined permit review process for project aspects relating to
historic fabric if the State and Federal project approval letters are provided to City Staff at
the start of the local project review process.
La Mesa property owners seeking additional information on the 20% Federal
Rehabilitation Tax Credit should contact the California State Office of Historic
Preservation.
10% Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit
The 10% Rehabilitation Tax Credit is available for the rehabilitation of non-historic
buildings placed in service before 1936. The 10% credit applies only to buildings—not to
ships, bridges or other structures. The rehabilitation must be substantial, exceeding either
$5,000 or the adjusted basis of the property; whichever is greater. The property must be
depreciable.
The 10% credit applies only to buildings rehabilitated for non-residential uses. Rental
housing would thus not qualify. Hotels, however, would qualify. They are considered to be
in commercial use, not residential.
A building that was moved after 1935 is ineligible for the 10% Rehabilitation Credit. (A
moved certified historic structure, however, can still be eligible for the 20% credit.) Projects
undertaken for the 10% credit must meet a specific physical test for retention of external
walls and internal structural framework:
    • At least 50% of the building’s external walls existing at the time the rehabilitation
        began must remain in place as external walls at the work’s conclusion, and
    • At least 75% of the building’s existing external walls must remain in place as either
        external or internal walls, and
    • At least 75% of the building’s internal structural framework must remain in place.
The 10% Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit must be claimed on IRS form 3468 for the tax
year in which the rehabilitated building is placed in service. There is no formal review
process for rehabilitations of non-historic buildings. Contact the National Park Service or
the Internal Revenue Service for additional information on the 10% tax credit. IRS form
3468 may be downloaded from the Internal Revenue Service website.

Glossary
Following is a glossary of terms commonly employed in historic preservation planning at
the time of the adoption of this Historic Preservation Element. Some terms are utilized
within this Historic Preservation Element and subsequent associated Appendices issued
under separate cover.
Adaptive Reuse: The reuse of a building or structure, usually for a purpose different from
the original. The term implies that certain structural or design changes have been made to
the building in order for it to function in its new use.
Alteration: Any exterior change or modification in appearance.
Archaeological Site: Property containing archeological deposits or features, usually with site
boundaries defined by the character and location of said deposits or features. An
archaeological site is categorized as either prehistoric (pre-European contact) or historic
(post-European contact).
Building: Anything constructed or erected to serve as a principal shelter for human
occupation or activity.
California Historical Landmarks Program: The California Historical Landmarks program
was established in 1932, when the Director of the Department of Natural Resources
assigned the California State Chamber of Commerce the responsibility to register and mark
buildings of historical interest or landmarks. To be eligible for designation as a Landmark,
a resource must meet at least one of the following criteria.
    • The first, last, only, or most significant of its type in the State or within a large
       geographic region (Northern, Central, or Southern California).
    • Associated with an individual or group having a profound influence on the history of
       California.
    • A prototype of, or an outstanding example of, a period, style, architectural
       movement or construction or is one of the more notable works or the best surviving
       work in a region of a pioneer architect, designer or master builder.
California Historical Resources Information System (CHRIS): A Statewide system for
managing information on the full range of historical resources identified in California.
Specifically, those resources evaluated in historical resource surveys conducted in
accordance with criteria established by the California Office of Historic Preservation
(OHP), formally determined eligible for, or listed in, the National Register of Historic
Places or designated as California Registered Historical Landmarks or California Points of
Historical Interest. CHRIS is a cooperative partnership between the citizens of California,

historic preservation professionals, twelve Information Centers, the CHRIS Hub, and
various agencies.
California Points of Historical Interest Program: The California Points of Historical
Interest program was established in 1965. California Points of Historical Interest are sites,
buildings, features, or events that are of local (City or County) significance and have
anthropological, cultural, military, political, architectural, economic, scientific or technical,
religious, experimental, or other value. To be eligible for designation as a Point of
Historical Interest, a resource must meet at least one of the following criteria.
     • The first, last, only, or most significant of its type within the local geographic region
        (City or County).
     • Associated with an individual or group having a profound influence on the history of
        the local area.
     • A prototype of, or an outstanding example of, a period, style, architectural
        movement or construction or is one of the more notable works or the best surviving
        work in the local region of a pioneer architect, designer or master builder.
California Register of Historical Resources: The California Register of Historical Resources
is a comprehensive listing of California’s historical resources, including those of local, State
and National significance. The “significance” criteria for the California Register are similar
to those used by National Register of Historic Places, which includes resources formally
determined eligible for, or listed in, the National Register of Historic Places.
California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA): Contained within Public
Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq., the Act requires private and public activities not
specifically exempted to be evaluated against the potential for environmental damage,
including effects to historical resources.
California Historical Building Code (CHBC): The California Historical Building Code is
Part 8 of Title 24 (State Building Standards Code) and applies to all qualified historic
structures, districts and sites, designated under Federal, State and local authority. It
provides alternative building regulations for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration or
relocation of structures designated as qualified historic buildings.
Certified Local Government (CLG): The CLG program is a model and cost-effective local,
State, and Federal partnership that promotes historic preservation at the grassroots level.
Through an agreement between the City and County of San Francisco and the California
OHP, the City carries out some of the functions of the National Historic Preservation Act,
as amended. The OHP also provides the City with technical assistance and small matching
grants to aid in the preservation of local resources.

Certificate of Appropriateness: A Certificate issued by the Historic Preservation
Commission approving such plans, specifications, designs, statements of work, and any
other information which is reasonably required to make a decision on any proposed
alteration, restoration, construction, removal, relocation, or demolition, in whole or in part,
of or to a landmark or to an improvement within a historic district.
Context Statement: An organizing structure for interpreting history that groups information
about historic resources that share a common theme, a common geographical area and a
common time period. Context statements are similar to a statement of significance for a
local historic district or the summary statement for a local landmark nomination.
Contributor(y): A classification applied to a site, structure or object within a historic district
signifying that it generally shares, along with most of the other sites, structures or objects in
the historic district, the qualities that give the historic district cultural, historic, architectural
or archaeological significance as embodied by the criteria for designating the historic
district. These resources are of the highest importance in maintaining the character of the
historic district. Typically, contributory resources have been modified very little over time.
Conservation District: Conservation Districts are areas that contain concentrations of
buildings that together create areas of special architectural and aesthetic value but that do
not collectively represent a specific theme or period of significance and are not recognized
as a Historic District due to either lack of importance or lack of integrity.
Cultural Resource: Improvements, buildings, structures, signs, features, sites, places, areas
or other objects of scientific, aesthetic, educational, cultural, architectural, or historical
significance.
Demolition: Damage or destruction to a building or structure that exceeds one-half the
replacement cost.
Design Guidelines: Design Guidelines detail the character-defining features that are unique
to a particular Historical Resource, Historic Landmark, Historic District, or Conservation
District. Design Guidelines are used to evaluate the appropriateness of projects that may
result in alteration, construction, relocation or new construction of a particular Historical
Resource, Historic Landmark, Historic District, or Conservation District. Design
Guidelines are any design standard specified by the City of La Mesa, including but not
limited to the Resource Management Guidelines, The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating,
Restoring, & Reconstructing Historic Buildings, and The Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation & Illustrated Guidelines on Sustainability for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings.

and objects within the built environment, the DPR 523 A and B forms are commonly
utilized. DPR 523A form is the Primary Record and includes space for descriptive
information about a property. The DPR 523B Building, Structure, Object Record (BSO)
includes space for an evaluation of the property under the City of La Mesa Historic
Landmark, California Register of Historical Resources, and National Register of Historic
Places eligibility criteria. For additional information refer to the California State Office of
Historic Preservation’s Instructions for Recording Historical Resources.
Eligible Property: A property that has been documented, researched, and positively
evaluated as having the ability to be designated as a La Mesa Historic Landmark, or listed
on the California Register of Historical Resources, or the National Register of Historic
Places through a survey evaluation. An eligible property is not actually listed or designated,
but has been found meritorious such that it should be considered in a project decision-
making process and should be regarded as a Historical Resource in a CEQA process and
as a Historic Property in a Federal project review process. Nominating authorities and
Federal agency officials commonly request determinations of eligibility for Federal planning
purposes. If a property has been determined eligible by the California State Office of
Historic Preservation or a Federal agency as part of a project review process, that property
is considered to be ‘Officially Determined Eligible.”
Exterior Architectural Appearance: The architectural character and general composition of
the exterior of a structure visible from a public street or way, including, but not limited to,
the kind, color and texture of the building material and the type, including, but not limited
to, windows, doors, light fixtures, trim and signs.
Heritage: A collective, and sometimes intangible, representation of stories, events, people,
and environments of the past and present that form the identity and sense of a specific
place or group.
Heritage Tourism: The function of offering and experiencing, as an economic stimulant
and educational program, the places and activities that authentically represent the stories,
events, people, and environments of the past and present, including built environment,
cultural, and natural aspects.
Historical Resource: Any building, area, place, record or manuscript, site, structure, street
furniture, monuments, object, district, or landscape evaluated as historically or
archaeologically significant, or is significant in architectural, engineering, scientific,
economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural history of La Mesa,
the State of California or the nation. Any property found eligible for designation or
designated as a La Mesa Historic Landmark or Historic District. Any property eligible for
listing or listed on the California Register of Historical Resources or the National Register
of Historic Places. The term Historical Resource is referenced in the statutes of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the associated CEQA Guidelines.

Historical Resource Survey: The process of systematically identifying, photographing,
documenting, researching, and evaluating archeological or historical resources within a
defined geographic area or setting. Historical Resources Surveys may be completed at a
Reconnaissance Level or at an Intensive Level. The Historical Resource Survey may also
be referred to as a Historical Resource Inventory or the Inventory.
Historic Character: The appearance, features, and materials or fabric that constitute,
comprise, or contribute to how a property is perceived.
Historic Context: A theme under which a property may be identified as significant.
Historic District: A concentration of historic buildings, structures, sites or objects that are
related through history, architecture or cultural association and possess a high level of
integrity. Historic districts are commonly defined by precise geographic boundaries or by a
specific theme that associates all contributing properties within.
Historic-era: The period of time that is at least 50 years earlier than the present year.
Properties are considered to achieve or reach the historic-era when they become 50 years
of age, the threshold to be considered for significance and eligibility under the National
Register of Historic Places.
Historic Fabric: The particular materials, ornamentation, stylistic features, and architectural
components of a property or Historic District that date to and indicate the period of
significance. Historic fabric should be retained to the greatest extent possible as part of a
Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, or Reconstruction process.
Historic Landmark: A property that has been officially designated as significant in La Mesa
history by the City Council pursuant to Chapter 25 of the Municipal Code.
Historic Preservation Commission: The Mayor-Appointed decision-making body in
La Mesa that advises on historic preservation concerns.
Integrity: Integrity is the authenticity of physical characteristics from which properties
obtain their significance. Integrity is the composite of seven qualities: location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association. When properties retain integrity,
they are able to physically convey their identified association and subsequent significance
and eligibility for designation as a La Mesa Historic Landmark, or for inclusion on the
California Register of Historical Resources or the National Register of Historic Places.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA): Contained within 42 United States
Code (U.S.C.) 4321- 4347, NEPA established a review and assessment process for
Federally funded or license projects with the potential to render adverse environmental
impacts, including historic properties.

National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA): The National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (16 U.S.C. 470-470t as amended) established the National Register of Historic Places
program and extended National Historic Preservation Programs to properties of State and
local significance.
National Register of Historic Places: The Nation’s official Inventory of buildings,
structures, objects, sites and historic districts that are significant in American history,
architectural, archeology and culture, maintained by the United States Secretary of Interior
under the authority of the Historic Sites Act of 1935 and the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (amended) (16 U.S.C. 470-470+, 36. C.F.R. Sections 60, 63).
National Register Eligibility / Significance Criteria: The Federally established standards for
evaluating the eligibility of properties for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places.
Non-contributing: A classification applied to a site, structure or object within a historic
district indicating that it is not representative of the qualities that give the historic district
cultural, historic, architectural or archaeological significance as embodied by the criteria for
designating the historic district. Properties constructed after the district’s period of
significance, or dating from the district’s period of significance but have undergone
significant alterations and lack integrity, are typically found to be non-contributing.
Object: Objects are constructions primarily artistic in nature of relatively small in scale and
simply constructed. An object is typically associated with a specific setting or environment,
such as a fountain or boundary marker.
OHP: The California State Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) is the governmental
agency primarily responsible for the State-wide administration of the Historic Preservation
Program in California. The mission of the Office of Historic Preservation and the State
Historical Resources Commission, in partnership with the people of California and
governmental agencies, is to “preserve and enhance California's irreplaceable historic
heritage as a matter of public interest so that its vital legacy of cultural, educational,
recreational, aesthetic, economic, social, and environmental benefits will be maintained
and enriched for present and future generations.”
Ordinary Maintenance: Acts of maintenance or repair that do not include a change in the
design, material or outer appearance of a resource, including repainting, replacement of
materials or windows of the same scale, texture and color.
Preservation: The act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing
form, integrity, and materials of a historic property. Work, including preliminary measures
to protect and stabilize the property, generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and
repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new
construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however,

the limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and
other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a
preservation project.
Preservation Planning: A series of activities through which goals, priorities and strategies for
identification, evaluation, registration and protection of historic properties are developed,
set forth and carried out.
Reconstruction: The act or process of depicting, by means of new construction, the form,
features, and detailing of a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure, or object for
the purpose of replicating its appearance at a specific period of time and in its historic
location.
Rehabilitation: The act or process of making possible a compatible use for a property
through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving those portions or features which
convey its historical, cultural, or architectural values.
Restoration: The act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and character of
a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features
from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration
period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a
restoration project.
Sense of Place: The term applied to the feeling, legacy, and memory that people associate
with tangible and intangible aspects of a specific location. Generally, a property, or
grouping of properties, that retains integrity would also convey or evoke a sense of place,
however, sense of place is not a technical term and is not a threshold or indicator of
significance or eligibility in historic preservation. A location may offer or retain a sense of
place and may still be found not-significant or ineligible in an evaluation process, but may
still be considered meritorious and important to the greater urban design, appearance,
development patterns, and interaction of a community. Erosion of sense of place is
generally thought to contribute to a loss of place, and therefore a loss of memory, direction,
and perception of what once was.
Secretary of Interior’s Standards: The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards (The Standards)
are neither technical nor prescriptive, but are intended to promote responsible
preservation practices that help protect our Nation's irreplaceable cultural resources. For
example, they cannot, in and of themselves, be used to make essential decisions about
which features of the historic building should be saved and which can be changed. But
once a treatment is selected, the Standards provide philosophical consistency to the work.
The four treatment approaches are Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction. Choosing the most appropriate treatment for a building requires careful
decision-making about a building's historical significance, as well as taking into account a

number of other considerations including relative importance in history, physical
condition, proposed use, and mandated code requirements. Use of and compliance with
The Standards is referenced in CEQA, NHPA, and locally in the La Mesa project review
process.
Significant: Having particularly important associations within the contexts of architecture,
history, and culture.
Site: The location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a
building or structure, whether standing, ruined or vanished, where the location itself
possesses historic, cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of the existing
structure.
Social History: The branch or study of history that is focused on the history of ordinary
people, their experiences, and strategies for coping with life. A term commonly applied to
the intangible aspects of historic preservation, wherein a property may not appear to be
architecturally meritorious or significant and not associated with a historical figure of repute
or having a high-profile, but is still found to be associated with an important component of
heritage relating to design or construction methods, events, or activities relating to a person
or group in daily society.
Stabilization: The act or process of applying measures designed to reestablish a weather
resistant enclosure and the structural stability of an unsafe or deteriorated property while
maintaining the essential form as it exists at present.
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO): Appointed by the Governor, under Public
Resources Code (Section 5020.6), the SHPO serves as the Chief Administrative Officer of
the Office of Historic Preservation and Executive Secretary of the State Historical
Resources Commission and administers State and Federally mandated Historic
Preservation Programs under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, Section 101
(b) (3) as amended.
Structure: Anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires, directly or indirectly,
a permanent location on or in the ground, including without limitation to bridges, buildings
garages, fences, gazebos, signs, street paving, utility meters, antennas, satellite sending or
receiving dishes, swimming pools, walks, walls, steps, and sidewalks. Structures are not
erected for human occupation.

Vision
A City that is a quiet and safe place to live, work, play or
go to school.                                                   Noise Goal:
                                                                Goal 1: A community where noise
Introduction                                                    and the effects of noise are minimized.
The quality of life in a city can be affected by the level of
noise experienced by those who live, work, and recreate
there. The Noise Element of the City’s General Plan is
intended to identify noise-sensitive land uses and noise sources, define areas of noise
impacts, establish policies and programs to protect the community from excessive noise,
and reduce negative impacts from those noise sources.
State guidelines stipulate the content of a General Plan Noise Element. Section 65302(f) of
the California Government Code states that a noise element should be prepared according
to guidelines established by the Department of Health Services. At a minimum, the
California Government Code requires an element to analyze noise levels for the following:
    •   Highways and freeways;
    •   Primary arterial and major local streets;
    •   Passenger and freight railroad operations and ground transit systems;
    •   Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, military airport operations, aircraft
        overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance
        functions related to airport operation;
    •   Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards;
        and
    •   Other ground sources identified by the local agencies as contributing to the
        community noise environment.
                                                                       Noise Element | NS-1

Purpose
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. The purpose of the Noise Element is to
limit the exposure of the community to excessive noise levels. Aircraft, automobiles,
trucks, railroads, construction equipment, factories and even home appliances contribute
to the noise environment of modern life. Motor vehicles are typically the most pervasive
contributors to urban noise. Other major noise sources common in the urban and
suburban environments are power gardening equipment, amplified music, power tools and
air conditioners.
The Noise Element of the General
Plan provides a mechanism for
including noise considerations in
the planning process. The Noise
Element provides goals, objectives
and policies to maintain areas
deemed currently acceptable in
terms of noise exposure, and
mitigate undesirable levels of noise
on existing sensitive land uses to
protect the health and well-being of                    Busy Intersection in La Mesa
people living, working and recreating in the City.
A primary function of the Noise Element is the quantification of the community noise
environment in terms of noise exposure contours for future transportation activities. The
contours serve as guidelines to ensure that new development and redevelopment are
protected from unwarranted noise and do not contribute to unacceptable levels of noise
within the community.
Organization and Content
The Noise Element identifies the existing and future noise environment within the City of
La Mesa. It presents the regulatory setting pertaining to noise, and establishes Goals,
Objectives, and [Policies to control and mitigate noise. A Noise Plan is included in this
Element to outline how the City will address noise issues related to land use compatibility
and how land use planning will address noise abatement.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Noise Element is directly related to other Elements of this General Plan, including the
Circulation, Conservation, Health and Wellness, Housing, Land Use and Urban Design,
Open Space, and Safety Elements. It covers a variety of issues such as the impact of noise
from vehicular and other traffic (Circulation Element); the importance of a quiet noise
environment to the health, welfare and livability of the City (Health and Wellness
Element); the impact of noise on various land uses and the effect of noise on residential

Regulatory Setting
The Federal Government and the State of California recognize the relationship between
noise and noise-sensitive land uses, and have developed standards and regulations
concerning noise and land use compatibility. The following have been adopted by Federal
and State agencies and the City of La Mesa, which pertain to the Noise Element and its
implementation:
Federal
Noise Control Act of 1972 (PL 92-574)
The Noise Control Act established a National policy “to promote an environment for all
Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their public health and welfare.” The Act
provides for a division of powers between the Federal, State and local governments, in
which the primary Federal responsibility is for noise source emission control, with the
States and other agencies retaining the rights to control noise sources and the level of noise
within their communities and jurisdiction. The Noise Control Act was supplemented by
the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 (PL 95-609).
                                                                                          Noise Element | NS-3

State of California
Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (Public Utilities Code, §21670, et seq.)
The Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCPs) promote compatibility between
public-use and military airports and the land uses that surround them to the extent that
these areas are not already devoted to incompatible land uses. The City is required to
modify its land use plans and ordinances to be consistent with the ALUCPs or to take steps
to overrule the Airport Land Use Commission.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
CEQA considers exposure to excessive noise an environmental impact. Implementation of
CEQA ensures that during the decision-making stage of development, City officials and the
public will be informed of any potentially excessive noise levels and available mitigation
measures to reduce them to acceptable levels.
California Noise Insulation Standards (California Code of Regulations, Title 24)
Title 24 establishes an Interior Noise Standard of 45 dBA CNEL for multiple-unit and
hotel/motel structures. Acoustical studies must be prepared for proposed multiple-unit
residential and hotel/motel structures within the CNEL noise contours of 60 dBA or
greater. The studies must demonstrate that the design of the building will reduce interior
noise in habitable rooms to 45 dBA CNEL or lower.
California Airport Noise Standards (California Code of Regulations, Title 21)
Division 2.5, Chapter 6, Section 5012 of Title 21 establishes that 65 dBA CNEL is the
acceptable level of aircraft noise for persons living near an airport.
Caltrans Project Development Procedures Manual (Section 2 of Chapter 30: Highway
Traffic Noise Abatement) and 23 CFR 772
These documents specify the Noise Abatement Criteria (NAC) for noise-sensitive land
uses. These criteria are presented in Table NS-2. The NAC are applicable to new highways
and changes to the horizontal or vertical alignment of existing highways and are required
for Caltrans and local agency projects that receive Federal funding or require Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) approval action.

The table on the following page provides a guideline for land use compatibility at various
noise levels (Figure NS-1). The compatibility guidelines are used in conjunction with the
future noise exposure contours to identify projects or activities which may require special
treatment to minimize noise exposure. This exhibit references generic land use categories
identified by the State of California and; as such, these categories should be interpreted as
to their applicability to City of La Mesa land use categories identified in the General Plan.

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                              2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Existing Noise Conditions
The City of La Mesa utilizes the State of California Land Use Compatibility Guidelines
(Figure NS-1) to identify land uses or activities that may require special treatment to
minimize noise exposure. The Guidelines are the primary tool that allows the City to
ensure integrated planning compatibility between land
uses and indoor and outdoor noise.
The goal for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential
areas is a CNEL of 60 dBA. This level is a requirement
for the design and location of future development and a
goal for the reduction of noise in existing development.
However, 60 dBA CNEL is a goal that cannot necessarily
be reached in all residential areas within the realm of
economic or aesthetic feasibility. The goal is applied
where outdoor use is a major consideration (e.g.,
backyards in single-family housing developments,
recreation areas in multi-family housing projects).
                                                                   Noise Monitoring Equipment
The indoor noise level, as required by the State of
California Noise Insulation Standards, must not exceed 45 dBA CNEL in multi-family
dwellings. This indoor standard may also be applied as the maximum acceptable indoor
noise level in single-family homes.
The La Mesa Municipal Code (Chapter 10.80) identifies acceptable criteria for various
noise sources. Noise levels are typically regulated across property boundaries. The noise
level to be observed is based on the zone applicable to the property adjoining that on which
the noise is generated. Noise sources regulated by the Municipal Code include outdoor
construction or repair activity, machinery, pumps, fans, air conditioning systems, radios,
musical instruments and phonographs.
Issues
The primary source of noise in the City is vehicular traffic, including automobiles, trucks,
buses and motorcycles. Most of this traffic is concentrated on the freeways that cross
through the City. Figure NS-2, the 2030 Projected Noise Contour Map, demonstrates the
extent to which freeway noise affects surrounding areas. Other sources of noise include the
San Diego & Imperial Valley (SDIV) Railroad freight line, the MTS San Diego Trolley
light rail line, periodic aircraft overflights from Gillespie Field and the Sharp Grossmont
Hospital heliport, industrial manufacturing , commercial activity, and construction.

Vehicular Traffic
Major      east-west    roadways
include I-8, SR-94, Fletcher
Parkway, El Cajon Boulevard,
University       Avenue,     and
La Mesa Boulevard. Major
north-south roadways include
SR-125,      Baltimore Drive,
Jackson Drive, Spring Street,                 Traffic is the biggest source of noise in La Mesa.
70th Street and Lake Murray
Boulevard. The level of vehicular traffic noise varies with many factors, including traffic
volume, vehicle mix (truck percentage), traffic speed, and distance from the roadway.
Figure NS-2 shows the projected location of the 60 dBA CNEL vehicular traffic noise
contour in the year 2030.
Sound barriers are commonly used to dampen traffic noise. In 1973-74 State and Federal
agencies adopted formal policies and criteria for construction of sound walls. Caltrans
conducts acoustical analyses and builds sound walls where necessary with new freeway and
freeway widening projects. As a result, sound walls have been installed along portions of
I- 8, SR 94, and SR 125 in La Mesa.
The City ensures that developers resolve significant noise impacts as a part of development
review for new projects. In addition, the City pursues funding opportunities, as available,
for highway sound wall projects. In 2002, La Mesa received a grant from SANDAG to
erect a barrier along a stretch of State Route 94 near Massachusetts Avenue. Caltrans
constructed the improvements on behalf of the City.
Railroads
The SDIV Railroad freight
trains and the Orange Line
and Green Line of the MTS
Trolley currently operate in
the City. For safety reasons,
the freight trains blow
whistles and the trolleys honk
horns at each major road
crossing. This may be
annoying        for     nearby
residents. A freight train
whistle generates a maximum
noise level (Lmax) of                      San Diego Trolley at La Mesa Boulevard Station
approximately 105 dBA at
100 feet from the engine. A trolley horn generates less noise. In addition, crossing bells that

are installed at each at-grade street crossing generate noise. The approximate noise level
generated by railroad operations, at 50 feet from the center of the nearest track, is 59 dBA
CNEL for freight trains and 64 dBA CNEL for trolleys. The source for these estimates is
the La Mesa General Plan Update Noise Technical Report, Kimley-Horn 2010 based on
the Federal Transit Administration railroad noise prediction methodology.
Aircraft
Sharp Grossmont Hospital operates the only heliport in the City of La Mesa. Five to ten
flights are normally flown to the hospital every month, typically during standard business
hours. This relatively low number of flights is not enough to generate noise levels above 60
dBA CNEL.
Stationary Noise Sources
Stationary noise sources are noise sources in the community at a “fixed” location.
Stationary noise sources include Industrial and Commercial Land Uses such as
manufacturing plants, processing plants, motorcycle parks, automobile repair, and power
generators. Ancillary equipment that generates noise includes heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning equipment, and emergency generators. The noise level associated with these
sources varies with the type of noise source and the distance from the noise source. There
are various stationary noise sources throughout the City. Industrial noise sources are
located in the area west of Jackson Drive on Center Drive, Commercial Street and
Hercules Street; however, there are no noise-sensitive land uses in this area to be impacted
by noise from industrial activities.
Noise Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive Receptors are land uses associated with indoor and/or outdoor activities
that may be subject to stress and/or significant interference from
noise, such as residential dwellings, transient lodging,
dormitories, hospitals, educational facilities, and libraries.
Industrial and Commercial Land Uses are generally not
considered sensitive to noise. Occupied habitat for threatened
and endangered wildlife species is also considered noise-
sensitive.
Noise-sensitive Receptors within the City include single- and
multi-family residences, schools, parks, libraries, hospitals,
churches, and open space. The Land Use Plan found in the Example of “Nuisance Noise”
Land Use and Urban Design Element depicts the location and distribution of various land
use types in the City.

Implementation
Land Use Compatibility and Noise
The Land Use Compatibility Guidelines shown in Figure NS-1 are used in conjunction
with the future noise exposure contours to identify projects or activities which may require
special treatment to minimize noise exposure. This exhibit references generic land use
categories identified by the State of California; as such, these categories should be
interpreted as to their applicability to City of La Mesa land use categories identified in the
General Plan.
Land Use Planning to Address Noise
The City will take steps to ensure that future develop minimizes exposure to excessive
noise, with special emphasis on protecting residential neighborhoods from intrusive noise.
The land use changes expected over the life of this Plan are located in specific targeted
areas, and noise associated with these changes should be abated and mitigated to the extent
reasonable.
Noise generating uses are regulated by the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Performance
entertainment and public assembly uses require a Conditional Use Permit so that potential
noise and traffic impacts can be carefully considered. Industrial and Commercial uses are
generally required to be enclosed within structures. Mechanical equipment such as HVAC
condensers require screening to attenuate noise. These land use policies ensure that
surrounding areas are not subjected to an unreasonable amount of noise.
Effective noise abatement measures are unique for each situation. The physical techniques
to mitigate noise vary in their
noise reduction capabilities.
Factors to consider when
evaluating      potential   noise
mitigation include: the amount
of noise reduction desired, the
location      where       physical
techniques would be most
effective, and aesthetics. The
following measures can be used to mitigate noise impacts:
Site Planning
Proper site planning to reduce noise impacts should be considered for all noise-sensitive
developments. Buildings can be oriented on a site in such a way as to exploit the site’s
noise attenuating features. By consideration of a site’s natural topography, size and shape, it
is often possible to reduce, and possibly eliminate, noise impacts from vehicular traffic and
railroads. Site planning techniques include the following:
                                                                      Noise Element | NS-13

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                         2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
     •   Increasing the distance from the noise source to sensitive receptors by creation of
         setbacks;
     •   Placing non-noise sensitive uses such as parking lots and utility areas between the
         noise source and receiver; and
     •   Orienting usable outdoor living space such as balconies, patios, and child play areas
         away from roadways.
Barriers
Noise barriers such as walls and earthen berms are commonly used to mitigate noise from
ground transportation, commercial and industrial sources. Noise barriers can be used to
reduce the noise level both outdoors and indoors. The effectiveness of a barrier depends
upon factors such as the relative height of the barrier relative to the line-of-sight from the
source to the receiver, the distance from the barrier to the source and to the receiver, and
the reflections of sound. To be effective, a barrier must block the line-of-sight from the
source to the receiver. A barrier must be of solid construction (i.e., masonry) without holes
or gaps and be long enough to prevent sound from passing around the ends. A properly
designed noise barrier can reduce noise as much as 15 decibels. A site-specific acoustical
analysis is required to determine the proper height and placement of a barrier.
A row of houses or other buildings may act as a barrier. A row of one- or two-story houses
(with about 30% open gaps) provides a sound attenuation of approximately 3 to 5 decibels;
two rows of houses, 6 to 10 decibels; and three or more rows of houses, 10 to 12 decibels.
Building Design
The placement of a building on its site, arrangement of rooms, and location of doors and
windows all have a bearing on interior noise control. The sides of a building that face a
roadway or other noise source should house those activities that can tolerate the greatest
amount of noise. Noise sensitive areas include bedrooms, living rooms and dens. Less
noise sensitive areas may include kitchens and bathrooms. Hallways, closets and storage
rooms are generally not noise sensitive.
Indoor noise levels are controlled by the noise reduction characteristics of the building
shell. Doors and windows typically allow the greatest amount of noise leakage in a building
and careful consideration should be given to their placement. By limiting the number and
size of these openings on the sides of the building exposed to noise, interior noise levels
will be reduced.
An interior noise analysis will be required for new residential development located in areas
where future noise levels would exceed 60 dBA CNEL. The interior noise analysis should
evaluate the proposed building shell (exterior wall, windows, and doors) to ensure that
interior noise levels will not exceed 45 dBA CNEL. The analysis should be performed
prior to obtaining a building permit.

Glossary
The terms and definitions in this glossary are commonly found in environmental noise
literature.
Ambient Noise: All-encompassing noise at a given place and time. This is usually a
composite of sounds from all sources near and far, including any specific sources of
interest.
At-grade: On the same level.
A-Weighted Level: The sound level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using
the A-weighting filter network. The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very
high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response of the human
ear and gives good correlation with subjective reactions to noise.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The average equivalent A-weighted sound
level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the
evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in
the night from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
Day-Night Sound Level (Ldn): The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-
hour day, obtained after the addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after 10:00
p.m. and before 7:00 a.m. (Note: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure
averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq represents the equivalent energy noise
exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.)
Decibel (dB): A unit of measurement describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times
the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the
reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): The energy-averaged A-weighted sound level during a
measured time interval. It is equal to the level of a continuous steady sound containing the
same total acoustical energy over the averaging time period as the actual time-varying
sound.
Frequency: The number of oscillations per second of a periodic wave sound and of a
vibrating solid, expressed in units of hertz, formerly cycles per second (cps). 1 Hz = 1 cps =
1 oscillation per second.
Heavy Truck: A vehicle type for the purpose of noise prediction modeling defined as all
vehicles with three or more axles designed for transportation of cargo. Generally, the gross
weight is more than 26,500 pounds.
Hertz: Unit of frequency, formerly called cycles per second. 1 Hz = 1 cps.
Maximum Sound Level (Lmax): Represents the root-mean-square (RMS) maximum noise
level obtained during the measurement interval.

Medium Truck: A vehicle classification for the purpose of noise prediction modeling,
defined as all vehicles with two axles and six wheels designed for transportation of cargo.
Generally, the gross weight is more than 10,000 pounds and less than 26,500 pounds.
Minimum Sound level (Lmin): Represents the root-mean-square minimum noise level
obtained during the measurement interval. The Lmin value obtained for a particular
monitoring location is often called the “acoustic floor” for that location.
Noise Barrier: A generic term for any feature that blocks or diminishes sound in its path
from the source to receiver. Although the term can technically refer to any feature,
manmade or natural, the two most common features included in noise barriers are sound
walls and earth berms.
Noise Contours: Lines drawn about a noise source indicating equal levels of noise
exposure.
Noise Sensitive Land Use: Land uses associated with indoor and/or outdoor activities that
may be subject to stress and/or significant interference from noise, such as residential
dwellings, transient lodging, dormitories, hospitals, educational facilities, public assembly
facilities, amphitheatres, congregate care facilities, childcare facilities, and libraries.
Percentile Noise Limit (Ln): Characterizes the time-varying character of environmental
noise by identifying the noise level exceeded n% of the time. For example, the statistical
noise descriptors L10, L50, and L90 are the noise levels exceeded during 10, 50, and 90
percent of a stated time, respectively. Sound levels associated with L10 typically describe
transient or short-term events, whereas levels associated with L90 describe the steady-state
(or most prevalent) noise conditions.
Receiver/Receptor: A stationary far-field position at which noise or vibration levels are
specified.
Root Mean Square (RMS): The square root of the mean-square value of an oscillating
waveform, where the mean-square value is obtained by squaring the value of amplitudes at
each instant of time and then averaging these values over the sample time.
Single Event Level (SEL): The summation of the A-weighted sound energy at a particular
location over the true duration of a noise event normalized to a duration of one second.
The true duration is defined as the amount of time the noise event exceeds background
levels. For events lasting more than one second, SEL does not directly represent the sound
level heard at any given time, but rather provides a measure of the net impact of the entire
acoustic event. SEL combines an event’s overall sound level along with its duration. SEL
provides a comprehensive way to describe noise events for use in modeling and comparing
noise environments.
Sound: A physical disturbance in a medium that is capable of being detected by the human
ear.

Purpose
A Safety Element is one of seven elements mandated by State law for inclusion in the
General Plan. Its purpose is to minimize the impact on the community from hazardous
conditions and emergency situations. Reducing the risk of death, injury, property damage,
and economic and social dislocation resulting from fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides,
                                                                          Safety Element | SE-1

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                         2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
and other hazards helps to ensure the overall health and safety of La Mesa’s citizens. The
Safety Element follows guidelines in the State Government Code, Sections 65302(g) and
65302.5, as well as Public Resources Code Sections 4102, 4125, 4128.5 and 2699.
Hazard Mitigation Plan
The Safety Element also acknowledges and reinforces the County of San Diego’s Multi-
jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. This county-wide plan identifies risks and ways to
minimize damage caused by natural and manmade disasters. It is a comprehensive
resource tool that serves to enhance public awareness, create a decision tool for
management, promote compliance with State and Federal program requirements, enhance
local policies for hazard mitigation capability, and provide inter-jurisdictional coordination.
San Diego County is one of the first in the State to tackle this planning effort on a region-
wide basis, and the County's 2004 Plan has received national recognition in the form of an
achievement award from the National Association of Counties organization.
Organization and Content
The Safety Element identifies existing local conditions within the community relative to
specific hazards. Existing conditions are described along with the goals and policies
established by the City to minimize the risks associated with these conditions. Existing
conditions include:
   •    Flood Hazards: The Alvarado, Chollas, and Spring Valley Creeks flow through and
        around La Mesa. Their flows have been mapped for the 100 year flood. Areas
        within the 100 year flood plain of these creeks have levels of protection which vary
        from none to complete.
   •    Seismic Hazards: La Mesa is subject to seismic activity from various fault systems
        located within San Diego County. The Uniform Building Code has placed La Mesa
        in Zone 4 for purposes of determining the structural requirements of buildings for
        earthquake safety.
   •    Landslides: Large portions of La Mesa are underlaid by sedimentary rock. This rock
        type is inherently susceptible to slope failure.
   •    Fire Hazards: Open, undeveloped canyons pose the biggest threat to fire safety in
        La Mesa.
   •    Hazardous Materials: Underground storage tanks, medical waste, and manufacturing
        chemicals are among potential sources of hazard in La Mesa.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Safety Element is directly related to those General Plan Elements that address the
health and welfare of La Mesa residents. These include the Land Use and Urban Design
Element, Conservation and Open Space Element, Public Services and Facilities Element,
and Health and Wellness Element. Each contains goals and policies designed to ensure
protection from hazardous conditions.
The relationship between the Safety Element and other General Plan Elements is tabulated

Flood Hazard
Comprehensive management of flood prone areas can reduce or even eliminate the threat
to public safety and property. Flood protection strategies range from structural control
facilities confining floodwater to a channel, to land use regulations, which limit
development in flood hazard areas. Flood management programs respond to local flood
hazards while utilizing cost effective strategies appropriate to the magnitude of the existing
problem.
Since the 1970s, the Federal Flood Insurance Program has adopted the 100-year flood as
an appropriate balance between inadequate and excessive flood hazard protection. The
result has been that the 100-year flood has become a national standard for flood protection
planning. Local agencies agree, as a condition of participation in the Flood Insurance
Program, to use the 100-year flood for land use and facilities planning in flood impacted
areas. The Department of Water Resources’ Division of Flood Management maintains
floodplain management and flood control information, including floodplain maps where
available.

The 100-year flood is the runoff from a storm with an expected occurrence rate of 1% in
any year. This does not imply that no greater flood could ever occur or that such a flood
could not happen more than once in 100 years, only that in any year, the chances are 1 in
100 that a flood of this degree of severity could occur. Analysis of drainage basin size,
slope, and type of land cover determine the amount of runoff resulting from precipitation
totals. Flood Hazard Areas for La Mesa are shown on Figure SE-1.
Drainage Patterns
Unlike other parts of the United States which cope with an annual spring runoff, in
San Diego County storm runoff is the primary source of flood hazard. Runoff from each
storm episode increases relative to total precipitation. Other factors influencing the
amount of runoff include soil type, soil saturation, land cover, and slope of the drainage
basin. Duration of the storm episode also influences runoff. The same measure of rainfall
can be a gentle shower or the 100-year flood depending on whether it falls over the course
of the day or all in an hour.
All watercourses in La Mesa are tributary to larger regional drainage systems. Dry most of
the year, during storm episodes they fill quickly with water, resulting in localized temporary
flooding conditions. The storm runoff and drainage facility needs for La Mesa’s principal
drainage channels, Alvarado Creek, Chollas Creek and Spring Valley Creek, are
summarized below.
Alvarado Creek
Alvarado Creek runs parallel
to and south of Fletcher
Parkway. Most of the area
north of Interstate-8 is in the
Alvarado Creek drainage
basin. Alvarado Creek joins
the San Diego River near the
stadium in Mission Valley.
In 1974, the County of
San Diego      mapped        the
inundation area of the 100-
year flood for the Alvarado                Alvarado Creek near the Grossmont Transit Center.
Creek. Flood hazard and lack of flood control facilities are the primary causes of the
underdeveloped and blighted conditions evidenced in this area in the past. Storm drainage
improvements funded by the Alvarado Creek Redevelopment Project Area in 1998
provide flood control along a significant portion of Alvarado Creek.

Chollas Creek
A branch of Chollas Creek runs parallel and south of University Avenue. The drainage
basin includes the area south of El Cajon Boulevard, west of Downtown and north of the
ridgeline of Eastridge. Chollas Creek drains into San Diego Bay near the 32nd Street
Naval Station.
Flooding of low-lying intersections along University Avenue during periods of heavy rainfall
is a traffic safety hazard. Inadequate and undersized storm drains are responsible. Unlike
Alvarado Creek, there is no funding mechanism to build the infrastructure needed to
alleviate flood hazards along Chollas Creek.
Spring Valley Creek
A branch of Spring Valley Creek flows off the west slope of Mount Helix, along Bancroft
Drive. Spring Valley Creek drains Mount Helix, Casa de Oro and Spring Valley and flows
into the Sweetwater Reservoir.
Existing flood control improvements include a cobblestone-lined drainage channel dating
back to the 1930s. Undergrounding of the drainage channel has occurred in some
locations, the result of more recent development activities.
Response to Flood Hazards
Flood hazards in La Mesa are primarily the result of a lack of adequate storm drain
facilities. During the 1950s and 1960s, areas developed without benefit of the
requirements for the level of drainage improvements that are in effect today. As a result,
flood hazard mitigation planning must retrofit flood control facilities into a built
environment.
Response to flood hazard takes two basic forms. In areas where there are substantial
existing improvements, construction of flood protective infrastructure is necessary.
Structural flood control measures include floodwater storage systems such as dams,
reservoirs and retention basins as well as channel improvements. Nonstructural measures
include zoning and subdivision regulations, exclusion of uses in the floodway and building
code requirements. In undeveloped areas, land use regulations, which steer development
away from flood impacted areas, are more cost effective.
Existing development is at risk throughout all the flood-impacted areas in La Mesa. Along
the Alvarado Creek commercial development and portions of the trailer park south of
Alvarado Road are at risk. Traffic hazard on Interstate-8 could result from flooding of
Alvarado Creek. A mix of businesses and residential uses on University Avenue are
affected by flooding within the Chollas Creek basin. Single-family residential uses as well as

Bancroft Drive and access to Highway 125 are located in the flood hazard area of Spring
Valley Creek.
Flood hazard areas are identified on the General Plan and Zoning maps. The map in
Figure SE-1 generally shows areas where potential flooding could occur in La Mesa.
Development of property within the "F" overlay zone designation must adhere to flood
control regulations. All new development is required to be elevated above the level of the
100-year flood. New development, or substantial improvement of existing structures,
requires construction of flood protection improvements. If actual construction of flood
improvements is not practical, a bond must be posted to guarantee future construction.
Recent construction of flood control facilities along Alvarado Creek is the result of
compliance with flood control regulations affecting new development.                   Future
redevelopment along Alvarado Creek will provide additional flood control improvements.
Within the Chollas and Spring Valley Creek drainage basins there is less opportunity for
funding of flood control facilities through new development. The established land use
pattern leaves little land available for new construction or redevelopment. A program for
funding of flood control facilities in the Chollas and Spring Valley Creek basins could take
the form of a basin-wide or City-wide drainage improvement assessment district. An
advantage of a basin-wide or City-wide approach is that contributory as well as impacted
property owners share equally is the cost of the solution to flood hazard problems. While
specific property owners would benefit from the elimination of hazard, the community
would also benefit from more efficient utilization of property and increased property value.
Seismic Hazard
Living with earthquake hazards is a fact of life in California. In response, the State
Legislature has enacted legislation to reduce the degree of earthquake hazard. For example,
the Field Act, enacted as a result of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, addresses the safety
of public school buildings. Pre-Field Act schools throughout the State have been phased
out or replaced as a result of this legislation.
Other legislation targets those areas with known hazard from identified faults. The
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act of 1972 requires identification by the State
Geologist of active fault traces within California cities and counties. Along the traces of
active faults, the Alquist-Priolo Act mandates the adoption of regulations designed to
mitigate fault hazard.
Seismic hazard is not, however, confined only to those areas with identified faults. Effects
of earthquakes are experienced miles from the active fault. In consideration of this, State
Law directs all cities and counties to address seismic safety within the Safety Element of the
local General Plan.
                                                                        Safety Element | SE-7

Local Conditions
Several major active faults pass through the Southern California region. They are parallel,
trend in a northwest/southeast direction, and display lateral or sideways movement.
Although the San Andreas Fault is the most notorious, all the lesser-known faults are
capable of producing damaging earthquakes. The degree of damage, experienced region-
wide, would depend on the strength of the earthquake as well as location of the epicenter.
Figure SE-2 shows a map of the region’s earthquake faults.
The following section describes the regional fault patterns. Table SE-2 provides a simple
comparison of the Richter scale magnitudes with the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale as a
means of describing the effects from earthquakes.

San Andreas
Over 650 miles long, the San Andreas Fault runs northwest from the Gulf of California to
north of San Francisco Bay. The fault trace in this region runs along the east side of the
Salton Sea. The San Andreas Fault is the most studied, as well as the most active, fault in
California. Geologists have identified lateral (sideways) movement of hundreds of miles.
The San Andreas Fault was the source of two large earthquakes in Northern California, in
1906 a magnitude 8.3 and in 1989 a magnitude 7.1 on the Richter Scale occurred. In
Southern California, the Desert Hot Springs earthquake in 1948, measuring magnitude 6.5,
was centered on the San Andreas. Numerous smaller earthquakes have occurred on this
fault. Maximum magnitude of future earthquakes centered on the segments of the San
Andreas in Southern California could range from magnitude 7.3 to 8.2. A magnitude 8
earthquake on the southern segment of the San Andreas could produce Mercalli intensities
of VII to IX in eastern San Diego County and VI to VII in the coastal zone.
San Jacinto Fault
The San Jacinto Fault is parallel to and west of the San Andreas. Stretching 125 miles
from the Imperial Valley to San Bernardino, the San Jacinto Fault cuts diagonally across
the northeast corner of San Diego County. Between 1899 and 1979 there have been eight
earthquakes with a magnitude near or greater than 6.0. The San Jacinto Fault is the most
active fault in San Diego County. Maximum magnitude could range from 6.9 to 7.3.
Portions of the San Jacinto Fault are only 60 to 80 miles from San Diego. An earthquake
of magnitude 7.0 could produce Mercalli intensities of VI or VII in the coastal areas.
Elsinore Fault
The Elsinore Fault, at approximately 135 miles, is the longest active fault in the County.
This fault begins near Vallecito in Anza/Borrego, passes through the Julian area, heads
northwest past Mount Palomar, into Riverside County. The Elsinore Fault was the source
of an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 in 1910. Since then only one earthquake greater
than magnitude 5 has been experienced on the Elsinore Fault. An earthquake with a
magnitude as high as 7 is possible for the Elsinore Fault. An earthquake of this size could
cause damage equal to intensity VII or greater.
Rose Canyon Fault
The Rose Canyon Fault repeats the northwest-tending pattern of the faults to the east,
however instead of running through sparsely populated mountains and desert, it runs
through the densely populated coastal strip. This fault comes on shore at La Jolla, passes
to the east side of Mount Soledad, extending south along the I-5 corridor towards the bay
and Downtown San Diego. The fault consists of several parallel strands that, when
examined as a group, create a fault zone.

In the historic past, earthquakes originating on the Rose Canyon fault have been in the
range of magnitude 3 to 4. It is generally agreed that an earthquake of magnitude 6 to 7 is
not improbable. An earthquake of this size could create Mercalli intensities ranging from
VIII to IX in the urbanized coastal area. While La Mesa would likely be spared the worst,
destruction of lifelines and temporary disruption of the general social fabric would have
community wide impacts.
Offshore Faults
The sea floor off the coast of Southern California is extensively faulted. Studies of
underwater topography reveal numerous basins, steep-sided ridges and offshore islands
indicative of faulting activities. Maximum probable magnitude for the offshore faults range
from 6.0 to 7.7. Mercalli scale intensities as high as VIII could be experienced. An
earthquake of this size could cause severe damage in the coastal area. An earthquake
centered on any of the offshore faults could also create a seismic sea wave or tsunamis.
The Effects of Seismic Activity
Significant earthquakes originating on local faults are a probability in the San Diego area.
Unfortunately, the location, occurrence and magnitude of earthquakes cannot be
predicted. The effects of an earthquake can be predicted and steps taken to minimize loss
of life and property damage, and to prepare for emergency needs as a result o a major
seismic event. The following section describes the primary and secondary effects of
earthquakes.
Initially, surface ruptures and fault displacements occur along the fault trace. Movement
will either be lateral (sideways) or vertical. Usually only a few inches but sometimes several
feet, of movement can occur. Shifting of the earth can be a slow, continual creep
(displacement) or rapid movement resulting from an earthquake (rupture). Structures built
across an active fault are susceptible to damage from fault movement. There are no known
faults in La Mesa. Damage resulting from surface rupture or fault displacement is not
expected, however an earthquake with significant surface rupture or fault displacement
along the Rose Canyon fault would have regional impacts. Regional impacts could include
damage to sewer, power and water lines and disruption of the regional transportation
network.
By far the greatest seismic hazard is ground shaking, resulting from energy released during
an earthquake. The intensity and duration of the seismic event influence the degree of
damage. Distance from the epicenter, bedrock and soil characteristics also influence the
severity of ground shaking.
Distance mitigates ground-shaking originating on the San Andreas, San Jacinto and
Elsinore faults. Ground shaking resulting from a moderate earthquake centered on any of
these faults might not be detected in La Mesa. Ground shaking would be noticeable in a
                                                                       Safety Element | SE-11

major event, but damage would be restricted to poorly constructed buildings or structures
on unstable soil.
The Rose Canyon fault and the offshore faults are closer. Ground shaking centered on
these faults could range from minor to significant depending on the epicenter location and
the duration and intensity of the seismic event. Damage to structures resulting from
ground shaking would also range from minor to extensive depending on soil stability and
the type of construction.
Although ground shaking and surface ruptures are the primary effects of seismic activity,
several other related phenomenon are potential seismic hazards. These secondary effects
can be as damaging as the earthquake itself. The following section describes the secondary
effects.
Liquefaction is a soil phenomenon in which water saturated unstable soil looses its strength
when subjected to the forces of intense, prolonged ground shaking. Soil liquefaction can
magnify ground shaking, induce landslides and cause differential settling of structure
foundations. Loosely structured soils, such as alluvium or improperly compacted fill, are
more susceptible to liquefaction. Clay-rich, well-compacted soils are less susceptible.
Deep unconsolidated soil, combined with a high water table, increase the risk of
liquefaction hazard.
Portions of La Mesa are underlain by the granitic rock of the Southern California batholith,
the “Santiago Peak Volcanics”. Where these geologic formations are present, bedrock is
close to the surface; soils are shallow and fairly fast draining. These areas are relatively free
from hazards related to liquefaction. Sedimentary rocks of the marine terraces underlie
most of La Mesa. Soils developed from these rocks are clay rich and fairly well
consolidated. However, pockets of less consolidated material are present. In addition, in
some areas an impermeable hardpan layer traps and holds water close to the surface.
A key factor in evaluating liquefaction hazard is the degree of soil saturation. Dry soil is
inherently more stable than wet soil because water acts as a lubricant. Information on
groundwater depths in La Mesa is limited. The presence of subsurface springs indicates
that water is close to the surface, at least in localized areas. It is more likely that throughout
most of La Mesa groundwater is not naturally abundant. However, more information is
needed about the nature of the subsoil and the presence of groundwater before an accurate
assessment of liquefaction hazard can be made.
Tsunamis are seismically induced ocean waves. Destructive forces resulting from tsunamis
can range from negligible to substantial. La Mesa's location and elevation allow the City to
avoid the tsunami hazard experienced by low elevation coastal areas. However, a regional
hazard remains. The potential for disruption of lifelines and transportation networks in
coastal areas could have region-wide impact that affect La Mesa.

Seiches and surges are the oscillation of water within a confined basin, such as a lake, river
or bay. Imagine liquid sloshing when a glass is shaken. On a much larger scale, this same
phenomenon causes seiches and surges. Duration ranges from a few minutes to several
hours after the initial shock. Flooding can result as waves run up on the lake shore. The
force of seismic induced water surges has damaged steel water tanks. Water bodies in
La Mesa, which could be subjected to seiches or surges, are Lake Murray, Lake Helix, and
the lake behind Anthony's Fish Grotto restaurant, which is located at 9530 Murray Drive.
Enclosed reservoirs and water tanks related to area-wide water distribution service could
also be affected, as well as public and private swimming pools.
Fire is often a secondary effect of an earthquake. Damaged power lines, gas mains and
electric or gas equipment can start fires. Effort to put fires out can be hampered by broken
water mains or damaged fire-fighting equipment.
Flooding can result from seismic activities. In its most dramatic form, flooding threatens
lives and properties in areas downstream from a seismically induced dam failure. More
likely, however, is property damage related to flooding caused by broken water and sewer
pipes.
An earthquake can trigger slope failure. Sedimentary rock is at risk for slope failure
resulting from the layered nature of this rock type. Sliding can occur along transition areas
of sedimentary rock with different stability characteristics.
Reducing Seismic Risk
The Uniform Building Code assigns four seismic zone designations based on the degree of
earthquake hazard. Minimum structural requirements increase as level of risk increases.
Zone 3 implies high degree of risk, although not as high as Zone 4. Zone 4 is applied in
areas close to major faults. The urbanized western portion of San Diego County is
designated Zone 3 in response to the perception of a lesser degree of hazard. The eastern
more rural section of the County is designated Zone 4 to reflect a greater degree of hazard
from the Elsinore, San Jacinto and San Andreas faults. Recent information about the Rose
Canyon fault shows a higher degree of activity than was previously believed. An upgrading
of the coastal areas of San Diego County, from seismic Zone 3 to Zone 4 may result.
Compliance with the more stringent requirements of Zone 4 increase construction cost
between one and five percent.
There are three categories of risk from seismic hazard. These are: risk to the public of
injury or death, risk of damage to property and risk of social disruption. Mitigation of
these risks is a public agency responsibility requiring identification of an acceptable level of
risk and development of a risk mitigation program.
The concept of acceptable risk recognizes there are varying degrees of risk inherent in all
human activities. Administration of hazard mitigation programs balances the social and

economic cost of hazard elimination against the probability that the hazard will occur.
Hazard with a high probability and with severe impacts on society demand the attention of
the community. Those hazards, which occur infrequently or impact a small number of
people, are less important. Earthquakes occur infrequently however, the consequences of
a major earthquake could be extremely disruptive.
Assignment of local resources to seismic hazard elimination requires establishment of
priorities. The first priority must be the protection of the public from injury and death.
Protection of property is a second priority. Elimination of social disruption is less
important at the local level.
Protection of the public from injury and death primarily involves the identification and
elimination of hazardous structural conditions. Voluntary versus involuntary risk play a
role in setting priorities for unsafe structure elimination. Public buildings not occupied by
choice, such as hospitals, schools and buildings used for public assembly, should sustain
very low levels of risk. Owners of these types of facilities have been mandated by the State
to plan and execute retrofit programs. Buildings housing disaster response functions
should also be viable after a severe earthquake. La Mesa’s public safety facilities have been
upgraded to earthquake structural standards. Single-family dwellings, which are the
majority of structures in the City, can tolerate a higher level of risk due to the voluntary
nature of the occupancy.
Landslides
Bedrock is the foundation for the physical characteristics of the landscape. It is the soil,
however, that supports the natural biologic environment as well as agriculture and the built
environment. Consideration of the physical properties and limitations of the various soil
types is important when planning for urban development. Failure to accommodate the
limitations of a particular soil can have disastrous consequences. Soil hazard includes
landslide and slumping, excessive erosions, and damage to foundations roads, and
infrastructure.
Soils are the product of the weathering of the bedrock, topographic relief, decomposition
of organic material, and climatic influences. Over thousands of years, the interaction of
these four factors produce soils which are unique to the area in which they are developed.
The US Geological Survey and California Geological Survey have published landslide
inventory and landslide debris-flow susceptibility maps at a variety of scales for selected
areas of California. Areas prone to rainfall-triggered landslides overlap areas where
earthquake-induced landslides, mapped under the Seismic Hazard Mapping Act, are likely.
In l973, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published a soil survey for the San Diego
Area. Soils with similar characteristics were grouped together as a soil series. Fifty-four
different soil series were identified; cataloged and mapped based on physical

characteristics. The soil survey rates soils based on their resistance to erosion, runoff
potential and shrink-swell behavior, as well as fertility and suitability for home sites.
Local Conditions
Most of La Mesa is underlain by soil of the Redding Series. Redding soils are derived
from the sedimentary rock of the marine terraces. The Redding soil series is characterized
as gravelly loam at the surface with a subsoil layer of gravelly clay. At a depth of
approximately 30" an impervious clay hardpan layer can sometimes be found. Redding
soils are of low fertility and are mild to strongly acidic. This soil type is a potential source
of construction gravel.
Three other characteristics of Redding soils are significant in an urban setting. The first is
the high degree shrink-swell behavior. Because it contains relatively large amounts of clay,
this soil expands when wet and contracts as it dries. Without adequate reinforcement
buildings and infrastructure constructed on this soil can be damaged by the shrink-swell
affect.
Secondly, Redding soils are highly erosive. Grading operations and land stripped of
vegetation increase the erosion potential of the soil.
The third factor, which is significant in an urban setting, is the high runoff potential
characteristic of Redding soils. Clay content and the presence of an impervious hardpan
layer limit water percolation and increase runoff. Runoff potential affects the size and
configuration of flood control facilities.
There are at least 8 other soil series present in La Mesa and the planning area. The map in
Figure SE-3 shows the general locations of these soil formations.

Mitigating Geologic Hazards
A variety of techniques are available to
mitigate     hazards    related    to     soil.
Identification of soil type through soil
testing is important. Once the particular
characteristics of a soil are known,
appropriate construction practices can be
incorporated into development plans.
Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code
contains basic regulations governing
grading.        Regulations include the
                                                      Soil composition can effect grading operations.
requirement for a grading plan, the
issuance of a permit and inspections during the work. A community can establish more
stringent requirements as local conditions dictate. In 1974 the City Council adopted a
Grading Ordinance, which includes Chapter 70 with additional provisions addressing
concerns specific to La Mesa. Enforcement of the Grading Ordinance mitigates hazardous
soil conditions.
Expansive soils can be addressed through special foundation construction techniques.
Drainage directed away from the structure prevents moisture build-up near the foundation.
Removal and replacement with re-compacted, non-expansive soil is another mitigation
technique.
Slope Failure
Slope failure is the movement of soil and rock material
down slope. Movement can be rapid, as in a landslide, or
slowly creeping. A slope can become unstable by several
techniques common to grading and land development.
Removal of material from the bottom steepens the angle of
the slope, increasing instability. Adding fill at the top of the
slope increases the weight the slope must carry. Water from
septic tanks, gutter runoff, irrigation or diversion saturates
the slope, increasing instability.
Large portions of La Mesa are underlain by sedimentary
rock. This rock type is inherently more susceptible to slope
failure. Different stability characteristics between layers of
sedimentary rock create the possibility of instability,
especially when the layering is parallel to the slope. As in-fill
development moves into areas with steep slopes, hazard                           Temporary fencing retains debris

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                                     2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Hazards related to slope failure can be mitigated. Identification of slide prone areas is the
first step. Development of areas identified as susceptible to slope failure should be
avoided. Modern grading practices can incorporate slope stabilization techniques.
Administration and enforcement of a comprehensive grading ordinance is the most
important aspect of a slope failure hazard elimination program.
Predominate soil types in La Mesa exhibit shrink/swell behavior, are erosive and relatively
impermeable. Hazards created by this geologic condition must be considered when the
City reviews new development proposals.
Fire Hazard
State law mandates policies related to fire hazard in the Safety Element. The purpose is a
reduction in the exposure to fire risks experienced in urban and rural areas throughout the
State. In rural areas, the emphasis is on reducing fire loss related to wild land fires. In
urban areas structural fire protection is emphasized.
Local Conditions
La Mesa is at risk for both wild land
and urban fires. Wild land fires occur
in rural areas and where development
interfaces with undeveloped areas. The
primary cause of fires in urban areas is
carelessness. Arson fire can be a
problem in some areas, but arson has
not historically been a significant cause
of fires in La Mesa.
Although La Mesa is an urban
community, wild land fire risks are
present in the remaining pockets of
undeveloped open area, including                 Fire protection services are enhanced by collaborative

Interstate-8, the open space portions of Eastridge, and Mount Helix. Characteristics shared
by these areas are limited access, steep terrain, thick vegetation cover, deficient hydrant
spacing, and water pressure.
Mishandling of flammable liquids, matches, candles, smoking material, blocked furnace
vents, electrical malfunctions, and grease fires in the kitchen are typical causes of residential
structure fires. While public education programs are important in reducing the incidence,
these types of fires will continue to occur.

Response to Fire Hazards
The Uniform Fire Code sets standards governing the use of property from a fire safety
perspective. Setbacks, access, building material and design, building occupancy, and the
use and storage of hazardous materials are examples of regulations found in the Uniform
Fire Code. The La Mesa Municipal Code also includes a section on fire regulations
specifically applicable in La Mesa. Enforcement of these fire code regulations mitigates fire
hazard in the community.
Adequate fire protection services, including manpower, equipment and facilities also
reduce fire hazard. The City of La Mesa is served by Heartland Fire and Rescue, which
utilizes the combined fire protection resources of La Mesa, Lemon Grove, and El Cajon.
This unique cooperative fire services agreement ensures a high level of fire and emergency
medical services delivery and maximizes resource utilization. Heartland Fire and Rescue
achieves an ISO rating of 2, signifying a well-equipped and well-trained fire response
service.
Adequate “fire flow," the amount of water delivered by the hydrant, is essential. The
minimum fire flow in single-family residential areas is 1,000 gallons per minute. Most
hydrants in the City can deliver the minimum flow. Fire flows are required to be higher in
commercial and high-density residential areas. This is achieved by the increased size of
water mains serving these areas and by combining hydrant flows.
Fire hydrant spacing is also important. The maximum distance permitted between
hydrants in single-family residential areas is 500', placing every home within 250' of a
hydrant. In commercial and high-density residential areas the hydrant spacing requirement
is reduced to 300' or less based on the type of development. Installation of a hydrant as a
condition of development approval is a standard practice.
Installation of fire sprinklers is effective. The 2010 California Residential Building Code
expanded the fire sprinkler requirements to include all new one and two family dwellings.
Nearly all new development, commercial and residential, now requires the installation of
sprinklers.
Adequate access for fire equipment and personnel is required. Minimum access for
private easements is 14' for a single dwelling. Access to multiple dwellings and fire lanes
serving commercial establishments are required to be 22' of unrestricted width. A
turnaround is required at a maximum of 150' or less if warranted by topography or building
arrangement.
Fire safety inspection of commercial and industrial facilities is effective. An on-going
inspection program targets new, as well as existing, businesses. Identified fire safety
violations are corrected and re-inspected.
                                                                     Safety Element | SE-19

Around undeveloped and open space areas the selective clearing and thinning of
overgrown vegetation reduces fire risk. Native chaparral species, as well as non-native grass
species, are relatively less fire resistant. Replacement plantings using fire resistant species
along the interface between developed and undeveloped areas reduces wild land fire
hazard.
Public education is perhaps the most cost effective fire hazard reduction tactic. For
example, the expanded use of home smoke detectors has drastically reduced the national
fire-related death rate. Other topics for public education include the safe storage of
flammable materials and the need for brush and weed abatement. La Mesa's Fire Safety
Public Education Program focuses on all segments of the community to increase fire safety
awareness of every citizen.
La Mesa is largely developed; therefore, concern for fire safety is centered on the City's
many structures. Fire safety inspection programs help reduce fire hazard in commercial
areas, but an on-going public education program is needed to reduce fire risk in residential
structures.
Hazardous Materials
The number of chemical and industrial processes associated with manufacturing, medical,
commercial, and residential uses continues to expand. Many of the new processes and
products, while raising the standard of living, are
potentially hazardous to humans and the environment. Classes of Hazardous Materials
As the range of hazardous substances has grown, the Class 1: Explosives
laws regarding these materials have become
increasingly comprehensive and complex.                     Class 2: Hazardous Gasses
                                                            Class 3: Flammable Liquids

hazardous materials as "any material that, because of its   Class 4: Flammable Solids

characteristics, poses a significant present or potential   Class 5: Oxidizers

the workplace or the environment."                          Source: Code of Federal Regulations
The degree of hazard presented by hazardous materials depends on several variables,
including the chemical and physical properties of the material, the amount and

concentration of the material, the use, activity or process involving the material and the
surrounding conditions. Regulating agencies consider these variables when reviewing
businesses involved in the production or use of hazardous materials. In California, the
threshold above which regulatory oversight is required is 55 gallons of a liquid, 500 pounds
of a solid and 200 cubic feet of compressed gas.
Federal Regulations
There are three principal federal policies related to management of hazardous substances.
The Toxic Substances Control Act (TOSCA) regulates the manufacture and use of
chemicals. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establishes a
minimum federal standard for hazardous waste management including requirements for
record keeping, reporting, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. The Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act regulates packing, handling, labeling, marking, and routing of
hazardous materials. Supplemental legislation, such as the "Superfund" hazardous waste site
cleanup and laws regulating underground storage tanks, support and strengthen the Federal
commitment to protection of the public health and the environment from the impacts of
improper handling of hazardous materials.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
The Clean Water Act of 1995 and its subsequent amendments give the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate industrial and municipal
discharges into public storm drains, sewer systems and surface water bodies. The National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution
by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. Point
sources are defined by the EPA as discrete conveyances such as pipes or man-made
ditches.
State Regulations
The State of California has shown leadership in the enactment of laws related to hazardous
materials. The Hazardous Waste Management Act and Hazardous Materials Storage and
Emergency Response Law were both adopted in the 1980s. Significantly, the 1986 Tanner
Bill (AB 2948) created a local planning process designed to make each county responsible
for managing hazardous waste generated within its borders.
Other State Laws which address hazardous substances include a State program for the
clean up of contaminated sites, regulation of underground tanks, regulation of medical
waste, water quality control, transportation of hazardous substances, and management of
household hazardous waste.

Hazardous Waste Management
Initial efforts to manage environmental waste focused
almost completely on regulation of "end-of-the-pipe"
pollution, rather than pollution prevention. In 1986, the
Hazardous Waste Management Act was enacted, directing
the State Department of Health Services and the State
Water Resources Control Board to promote reductions in
hazardous waste generation through recycling and
treatment.
Each county in the State of California is required to
maintain a Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The

California Environmental Agency (CalEPA) as the local
Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), and thus is
responsible for implementing Federal and State hazardous waste laws at the local level.
Medical Waste Management
To protect the public and the environment from potential infectious exposure to disease-
causing agents, the Medical Waste Management Program (MWMP), in the Environmental
Management Branch of the California Department of Public Health, regulates the
generation, handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical waste by providing
oversight for the implementation of the Medical Waste Management Act (MWMA).
The MWMP permits and inspects all medical waste offsite treatment facilities and medical
waste transfer stations. In addition to the treatment methods specifically allowed in the
MWMA, there are more than a dozen alternative medical waste treatment
technologies approved for use in California.
Additionally, the MWMP acts as the local enforcement agency in a number of local
jurisdictions that elected to have the State implement the large quantity generator
inspection program for medical waste management.
The MWMP assists generators of medical waste to minimize waste generation through
training and facilitating implementation of the Hospital Pollution Prevention Program. In
this regard, MWMP has provided guidance on waste minimization, the elimination of
mercury in hospitals, and waste reduction intervention strategies.
Hazardous Materials Storage
The San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials
Division (HMD) is responsible for inspecting businesses or facilities that handle or store
hazardous materials, generate hazardous waste, generate medical waste, and own or operate
underground storage tanks. HMD regulates chemical inventories, hazardous wastes,
underground storage tanks, above ground petroleum storage, medical waste, and risk

management plans. State Law requires that all businesses which handle hazardous material
and hazardous waste submit a "Business Plan" to HMD, which contains detailed
information about the type and amounts of chemicals at the site and the amounts of
hazardous waste generated.
Prevention Programs
The California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program works with local
businesses to reduce the likelihood and severity of offsite consequences from releases of
very toxic materials such as ammonia and chlorine gasses.
Emergency Operations Plan
The City Council adopted Resolution No. 2012-075, creating the City of La Mesa
Emergency Operations Plan. The Emergency Operations Plan includes the Continuity of
Operations Plan, the Annex Q Evacuation Supplement, the Care & Shelter Standard
Operating Procedure, the California Emergency Management Agency (CALEMA)
Crosswalk, and the After-Action Report/Corrective Action Survey. The Hazardous
Materials Storage and Emergency Response Law also mandates preparation of a local
Emergency Response Plan based on information provided in the Business Plans. HMD is
involved in emergency response planning. The City’s Emergency Operations Plan includes
hazardous materials response protocol.
Household Hazardous Waste
While the vast majority of hazardous materials are used by industries as part of their
manufacturing process, a significant part of the hazardous waste stream is produced by
households that use and then discard cleaners, pesticides, paint products, automotive
products, hobby products, and other toxic substances commonly found in households.
These materials and wastes are significant because they have the potential to cause physical
injury and environmental damage in their use and disposal. When these materials are
disposed of improperly in the municipal refuse or sanitary sewer system, they have the
potential to harm refuse workers and to contaminate landfills, the underlying groundwater
and other environmental media.
State Law mandates that local jurisdictions plan for the management of household
hazardous waste. The Household Hazardous Waste Element of the County-wide
Integrated Waste Management Plans accomplishes this. The City of La Mesa has
completed a draft of its Household Hazardous Waste Management Element. This
document will be forwarded to the County of San Diego for incorporation in the Integrated
Waste Management Plan.

monitors the emissions from these facilities to ensure that their annual limits are not
exceeded. The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District also issues permits for any
operations or equipment that emits or is capable of emitting contaminants into the
atmosphere.
The California Department of Toxic Substances Control maintains a list, commonly
known as the Cortese List, of Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites. The list is updated at
least annually to comply with disclosure requirements required by the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In La Mesa, sites included on the Cortese list are
primarily associated with abandoned underground tanks associated with previously
operational gas stations.
The San Diego Region has established a successful Household Hazardous Waste
Collection Program. Collection events at locations throughout the County allow residents
and small businesses to dispose of household hazardous wastes in a responsible manner.
Collection events are held in La Mesa several times a year.
Other State laws which address hazardous substances include a State program for clean up
of contaminated sites, regulation of underground tanks, water quality control,
transportation of hazardous substances, and management of household hazardous waste.
Several other agencies are involved at the local level in hazardous materials management.
The Combustible, Explosive and Dangerous Materials Inspection Program is staffed by the
City of San Diego Fire Department. The regional HAZMAT Incident Response Team, a
cooperative effort between the San Diego Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials
Management Division, responds to hazardous material incidents Region-wide. The Air
Pollution Control District, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board and local
sanitation districts are also involved in hazardous materials and hazardous waste
management.
Sections of the Uniform Building Code and the Uniform Fire Code regulate the use and
storage of hazardous substances. These codes are adopted and enforced by local
jurisdictions to set a minimum standard for building and fire safety. The Building Code
sets forth criteria for construction of buildings where hazardous substances are handled,
including a requirement for "control areas" which separate and contain operations involving
hazardous substances.
The Fire Code calls for Hazardous Materials Management Plans (HMMP) to be submitted
by businesses handling hazardous substances. Site plan, building plan, type, and amount of
hazardous substances, chemical compatibility, separation, monitoring, inspection, record

keeping, and employee training must be specified in a written plan. This is similar to the
requirements of the State-mandated business plan. The La Mesa Fire Department accepts
a business plan as a substitution for the HMMP.
Local zoning ordinances and municipal codes are an additional source of regulatory
control of hazardous substances. Zoning ordinances can restrict to certain areas, or
prohibit all together, businesses which handle more than threshold amounts of hazardous
materials.
The City of La Mesa is required to comply with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. To reduce pollution from urban runoff and storm water
discharges, City staff, developers, contractors, businesses, and residents are required to
implement Best Management Practices (BMPs). BMPs are practices or devices used to
reduce or eliminate pollutants from entering the storm water system. The City is further
required to implement programs to identify and eliminate illegal/illicit discharges into
La Mesa’s storm water system and conduct monitoring programs during dry and wet
weather seasons. A Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual for commercial,
industrial, construction, municipal, and residential activities ensures compliance with these
regulations.
The Conservation and Sustainability Element also addresses environmental and public
health issues related to waste management.
Disaster Preparedness
The foundation of disaster response planning is a mutual aid system involving local, State
and Federal agencies. Mutual aid ensures that adequate resources and support are
available to jurisdictions coping with the results of a disaster. A hierarchy of authority is
established which coordinates the flow of aid as needed while retaining local jurisdictional
responsibility and control.
Primary focus of regional disaster preparedness is on earthquake response. A powerful
earthquake having Region-wide impacts would severely test response capabilities of the
Region. The County Office of Disaster Preparedness, in cooperation with the State Office
of Emergency Services, is responsible for Regional coordination of earthquake response.
Annual training exercises simulate a hypothetical earthquake incident. Local agency
participation is encouraged. Post exercise assessments identify future training and
coordination needs. The Office of Disaster Preparedness is also responsible for Regional
coordination of all other types of emergency response.

Local Conditions
La Mesa has an adopted Emergency Operations Plan. The Plan describes a
comprehensive emergency management system for response to natural and man-made
disasters, including civic unrest, dam failure, earthquake, flooding, hazardous materials,
nuclear incidents, public health emergencies, power outages, transportation emergencies,
terrorism, and wildfires. Lines of authority and operational responsibilities are identified.
A framework for the continuity of government and maintenance of City services is
outlined. The Emergency Operations Plan provides City Staff with the basis for an
effective response in the event of a local or region-wide disaster.
In addition, in conjunction with community volunteers and the San Diego Unified Disaster
Council, the City's Fire Department has developed the "La Mesa Survive" program. This
public information program provides a valuable reference tool for quick response and
preparations needed for La Mesa residents to be well-prepared if a major disaster affected
the City.

The City of La Mesa was incorporated in 1912 and, since then, the City has strived to
provide services at a level that achieves public expectations. One-hundred years later those
services are much different, but the vision is the same; planning for and providing public
services and facilities for the entire community is the most important responsibility of local
government.
Planning for future services and facilities is critical to maintaining quality of life in a
community. Although the Public Services and Facilities (PSF) Element is not required by
State General Plan Law, inclusion of such an element is optional. The General Plan
assesses the potential for growth in the residential and commercial sector. Public services
and facilities are linked to the General Plan through the Capital Improvement Program
(CIP). Every other year, the Planning Commission reviews the proposed Capital
Improvement Program and must take action to make a finding that the Capital
Improvement Program is consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the General
Plan. Table PSF-1 shows the CIP expenditures by category in fiscal year 2012.

The goals and policies of this Element emphasize the following five concepts:
     •    Provide a balance of City services at a level that attempts to meet or exceed public
          expectations
     •    Provide a safe community through police and fire protection.
     •    Maintain, expand, and improve the City’s public infrastructure to sustain the quality
          of life.
     •    Provide the citizens with a range of recreation services.
     •    Provide oversight and program administration for the physical and economic
          development of the community.
     •    Provide a financial plan for the repair and replacement of capital facilities
The community of La Mesa desires a high quality of life and a responsible leadership that
will guide the City through the next 20 years and beyond.
A Glossary of technical terms is located at the end of this element.
Purpose
Planning for future services and facilities is important to the government and its citizens. In
La Mesa most of the growth has already occurred, but future development of underutilized
property continues to occur. New development can impact the demand for services and
facilities, but at the same time new development creates additional funding for services and
facilities.
Analysis of services and facilities in an established community is necessary in an era of
constrained fiscal resources. Decisions regarding the funding of service and facilities are
more difficult to make. An understanding of existing deficiencies, current demands, and
public expectation is critical to the decision-making process. The City must anticipate and
respond to increased service and facility demands to mitigate the impact of growth within
the community.
As a point of reference, Table PSF-2 summarizes the existing and projected population
and housing units for the horizon year of this General Plan and looks ahead to 2050:

Organization and Content
The City of La Mesa provides services to the citizens of La Mesa through the following
departments: General Government, Police, Fire, Public Works, Community Services, and
Community Development. To provide these services the City maintains police and fire
stations, parks, recreation centers, a maintenance yard, a City administration center,
numerous community facilities, and many networks of public infrastructure. Provision of
services and maintenance of public facilities is supported by the various revenue sources
outlined in the following section. Revenues are allocated through the budget process,
which is key to the efficient operation of the City.
The Public Services and Facilities Element addresses those general public services that
include a safe community, infrastructure, recreation, economic development goals, and
related objectives and policies.
The public facilities map, Figure PSF-1, located on the following page, reflects the City’s
present public facilities, including City Hall, Police/Fire facilities, parks, schools, library,

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Public Services and Facilities Element (PSF) integrates policies from other Elements
of La Mesa’s General Plan. Table PSF-3 represents the integration of the Elements.
The Circulation Element outlines goals and policies for a complete transportation system
that is supported by infrastructure policies in the PSF Element. The Conservation and
Sustainability, Open Space and Recreation, Noise, and Safety Elements contain policies
that protect resources that need to be considered to maintain and enhance quality of life.
The Land Use and Urban Design Element contains polices for commercial and residential
development which result in revenues to fund the services and infrastructure policies in the
Public Services and Facilities Element.

Relationship of Budget to General Plan
The General Plan is not the primary tool available to solve a budgetary problem; however,
it provides goals, objectives, policies, and implementation programs, which are
economically sound in their attempt to balance community needs with resources. Table
PSF-4 shows the expenditures of the General Fund by account for a typical fiscal year. The
majority of the City's annual expenditure of discretionary funds pays for staffing needed to
provide the services and programs desired by the public. This fiscal reality will make it a
continuing issue to determine how to sustain top quality services to the community, and
maintain or improve the facilities and infrastructure that is necessary to sustain the quality
of life in La Mesa.

The City is aware that if the current revenue base is unable to support the current level of
services and capital needs, it will be essential to promote future economic development that
is self-sustaining and will provide additional revenue to support needed City services. The
City will carefully monitor its finances, and establish those measures necessary to efficiently
provide services and maintain facilities within the existing budgetary framework. Table
PSF-5 shows the sources of revenue that support the General Fund for a typical fiscal year.

During the life of this General Plan, the City will be especially concerned with the
improvement and maintenance of its infrastructure. For local governments, infrastructure
refers to such features as roads, sewers, storm drains, and utilities. These resources permit
a community to operate in comfort and safety. La Mesa is an older community that has
many areas where the infrastructure is antiquated or near the end of its useful life. The
City must prepare for the upgrade or repair of those facilities under its control.
La Mesa’s residents recognize the need for improvements to City facilities and
infrastructure. In 2002, the voters overwhelming approved Proposition D, a bond issue
measure for construction of public safety facilities, including a new fire
station/administration building, a new police headquarters, and renovation of Fire Station
13. Both buildings were completed by the end of the decade. In 2008, the voters
approved Measure L, which enacted a ¾ % sales tax increase for transactions in the City of
La Mesa.

In 2010, the cities of El Cajon, La Mesa and Lemon Grove entered into a Joint Exercise of
Powers Agreement (JPA) for consolidated management and delivery of fire protection and
emergency medical services. Named Heartland Fire and Rescue, this Sub-Regional service
increased efficiency and reduced cost through shared administration of all fire department
services for the three cities involved.
La Mesa residents benefit from an active volunteer program. Volunteers make a real
difference in the quantity and quality of services provided by the City. The Retired Senior
Volunteer Program (RSVP) provides valued services for the Police Department. Other
volunteers provide necessary services in several other City departments. This contribution

City Administration
All departments provide general administrative services related to public services and
facilities. Most of these administrative functions are located at La Mesa City Hall, 8130
Allison Avenue, or in the Civic Center complex. The following pages describe these
departments in greater detail.
City Manager/City Council
Appointed by the City Council, the City Manager is responsible for the overall
management and operations of the City. The City Manager's Office is responsible for the
development and administration of the City's budget. Implementation of State and Federal
law affecting municipal operations and policy advisor to the City Council are also areas of
responsibility for the City Manager's Office.
City Clerk
The City Clerk is an elected official responsible for the organization and maintenance of all
official records of City business as required by law. Preparation of agendas, recordation of

the minutes, and indexing of all action taken by the City Council are the responsibilities of
the City Clerk.
Municipal Finance
The Department of Finance is responsible for the overall management of the City's fiscal
resources. Revenue administration, budget control, centralized purchasing, payroll, and
business licensing are among the responsibilities of Finance.
Human Resources
The Human Resources Department is responsible for the recruitment and testing of
employees. This department also administers the Benefits Program, Unemployment
Insurance and Workers' Compensation Programs.
City Attorney
The City Attorney provides legal counsel to the City Council and Staff in all matters related
to City business and the law. City Attorney services are provided by contract with a local
firm.
Police Services
The La Mesa Police Department provides general law enforcement services for the City of
La Mesa. The City maintains three patrol shifts that provide 24-hour response to calls for
assistance and traffic control. This continual
presence is expected to deter criminal activity in
the City. The number of officers on each shift is
reviewed annually during the budgetary process.
Crime Prevention is another service provided
by the Police Department. In addition to
responding to complaints and incidents, the
Police Department assigns personnel to
programs designed to prevent crime. The best
known of these is the Neighborhood Watch
Program; however, the Department also is
involved in Business Alert, Women Alert,

Senior Savvy, and Hospital Alert.
The Investigation Division of the Department performs the follow-up activity to crimes or
traffic accidents, which occur in the City. Staffing within this section is determined by
weighing the budget constraints with the City's crime rate. The Department's ability to
respond to complaints or incidents is greatly enhanced by the volunteers in the RSVP
program. This service will be continued not only for its cost savings benefits, but also for its
role as a recruiting technique.

Animal Control Officers operate out of the Police Department; however, shelter services are
contracted for through the City of El Cajon. The Department is also responsible for
enforcement of the Downtown parking lots and meters.
A new Police Station was completed in 2010. It provides approximately 40,000 square feet
of space and features modernized and expanded communications facilities, prisoner
holding and processing areas, juvenile detention areas, interview rooms, offices, secure
parking, and a community room. The equipment for the new Police Station was funded in
part by State and Federal grant monies.
Fire Services
Over the years, fire services in La Mesa have changed as a
result of changes in the industry, building inventory, and the
fire code. Increased resources will be demanded as the land
development pattern intensifies with higher building density,
larger commercial buildings, and increased number of
multi-story structures. Fires in single-family dwellings do not
require the same equipment that is necessary for mid-rise,
high-rise, or large commercial structures. These buildings
require equipment that is more sophisticated and requires
additional training and personnel.
The Department currently uses a constant staffing model of
13 personnel on duty per day. Staffing is typically three
personnel on engines and four personnel on a cross-staffed         Fire Administration and Station 12
truck/rescue.
On January 1, 2010, the Cities of El Cajon, La Mesa, and Lemon Grove entered into a
Joint Powers Agreement for management and delivery of fire protection and emergency
medical services. This management team is known as Heartland Fire and Rescue. The La
Mesa Fire Department works cooperatively with the other cities to maintain this Sub-
Regional fire agency through consolidated management within service areas. The benefit
of a Sub-Regional service is increased cost effectiveness due to economies of scale and cost
containment.
La Mesa is part of the Heartland Communication Facility JPA and the Heartland Training
Facility JPA. La Mesa has partnered with American Medical Response (AMR) and
multiple local fire agencies to form the Regional Cooperative Care Program (RCCP). The
Department is a member of a Regional paramedic resource pool. The City also is part of a
JPA through the Unified Disaster Council (UDC) that provides response to hazardous
materials incidents. Most of the Department's resources are dedicated to fire suppression.
Proactive fire prevention and education programs will never replace the need for reactive

fire suppression. However, an effective fire prevention program could reduce the
incidence, and limit the severity, of fires occurring in the City.
A new Fire Administration Building was constructed on the Civic Center site in 2007 and
includes a new Emergency Operations Center (EOC). There is tremendous benefit to the
City in having a capable and effective EOC in this newly constructed facility. This
self-contained facility, built to a “Public Safety Facilities Standard”, has become
headquarters for the City’s emergency response and recovery operations. In the event of a
large-scale disaster, either natural or manmade, the City's operations would be coordinated
from this centralized location.
The Insurance Services Office (IS0) evaluates the quality of Fire Department services
provided to communities to determine levels of fire risk and therefore, insurance risk. ISO
evaluates a community's fire protection records, staffing, equipment and water supply.
Rating is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 indicating no fire protection provided. La Mesa Fire
Department's current ISO rating is 2, which compares favorably with other fire agencies in
the area.
Public Works
The Public Works Department operates
and     maintains      the    City’s     public
infrastructure, including wastewater, storm
water, streets, parks, and public buildings.
Proper maintenance protects public
investment, assures health and safety and
improves quality of life for La Mesa
citizens.
The Department’s Engineering and
Operations Divisions work together to
maintain this infrastructure.              The      Public Works Street and Infrastructure Maintenance
Engineering Division is located at City Hall
while the Operations Division has a corporation yard in the City's industrial area north of
Interstate 8.      The corporation yard underwent a complete reconstruction and
modernization in 2000, which allows the Division to adequately serve the community for
the foreseeable future.
The Public Works Department has divided the City into seven maintenance zones (Figure
PSF-2) for the planning and coordination of infrastructure maintenance and improvements.
These zones are made up of similarly sized areas and laid out in a clockwise pattern
around the City.

Wastewater
The Wastewater Collection System is made up of approximately 156 miles of clay,
concrete and plastic sewer pipe. La Mesa is a member of the Metro Wastewater Joint
Powers Authority, a coalition of agencies that utilize the Point Loma Wastewater
Treatment Plant operated by the City of San Diego. La Mesa’s average daily wastewater
flow to the plant is 5.27 million gallons per day. La Mesa has a contracted wastewater
treatment capacity limit of 6.99 million gallons per day.
A Wastewater Master Plan was completed in 2008 in which is was determined that the City
is expected to have sufficient capacity to accommodate anticipated development through
2030. The sewer drainage basins are shown in Figure PSF-3. The major challenges that
the City faces are to continue with its proactive Maintenance Program to limit sewer spills
and to replace infrastructure that has reached its useful life or is difficult to properly
maintain. Other challenges include compliance with governmental mandates and reducing
sewer spills. To comply with one of those governmental mandates, the City developed a
Fats, Oils and Grease, or FOG, Control Program in 2009. FOG in the Wastewater
Collection System is a major contributor to sewer spills.
When storm water flows in to the Wastewater Collection System, capacity is reduced and
treatment costs increase. La Mesa has instituted an Inflow and Infiltration Reduction
Program to manage non-wastewater flows. It is challenging to locate where storm water
run-off is entering the system. Identifying and correcting these deficiencies preserves
capacity, reduces the City’s wastewater treatment cost and prevents sewer spills.
The Wastewater Capital Improvement Program includes three types of projects: capacity,
condition and inflow and infiltration. One of the biggest challenges for the Wastewater
Program will be replacement of sewer pipes crossing beneath the freeway right-of-way.

Storm Water Drainage
The Storm Water Drainage System is made up of approximately 53 miles of concrete and
corrugated metal storm drainpipe. Storm water runoff in La Mesa drains to the San Diego
River (northern half of City) and the San Diego Bay (southern half of City) watersheds.
The San Diego Bay watershed is further divided into the Chollas Creek Basin to the west
and the Sweetwater River Basin to the east. The storm water drainage basins are shown in
Figure PSF-4.
The City has been replacing corrugated metal pipe with concrete pipe in a prioritized
manner and as-needed basis where resources have allowed. La Mesa is a co-permittee to
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the Regional Water
Quality Control Board. This permit is revised every five years and requires extensive
monitoring and reporting by the City to protect water quality.

Street Maintenance
A well-maintained network of streets is an essential component of any community. Streets
provide access and connectivity for residents and visitors. There are approximately 150
centerline miles of public streets that need to be maintained in La Mesa. Street
preventative maintenance typically includes minor street asphalt patching repairs and crack
sealing followed by application of a rubberized asphalt slurry seal. Prior to the street work,
maintenance is performed on street trees and cement concrete surface improvements
including curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and pedestrian ramps.
Street maintenance is programmed by maintenance zones shown in Figure PSF-2. The
maintenance needs in one zone are addressed each year. Maintenance efforts rotate on a
clockwise and numerical order. This rotation allows for a systematic and planned
approach to maintenance responsibilities.
Pavement condition is surveyed periodically to rank and prioritize maintenance activities in
an effort to receive the longest life possible from the pavement and spend resources in an
efficient manner. Street resurfacing is performed periodically as required and as resources
allow. The Street Maintenance Division is also responsible for the repair and maintenance
of all street signage and striping. More on street improvements can be found in the
Circulation Element of this General Plan.
Park Maintenance
Access to open space for recreation is an important asset for the community and
contributes to the well-being of its residents. Parks serve a valuable purpose in an urban
environment, reflecting the quality of life and character of the community. La Mesa has a
system of parks, which are improved and
maintained to satisfy a variety of users.
Although the City provides most of the
maintenance, user groups, such as youth
recreation leagues or senior organizations
assist with the maintenance of certain parks
or recreational facilities.
There are 14 parks in La Mesa comprising
a total of 136 acres. The City currently has
a reasonable distribution of neighborhood,
community and Regional parks, yet total              Public Works Park Infrastructure Maintenance
area objectives identified in the Open
Space and Recreation Element show the need to increase park space.
Development of additional park sites in the City will be difficult due to the cost to acquire
suitable land. The City plans to make parks available to a broader section of the
population by focusing on improving access to the existing parks,

Building Maintenance
The City currently maintains 41 different buildings totaling 245,200 square feet of space.
The average building age is 30 years old. Over the next 20 years, La Mesa will be
challenged with protecting recent investments in the new Fire Administration and Station
11 building completed in 2007, the new Post Office/Library completed 2008, the new
Police Station completed in 2010 and the renovated Fire Station 13 completed 2011. All
of these facilities will require regular maintenance so the useful life of the buildings can be
maximized. Existing older buildings will require ong-oing maintenance and improvements
to keep them safe and secure. All City buildings have some type of public access that
should be properly maintained and protected.
Planning needs to begin to replace City Hall, which was constructed in 1958 when the
City’s population was approximately 30,000. Currently, there is not enough room in the
City Hall facilities for employees and customers to have a sufficient work environment.
Environmental Services
In 2006, the Environmental Services Division was moved to the Department of Public
Works to better coordinate with other environmental programs, such as Storm water
Pollution Prevention. The Division oversees solid waste reduction and recycling efforts,
including household hazardous waste disposal and compliance with the Assembly Bill 939
State mandate for waste diversion.
Enforcement of City Ordinances requiring recycling at single-family, multi-family and
commercial properties as well as construction and demolition sites has resulted in
substantial reductions in landfill waste, helping to extend the life of local landfills. As a
result, properties that were originally designed to accommodate only trash collection have
been required to accommodate additional containers. Increasing recycling requires more
storage space, which impacts some properties. New construction and remodeling projects
are required to provide space for recycling. City facilities will continue to incorporate
recycling into their designs.
The largest remaining component of landfill waste is organic; essentially yard and food
waste. Targeting this material for reduction and recovery will present new challenges
related to collection and transportation from the City, some of which will be offset by a
reduction in landfill-bound trash. The primary source of this waste, residents and
restaurants, may be able to substitute space and collection capacity currently devoted for
trash to this new recoverable stream.
The Division is committed to improving the City’s sustainability by preserving La Mesa for
future generations in the same or better condition than it is currently. Efforts will be made
to reduce the resources needed to maintain the quality of life in the City and to maximize
the use of existing resources while minimizing those resources effects on the environment.

The Conservation and Sustainability Element of this General Plan discusses the program
and projects in detail.
Community Services
Land for the first La Mesa park, Collier
Park, was acquired in 1912. The Parks
and Recreation Department was created
when La Mesa's population was less than
10,000. As the City grew, the number of
parks increased to 14, and the
responsibilities were assigned to the Parks
and Recreation Department. In 1990, the
Department was renamed the Community
Services Department to better reflect the
full range of activities and services                Parks provide spaces where children can play.
provided.
The Department has responsibility for recreational services, educational, limited social
service programs, cultural events, facilities rentals, and facilities planning for City parks.
Although there are a number of programs and classes which are offered on a continual
basis, the Department finds that it must be flexible in providing new or expanded programs
as the interests of La Mesa residents change. Most of these programs are supported by fees
and, therefore, enjoy some degree of self-sufficiency.
The Department also serves the vital function of coordinating programs and services that
serve children at school/park sites in La Mesa.
Although not responsible for the actual construction of parks or park improvements, the
Department does exercise considerable influence in the planning and funding for new park
improvements.        In 1999, the City launched a non-profit
organization called the La Mesa Park and Recreation Foundation.
The role of this community-led Foundation is to leverage outside
funding for upgrades to parks as well as privately fund some
traditional City-sponsored events. For example, organization and
funding of the City’s Safety Fair has been transferred to the
Foundation and the Grossmont Healthcare District. The Junior
Seau Sports Complex, La Mesa Teen Club and several new
playgrounds were funded in part thanks to the Foundation’s
efforts.                                                                     The Teen Club provides a

The Department serves as coordinator of the Community Participation Program that
recruits, screens and places volunteers from the community in City departments.
Volunteers have provided thousands of hours of service per year, thereby providing a

higher level of service to City residents, while creating community pride and ownership
among the volunteers.
The Department provides leadership to the City’s Community Wellness Initiative.
“Ready…Set…Live Well” extends and integrates efforts to support healthy eating and active
living through environmental and policy change strategies. It is a collaboration of the City,
the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District and the Spring Valley community. The
Initiative engages multiple sectors – schools, healthcare, business, and faith communities to
coordinate with residents on actions that will create healthier community environments and
reverse the trends in obesity.
Greater detail of the services administered by the Community Services Department is
provided in the Health and Wellness Element and the Open Space and Recreation
Element.
Facility Needs
La Mesa’s 14 park locations are illustrated on the General Plan map (Figure LD-5 -
Existing Land Uses in the Land Use & Urban Design Element) and are also shown on
Figure PSF-3 - Public Facilities Map and discussed in further detail in the Open Space and
Recreation Element. Parks serve different functions depending on their size, location, and
types of improvements. Neighborhood, community, and Regional parks are examples of
different park types. The Community Services Commission provides an ongoing forum
for citizen input into the operations, maintenance, and development of City parks and
recreation facilities.
In recent years, State and Federal funds for local parks and recreation facilities have
become more competitive. The City has been forced to turn to local resources and
programs to fund park maintenance and development. La Mesa currently charges two
park fees to mitigate the impact of new residential development in the City: a parkland
dedication in-lieu fee as a condition of approval of a tentative map or parcel map, and an
improvement impact fee assessed at the time of construction. Commercial and industrial
developments are exempt from park fees.
It is a goal of the Department to provide the
public with recreation services that are not being
provided by the private sector. Services provided
must meet the needs of the public at a reasonable
cost to the program participant. There must also
be an acceptable cost offset to the Community
Services Department's investment in time and
resources.

the fact that 40% of participants in special events and programs are non-residents. No

special effort is made by the Department to attract non-resident participants. The 40%
figure is considered a testimony to the Community Services Department's reputation for
providing high quality programs. In addition, Harry Griffin Park is a Regional recreation
facility. Management and maintenance of this Regional park are the responsibility of the
City of La Mesa Staff. When planning programs, Department Staff considers offerings
available in surrounding communities and provides activities that complement rather than
compete with activities that are already available nearby.
A near universal response to the newsletter survey questions, "What do you like about
living in San Diego County?" was proximity to beaches and mountains. It is clear that these
are much-appreciated amenities of living in the region. However, as Regional recreation
facilities, e.g., the beaches, Balboa Park, and mountains, become increasingly crowded, and
transportation costs rise, more people will turn to, and demand more of, facilities close to
home. In this way, the La Mesa Community Services Department will feel the impact of
Regional growth.
Community Development
The Community Development Department was created to consolidate several divisions
and functions within the City. This has minimized overlapping responsibilities and
provided more effective program administration. There are three divisions within the
Department:
     •    Building
     •    Planning & Development Services
     •    Housing & Community Development
The services provided by the Department cover a wide range of programs involving the
physical and economic development of the community.
Building Inspection Division
The Building Inspection Division provides a
full range of services needed to enforce the
Uniform Building Codes and other local
building safety programs in La Mesa. This
includes administering the permit process,
plan checking and construction inspection.
The primary goal of this program is public
safety. A key means of achieving public
safety in the community is by ensuring that
the inventory of existing structures and new
development are built and maintained to              The Talmadge development on Guava Avenue under

process (i.e., Building, Planning, Fire, and Engineering). Building Division staff also assists
the permit applicant with other agency approvals needed to get projects underway in
La Mesa. This often includes coordination with other organizations including, Helix
Water District, the local school districts, SDG&E, San Diego County Water Authority
(SDCWA), the County Health Department, the State of California HCD, and the Office
of the State Architect.
In a community like La Mesa, which is essentially built out, there are many projects that
involve difficult sites (e.g., steep slopes or adaptive reuse of existing structures). This
requires that the Building Division have the expertise to work with property owners and
developers to interpret and implement the codes in an effective manner. This often
involves upgrading existing structures to accommodate more intensive uses or to meet
newer, more restrictive codes. Maintaining these services in a cost effective manner, with
self-supporting fees, provides the City with the ability to continually upgrade the City's
building stock as development opportunities arise. All these things will keep La Mesa a
safe place to live and work and a good place to invest.
The Building Division personnel are a key part of the City's overall Public Safety Program.
Staff is trained in the types of structural assessments needed after major natural disasters,
such as earthquakes, to provide the type of expertise needed as part of complete disaster-
preparedness planning. The Building Division is also responsible for the implementation
of various programs needed to keep the City's facilities safe and in compliance with the
latest codes, including such programs as the accessibility requirements of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Planning Division
The Planning Division focuses on tasks primarily related to the development review
process. Coordination of the Development Advisory Board is a key element of the City's
effort to provide the most efficient development review services feasible. Zoning and
Subdivision Ordinance administration are top priorities, therefore, this Section works
directly with some of the key tools used to implement the General Plan. In conjunction
with these tasks, the Planning Division manages the City's programs for urban design,
implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and historic
preservation. The Planning Division is responsible for providing staff support to the
Planning Commission, Historic Preservation Commission, and Design Review Board.
In addition to development review, the Planning Division is responsible for managing the
City's zoning Code Enforcement Program. This involves working with property owners to
achieve compliance with the City's property development and maintenance regulations. If
compliance is not achieved voluntarily, Staff and the City Attorney work through the courts

to correct outstanding violations. This is also an integral part of the City's overall Public
Safety Program.
The Planning Division focuses on long-range
planning projects, as the name implies. It also
has responsibility for managing several other
programs directly related to General Plan
implementation.

Plan.       This requires the synthesis of
information from on-going operations in the City, response to Regional trends, and
integration of demographic data into land use and program policies for the community.
The Planning Division provides professional planning expertise for one other general area
identified as "special projects." This includes assistance with the planning tasks required for
projects and responsibility for representing the City on a variety of Regional planning
projects, such as the Regional Growth Management Strategy prescribed by local ballot
initiative Proposition C, or the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan. The Division
ensures compliance with the Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) and oversees the
monitoring of the Eastridge Open Space Preserve, and works with the State Department of
Water Resources (DWR), San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), and Helix
Water District to achieve common water conservation objectives. An example of this is the
adoption of the City’s Water Efficient Landscape Regulations in 2010. Other examples of
special projects that reflect this Division's varied assignments include projects such as the
Downtown Village Specific Plan, the Civic Center Master Plan, the Grossmont Specific
Plan, and work on an Economic Development Strategy.
Housing Division
The Housing Division manages the City's Federal Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) and HOME programs, which are Federal revenue sources available to help
implement the General Plan. The CDBG program supports social service programs,
which is consistent with the objectives of the General Plan Housing Element. This
program also funds public facility projects in lower income neighborhoods, through the
Capital Improvement Program (CIP). Such projects are required to be consistent with the
General Plan. The HOME program provides funding to support housing activities. This
is a critical part of the City's ability to meet both local and Regional fair share housing
assistance objectives as found in the Housing Element.
The Housing Division is also responsible for providing Staff support to the La Mesa
Community Parking Commission and the Downtown Village Merchants Association.

Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District
The Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District covers a wide area of east San
Diego County including La Mesa, Lemon Grove, El Cajon, Santee, and the
unincorporated area. Voters in the District elect a five-member Board of Trustees to a
four-year term of office.        Facilities include two
campuses.
The Grossmont campus is located north of La Mesa
City limits at the terminus of Lake Murray Boulevard.
Grossmont first convened classes in 1961. The
Grossmont campus is 135 acres in size and serves over
20,000 students every semester.
The first phase of Cuyamaca campus located east of
La Mesa was dedicated in 1978 on a 165-acre site
located northwest of Jamacha Road.               Current            Grossmont College
enrollment at the Cuyamaca campus is 10,000 and is project to grow to 15,000 by 2015.
Both facilities offer vocational training as well as Associate Degree and Certificate of
Achievement programs. Residency within the District is not a requirement of admission.
There is also a five-acre Water Conservation Garden on the Cuyamaca College campus
that provides free how-to information on ways to save water outdoors through the use of
drought-tolerant landscaping. The Garden, which opened in 1999, was created by a
partnership between the Helix and Otay Water Districts in conjunction with the
Community College District. The Water Conservation Garden continues to be a popular
destination and encourages many people to save water by creating their own drought-
tolerant landscaping.
Helix Water District
Helix Water District is a public agency, operating under Irrigation District Law of the State
of California. The District is governed by a five member Board of Directors elected to
four-year terms by the voters residing within the District. The Board is empowered to
establish water charges, levy assessments and adopt all policies, procedures and regulations
regarding water storage and delivery within the boundaries of the District.
District history dates back to 1885 with the formation of the San Diego Flume Company.
Water from Cuyamaca Lake was brought to La Mesa via a 33-mile redwood flume. The
La Mesa Lemon Grove and Spring Valley Irrigation District later purchased the Lake and
the flume to provide water for agricultural purposes. A name change to Helix Irrigation
District and later Helix Water District reflect the diminished importance of agriculture
within the District's service area. The Helix District has been a member of the County
Water Authority since the Authority was established in 1943.

                                                                                          2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Today the Helix Water District covers nearly 50 square miles, serving the communities of
La Mesa, El Cajon, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley, and various unincorporated areas near
El Cajon. Population in the District is 264,000 and has 62,000 customers.
The District's primary water collection and storage facilities are at Lake Cuyamaca, Lake
Jennings and El Capitan Reservoir. Grossmont reservoir, located under Harry Griffin
Park, has a storage capacity of 30 million gallons. Twenty-two other above ground storage
tanks are located throughout the District. Eleven of these are located in La Mesa. The
above ground tanks provide an additional 35 million gallons for a total storage capacity of
68.8 million gallons of water.
In 2010 less than 20% of Helix Water District supply was local runoff from winter rain and
snow releases from Lake Cuyamaca and natural runoff into El Capitan Reservoir. The rest
was a blend of water from the Colorado River and San Diego County Water Authority,
which purchases its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Helix Water District’s per-capita usage of water was 165 gallon per capita per day (gpcd).
By 200 the usage had dropped to 156 gpcd and in 2011, the usage is 106 gpcd. The
residents of La Mesa are outstanding examples of embracing a new water conservation
behavior.
Grossmont Hospital District
The Grossmont Hospital District was established in 1952. At that time, there were no
other major medical facilities in the East County. Today the District covers a 750 square
mile area with a population of 500,000. Governed by a five-member board elected to
two-year terms, the District is one of the
largest in San Diego County.
The facility has nearly 550 beds or
approximately one for every 900 residents in
the District. There are 650 physicians and
2,700 employees are on staff, making the
hospital the largest employer in the East
County. Annual admissions are 26,225. The
emergency room treats an average of 67,401
patients per year. The physicians performed
                                                            Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa
8,551 inpatient and 6,590 outpatient surgeries.
Library Services
The County of San Diego provides library services. A La Mesa branch is located in the
Civic Center complex at 8074 University Avenue. The County is a participant in the Serra
Library System, which provides reciprocal lending arrangements with other libraries
throughout San Diego and Imperial Counties.

La Mesa’s 10,525 square foot Library was completed in 2009, a joint venture between the
City and the County of San Diego. The Library shares the building with the Post Office.
Circulates over 60,000 titles each month, the La Mesa library is one of the top circulating
branches in the San Diego County Library System. Since moving to the new facility, over
700,000 customers have visited the library. Every chair in the library is full most of the
time with customers reading the latest magazines/novels, doing homework, or just relaxing
with their friends.
Staffing levels and hours of
operation are periodically adjusted
to meet budget constraints of San
Diego County. The Library also
has a dedicated group of volunteers,
contributing over 3,000 hours in any
given year.      Over 130 special
programs for children and adults,
sponsored by the La Mesa Branch,
attracted nearly 8,000 participants.
While adult materials are checked               The Library and Post Office Facility Building

out the most, the children and teen
programs are popular. Weekly Story Times usually have 30 to 50 people in attendance
and the Teen Book Club is not only popular in person, but is also available on Podcast.
There is a new program called “Text Message Reference” that gives customers the
opportunity to text the library and ask for answers to reference questions.
The Friends of the La Mesa Library receive generous donations of materials so there is a
plentiful supply of adult books and movies. The Friends of the La Mesa Library also
operate a Bookstore in the Branch and sell donated books and other items, giving the
proceeds back to the Library.
The La Mesa Library is bright and welcoming, with comfortable spaces for all. The Staff is
well-organized, enthusiastic and continues to provide high quality services to the
community.
Regional Services Provided by the County of San Diego
The State of California assigns several major service responsibilities to the counties.
Regional services provided by the County of San Diego include, health and social services
programs, property assessment, property tax collection and distribution, municipal and
superior court, and pollution control. These services are available on an equal basis to all
citizens of the County, regardless of whether they reside in an incorporated or
unincorporated area. The County's Regional services responsibilities are the result of State
mandate; yet rarely are State-mandated programs funded by the State.

Implementation
Planning for future services and facilities is an important role of local government. The
General Plan can assess the potential for growth in the residential and commercial sector.
Public services and facilities are linked to the General Plan through the Capital
Improvement Program (CIP).
The General Plan also has a relation to the City of La Mesa budget and provides goals,
objectives, policies and implementation programs, which are economically sound, in their
attempt to balance community needs with resources. The City will carefully monitor its
finances and establish those measures necessary to efficiently provide services and maintain
facilities within the existing budgetary framework. There is a continuing effort to sustain top
quality services to the community and maintain or improve the facilities and infrastructure
that is necessary to sustain the quality of life in La Mesa.
General Government
A General Law City, La Mesa will continue to operate under a Council/Manager form of
government. A five-member City Council includes a directly elected Mayor.
Senior Management Group
The City Manager's Office acts as coordinator of the Senior Management Group consisting
of all of the City Department heads. This group will use its combined knowledge and
experience to help the City Council guide the City on a sound financial course.
Budget Review Process
The City Manager and the Senior Management Group will use the bi-annual budget
process as a tool to implement the policies and objectives of the City Council and the
General Plan, and to monitor the City's progress in achieving its goals.
Capital Improvement Program
The Five Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a primary method the City has used
to identify and prioritize funding for the kinds of major projects anticipated in the near
future. The CIP process involves the following general steps:
     1. The Public Works Department receives project proposals from all City departments
          and organizes them for review.

Introduction
The Health and Wellness Element describes the measures La Mesa will take to make the
health of the community a key priority and achieve its vision of being the healthiest and
most livable city in the San Diego Region. It offers policy guidance that will enable
La Mesa’s residents to achieve an active lifestyle, have access to healthy food choices, enjoy
a safe, livable community, and raise healthy, active children. La Mesa is projected to add
approximately 8,000 residents in the period between 2010 and 2030. As this growth
occurs, the City will keep health and wellness a priority in its decision-making processes.
In recent years, La Mesa has been working closely with the County of San Diego Public
Health Department and the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District and others to promote
wellness within their jurisdictions. In 2007, an average of 31 percent of students tested in
the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District and Grossmont Union High School District did
not meet State Healthy Fitness Criteria. In addition, the County Health Department
identified the La Mesa/Spring Valley Area as having the highest childhood obesity rates in
                                                         Health & Wellness Element | HW-1

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                              2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
the County. Concern for the health impacts of these troubling statistics led to the formation
of the “ready…set…Live Well” (Live Well) Initiative (2005), which is a collaborative cross-
jurisdictional program to promote wellness in the La Mesa-Spring Valley area. “Live Well”
focuses primarily on environmental change and policy strategies to support healthy eating
and physical activity. Five major goal areas are identified, including: 1) neighborhoods; 2)
schools; 3) public health, health care and fitness; 4) community engagement; and 5)
initiative promotion, tracking, and evaluation.
In early 2009, a Strategic Plan was prepared for the Live Well Initiative. One of the
recommendations from the Strategic Plan was to prepare a Health and Wellness Element
(HWE) as a part of the City’s update of its General Plan to provide a policy framework for
the implementation of the Strategic Plan and to demonstrate the importance of this topic
for the future of the City of La Mesa.
Purpose
The purpose of the Health and Wellness Element is to provide the policy framework to
guide La Mesa’s decisions, programs, processes, infrastructure improvements, and
development activities. The overarching goal of the Health and Wellness Element is to
improve community health and well-being of La Mesa’s residents by encouraging and
supporting their healthful behaviors and choices.
Benefits and outcomes of implementation of the Health and Wellness Element and
interrelated goals in the other General Plan Elements
include:
      • Reduced rate of chronic diseases and obesity
      • Improved quality of life and livability
      • A built environment that supports good health
      • Strong sense of public safety
      • Reduced health care costs
      • Enhanced environmental sustainability
      • Stronger social ties and community cohesion
      • Better health for children
      • Improved productivity of both adults and                 Stairs in Mt. Nebo Neighborhood
          children
      • Stronger economy
The Health and Wellness Element also demonstrates La Mesa’s commitment to taking a
community-based approach to improving public health and sets the stage for evaluating and
monitoring improvement over time.

Organization and Content
The Health and Wellness Element includes an overview of health-related characteristics
and conditions, six goals with related objectives and policies, and a discussion of topics
upon which the City will focus efforts to improve the health and wellness of its residents. A
Glossary of Terms is located in the final pages of this Element.
Community Outreach
Community input provided the foundation for preparation of this Element. Many of the
City’s Boards and Commissions received presentations regarding the General Plan Update
and provided their thoughts as to what should be included. The Environmental
Sustainability Commission, Youth Advisory Commission and Community Services
Commission each hosted a special presentation regarding the Health and Wellness
Element and offered valuable insights and suggestions.
The City of La Mesa held several Community-wide Workshops and Open Houses to
inform the public about the General Plan, including the Health and Wellness Element,
and to provide the opportunity for citizens to comment and provide input. An interactive
workshop specifically focused on the Health and Wellness Element was held April 7,
2011. Several methods were employed to engage and gain feedback from the 50+
participants.
A visioning exercise was conducted to describe the health of La Mesa in 20 years, for the
purpose of developing the Vision Statement to support the Health and Wellness Element.
Other activities included audience polling with instant results through the use of an
audience response system (ARS) and discussion of focused topics for community health
and wellness, including parks and recreation, access to fresh foods, active transportation,
how design has an influence on the health of a community, and the importance of
community connections and involvement.
One activity was a “Healthy Tree” exercise, which illustrated how diseases are a product of
individual behaviors and social, environmental, and economic factors (see following page).
Participants were asked to first identify diseases (outcomes), individual behaviors that could
contribute to some diseases, and potential root causes of diseases (or determinants). The
purpose was to demonstrate how certain factors and behaviors can lead to disease, and to
stimulate discussion as to how General Plan goals and policies could address some of the
root causes and enable people to make healthier choices.

There was general consensus that workshop attendees feel the City’s attention to health and
wellness is very beneficial. Participants expressed concern about the health statistics for the
eastern portion of the County where La Mesa is located, and particular apprehension
regarding the health of the school-age children in the community. Participants voiced
interest in creating more parks and park programming and the importance of feeling safe in
the City’s parks. Benefits of safe walking and biking routes to parks, schools and grocery
stores, and other services used on an everyday basis was emphasized. The importance of
the social aspect of wellness was discussed, including neighborhood cohesion, comfortable
gathering places, and opportunities for participation in government. Retaining La Mesa’s

livability and having clean, well-landscaped and well-maintained neighborhoods and public
areas were emphasized.
Access to fresh, healthful foods was a high priority for the workshop attendees. There was
considerable interest in backyard and community gardens. Some residents encouraged the
City to explore allowing poultry and other farm animals in all single-family neighborhoods.
The potential for the City to facilitate the collection and distribution of excess produce
from residents’ fruit trees and gardens was suggested, as was the idea of the City planting
fruit trees as street trees.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Health and Wellness Element focuses on specific topics to improve overall
community health and well-being and address typical health disparities. However, due to
the broad and interdisciplinary nature of health issues, La Mesa’s General Plan features
goals and polices related to health and wellness in each of the Elements of this General
Plan. Shared topic areas are summarized below and graphically represented in Table

Community Health Awareness and Guidance
The Health and Wellness Element is not required under the California Government
Code; however, Section 65303 of California Government Code authorizes local
jurisdictions to adopt other elements or address additional topics when they relate to the
physical development of the jurisdiction. Once adopted, an optional element carries the
same legal weight as any of the mandatory elements and must be consistent with the other
elements.
While there is currently no adopted legislative guidance for cities desiring to prepare plans
specifically focused on health and wellness, there is urgency on several levels. Nationwide
obesity levels have increased among adults and concerns have been growing about the
burgeoning childhood obesity epidemic. One in four children in San Diego County is
overweight or obese; this is slightly higher than the national average i. In a community often
referenced as "Paradise," many may be surprised to discover an obesity rate in San Diego
County that surpasses the National average. La Mesa’s location in the East County Region
of San Diego County places it in an area with the highest obesity rates in the County. From
the National to local level, efforts are underway to address obesity issues. A sampling of
current efforts is summarized below.
Let’s Move: Let’s Move is a comprehensive initiative, launched by First Lady Michelle
Obama in February 2010, dedicated to solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a
generation so that children born today will grow up healthier and better able to pursue their
dreams. Let’s Move is an effort to put children on a path for healthy living from their
earliest days by giving parents helpful information and fostering environments that support
healthy choices. Efforts include promoting healthy school environments, ensuring access
to healthful nutrition, and encouraging daily physical activity. This initiative emphasizes the
importance of collaboration by parents, elected officials from all levels of government,
schools, health care professionals, faith-based and community-based organizations, and
private sector companies.
Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW): CPPW was created by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is led by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC). It is an effort to address chronic diseases since they are the most
common, most costly, and most preventable of all health diseases. Lack of physical activity
and poor nutrition—the two modifiable risk factors for obesity—and tobacco use are
responsible for much of the illness, suffering, and death related to chronic disease. CPPW
is intended to be a locally driven initiative supporting 50 communities nationwide over a
two-year period to tackle obesity and tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) promotes healthy community design as one way to address obesity and related
health concerns and has made grant funding available to many regions in the nation to fund
improvements.

Healthy Works: In March 2010, the San Diego County Health and Human Services
Agency (HHSA) received a $16 million CDC grant from the CPPW program to promote
and fund healthy community projects. Healthy Works is a component of the County of
San Diego's "Live Well, San Diego! Building Better Health" initiative is a 10-year strategic
vision for improving health and wellness and combating the toll of chronic diseases,
including obesity and tobacco use. Funded in part by the CPPW grant discussed above,
Healthy Works engages San Diego County residents, businesses, and community leaders
in approaches such as farmers markets, community gardens, bike-to-school and work
programs, school exercise and nutrition programs, as well as changes to land use and
transportation. Administered by the County HHSA, Healthy Works involves the
collaborative effort of many local entities, including the Community Health Improvement
Partners (CHIP), the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative, and the San Diego
County Association of Governments (SANDAG), among others.
SANDAG: HHSA partnered with SANDAG to implement the components of the
Healthy Works project related to regional planning, active transportation, and safe routes
to school. This work is supported by $3 million in grant funds and will be completed by
February 2012. Six initiatives comprise SANDAG’s Healthy Works efforts: Healthy
Impact and Assessment, Regional Comprehensive Planning Policy, Healthy Communities
Campaign, Safe Routes to Schools Implementation, Active Commuter Transportation
Campaign, and Regional Bicycle Implementation Campaign. As a Healthy Works partner,
SANDAG awarded over $1 million through four pass-through grant programs to local
agencies, tribal governments, community programs, and school districts to incorporate
public health considerations in planning, active transportation, and safe routes to school
projects. La Mesa has received funds from this grant for Safe Routes to Schools, Safe
Routes to Transit, and a Parks and Recreation Master Plan. This infrastructure will
encourage walkability within the City.
San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative (COI): The COI is a public-private
partnership whose mission is to reduce and prevent childhood obesity in San Diego
County by creating healthy environments for all children and families through advocacy,
education, policy development, and environmental change. To fulfill its mission, the COI
creates, supports, and mobilizes partners from multiple sectors; provides leadership and
vision; and coordinates county-wide efforts in the prevention and reduction of childhood
obesity. The advocacy efforts of the COI with respect to local government include:
     •  Promoting local sustainable food production through urban agriculture and
        community gardens;
     •  Promoting the incorporation of Health and Wellness Goals and Policies into
        General Plan updates.

Private Foundations: Private foundations such as the Kaiser Foundation and the Robert
Woods Johnson Foundation have made our Nation’s health and wellness a priority and
play an important role by providing funding for efforts by La Mesa and other local
governments to make both systems and long-term policy changes to create more livable
and healthy communities. This Health and Wellness Element is made possible by a grant
from the Kaiser Foundation.
Health-Related Characteristics and Conditions
This section summarizes community characteristics and conditions that describe and have
an impact on the health of those who live and work in La Mesa.
Demographics
The demographic profile of a community can be one of the predictors of the health of its
residents. Research indicates that race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and education
have implications for health-related outcomes, both at the individual and community levels.
Age plays a role as well, as older residents tend to have higher rates of chronic disease.
According to the 2010 Census, La Mesa has a population of 57,065 residents. Non-
Hispanic White persons account for approximately 61.9% of residents, while Hispanic
residents make up approximately 20.5% of the population. The percentage of Black and
Asian persons is approximately 7.2% and 5.5%, respectively, and the remainder of the
population is made up 1.2% of American Indian, Hawaiian and Pacific Islander and other
ethnicities, and 3.7% for those of two or more races.
As indicated in Figures HW-1 and HW-2, the composition of La Mesa’s population will
become both more diverse and older over the 2030 planning period. These trends mean
that the City and its health and wellness partners will need to consider factors such as
culture, language, and mobility constraints associated with age when they plan for and
institute programs, resources, and services to influence healthy behaviors and health
outcomes. For example, health facilities should be encouraged within walking distance of
transit stops for those who must rely on transit.

Sources of culturally appropriate food should be accessible and affordable to all residents.
An aging population will require recreational programming that supports the
specializedneeds of seniors, as well as infrastructure improvements that consider those with
physical limitations and disabilities.

Health Outcomes
There are many factors that influence individual and community health. According to the
Institute of Medicine, individual factors—such as genetics, age, existing health conditions,
and access to healthcare account for approximately 30 percent of health outcomes. Other
determinants that contribute to health outcomes include:
    •    Access to services and infrastructures other than healthcare (such as parks and
         recreational facilities, education, community centers, and transportation);
    •    Living and working conditions (such as housing, access to purveyors of healthful
         food, employment, and environmental quality); and
    •    Social, economic, and political factors (such as poverty, racism, social cohesion, and
         political participation).
According to the CDC, chronic diseases account for 70 percent of all deaths in the U.S.,
and also cause major limitations in daily living for almost one out of 10 Americans iii. The
U.S. National Center for Health Statistics characterizes chronic diseases as those that last
three months or more. They generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by
medications, do not just “go away,” and tend to become more prevalent with age. Chronic
diseases include heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular diseases (including hypertension

and stroke), diabetes, and respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease or COPD and asthma).
Chronic diseases account for the majority of the leading causes of death for the State of
California, San Diego County, and the East Region of San Diego County, of which
La Mesa is a part. (The East Region is one of six regions in San Diego County that were
created by the HHSA for the purpose of collecting and analyzing community data.)
Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they
are also among the most preventable. According to 3-4-50: Chronic Disease in San Diego
County (prepared by HHSA), three behaviors—poor nutrition, lack of physical exercise,
and tobacco and substance use—contribute to four chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease
and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and respiratory conditions), which result in over 50 percent of
deaths in San Diego County iv and over 55 percent of deaths in the East Region. Figure
HW-3 shows how death rates from five chronic diseases compared in 2007 for La Mesa,
East Region, and San Diego County.
Figure HW-3. Deaths Due to Selected Chronic Diseases, 2007 (Rates per 100,000
Population)
Source: County of San Diego, HHSA, Community Health Statistics, 4/12/2010
While the death rates in the East Region exceed those of San Diego County for all chronic
diseases shown, the death rates in La Mesa exceed those of both the East Region and San
Diego for all chronic diseases shown except diabetes. 3-4-50: Chronic Disease in San
Diego County identifies possible risk factors for each of the six HHSA regions. Although
cities or communities are not discussed individually, the risk factors for East County may
shed some light on reasons why La Mesa’s death rate from chronic diseases is high.
                                                                Health & Wellness Element | HW-11

According to 3-4-50: Chronic Disease in San Diego Count v:
     •    Adults in the East Region were more likely to have ever smoked and more likely to
          be current smokers than most other regions.
     •    East Region residents had poorer nutrition than the rest of the County.
     •    East Region adults were more likely to be overweight or obese than adults in other
          Regions in the County.
     •    Other socio-economic determinants, such as age, also are likely to contribute to
          the higher death rate due to chronic diseases for La Mesa.
Obesity is a significant public health challenge that is linked to many chronic diseases.
Obesity rates for adults have doubled and rates for children have tripled in the U.S. since
1980; today, more than 34 percent of adults and 16 percent of children are now considered
obese vi. The CDC observes that “American society has become ‘obesogenic,’ characterized
by environments that promote increased food intake, nonhealthful foods, and physical
inactivity vii.” While not as high as the U.S. percentage, the percentage of adults in San
Diego County has increased significantly as well, from 7.3 percent in 1985 to 23.1 percent
in 2009. Figure HW-4 shows the increase in the obesity trend for adults in San Diego
County from 1985 to 2009. As noted earlier in this Element, the high rate of obesity in
children is what prompted the Live Well Initiative in La Mesa.

                                                                                               2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
According to obesity data collected between 2001 and 2007 for San Diego County by the
CHIS, Blacks have the highest obesity rate, followed by Hispanics, Whites, and Asians.
The City’s projected changing ethnic composition should be considered when La Mesa
health and wellness partners consider policies and programs to reduce obesity rates.
Being overweight or obese during childhood and adolescence has both short-term and
long-term health-related consequences. In the short-term, it increases the risk of
developing high cholesterol, hypertension, respiratory ailments, orthopedic problems,
depression, and type 2 diabetes as a youth. In the long-term, overweight adolescents have a
70 percent chance of becoming overweight or obese adults, which increases to 80 percent if
one or more parent is overweight or obese viii.
Making healthful choices, such as being physically active, eating nutritious foods and
avoiding tobacco use, can prevent or lessen the serious effects of many chronic diseases ix.
For example, regular physical exercise reduces the risk of premature mortality, coronary
heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, hypertension, and osteoporosis; improves mental
health conditions such as depression and anxiety; and, in conjunction with a healthy diet,
plays an important role in preventing overweight and obese adults, adolescents, and
children x.
Built Environment
The quality, conditions, and design of the built environment—including buildings, roads,
trails, public and private infrastructure, and parks—can have both direct and indirect effects
on a community’s health. Land use patterns and densities can influence opportunities
residents have for making healthful choices, such as
the amount of physical activity people get and the People living in highly walkable, mixed-use
overall livability of the community. The integration of communities are more than twice as likely
land use and transportation planning can create              to get more than 30 or more minutes of
environments that reduce reliance on the use of
                                                            daily exercise as people who live in more
personal automobiles and encourage more active
modes of transportation. The location of parks and              auto-dependent neighborhoods. xi
their distance from residential neighborhoods
correlates to the amount of physical activity people get
each week. The built environment also has an impact on the ways people interact with
each other and their community, which influences community connections and social well-
being.
As part of its efforts to address health and wellness and promote active living, the City has
prepared a number of studies to understand the existing conditions and barriers that must
be overcome related to the built environment and to prepare plans for future
improvements. These Plans are described below. Implementation requires funding;
La Mesa has been highly successful with attaining grant funding and leveraging scarce

resources in making improvements to its built environment that will result in health
benefits.
     •  A Walkability Plan was prepared in 2006 to help La Mesa achieve its goal of
        becoming a more walkable city and allow residents to make everyday trips without
        the use of the personal automobile.            The Walkability Plan features a
        comprehensive look at the existing barriers to walking experienced by pedestrians
        and presents an equally comprehensive plan to improve the City’s pedestrian
        environment.
     •  A Sidewalk Master Plan was adopted in 2008 to identify where sidewalks need to
        be extended and connections made and to prioritize future improvements.
     •  Several Safe Routes to Schools projects have been accomplished to improve the
        pedestrian and bicycling environment for school children. A Safe Routes to Transit
        project was completed in 2011 to identify and prepare strategies to address barriers
        to transit use.
     •  La Mesa’s existing bicycle route network is sparse, particularly in the older part of
        the City south of I-8, and many of the bike routes are not connected. A Bicycle
        Facilities Plan and Alternative Transportation Plan was adopted in 2012 to address
        the existing deficiencies, provide a framework for the future development of the
        City’s bicycle network, and to ensure La Mesa’s bicycle routes connect to the
        Regional bicycle network.
Even though La Mesa is nearly built out, opportunities exist through market-driven reuse
and recycling of existing development to incorporate public health considerations into both
new and infill development, including pedestrian- and transit-oriented development,
improved connectivity, and improved access to parks. Although many of these future
efforts and opportunities are also addressed in other Elements of the General Plan, they
are brought together and highlighted in the Health and Wellness Element to demonstrate
how implementation of the General Plan will improve the built environment in a manner
that supports La Mesa’s vision of becoming the healthiest and most livable city in the
region.
Pedestrian- and Transit-Oriented Development: The arrival of trolley service in La Mesa
in 1989 brought about an effort to concentrate the City’s planning efforts around the trolley
stations, including the application of a Mixed-Use Urban Overlay Zone to the City’s
transportation corridors, which can support and are designated for higher density
development. In order to accommodate the projected population increase and protect
La Mesa’s single-family residential neighborhoods, the City will continue to intensify the
corridors identified for mixed-use and higher density development near the transit stations
and along the City’s transit corridors. New infill development is encouraged near each of
La Mesa’s five transit stations. There is potential for compact redevelopment along the

City’s main mixed-use corridors of El Cajon Boulevard and University Avenue, where
revitalization should include improving walkability, landscaping, safety, and circulation. As
a major node, La Mesa’s Downtown Village and Civic Center will be enhanced with new
streetscapes and uses for increased pedestrian mobility. The Grossmont Center and
Grossmont Medical Campus represent a major District in La Mesa and will continue to
develop with new uses in future years, representing opportunities for innovative,
sustainable, pedestrian- and transit-friendly design.
Improved Connectivity to Increase Physical Activity: The City is roughly bisected into four
quadrants by two freeways, Interstate 8 and SR-125, which provide excellent automobile
access, but present challenges for pedestrian and bicycle access, and barriers to
connectivity. Sidewalks are well-connected and complete in some areas of the City, while
in others they are not present, exist on only one side of the street, and/or gaps are present
and connectivity is lacking. The City’s topography presents challenges to connectivity as
well, since the existing development pattern makes constructing new sidewalks or closing
gaps difficult due to homes constructed close to the street, winding roadways, and a
resulting lack of available right-of-way. It is also the choice of residents near the County
border to maintain their neighborhood’s character and not have sidewalks.
As funding becomes available, the Sidewalk Plan, Walkability Plan, and Bicycle Facilities
Plan and Alternative Transportation Plans will continue to be implemented to improve
opportunities for active transportation. The City will also look for opportunities to
construct streetscape improvements similar to the project along Allison Avenue in the Civic
Center area of La Mesa (completed in 2010-2011), which is an excellent example of using
the guidance from Complete Streets Legislation to improve the street environment to
accommodate all users. The project included widening the sidewalks, providing safer
crossing for pedestrians, enhanced transit stops, improved accommodation for bicyclists,
and attractive landscaping for an overall more pleasant experience.
Improved Access to Parks: Although most of La Mesa’s residents live within one-half mile
of a park, the City desires to provide even better access to parks to encourage residents to
engage in regular physical activity. In 2011, the City received a grant to prepare a City-wide
Parks Master Plan. As part of this Plan, the City has set a standard for all residents to have
access to a park within a 15-minute walk of their homes. Implementation of the Parks
Master Plan will ensure better access to the City’s parks, and added and expanded facilities,
activities, and programming for residents.

Implementation
The Health and Wellness Element provides the policy framework for implementation of
the Strategic Plan for the Live Well Initiative and future implementation programs, plans,
and other actions. This section describes how implementation of the Goals, Objectives,
and Policies of the Health and Wellness Element can improve opportunities for residents
to make appropriate choices that are necessary for good health. It also illustrates how the
interrelationship of Goals, Objectives, and Policies throughout the General Plan can
influence factors that affect community health. This section demonstrates the City’s
commitment to taking a community-based approach to improving public health by working
with community partners to make public health and wellness priorities for the community,
such as through the Live Well Initiative.
                                                              A healthy community is one that embraces

    •    Community-Based Collaboration for Health
One of the goals of both the Strategic Plan and the Health and Wellness Element is to
evaluate the degree to which individual behaviors are changing and community health and
wellness outcomes are improving as a result of implementation of these policies, strategies,
and programs. This requires collecting and assessing data to measure progress over time.
La Mesa can evaluate how health outcomes in the community are changing by identifying
and tracking a variety of indicators, such as rates of obesity in adults and children, chronic
disease rates, the number of miles added to the City’s bicycle network, the percentage of

people who live within 15 minutes walking distance to a park, and the number and location
of community gardens. Indicators also can help the City measure its progress compared
with other cities in San Diego County, in California, and the nation. Much of the
information included in the Health Outcomes and Built Environment sections and many
of the objectives and policies of the Health and Wellness Element can form the basis for
indicators. The indicators may be measured by readily available data, such as those
currently collected by the City and San Diego County, while others may require
preparation and administration of surveys or other data collection methodologies.
Indentifying and tracking indicators will assist the City and its community partners in
measuring progress over time and fine-tuning its policies, strategies, and implementation
programs. Figure HW-5 depicts graphical representations of potential physical indicators
La Mesa may use to measure progress in achieving changes to the built environment.

Access to Healthful Food and Community Food Security
La Mesa will strive to ensure all residents have access to healthy food on an equitable basis
and improve the security of the City’s food system. Community food security is achieved
when all community members can obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally
adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance
and social justice. Community food security also involves creating and/or supporting local,
regional, and family-scale farmers and linking consumers and growers.
Although La Mesa is well-served by outlets offering healthful food options, such as grocery
stores and healthy food outlets, the Health and Wellness Element supports many forms of
urban agriculture,
which can greatly
increase the City’s
food security. Com-

common areas around multi-family developments give everyone the opportunity to grow
healthy food for themselves and their families. Backyard gardens and edible landscaping
make productive use of private land. To discourage waste, excess produce should be
collected and distributed to vulnerable populations including children, the elderly and low-
income residents. The City supports residents raising poultry (no roosters) in backyard
areas and provides nuisance regulations to protect neighbors.
Additional methods to support opportunities for residents to make healthful food choices
include encouraging outlets that offer fresh, locally grown produce, such as La Mesa’s
Farmer’s Market and restaurants, to sell and/or serve
locally grown products. The City provides gardening
education programs for residents and local schools, and
encourages nutritional programs to benefit those
vulnerable populations that have the greatest need, such
as children, seniors, and low-income residents. Planning
for La Mesa’s first community garden began in 2011 as a
joint-use project between the City of La Mesa and Helix
                                                                            La Mesa Farmer’s Market
Charter High School. A grant received by the City
provided the “seed money” to collaborate with the School District and allow both the
students and the community to participate in raising fresh, nutritious food. Building on the
success of La Mesa’s first community garden, the City has the opportunity to expand its
efforts in promoting and providing accommodation for better community food security by
supporting more community and school gardens.

Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles
Every day, millions of Americans make the choice to live healthier lives. The City of
La Mesa recognizes it can serve an important role by
providing residents with information they can use to People who live within walking distance
practice healthy living. Some of the methods employed (e.g., ¼ mile) of a park are 25 percent
by the City include using the City’s website, printed more likely to meet the minimum weekly
materials, signage, maps and other means to educate and exercise recommendation of three times
inform residents of the varied and abundant

opportunities to take part in physical activity in La Mesa
and the surrounding areas. In addition to promoting City-sponsored programs and
sporting activities offered in La Mesa’s parks, joint-use areas, Community Center, and
Adult Enrichment Center, the City can expand efforts to find creative ways to offer fun
activities that also provide physical activity, such as sponsoring community walks targeted
specifically for segments of the community with common interests, like teens, families,
seniors, cultures, and ethnicities.
La Mesa’s efforts to promote healthy lifestyles, when combined with the efforts of others,
like the Kaiser Foundation, who places TV and radio announcements promoting physical
activity, healthful eating and active living—will help instill the value that individual, family,
and community health is important and should be the norm.
Social media has come to play an important role in the way Americans access information,
and it can be an effective mechanism for disseminating promotional material about active
living and nutrition. This trend is expected to continue. Social media refers to web-based
and mobile technologies to turn communication into an interactive dialogue. Young adults
in particular are more likely to get their news from the social media sites they frequent than
traditional methods such as newspapers, television, or radio news. The City has an
adopted Social Media Policy and will continue to monitor and expand its use when
appropriate.
La Mesa will consider adopting a “Wayfinding Program” to connect residents with the
activity centers in the City, including the parks, stairs, bicycle paths, trails, schools,
Community Center, Adult Enrichment Center, and non-profits that provide recreational
programming such as the YMCA, Boys and Girls Club and Joan Kroc Community Center
located just west of La Mesa’s City boundary. Wayfinding is essentially a signage program
to convey directions to travelers. Signage should be easily read, clearly identified, feature a
consistent look and feel, and should be prominently displayed. The City can also ensure
that signage for health care providers is easy to read, clear of obstruction by other structures
or vegetation, and is visible to those using modes of transportation other than the personal
automobile.
A Community Physical Activity Plan (CPAP) is an action plan to promote physical activity.
It comprehensively identifies the places and programs in a given geographical area to

participate in physical activity and provides information to residents as to how to connect
with and participate in those activities. A CPAP is also a motivational tool to encourage
those inactive members of the community to take part in active living, recognizing that
increased physical activity leads to improved quality of life. The City will consider
preparing a CPAP as part of its promotional efforts for healthy lifestyles.
La Mesa’s Focus on Its Children
Obesity is one of the most pressing health concerns for children in our country. It is
complicated by vehicular-dominated transportation systems, a pedestrian-unfriendly built
environment, and poor nutrition habits. La Mesa is located in an area of San Diego
County that has been identified as having the highest rates of childhood obesity in the
County. In the 2007-2008 school year, 30% of 5th graders and 32% of 7th graders in the
La Mesa-Spring Valley School District were outside the Healthy Fitness Zone (HFZ), a
measure of body mass index. The percentage of 9th grade students not in the HFZ at high
schools serving La Mesa ranged from 22% - 48%.
The City of La Mesa values its children and recognizes this Plan represents their future.
Children’s health can be improved by changing the environment so that children will move
more and eat well. Much can be done to improve the physical environment in the City
and on or near school campuses to offer more abundant opportunities for physical activity.
The plan to increase access to healthful food and increase community food security is
refined further in this section to focus specifically on La Mesa’s kids.
La Mesa has established a collaborative relationship with some local schools to improve
children’s health and will continue to expand these efforts.
                                                                      Active living research has shown

exercise into a student’s school day. La Mesa will continue to
improve the sidewalks, bike lanes and intersections, and will
adopt safety programs near schools to encourage more children to walk and bike to school.
Locating parks near schools and continuing to adopt joint-use agreements between the City
and local schools can expand the availability of fields for both organized and free play
activities. Coordinating use of school and park amenities also helps build community and
extends the ability to offer a broader range of park and recreational programming options
through the use of an expanded range of facilities.
The YMCA, Boys and Girls Club, and Joan Kroc Center are organizations that offer a
wide variety of health-related programming and activities to La Mesa’s kids, and provide
opportunities for collaboration with the City. Each of these organizations has local
recreational facilities and offer classes, camps, sports, educational activities, trained staff,

and more. Partnering with such organizations expands the ability of both the City and the
particular organization to promote active living, in particular for children.
Nutrition and learning go hand in hand. Kids who are nutritionally fit are more likely to
have the energy, stamina, and self-esteem that enhance their ability to learn. Teaching
children how to eat healthful foods will enable them to
establish a foundation of good nutrition and healthful School and community gardens teach
lifestyle habits that will benefit them for the rest of their children that vegetables come from

                                                                   someplace other than the grocery

help bolster healthy eating habits. School gardens offer
opportunities for fun and physical activity while also serving as an important educational
tool to help students understand how healthy food is produced and where their food
comes from. Current research suggests that, when used as part of a nutrition education
strategy, school gardens can increase knowledge of fruits and vegetables and influence
behavioral change among children. Leading by example, and promoting school programs
that offer healthy school meals, limiting beverage vending machines to water only, and
working with local youth sports organizations to implement healthy eating policies are
additional ways the City of La Mesa can promote healthy lifestyles for the City’s youth.
Safety and Security as it Relates to Health
Increasing healthy outcomes is dependent on an environment where residents both are and
feel safe and secure. People are more likely to choose active transportation options of
walking and biking to school, work, the store, and transit stops when they perceive that
those routes are safe. For example, parks, community gathering spaces, transit stops, and
residential developments with overgrown landscaping or those that have been designed
without “eyes on the street” can affect both real and perceived safety. Incomplete
sidewalks mean people must walk in the street, which results in a real increased physical
safety risk, while walking on a connected sidewalk network that is isolated by adjacent
property may result in a perceived safety risk. The Health and Wellness Element supports
the Safety, Circulation, and Land Use and Urban Design Elements by addressing the ways
in which improving the safety of the City’s public infrastructure, crime and violence
prevention, design for special pedestrian populations (children, seniors, and those with
disabilities), and violence prevention can positively affect healthy behaviors and choices.
The manner in which the built environment—such as buildings, sidewalks, streets, parks,
and landscaping—is designed and maintained can impact both the legitimate use of the
environment and opportunities for crime. Crime Prevention Through Environmental
Design (CPTED) is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring criminal behavior through
HW-26 | Health & Wellness Element

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                                2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
the design of the built environment, including buildings; parking lots and garages; parks,
open spaces, plazas, and courtyards; transit stops and stations; exposed uses such as ATMs;
and landscaping. It applies relatively simple design techniques to the built environment in
both the public and private realms to increase the legitimate use of a space and deter crime.
CPTED encourages the use of design techniques to promote the creation of defensible
space; fostering a sense of ownership of a space; promoting opportunities for informal and
formal surveillance; employing appropriate types and quantities of lighting; and utilizing
landscaping to both provide an attractive environment that generates pride and ownership
and allow visual observation. The City’s implementation of CPTED techniques will help
ensure that new and redeveloped private and public buildings, infrastructure, and
developments are active, inviting, secure spaces that incorporate techniques to deter crime.
Even the ideally designed space will not promote actual or perceived safety if it is poorly
maintained—conditions such as litter, weeds, graffiti, broken windows, and boarded up
buildings give the impression that a place is abandoned and not safe. La Mesa’s
implementation of policies and programs to abate graffiti and promote property
maintenance will enhance the perception of safety and may deter vandalism, loitering, and
gang activity.
The City is committed to increasing opportunities for people to make safe active
transportation choices. Implementation of the Walkability Plan and Sidewalk Master Plan
will reduce existing barriers to walking, especially in the
geographic areas that are considered challenging for Children who walk or bike to school have

will improve the safety of bicyclists by addressing the

Health and Wellness Element also includes Policies to ensure the specialized mobility
needs of children, individuals with disabilities, and an aging population are met in the
design and construction of public improvements.
Prevention of violence and crimes against persons and property also has an effect on
overall physical and mental health. There is a growing body of research that shows that
both the experience of victimization and the anxiety or fear of crime have impacts on
health by causing symptoms such as stress, sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, depression,
and health-harming “coping” mechanisms (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use and abuse) xvii. The
City’s violent crime rate, FBI Index Crime Rate, and property crime rate (per 1,000
population) have decreased between 19 and 22 percent between 2006 and 2010.

However, its crime rates in all three categories are higher than the average for the entire
San Diego region (all cities and the County) xviii. The City will continue to improve the safety
and security of those who live and work in La Mesa through its emphasis on community
policing and other safety programs and services. Examples include the following:
    •   The City’s Crime Free Multi-Housing Crime Prevention Program, which is a
        cooperative partnership between Police Department staff and owners and managers
        to enhance the quality of life for residents living in apartment complexes
        throughout La Mesa. The Program includes an inspection of the property to assess
        any recommendations for crime prevention measures, training for owners and
        managers, organizing meetings with tenants, the use of a “Crime Free” lease
        addendum, and periodic follow-up meetings.
    •   Business Crime Prevention and Residential Crime Prevention presentations, which
        are available through the Crime Prevention Unit at no charge.
    •   The City’s Anti-Graffiti Program and Crime Stoppers Tagger Tip Line.
    •   Kidz Watch, a free safety academy for children ages 6 to 11offered by the La Mesa
        Police Department.
    •   Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol or "RSVP," where active seniors donate their time
        to patrol the City, conduct vacation security checks, visit elderly and homebound
        citizens, and provide information and services to the public.
Community-Based Collaboration for Health
La Mesa’s Live Well initiative, described in the Introduction to this Element, demonstrates
the City’s commitment to a cross-jurisdictional, collaborative approach to wellness. A
policy team with members from government, education, healthcare, public works, public
health, parks and recreation, academia, faith, and youth and family coalitions was formed
and prepared a strategic plan to create communities (La Mesa and Spring Valley) that are
the healthiest in the Region. Live Well features a Community Ambassador (CA) program
to support grassroots involvement in policy and systems change in both La Mesa and
Spring Valley. The CA program is also intended to facilitate broad-based participation and
leadership. CAs may be part of existing community groups, such as PTA, Neighborhood
Watch, or youth groups, or they may simply have an interest in engaging their neighbors on
health topics. As funding becomes available, the Live Well initiative will continue to
expand efforts aimed at creating healthy communities.
A number of organizations with facilities, programs, and activities that promote health are
presently located in or near La Mesa. The YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, and Joan Kroc
Center are discussed in the La Mesa’s Focus on Its Children section of this Element.
Partnerships already exist with some of the local schools and health care providers. The

City has made it a priority to work with the County HHSA on Region-wide health and
wellness initiatives and will continue to do so.
Community-based collaborations can offer a solution to many problems, like competition
between similar types of organizations for resources, disjointed services in the community,
issues that require more than one approach, or when there are more community needs
than available resources. At their best, collaborations do not just add, but multiply each
organization's strengths, allowing them to do together what they could not have
accomplished alone.

responds to the special characteristics of the
City’s housing environment. This Housing Element incorporates the most current data
and information readily available at the time of writing. It also includes an evaluation of the
Housing Element adopted in 2005, an assessment of the current and potential housing
actions, and an assessment of resources of the private sector and all levels of the public
sector.
This La Mesa Housing Element is prepared for the 2013-2020 update cycle for
jurisdictions in the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) region.
Purpose and Content
The Housing Element of the General Plan is designed to provide the City with a
coordinated and comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent, and
affordable housing within the community. A priority of both State and local governments,
Government Code Section 65580 states the intent of creating housing elements:
                                                                       Housing Element | HE-1

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                         2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
        The availability of housing is of vital Statewide importance, and the early
        attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
        California family is a priority of the highest order.
Per State Law, the Housing Element has two main purposes:
    •   To provide an assessment of both current and future housing needs and constraints
        in meeting these needs; and
    •   To provide a strategy that establishes housing goals, policies, and programs.
The Housing Element is an eight-year plan for the 2013-2020 period and serves as an
integrated part of the General Plan, but is updated more frequently to ensure its relevancy
and accuracy. The Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
    •   Matching housing supply with need;
    •   Maximizing housing choice throughout the community;
    •   Assisting in the provision of affordable housing choices;
    •   Removing government and other constraints to housing investment; and
    •   Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
    •   A profile and analysis of the City’s demographics, housing characteristics, and
        existing and future housing needs.
    •   An analysis of constraints to housing production and maintenance. Constraints
        include potential market, governmental, and environmental limitations to meeting
        the City’s identified housing needs.
    •   An overview of resources available to further housing production and maintenance.
        Resources include land available for new construction, opportunities for
        rehabilitation and revitalization, and financial and administrative resources available
        for implementing housing programs. In addition, this section also examines
        opportunities for energy conservation.
    •   An assessment of housing accomplishments during the previous Housing Element
        period, 2005-2010.
    •   A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City’s identified housing needs,
        including a formulation of housing goals, policies, and programs.

is dominated by a series of geologic features known as marine terraces. Over the past 2.5
million years, stream erosion has cut canyons through these terraces which help to define

communities and Sub-Regions. Alvarado Creek and Chollas Creek, which are defining
features of La Mesa, are examples of terrace cutting streams. These natural drainage
systems are now important urban drainage systems which continue to be an important
factor in the shaping the form and development of the community.
To understand the current land use and development patterns that exist in La Mesa, it is
important to understand the general history of the settlement of the area. The area now
occupied by La Mesa was part of the early Rancho de la Mission San Diego de Alcala as
created by Spanish colonists. However, settlement of the area did not begin in earnest until
the late 1800s after California was annexed to the United States. The post-war period
resulted in tremendous growth throughout Southern California with La Mesa being no
exception. Residential neighborhoods bloomed along the University and El Cajon
corridors, and on the north side of the City along Lake Murray Boulevard and Baltimore
Drive. La Mesa grew in size as well as in population during this period.
Today, La Mesa is known as the “Jewel of the Hills” and is very typical of other suburban
communities in terms of the distribution and range of land use in the community.
According to the 2010 Census, the City population was 57,065, an increase of about four
percent in the ten years since the 2000 Census. The 2010 Census also reported a slight
increase in average household size from 2.2 persons per household in 2000 to 2.4 persons
in 2010.
La Mesa offers a mix of housing types. Single-family homes make up about 54 percent of
the housing stock, the multi-family share is about 45 percent, and mobile homes comprise
the remaining one percent.
Public Participation
Citizen participation is one of the most important components of the Housing Element
process. The City of La Mesa Community Development Department utilized the following
strategy to solicit meaningful community input in preparing the City’s 2013-2020 Housing
Element.
Housing Element and Historic Preservation Element Workshop
On August 25, 2011, the City conducted a community workshop on the Housing and
Historic Preservation Elements of the General Plan. The meeting flyer was posted on the
City’s upcoming events section of the website. An email blast was sent to remind the 130
people on the General Plan “Notify Me” list. The Historic Preservation Element also
maintains a separate list of about 20 interested people. An email reminding them of the
upcoming meeting was sent twice prior to the meeting. In addition, the meeting flyer was
mailed to interested parties, key service providers, and public agencies. The meeting was
attended by over 50 residents and representatives from a range of agencies and
organizations.
During the workshop, participants were invited to discuss several specific housing topics:
    •   What types of housing services and programs would you like to see if La Mesa?

A list of the agencies invited and a summary of the comments received are included in
Appendix A.
Public Hearings
Public hearings will be conducted before the Planning Commission and City Council to
review the Draft Housing Element. The meetings will be publicly noticed and agencies on
the City’s mailing list to receive information on the Housing Element update will be
notified (see list in Appendix A).
Public Review of Draft Housing Element
The Draft La Mesa Housing Element was available for public review at the following
locations:
    •   City Hall
    •   City Library
    •   City Website
Data Sources and Methodology
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information are consulted. The
2010 Census provides the basis for population and household characteristics. However,
the 2010 Census no longer contains detailed information on household, income, and
housing characteristics. Therefore, several sources are used to supplement the 2010
Census, including the following:
    •   2005-09 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau 1
    •   Population and demographic data updated by the State Department of Finance
    •   Housing market information, such as home sales and rents, from Dataquick and
        Realtytrack, among other sources
    •   Lending patterns from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database
    •   Labor statistics from California Employment Development Department
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The City of La Mesa’s General Plan contains goals and policies for urban development,
community design, housing, natural hazards, economic development, and public services
and facilities.

    The American Community Survey (ACS) is conducted on a very small sample of the population. As
    such, the data tend to have large margins of errors, especially for the more detailed levels of questions
    and small geographic units. Therefore, this Housing Element may not present all ACS data available
    when the margins are errors appear to be unreasonable.

The Land Use Element sets forth the amount and type of residential development
permitted under the General Plan, thereby affecting housing opportunity in La Mesa. In
addition, the Land Use Element contains policies directed at maintaining the existing
housing stock, as well as ensuring the quality of new residential development. The
Circulation Element contains policies to minimize roadway traffic into residential
neighborhoods and the Noise Element sets forth policies to minimize the level of noise in
neighborhoods. The Conservation and Open Space Element establishes development
standards to minimize the impact of residential development on sensitive resources, such
as hillside areas, ecological habitat, and scenic view sheds. Finally, the Safety Element sets
forth policies to ensure the safety of the City's housing stock through such measures as
code enforcement, and mitigation of environmental hazard (such as wildfires and flooding)
as conditions to development.
The City must also ensure that adequate water and sewer services are available to
accommodate the growth anticipated in the Housing Element. In the event of a shortage in
water supply or sewage capacity, affordable housing will be given priority for allocation
pursuant to SB 1087. Upon adoption of the Housing Element, the City will send a copy of
the Housing Element to the various water and sewer service providers.
This Housing Element was updated as part of the comprehensive update to the General
Plan Elements and therefore is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals set forth
by the General Plan. Specifically, new State Law requires that the Safety and Conservation
Elements include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management
information upon revisions to the Housing Element. Through the City’s Annual General
Plan Implementation Review Process, the City will ensure internal consistency among the
various elements of the General Plan.

Goals and Policies
The La Mesa Housing Element includes the following goals:
    •   Maintain and enhance the quality of existing residential neighborhoods in La Mesa.
    •   Encourage adequate provision of a wide range of housing by location, type of unit,
        and price to meet the existing and future needs of La Mesa residents.
    •   Provide increased opportunities for home ownership.
    •   Provide housing support services to address the needs of the City’s low and
        moderate income residents.
    •   Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of their choice.
Community Profile
The City strives to achieve a balanced housing stock that meets the varied needs of all
income segments of the community. To understand the City’s housing needs, the nature
of the existing housing stock and the housing market are comprehensively evaluated. This
section of the Housing Element discusses the major components of housing needs in
La Mesa, including population, household, economic, and housing stock characteristics.
Each of these components is presented in a Regional context, and where relevant, in the
context of other nearby communities. This assessment serves as the basis for identifying
the appropriate goals, policies, and programs for the City to implement during the 2013-
2020 Housing Element cycle.
Population Characteristics
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the
future needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the type and amount of
housing needs in a community. Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and
employment trends are factors that combine to influence the type of housing needed and
the ability to afford housing. The following section describes and analyzes the various
population characteristics and trends that affect housing needs.
Population Growth
The Census reported that La Mesa’s population rose from 52,931 in 1990 to 57,065 in
2010 (Table HE-2). The SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast estimates that the
La Mesa population will reach 62,100 in 2020. Although La Mesa’s population growth is
expected to be moderate in comparison to the County’s overall population growth,
projections for the City are in line with projections for neighboring jurisdictions such as
Lemon Grove, El Cajon, Santee, and National City.

Age Characteristics
A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age
characteristics of residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and
sizes, ability to earn incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through
each stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that
the young adult population (20 to 34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate
cost townhomes/condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35
to 64 years old) represents the major market for moderate to relatively high cost
condominiums and single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends
to generate demand for low to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, group
quarters, and mobile homes. In order to create a balanced community, it is important to
provide housing options that suit the needs of various age groups.
The population of La Mesa is, as measured by the median age of its residents, significantly
older than in neighboring communities or the County as a whole. In 2010, La Mesa’s
median age was 37.1 years; roughly four years older than the County’s median age. The
higher median age is due to the larger percentage of seniors (14 percent of the population
in 2010) and the smaller percentage of children under 18 years of age (20 percent in 2010)
than in other San Diego County communities. Specifically, 14.2 percent of La Mesa
residents were over the age of 65 in 2010. The proportion of senior residents in
neighboring cities however, was lower (by three to four percentage points depending on the
jurisdiction). Figure HE-1 compares changes in the age composition of La Mesa’s
population from 1990 to 2010, while Table HE-3 compares the percentage of individuals
under 18, over 65, and the median age of La Mesa with nearby communities.

Race/Ethnicity Characteristics
Race/ethnicity of the population is important to an analysis of housing needs and
conditions for several reasons. A community’s racial and ethnic composition may have
implications for housing needs to the extent that different groups have different household
characteristics, income levels, and cultural backgrounds that may affect their housing needs
and preferences. Recent studies have also suggested that different racial and ethnic groups
differ in their attitudes toward and/or tolerance for “housing problems” as defined by the
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including overcrowding

In 2010, roughly 62 percent of La Mesa residents were White, seven percent Black, 21
percent Hispanic, six percent Asian, less than one percent Pacific Islander and American
Indian, and four percent other races. La Mesa has a higher proportion of White residents
and smaller proportion of Hispanic residents compared to most neighboring jurisdictions
and the County. The City’s proportion of Black residents and those of “Other” racial and
ethnic backgrounds is roughly similar to that among neighboring jurisdictions and within
the County. Asian/Pacific Islander’s comprise a much smaller proportion of La Mesa
residents compared to Chula Vista, National City and the City of San Diego, but the
proportion is similar to those in neighboring El Cajon, Lemon Grove and Santee. In
general, Hispanic and Asian households exhibit a greater propensity for living in extended
families or other household arrangements than the majority White population.
Communities with larger proportions of Hispanic and Asian households tend to have
larger average household sizes.

      Economic Characteristics
      Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Incomes associated with different
      jobs and the number of workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a
      household can afford. In some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs
      and demand (such as in communities with military installations, college campuses, and
      large amounts of seasonal agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong
      housing demand, while the reverse is true when employment contracts.
      Employment
      In 2000, the two largest occupational categories for City residents were education/health/
      social services and retail/trade occupations (Table HE-5). These categories accounted for
      more than one-third (36 percent) of jobs held by La Mesa residents. Similarly, these
      occupations comprised 31 percent of jobs held by County residents. According to the
      ACS for 2005-2009, approximately 34 percent of La Mesa residents were working in
      educational, health and social services occupations or professional services occupations.
      Table HE-6 displays mean annual wage data for occupations compiled by the California
      Employment Development Department (EDD) for the San Diego Metropolitan Statistical
      Area. Table HE-6 shows education and healthcare occupations generally offer moderate
      pay scales while the food preparation and retail sales offer the lower wages.

Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood and
unrelated individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories or other group living situations are not considered households. Household
type and size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other
household characteristics determine the type of housing needed by residents, their
preferences, and their ability to obtain housing that meets their needs. For example, single-
person households, typified by seniors or young adults, tend to reside in apartment units or
smaller single-family homes. Families typically prefer and occupy single-family homes. This
section details the various household characteristics affecting housing needs.
Household Type and Size
According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,086,865 households (i.e., occupied housing
units) in San Diego County. Of these, 24,512 households, or approximately two percent,
were residing in La Mesa. Among the La Mesa households, 33 percent were single-person
households, and households headed by seniors (65+) comprised 22 percent of all
households. Both single-person and senior-headed households represented a much larger
proportion of La Mesa’s total households than nearly all neighboring jurisdictions and
countywide. Conversely, 25 percent of La Mesa households consisted of families with
children; a much smaller proportion than that found in neighboring jurisdictions and
County-wide (Table HE-7). Given the low proportion of families with children in La Mesa,
it should come as no surprise that the proportion of large households (five or more
persons) and single-parent households is also smaller than in neighboring jurisdictions.

    Table HE-8 shows that in 2010, La Mesa households consisted mostly of families (56
    percent). More of these families were married couples that do not have children, 5,431 (22
    percent), compared to 3,899 married couple families (16 percent) with children. The
    greatest change from 2000 to 2010 was the 18 percent increase in other families, followed
    by the nine percent increase in other non-family households.

Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size can be
used to predict the unit size that a household will select. For example, small households
(one and two persons per household) traditionally can find suitable housing in units with
zero to two bedrooms while larger households (three or more persons per household) can
usually find suitable housing in units with three to four bedrooms.
People’s choices, however, also reflect preference and economics. Especially during the
housing boom when mortgage credit was readily available, many households extended
beyond their financial means and purchased large homes. The National Association of
Realtors estimates that after the housing boom, the average size of homes will be trending

In 2010, the average number of persons per household in the San Diego region ranged
from 2.1 to 3.5, with a regionwide average of 2.9 persons per household. La Mesa had an
average of 2.4 persons per household, representing a small increase from 2000, when an
average of 2.2 persons per household was reported. Table HE-9 compares household size
in La Mesa to household size in surrounding cities and the County. Household size varied
among the cities, with La Mesa having the lowest average household size among
surrounding jurisdictions. SANDAG estimates that average household size in the region
will increase slightly over the next 20 years.

Household Income
Household income indicates the wealth of a community and therefore is directly connected
to the ability to afford housing. As household income increases, the more likely that
household is to be a homeowner. As household income decreases, households tend to
pay a disproportionate amount of their income for housing and the number of persons
occupying unsound and overcrowded housing increases.
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) has developed the following income categories based on
the Area Median Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area (such as San Diego County):

    •    Extremely Low Income: households earning up to 30 percent of the AMI
    •    Very Low Income: households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
    •    Low Income: households earning between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI
    •    Moderate Income: households earning between 81 percent and 120 percent of the
         AMI
    •    Above Moderate Income: households earning over 120 percent of the AMI
Combined, the extremely low, very low, and low income groups are referred to as lower
income. 3
Between 2006 and 2008, approximately 53 percent of La Mesa households earned
moderate or above moderate incomes (Table HE-10), while 47 percent of households had
incomes in the extremely low, very low, and low income levels. 4

Household incomes in La Mesa tend to be slightly lower than those in the region as a
whole. Median household income in the City was $41,693 in 2000, compared to the San
Diego County median household income of $47,067. The ACS estimates that the median
household income in La Mesa between 2005 and 2009 was $52,758, compared to $62,901
in the County. Figure HE-3 compares household income in La Mesa and in the San
Diego region between 2005 and 2009.

    Federal housing and community development programs typically assist households with incomes up to
    80 percent of the AMI and use different terminology. For example, the Federal Community
    Development Block Grant (CDBG) program refers households with incomes between 51 and 80
    percent AMI as moderate income (compared to low income based on State definition).

    Data was obtained from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared for HUD
    by the Census Bureau using 2000 Census data. CHAS data does not provide a breakdown of household
    income for those with more than 80 percent AMI as those households are not qualified for federal
    housing programs.

According to the 2005-2009 ACS, approximately 21 percent of the La Mesa households
earned less than $25,000 (Figure HE-4). Only 18 percent of La Mesa households earned
$100,000 or more between 2005 and 2009. By comparison, the County’s income
distribution between 2005 and 2009 was skewed toward the higher income categories,
explaining the SANDAG estimates of higher median household income in the County
than in La Mesa.

Housing Problems
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for
HUD provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types
of households in La Mesa. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2006-2008 ACS data is
displayed in Table HE-12. Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
    •    Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
    •    Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
    •    Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
    •    Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross
         income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some
highlights include:
    •    In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (53 percent)
         compared to owner-households (39 percent).

             •     Approximately 81 percent of the extremely low income (households earning up to
                   30 percent of the AMI) and 77 percent very low income households (households
                   earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI) had the highest incidence of

Overcrowding
The combination of low incomes and high housing costs has forced many households to
live in overcrowded housing conditions. “Overcrowding” is generally defined as a housing
unit occupied by more than one person per room in house (including living room and
dining rooms, but excluding hallways, kitchen, and bathrooms). Under State law a housing
unit is considered overcrowded if there is less than 120 square feet of livable space (all
space except the bath, kitchen and hallways) for the first two people and less than an
additional 50 square feet for each additional person. Overcrowding can indicate that a
community does not have an adequate supply of affordable housing, especially for large
families.
Overcrowding typically occurs when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share
a housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, or when families reside in smaller
units than they need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care.
Overcrowding tends to accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a
reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality
of life.
In 2000, five percent of La Mesa households lived in overcrowded conditions (Table HE-
13). Overcrowding disproportionately affected renters (eight percent of renters versus just
two percent of owners); indicating overcrowding may be the result of an inadequate supply
of larger sized rental units. While 39 percent of occupied housing units in the City had
more than three bedrooms (the minimum size considered large enough to avoid most
overcrowding issues for large households), only a small portion of these units (18 percent)
were occupied by renters. The 2010 Census does not contain information of detailed
occupancy status. The 2005-2009 ACS provides estimates on overcrowding status.
According to the ACS, the overcrowding conditions in La Mesa improved between 2000
and 2009 with only two percent of the households being overcrowded. However, in close
examination, the ACS documents large margins of errors for these estimates.

Overpayment (Cost Burden)
Measuring the portion of a household’s gross income that is spent for housing is an
indicator of the dynamics of demand and supply. This measurement is often expressed in
terms of “over payers”: households paying an excessive amount of their income for
housing, therefore decreasing the amount of disposable income available for other needs.
This indicator is an important measurement of local housing market conditions as it
reflects the affordability of housing in the community. Federal and state agencies use
overpayment indicators to determine the extent and level of funding and support that
should be allocated to a community. State and federal programs typically define over-
payers as those lower income households paying over 30 percent of household income for
housing costs. A household is considered experiencing a severe cost burden if it spends
more than 50 percent of its gross income on housing.
Table HE-12 presented earlier provides overpayment detail by income group and
household type for La Mesa between 2006 and 2008. Approximately 71 percent of lower
income households were overpaying versus 22 percent of moderate and above moderate
income households. Overpayment among extremely low income and very low income
households were most severe, at 80 percent and 77 percent, respectively.

Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, disability and household characteristics,
among other factors. Consequently, certain residents in La Mesa may experience higher
incidences of housing overpayment (cost burden), overcrowding, or other housing
problems. The special needs groups analyzed include the elderly, persons with disabilities,
homeless people, single parents, large households, military personnel, farm workers, and
students (Table HE-14). Many of these groups overlap, for example many farm workers
are homeless, and many elderly people have a disability of some type. The majority of
these special needs groups could be assisted by an increase in affordable housing, especially
housing located near public transportation and services.

The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each
particular group as well as programs and services available to address their housing needs.
Seniors
Many senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. Specifically, people aged 65 years and
older often have four main concerns:
    •    Housing: Many seniors live alone and may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
    •    Income: People aged 65 and over are usually retired and living on a limited
         income.
    •    Health care: Seniors are more likely to have high health care costs.
    •    Transportation: Many of the elderly rely on public transportation; especially those
         with disabilities.
The limited income of many elderly persons often makes it difficult for them to find
affordable housing. Table HE-15 shows that 8,088 persons were age 65 and over in La
Mesa in 2010. This accounted for about 14 percent of residents, higher than the
percentage found in the region as a whole.

In 2010, 22 percent of City households were headed by someone 65 years old or older. Of
these households, the majority (64 percent) owned their homes, while the remainder (36
percent) rented their homes. Among senior-headed households, approximately 3,700
were considered lower income. Among these lower income senior households, 61 percent
were overpaying for housing – 46 percent of the lower income senior owner-households
and 81 percent of the lower income senior renter-households were overpaying for housing.
Aside from overpayment problems faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes,
many seniors are faced with various disabilities. Roughly 42 percent of La Mesa’s senior
population was listed as having one or more disabilities in 2000 by the Census. Among
these disabilities, the most common were physical disabilities (33 percent) and disabilities

  In May 2011, La Mesa was home to 21 residential care facilities for seniors licensed by the
  State (Table HE-16). The bulk of the 909 beds were provided in five large care facilities,
  while the other 16 care facilities had the capacity for 6 seniors each. Licensed residential
  care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential zones.
  Facilities serving more than six persons are permitted or conditionally permitted in all
  commercial or residential zones.

Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly are facilities that provide services to persons 60 years of age and over and
persons under 60 with compatible needs. RCFEs may also be known as assisted living facilities, retirement homes and
board and care homes. The facilities can range in size from six beds or less to over 100 beds. The residents in these
facilities require varying levels of personal care and protective supervision.
Adult Residential Facilities are facilities of any capacity that provide 24-hour non-medical care for adults ages 18 through
59, who are unable to provide for their own daily needs. Adults may be physically handicapped, developmentally disabled,
and/or mentally disabled.
Group Homes are facilities of any capacity and provide 24-hour non-medical care and supervision to children in a
structured environment. Group Homes provide social, psychological, and behavioral programs for troubled youths.
Small Family Homes provide 24-hour-a-day care in the licensee's family residence for six or fewer children who are
mentally disabled, developmentally disabled, or physically handicapped, and who require special care and supervision as
a result of such disabilities.

  Persons with Disabilities (Including Developmental Disabilities)
  Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working,
  restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, disabled persons often
  have special housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible and
  affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with a disability. Some residents
  suffer from disabilities that require living in a supportive or institutional setting.

No updated data on disabilities is available from the 2010 Census or ACS. The 2000
Census defines six types of disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-home
and employment. The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting
conditions.” Mental, self-care, go-outside-home and employment disabilities are defined as
conditions lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities. A
more detailed description of each disability is provided below:
    •    Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness or severe vision or hearing
         impairment.
    •    Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic,
         physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying.
    •    Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that
         impairs learning, remembering or concentrating.
    •    Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get
         around inside the home.
    •    Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home
         alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
    •    Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job or
         business.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 18 percent of La Mesa residents over five
years of age had a disability. The Census tallied the number of disabilities by type for
residents with one or more disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, 13 percent were
sensory disabilities, 27 percent were physical disabilities, 17 percent were mental
disabilities, 9 percent were self-care disabilities, 18 percent were disabilities that limited the
ability to go outside the home, and 18 percent were employment disabilities (Table HE-
17). The 2000 Census reported that 11.3 percent of persons with disabilities in La Mesa
were living below the poverty level. It is also estimated that 40 percent of people with
disabilities between the ages of 21 and 64 years in the City were not employed.

of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental
disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
     •   Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and
         physical impairments;
     •   Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
     •   Is likely to continue indefinitely;
     •   Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas
         of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning;
         d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-
         sufficiency;
     •   Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
         interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
         assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
         coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of
the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates
to 570 persons in the City of La Mesa with developmental disabilities, based on the 2010
Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of August 2011, at least
353 La Mesa residents with developmental disabilities were being assisted at the
Developmental Center and Regional Center. Most of these individuals were residing in a
private home with their parent or guardian and 182 of these persons with developmental
disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Resources
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to
their needs. Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory
limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access
ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for
accessibility. Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with
disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to travel to necessary services and
shops. “Barrier free design” housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and
transit, and group living opportunities are important in serving this group. Incorporating
                                                                     Housing Element | HE-25

                                                                                     2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
barrier-free design in all new multi-family housing is especially important to provide the
widest range of choices for the disabled.
State and federal legislation mandate that a specified number of units in new or
rehabilitated multi-family apartment complexes be accessible to individuals with limited
physical mobility. The City offers flexibility in development standards for projects
proposing housing affordable to seniors and persons with disabilities. In addition, a
number of residential care facilities are located in La Mesa to accommodate persons with
disabilities (see Table HE-16 presented earlier).
Large Households
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These
households comprise a special need group because of the often limited supply of
adequately sized and affordable housing units in a community. To save for other basic
necessities such as food, clothing and medical care, it is common for lower-income large
households to reside in smaller units, which frequently results in overcrowding and can
result in accelerated unit deterioration.
Table HE-18 compares the number of large households in La Mesa to that of the San
Diego region. In 2010, just seven percent of households in La Mesa consisted of five or
more persons, compared to 14 percent region wide. Among large households in La Mesa,
the 2010 Census reported 47 percent were owner-households and 53 percent were renter-
households.

Overall, a greater percentage of larger households (69 percent) had housing problems than
all households (46 percent) between 2006 and 2008. The majority of renter-occupied large
households (74 percent) had one or more housing problems, while two-thirds of owner-
occupied households (66 percent) had one or more housing problems (see Table HE-12).
Resources
Lower- and moderate-income large households can benefit from various affordable
housing programs. These include the First-Time Homebuyer Downpayment and Closing
Cost Assistance programs, affordable housing development assisted with City, State, and
federal funds, and Housing Choice Vouchers, among others.

Single-Parent Households
Single-parent families, particularly female-headed families with children, often require
special consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing
and accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families
with children are a particularly vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of
their children with work responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
An estimated nine percent of La Mesa households were headed by single parents in 2010
(Table HE-19); the large majority of which were headed by females (71 percent).
According to the 2005-2009 ACS, 21 percent of female-headed single-parent households
had incomes below the poverty level.

Resources
Lower-income single-parent households can benefit from City programs that provide direct
rental assistance or that will facilitate the development of affordable housing.
Homeownership opportunities can also be expanded for low and moderate-income single-
parent households through the Housing Choice Vouchers, First-Time Homebuyer
Downpayment and Closing Cost Assistance, and Mortgage Credit Certificate programs.
Residents Living in Poverty
Families, particularly female-headed families, are disproportionately affected by poverty.
In 2000, nine percent of the City’s total residents (5,062 persons) were living in poverty.
Approximately 12 percent of female-headed households with children, however, had
incomes below the poverty level. The 2005-2009 ACS reports that 11 percent of the City’s
population and 21 percent of female-headed families with children were living below the
poverty level.
Resources
Most housing programs that target households with extremely low incomes (up to 30
percent AMI) will benefit households living in poverty.
Homeless
Throughout the country and the San Diego region, homelessness has become an
increasingly important issue. Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include a lack
of housing affordable to low and moderate income persons, increases in the number of
                                                                    Housing Element | HE-27

persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the
poor, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
State law (Section 65583(1) (6)) mandates that municipalities address the special needs of
homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), describes an individual
(not imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
     •   Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
     •   Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
         - A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
              temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters,
              and transitional housing for the mentally ill);
         - An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
              be institutionalized; or
         - A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
              sleeping accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing, (unless it has been
officially condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up
with others), persons being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was
homeless when entering and is considered to be homeless at discharge), or persons who
may be at risk of homelessness (for example, living temporarily with family or friends.)
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is San Diego County’s leading
resource for information on issues of homelessness. Established in 1985, the Task Force
promotes a regional approach as the best solution to ending homelessness in San Diego
County. The Task Force is a public/private effort to build a base of understanding about
the multiple causes and conditions of homelessness. According to the Task Force, the San
Diego region’s homeless population can be divided into two general groups: (1) urban
homeless, and (2) rural homeless, including farm workers and day laborers who primarily
occupy the hillsides, canyons and fields of the northern regions of the county. It is
important to recognize that homeless individuals may fall into more than one category (for
example, a homeless individual may be a veteran and a substance abuser), making it
difficult to accurately quantify and categorize the homeless.
Since the homeless population is very difficult to quantify, Census information on
homeless populations is often unreliable, due to the difficulty of efficiently counting a
population without permanent residences. The Task Force compiles data from a physical
Point-In-Time (PIT) count of sheltered (emergency and transitional) and street homeless
persons. The 2011 Count was conducted on January 28, 2011 and the results are shown in
Table HE-20. Chula Vista and El Cajon had the largest homeless populations of the
Eastern County cities and the City of La Mesa is estimated to be home to just 55 homeless
persons.

Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in
the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When
workload increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal
labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant
workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to
their primary residence every evening.
Due to the high cost of housing and low wages, a significant number of migrant farm
workers have difficulty finding affordable, safe and sanitary housing. According to the State
Employment Development Department, the average farm worker earned between $19,000
and $30,000 annually. 5 This limited income is exacerbated by their tenuous and/or
seasonal employment status. It is estimated that there are between 100 and 150 farm
worker camps located throughout the San Diego region, primarily in rural areas. These
encampments range in size from a few people to a few hundred and are frequently found
in fields, hillsides, canyons, ravines, and riverbeds, often on the edge of their employer’s
property. Some workers reside in severely overcrowded dwellings, in packing buildings, or
in storage sheds.

Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is problematic. For instance, the
government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently define farmworkers (e.g.
field laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of employment (e.g. permanent
or seasonal), or place of work (e.g. the location of the business or field). Further limiting
the ability to ascertain an accurate number of agricultural workers within La Mesa is the
limited data available on the City due to its relatively small size. Therefore, the Census is
the only source of information that can be referenced. According to both the 2000 Census
and 2005-2009 ACS, only 0.1 percent of La Mesa residents were employed in farming,
forestry, or fishing occupations.
Because a negligible portion of community residents are employed in farming, fishing, and
forestry occupations and there is little potential for this occupational category to expand
within La Mesa, no housing programs or policies are needed to address the needs of
farmworkers.
Students
Due to La Mesa’s proximity to San Diego State University and Grossmont College, a large
proportion of City residents are enrolled in a college or university (12 percent) compared
to the countywide total (9 percent). San Diego State University is the largest university in
the San Diego region, with approximately 30,000 students. The university provides housing
for an estimated 10 percent of enrolled students. Typically, students have low incomes and
therefore can be impacted by a lack of affordable housing, which can often lead to
overcrowding within this special needs group.
Resources
Many State and federal programs are not available to students. However, City housing
programs designed to expand affordable rental housing opportunities in the City will help
expand housing options for students.
Housing Stock Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within
the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and
condition, tenure, vacancy rates, housing costs, and affordability are important in
determining the housing needs for the community. This section details the housing stock
characteristics of La Mesa to identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of
current and future residents of the City.
Growth in the Supply of Housing Stock
Consistent with an urbanized, largely built-out community, La Mesa has experienced
relatively little housing growth since 1990. The housing stock in the City grew from 24,154
units in 1990 to 26,167 units in 2010, or an eight percent increase over 20 years (Table
HE-22). Overall, housing growth in the suburban East County areas has been limited,
compared to countywide growth.

Projected Housing Units
Table HE-23 shows that between 2010 and 2020, La Mesa is projected to gain two percent
in housing stock. Region-wide, approximately eight percent more units will be added to the
housing stock. Between 2010 and 2030, La Mesa is projected for a seven-percent increase
in housing stock and approximately 22 percent more units will be added in the region.
Most of the East County cities are expected to experience slower rates of housing growth
compared to the region between 2010 and 2030.

Housing Type
La Mesa maintains a diverse housing stock. Figure HE-5 shows that in 2010, La Mesa had
almost equal shares of multi-family units (45 percent) and single-family detached units (43
percent). Another 11 percent of the units were single-family attached units (such as
second units and duplexes). Only one percent of the units were mobile homes/trailers.

Table HE-24 shows that the proportion of both single-family units and mobile homes in La
Mesa is projected to decrease slightly, while the proportion of multi-family units is expected
to increase. However, this figure may be misleading because SANDAG forecasts mobile
homes by determining the region’s mobile home growth rate and applying it to each
jurisdiction.

Housing Availability and Tenure
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of
housing. Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Tenure is an
important market characteristic because it is directly related to housing types and turnover
rates. The tenure distribution of a community’s housing stock can be an indicator of
several aspects of the housing market, including the affordability of units, household
                                                                      Housing Element | HE-33

stability and residential mobility among others. In most communities, tenure distribution
generally correlates with household income, composition and age of the householder.
In 2000, among the City’s occupied housing units, approximately 47 percent were owner-
occupied, while 53 percent were renter-occupied (Table HE-25). The homeownership
rate for the City has remained relatively steady since 1990. According to the 2010 Census,
the home ownership rate in La Mesa decreased slightly to 46 percent of the occupied units.
Renter-occupied housing units made up over one-half (54 percent) of the City’s occupied
housing stock. Approximately six percent of total housing units were vacant.

As shown in Table HE-26, renter-occupied households had a slightly lower average
household size than owner-occupied households. In 2000, average renter-household size
was 2.10 persons compared to 2.35 persons for the average owner-household. In 2010,
average renter-household size increased to 2.23 persons compared to 2.38 persons per for

Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator because they indicate the degree of
choice available. High vacancy rates usually indicate low demand and/or high supply
conditions in the housing market. Too high of a vacancy rate can be difficult for owners
trying to sell or rent. Low vacancy rates usually indicate high demand and/or low supply
conditions in the housing market. Too low of a vacancy rate can force prices up making it
more difficult for low and moderate income households to find housing. Vacancy rates
between two to three percent are usually considered healthy for single-family housing; and
five to six percent for multi-family housing. However, vacancy rates are not the sole
indicator of market conditions. They must be viewed in the context of all the
characteristics of the local and regional market.

 According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate in La Mesa was 6.3 percent.
 Specifically, ownership housing had a vacancy rate of 1.4 percent but the rental vacancy
 rate was seven percent. Additional vacancy information was obtained for spring 2010 from
 the San Diego County Apartment Association (SDCAA) and is shown in Table HE-27.
 Vacancy rates in La Mesa were similar to those in neighboring communities and in the
 County as a whole. In La Mesa, a large number of the City’s rental units are older units
 (over 25 years). Such units tend to command lower rents and therefore, more likely to be
 rented. Vacancy rate among older rental units in La Mesa is lower than that among newer
 units.

 Housing Age and Condition
 Housing age can be an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Like
 any other tangible asset, housing is subject to gradual physical or technological deterioration
 over time. If not properly and regularly maintained, housing can deteriorate and discourage
 reinvestment, depress neighboring property values, and eventually impact the quality of life
 in a neighborhood. Many federal and state programs also use the age of housing as one
 factor in determining housing rehabilitation needs. Typically, housing over 30 years of age
 is more likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing, roof repairs,
 foundation work and other repairs.
 Neighborhoods adjacent to downtown and throughout the City have examples of housing
 units that date to the early 1900s. In the early 1980s, the City conducted a survey of
 historic resources that resulted in an inventory of over 375 structures and sites that may be
 considered historic based on age, architecture, and local history. The City administers a
 program that allows owners of historic properties to obtain a local landmark status, allowing
 for “Mills Act” property tax relief. The Historic Preservation program supports the
 continued viability of the City’s older housing stock and provides a means of making
 ownership of old homes more cost effective.

Although the Census does not include statistics on housing condition based upon
observations, it includes statistics that correlate closely with substandard housing conditions.
The three factors most commonly used to determine housing conditions are age of
housing, overcrowding, and lack of plumbing/kitchen facilities.
Housing that is not maintained can discourage reinvestment, depress neighboring property
values, and can negatively impact the quality of life in a neighborhood. Improving housing
is an important goal of the City. The age of the City’s housing stock indicates a potential
need for continued code enforcement, property maintenance and housing rehabilitation
programs to stem housing deterioration.
A number of housing units in La Mesa are beginning to show a need for rehabilitation.
The scope of rehabilitation needed ranges from minor to substantial. Where it is not
financially feasible to rehabilitate the units, replacement housing may be required. The
vast majority of these substandard units (units in need of repair or replacement) are in the
urbanized core of the City. However, other areas of the City include pockets of
substandard and/or deteriorating housing stock. Although some of the units considered as
substandard in the Censuses have been rehabilitated, many are in the same condition. The
substandard units are presented in Table HE-28. No updated Census data was available at
the writing of this report.

La Mesa’s greatest housing rehabilitation needs are primarily concentrated in the West
End Neighborhood Revitalization Area. The City has a program that focuses on the
improvement of the West End Revitalization Area. The City can improve deteriorating and
dilapidated housing conditions in this area by focusing capital improvements and
implementing the recently adopted mixed-use zoning along the transportation corridors in
West La Mesa. The Housing Rehabilitation, Single-Family Acquisition and Rehabilitation,
Multifamily Acquisition and Rehabilitation, and Enforcement of Uniform Code programs
will supplement and reinforce the efforts of the neighborhood revitalization strategy.
Housing Costs and Affordability
Housing costs are indicative of housing accessibility to all economic segments of the
community. Typically, if housing supply exceeds housing demand, housing costs will fall.
If housing demand exceeds housing supply, housing costs will rise. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to La Mesa residents.
Home Ownership Market
In 2010, median home prices in the East County areas of San Diego ranged from $201,000
in National City to $341,000 in the City of San Diego (Figure HE-7). La Mesa’s median
home price is on the higher end of the spectrum at $321,500, only slightly lower than the
San Diego County median price of $330,000.

Rental Market
The primary source of information on rental costs in the San Diego region is the San
Diego County Apartment Association (SDCAA). SDCAA conducts two surveys of rental
properties per year. For the spring 2010 survey, 6,000 surveys were sent out to rental

property owners and managers throughout San Diego County. Responses were received
from property owners representing 50,089 units. Although this survey sampled a broad
variety of rental housing, it was not a scientific sampling.
Table HE-30 shows that in the spring of 2010, average monthly rents in La Mesa ranged
from $829 for a studio apartment to $1,619 for a three-bedroom apartment. Apartment
rents in La Mesa tend to be slightly higher than rents in other East County cities but lower
than those in the City and County of San Diego.

Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in
the City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income
levels. Taken together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and
type of housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding
and overpayment.
The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal
housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be used to determine
the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their
respective income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less
by comparison than those at the upper end. The maximum affordable home and rental
prices for residents in San Diego County are shown in Table HE-31.
Table HE-31 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each
month without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be compared to
current housing asking prices (Table HE-29) and market rental rates (Table HE-30) to
determine what types of housing opportunities a household can afford.

Extremely Low income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the County area median
income – up to $17,200 for a one-person household and up to $26,550 for a five-person
household in 2011. Extremely low income households cannot afford market-rate rental or
ownership housing in La Mesa without assuming a cost burden.
Very Low income Households
Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50 percent of the County area
median income – up to $28,700 for a one-person household and up to $44,250 for a five-
person household in 2011. A very low income household can generally afford homes
offered at prices between $81,215 and $111,275, adjusting for household size. Given the
costs of ownership housing in La Mesa, very low income households would not be able to
afford a home in the City. Similarly, very low income renters could not afford
appropriately-sized market-rate rental units in La Mesa. After deductions for utilities, a
very low income household at the maximum income limit can afford to pay approximately
$647 to $992 in monthly rent, depending on household size.
Low income Households
Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the County’s area
median income - up to $45,850 for a one-person household and up to $70,750 for a five-
person household in 2011. The affordable home price for a low income household at the
maximum income limit ranges from $141,511 to $204,444. Based on the asking prices of
homes for sale in 2011 (Table HE-29), ownership housing would not be affordable to low
income households. After deductions for utilities, a one-person low income household
could afford to pay up to $1,075 in rent per month and a five-person low income
household could afford to pay as much as $1,655. As of Spring 2010, most low income
households in La Mesa would be able to find adequately sized affordable apartment units
(Table HE-30), although the availability of such units may be limited.
Moderate income Households
Moderate income households earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the County’s
Area Median Income – up to $97,100 depending on household size in 2010. The
maximum affordable home price for a moderate income household is $238,517 for a one-
person household and $353,982 for a five-person family. Moderate income households in
La Mesa would still have some trouble finding and purchasing adequately-sized homes.
The maximum affordable rent payment for moderate income households is between
$1,503 and $2,314 per month. Appropriately-sized market-rate rental housing is generally
affordable to households in this income group.
Affordable Housing
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units that are eligible to convert to non-low-income housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during
the next ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from January 1,
2013 through December 31, 2023. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly

Publicly Assisted Housing
The City of La Mesa has a range of publicly assisted rental housing affordable to lower and
moderate income households. Table HE-32 provides a summary listing of affordable

include affordable units. Specifically, 547 units are set aside as housing for lower and
moderate income households.

Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Within the 2013-2023 “at-risk” housing analysis period, two projects (Murray Manor and
La Mesa Springs) are considered at risk of converting to market-rate housing. These
projects offer 346 housing units, inclusive of 326 units that are affordable to lower income
households with project-based Section 8 rental subsidies. Both projects are considered at
risk due to expiring Section 8 contracts.
Murray Manor is a 218-unit apartment project, constructed in the early 1970s. The
property owner entered in to an agreement with HUD to maintain 198 affordable units in
exchange for favorable loan terms. In 2003, the property owner refinanced the mortgage
and entered in to an agreement to maintain affordability via the Section 8 program.
La Mesa Springs is a 128-unit affordable housing project constructed in 1981, with a 40-
year use restriction and a project-based Section 8 contract for rent subsidies. The Section 8
for La Mesa Springs is due to expire in 2016. The owner can choose to opt out of Section
8 or to renew the Section 8 with HUD.
                                                                  Housing Element | HE-43

While the new Section 8 contracts are subject to a periodic renewal process, the approval is
fairly automatic. If the property owner decides to allow the Section 8 program to lapse, the
tenants would be notified and would have one year to relocate. Subject to funding
availability, HUD would make Section 8 vouchers available to the tenants. Tenants could
decide to use the voucher at the project or at a different location.
Preservation and Replacement Options
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City works to preserve the existing
assisted units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the circumstances
of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units.
Preservation options typically include: 1) transfer of units to non-profit ownership; 2)
provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources; and 3) purchase of
affordability covenants. In terms of replacement, the most direct option is the
development of new assisted multi-family housing units. The following discussion
highlights ways that the City’s two at-risk projects could be preserved as affordable housing.
All of the presented alternatives are costly, probably beyond the ability of the City of La
Mesa to manage without large amounts of subsidy from Federal, State and other local
resources. These options are described below.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing provider is generally
one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain affordable for the long
term. By transferring property ownership to a non-profit organization, low income
restrictions can be secured and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater
range of governmental assistance. The estimated market value for Murray Manor and La
Mesa Springs Apartments is provided in Table HE-33.

            Market value for project is estimated with the following assumptions:
            Average market rent based on Fair Market Rents (FY 2012) established by HUD. One-
            bedroom unit = $1,126; Two-bedroom unit = $1,378 (higher than the average rent for a one-
            bedroom unit from 2010 rent survey by the San Diego County Apartments Association).
            Average size is assumed to be 600 square feet for a one-bedroom and 850 square feet for a
            two-bedroom.
            Annual income is calculated on a vacancy rate = 5%
            Annual operating expenses per square foot = $4.50
            Market value = Annual net project income*multiplication factor
            Multiplication factor for a building in good condition is 12.5.

Current market value for the units is estimated on the basis of the project’s potential annual
income, and operating and maintenance expenses. As indicated above, the estimated
market value of Murray Manor and La Mesa Springs Apartments is $46.5 million. (This
estimate is provided for the purpose of comparison and understanding the magnitude of
costs involved and does not represent the precise market value of this project. The actual
market value at time of sale will depend on market and property conditions, lease-
out/turnover rates, among other factors.)
Rental Assistance
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar
to Section 8 vouchers, the City, through a variety of potential funding sources, could
provide rent subsidies to tenants of at-risk units. The level of the subsidy required to
preserve the at-risk units is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a unit minus
the housing cost affordable by a lower income household. Table HE-34 estimates the rent
subsidies required to preserve the affordability of the 326 at-risk units. Based on the
estimates and assumptions shown in this table, approximately $1,707,720 in rent subsidies
would be required annually.

 Notes:
 Fair Market Rents (FMR) FY 2012 are determined by HUD.
 San Diego County 2011 Area Median Household Income (AMI) limits set by the California Department of Housing and
 Community Development (HCD).
 Affordable cost = 30% of household income minus utility allowance.
Purchase of Affordability Covenants:
Another option to preserve the affordability of the at-risk project is to provide an incentive
package to the owner to maintain the project as affordable housing. Incentives could
include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, providing a lump-sum
payment, and/or supplementing the rents to market levels. The feasibility and cost of this
option depends on whether the complex is too highly leveraged and interest on the owner’s
part to utilize the incentives found in this option. By providing lump sum financial
incentives or ongoing subsides in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the
City could ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low income housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk units
should they be converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends

upon a variety of factors, including density, size of the units (i.e. square footage and number
of bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction.
Assuming an average development cost of $150,000 per unit for multi-family rental
housing, replacement of the 326 at-risk units would require approximately $64,841,400.
This cost estimate includes land, construction, permits, on- and off-site improvements, and
other costs.
Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under
various options. However, because different projects have different circumstances and
therefore different options available, the direct comparison would not be appropriate. In
general, providing additional incentives/subsidies to extend the affordability covenant
would require the least funding over the long run, whereas the construction of new units
would be the most costly option. Over the short term, providing rent subsidies would be
least costly but this option does not guarantee the long-term affordability of the units.
The cost to build new housing to replace the 326 at-risk units is high, with an estimated
total cost of nearly $64,000,000. This cost estimate is substantially higher than the cost
associated with transfer of ownership ($46,551,337) or providing rent subsidies similar to
Section 8 vouchers ($1,707,720 annually).
Resources for Preservation
Preservation of at-risk housing requires not only financial resources but also administrative
capacity of nonprofit organizations. These resources are discussed in detail later in this
Housing Element in the “Housing Resources” section.
Housing Constraints
Actual or potential constraints to the provision of housing affect the development of new
housing and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Governmental and
non-governmental constraints in La Mesa are similar to those in other jurisdictions in the
region and are discussed below. One of the most, if not the most, significant and difficult
constraints to housing in La Mesa and elsewhere in the San Diego region is the high cost of
land. This section describes various governmental, market, and environmental constraints
on the development of housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of La Mesa
population.
Market Constraints
Market constraints significantly affect the cost of housing in La Mesa, and can pose barriers
to housing production and affordability. These constraints include the availability and cost
of land for residential development, the demand for housing, financing and lending,
construction costs, development fees, and neighborhood opposition which can make it
expensive for developers to build affordable housing. The following highlights the primary
market factors that affect the production of housing in La Mesa.

                                                                                        2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Economic Factors
Market forces on the economy and the trickle down effects on the construction industry
can act as a barrier to housing construction and especially to affordable housing
construction. California’s housing market peaked in the summer of 2005 when a dramatic
increase in the State’s housing supply was coupled with low interest rates. The period
between 2006 and 2010, however, reflects a time of significant change as the lending
market collapsed and home prices saw significant decreases. Double-digit decreases in
median sale prices were recorded throughout the State until recently. These lower-than-
normal home prices allowed for a large increase in the number of homes sold initially until
the availability of credit became increasingly limited. As such, housing production in the
last few years has been limited while the need for affordable housing increased along with
high unemployment rates and foreclosure rates.
Construction Costs
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development. Multi-family housing
is generally less expensive to construct than single-family homes on a per unit basis.
However, a wide variation within each housing type exists depending on the size of the unit
and the number and quality of amenities provided. Such amenities include fireplaces,
swimming pools, and interior features among others.
A number of factors influence construction costs and the sales price. A reduction in
amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum acceptability for health,
safety, and adequate performance) could result in lower sales prices. Another factor related
to construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number increases,
overall costs generally decrease as builders are able to take advantage of economies of
scale. This type of cost reduction is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for
the provision of affordable housing. Manufactured housing may provide for lower priced
housing by reducing construction and labor costs. However, due to the high cost of land in
urban neighborhoods, new construction of manufactured housing cannot be assumed to
meet the housing needs of lower-income households.
Land Costs
The cost of raw land typically accounts for a large share of total housing production costs.
Land costs vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use that must be
removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental issues (e.g. steep slopes, soil
stability, seismic hazards or flooding) can be a factor driving up the cost of developable
land. Typically, land prices can add to the cost of a residential development project and
ultimately be a constraint on housing development.
Few vacant lots remain in the City of La Mesa. Future residential development will
primarily occur as infill developments and redevelopment of existing underutilized
properties. Developing on previously developed properties in general is more costly than
developing on vacant land given the higher site acquisition and demolition costs.

Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and
race of the applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases,
improvements and refinancing, whether financed at market rate or with government
assistance. The data for La Mesa was compiled by census tract and aggregated to the area
that generally approximates the City’s boundaries.
Table HE-35 summarizes the disposition of loan applications submitted to financial
institutions in 2010 for home purchase, refinance, and home improvement loans in La
Mesa. Included is information on loan applications that were approved and originated,
approved but not accepted by the applicant, denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or
incomplete.

Home Purchase Loans
In 2010, a total of 347 households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in La
Mesa. The overall loan approval rate was 73 percent and 13 percent of applications were
denied.        In comparison, 72 percent of conventional home loan applications were
approved in San Diego County. Approximately 296 home purchase applications were
submitted in La Mesa through government-backed loans (for example, FHA, VA) in 2010;
76 percent of these applications were approved. To be eligible for such loans, residents
must meet the established income standards, maximum home values, and other
requirements. For government-backed loans, the approval rate for the San Diego County
was 74 percent. In general, access to home purchase financing in La Mesa reflects
countywide trends.
Refinance Loans
The majority of loan applications submitted by La Mesa residents in 2010 were for
refinancing their existing home loans (1,547 applications). About 68 percent of these
applications were approved, while 17 percent were denied. In the San Diego County, 67
percent of refinancing applications were approved.

Home Improvement Loans
A larger proportion of La Mesa applicants were denied for home improvement loans than
any other type of loan applications. Nearly one-quarter of all applicants (22 percent) were
denied and just 67 percent were approved by lending institutions in 2010. The high denial
rate may be explained by the nature of these loans. Most home improvement loans are
second loans and therefore more difficult to qualify due to high income-to-debt ratios. In
San Diego County, home improvement loan applications had a lower approval rate (61
percent) than in the City of La Mesa.
Foreclosures
The period of 2000 to 2005 represents an inflated housing market in the San Diego region
and nationwide. With low interest rates, “creative” financing (such as zero down, interest
payment only, and adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (such as aggressive
marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased homes that
were beyond their financial means. Many homebuyers were misled to assuming
refinancing to lower interest rates would always be an option and home prices would
continue to rise at double-digit rates. Many were unprepared for the hikes in interest rates,
expiration of short-term fixed rates, and decline in sales prices that set off in 2006.
Suddenly faced with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are
larger than the worth of the homes, foreclosure was the only option available to many
households.
Recovery of the housing market has been slow but the number of foreclosures has steadily
declined over the past couple of years. The number of Notices of Default (NODs)
continued to decline, from 8,630 NODs in the third quarter of 2009 to 5,869 NODs in the
third quarter of 2010 (a 32-percent decrease), to 5,048 NODs in the third quarter of 2011
(another 14 percent decrease).
However, foreclosures remain an issue in the San Diego region. In May 2011, 338 homes
in La Mesa were listed in various stages of foreclosure. These homes were listed as pre-
foreclosures, bank-owned, and auctions and ranged in price.
Governmental Constraints
Aside from market factors, housing affordability is also affected by factors in the public
sector. Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and,
in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement
requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, among other issues may
constrain the maintenance, development and improvement of housing. This section
discusses potential governmental constraints in La Mesa and efforts to address them.
Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element sets forth City policies for guiding local land use development.
These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and
distribution of land allocated for different uses.
                                                                Housing Element | HE-49

The La Mesa City Council recently authorized a comprehensive update to the General
Plan to be completed by the City’s centennial celebration in 2012. The City’s General Plan
was originally adopted in 1965 and has been amended over the years as state law and local
needs changed. The first complete update was prepared in 1988 and the current Plan was
adopted in 1996. New issues addressed in the 2012 update include sustainability, climate
change, water conservation, storm water pollution control, and energy efficiency.
Residential Land Use Designations
The land use policies of the City have a direct impact upon the provision of housing for all
economic sectors of the community. The General Plan designates substantial areas of land
for residential development, and the Zoning code permits a wide variety of residential uses,
ranging from multi-family housing to large estates. Table HE-36 lists the residential land
use designations in the General Plan.
The City’s residential land use designations provide for the development of a wide range of
housing types at various densities including single-family dwellings, mobile homes,
townhomes, condominiums, second dwelling units, and multi-family units. Therefore, the
land use regulations are not considered a constraint to residential development.

Specific Plans
The City of La Mesa has adopted a number of specific plans which offer a range of
housing types, densities, and mix of uses. The City anticipates that much of its new
residential growth, however, will occur in the Mixed Use Overlay zone, although the
Downtown Village Specific Plan does present some opportunities for new housing.
Downtown Village Specific Plan
The project area consists of approximately 161 acres of land, plus street rights-of-way. This
area extends from the Route 8 Freeway south along Spring Street to Pasadena Avenue. It
is roughly bounded on the east by the University Avenue - La Mesa Boulevard intersection
and on the west by the University Avenue - La Mesa Boulevard intersection. The project
area encompasses the downtown commercial activities, Civic Center, and surrounding
residential neighborhoods. Downtown is envisioned as La Mesa's Symbolic Center - the
shopping, cultural, governmental and housing center of the entire community - the place
that can provide citizens with a sense of belonging, roots, history and pride.
The Plan area is surrounded by a series of single-family (R1) neighborhoods. The Plan
area itself contains 996 existing units. Of these, 341 units (34 percent) are in single-family
use, 162 units (16 percent) in two-family use, and 493 units (49 percent) are in multi-family
use. Although over time, economic forces will tend to replace residential development
with commercial development, the goal for the Downtown Village is to retain a variety of
viable residential neighborhoods in close proximity as well as within the area, and thus
provide a balanced community. The project area is also a major focal point for La Mesa's
historic resources. More than half of the sites listed in La Mesa's Historical Resource
Inventory are located in the Village.

Mixed Use Overlay Zone
The City of La Mesa’s “Mixed Use Urban” General Plan designation allows for a mix of
commercial and residential development at densities of up to 40 dwelling units per acre.
The transit corridors along El Cajon Boulevard, La Mesa Boulevard, University Avenue,
Baltimore Drive south of the I-8 and in the neighborhood around the Spring Street trolley
station are designated Mixed Use Urban. The entire planning area is illustrated in Figure
HE-8.
In 2003, the City developed new zoning regulations to implement the General Plan and the
City Council approved the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone and Design Guidelines in March
2008. The overlay zone regulations and design guidelines are responsive to the existing
physical and financial conditions and include built-in incentives to facilitate change.
The City’s long held goals for the transit corridors include: revitalization and renewal of
deteriorated properties, increased housing opportunity and provision of neighborhood
level commercial activity that supports a pedestrian oriented environment. The envisioned
image for the corridors is more urban and pedestrian-friendly and less suburban and auto-
oriented, than is the case at the present time.
The Mixed Use Overlay zone permits future development to be either a vertical mix,
within a project, or a horizontal mix along the corridor. Exclusively residential projects are
also permitted. The overlay zone encourages a diversity of residential types and
commercial uses, including retail, office, local-serving businesses and restaurants.
Incentives for parcel consolidation in the overlay zone also encourage more efficient land
utilization. Development projects on lots smaller than 10,000 square feet are permitted at
30 dwelling units per acres, while sites at 10,000 square feet or larger are permitted at 40
dwelling units per acre.
The existing height limit of 46 feet is retained and applied to all corridor properties
developed in accordance with the Mixed-Use Overlay zone. When design objectives are
met, additional height up to a total of six stories can be permitted through the special
permit process. Parking requirements are two spaces per dwelling unit and approximately
four spaces per 1,000 square feet for commercial uses. When both spaces are assigned to
a residential unit, tandem parking is permitted. Existing development standards provide
for shared parking.

Density Bonus
State law requires jurisdictions to provide density bonuses and development incentives to
all developers who propose to construct affordable housing on a sliding scale, where the
amount of density bonus and number of incentives vary according to the amount of
affordable housing units provided. Specifically, State law requires the provision of certain
incentives for residential development projects that set aside a certain portion of total units
to be affordable to lower and moderate income households. Under State law, a
development of more than five units is eligible to receive density bonuses if it meets at least
one of the following:
    •    Very Low Income Units: Five percent of the total units of the housing development
         as target units affordable to very low-income households; or
    •    Low Income Units: Ten percent of the total units of the housing development as
         target units affordable to low-income households; or
    •    Moderate Income Units: Ten percent of the total units of a newly constructed
         condominium project or planned development as target units affordable to
         moderate-income households, provided all the units are offered for purchase; or
    •    Senior Units: A senior citizen housing development of 35 units or more.
The La Mesa density bonus provisions are consistent with State density bonus law.
Furthermore, the City provides for an additional increase in the allowed density of
residential development projects in the R3 and RB Zones. By discretionary, individual
project review, the required minimum building site area per dwelling unit for a residential
project under these zones may be decreased from 2,420 square feet to 1,895 square feet.
The purpose of the decrease in building site area requirements is to allow increased density
as an incentive in return for the provision of specific project features and amenities, such as
additional open space, additional off-street parking, or housing specifically for families or
persons with disabilities.
To promote transit-oriented development, when a project is within a quarter-mile and has
reasonable access to transit service, and/or provides some incentive for use of public
transit, a density bonus not to exceed 40 units per acre may be granted.
Condominium Conversion Ordinance
La Mesa strives to find a balance between affordable homeownership and affordable rental
opportunities in the community. Condominium conversions can create for-sale housing
opportunity for moderate-income households, mostly first-time buyers. However, the
conversion of apartments to condominiums removes rental units from the City’s housing
stock and could impact lower-income households and households with other special
housing needs.

The City adopted a Condominium Conversion Ordinance that requires all conversions of
existing residential development to condominium development to submit an application
for subdivision and obtain approval from the Planning Commission and City Council.
Furthermore, the number of existing apartment units which may convert into a
condominium project in any one year is limited to fifty percent of the yearly average of
apartment units constructed in the previous two fiscal years.
However, the city council may consider providing an exemption from the annual unit

Residential Development Standards
Citywide, excluding the specific plan areas, the City regulates the type, location, density,
and scale of residential development primarily through the Zoning Code. The following
summarizes the City’s existing residential zoning districts:
    •    Zone R1E (Semi-Rural Estate) – (1.0-2.0 du/acre): This zone is designed to
         accommodate the large lot residential estate development in the Grossmont-Mt.
         Helix area. It is expected development will occur at densities of one to two
         dwelling units per acre predicated upon adequate streets, sewer, fire hydrant and
         other public facilities.
    •    Zone R1R (Semi-Rural Residential) – (3.0 du/acre): This zone is designed to
         preserve the general characteristics of low density semi-rural environment which has
         developed along the southerly fringe of the city and to accommodate development
         up to three dwelling units per acre, predicated upon adequate streets, sewer, fire
         hydrants and other public facilities.
    •    Zone R1S (Suburban Residential): This zone is designed for those areas affected by
         moderate to severe hillside conditions and to the fringe of such areas. It is intended
         that development conditions including structure locations will be variable in order
         to achieve maximum allowable density without adversely affecting the hillside
         environment. Minimum grading which leaves natural appearing land forms is
         required in the development of these areas.
    •    Zone R1 (Urban Residential) – (7.0 du/acre): This zone is designed for the more
         urbanized areas of the city where streets and other public facilities are generally
         adequate to accommodate a dwelling unit density of seven dwelling units per net
         acre.
    •    Zone R1A (Urban Residential-Alternative): This zone is specifically designed for
         the Rolando Knolls area. Similar to Zone R1 but on lots of 9,000 square feet a
         second detached residence may be constructed.
                                                                    Housing Element | HE-55

    •   Zone R2 (Medium Low Density Residential) – (14.0 du/acre): This zone is
        designed to allow one and two family dwellings in the City. Apartments may be
        allowed, restricted to 14 dwelling units per net acre.
    •   Zone R3 (Multiple Unit Residential) – (18.0-23.0 du/acre): This zone provides for
        apartment-type development within the City.
    •   Zone RB (Residential Business) – (18.0 du/acre): This zone is designed for areas
        which appear to be in transition from residential to business development. It is
        intended to provide incentives for accommodating a reasonable transition, by
        permitting apartment-type development, and limited business uses which are
        compatible with a residential environment.
    •   Mixed Use Overlay (Mixed Use Urban): The Mixed Overlay Zone allows ‘for-sale’
        homes, condominiums, and apartment units to provide for a diversity of housing
        types including row housing, loft-type dwellings, and flats that are arranged either
        around courtyards or linearly along the pedestrian realm. The MU Overlay Zone
        also allows for commercial uses that are neighborhood serving and that generate
        pedestrian activity, such as cafes, restaurants, bookstores, floral shops, retail
        shopping, commercial recreation and entertainment spaces, personal and
        convenience service stores, bakeries, travel agencies, childcare facilities, art galleries,
        and offices.
Development standards specific to each zone district are designed to protect and promote
the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the
General Plan. These standards also serve to preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. Specific residential development standards are summarized in Table HE-
37. Generally, development standards can limit the number of units that may be
constructed on a particular piece of property. These include density, minimum lot and
unit sizes, height, and open space requirements. Limiting the number of units that can be
constructed will increase the per-unit land costs and can, all other factors being equal, result
in higher development costs that may impact housing affordability.

Parking Standards
Communities that require an especially high number of parking spaces per dwelling unit
can negatively impact the feasibility of providing affordable housing by reducing the
achievable number of dwelling units per acre and increasing development costs. Typically,
the concern for high parking standards relates mostly to multi-family, affordable, or senior
housing.
The City of La Mesa has parking requirements on par with other jurisdictions in San Diego
County. Parking requirements for single-family and multi-family residential uses in La
Mesa are summarized in Table HE-38.

The City provides flexibility in parking requirements. In some instances, tandem spaces
are permitted and in others, guest parking may be substituted with on-street parking. To
facilitate mixed-use development in the City, shared parking and tandem parking are
allowed within the Mixed Use Overlay zone. Furthermore, affordable and senior housing
projects meeting the State density bonus requirements will be eligible for reduced parking
pursuant to State law.
Height Limit
To promote mixed use development, the developer can apply for a special permit to
increase the height limit. Three recent developments in the City have used this process to
achieve an increase in height limit.
Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of a variety of housing types for all economic segments of the population.
This includes single-family homes, multi-family housing, second units, mobile homes,
emergency shelters, and housing for persons with disabilities. Table HE-39 below
summarizes the various housing types permitted within the City’s zoning districts.

One-Family Dwelling
A “one-family dwelling” is defined in the Zoning Code as a single, detached dwelling unit.
The title one-family dwelling also includes manufactured housing, certified under the
National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 on a foundation
system, and homes manufactured offsite, used for permanent residence, as well as any state
authorized, certified or licensed residential facility serving six or fewer persons. Single-
family dwellings are permitted in all residential zones.
Accessory Dwelling Unit
Accessory dwelling units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation. Accessory dwelling units may be an alternative
source of affordable housing for lower-income households and seniors. The passage of

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                           2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires cities to use a ministerial process to consider
accessory dwelling units in an effort to facilitate the production of affordable housing state-
wide. Accessory units should be permitted in all residential zones where a primary single-
family unit already exists.
The accessory use section of the La Mesa residential zoning regulations outlines the
requirement for permitting accessory dwelling units. The City amended the zoning
ordinance in October of 2003 and removed the requirement for a conditional use permit
for accessory dwelling units. Accessory dwelling units are now allowed in the R1E, R1R,
R1S, R1 and R1A zones, subject to the following provisions and limitations:
    •    No age restriction will apply to the tenants of accessory dwelling units.
    •    The property owner must occupy either the primary or accessory unit.
    •    Occupancy of the accessory unit is restricted to no more than two persons.
    •    Accessory unit must comply with all adopted municipal codes and zoning
         requirements of the underlying zone.
    •    One additional off-street parking space must be provided.
    •    Approval by the local health officer when a private sewage disposal system is used.
    •    The accessory dwelling unit must be attached to the existing dwelling unit.
    •    When an accessory dwelling unit is attached or made a part of the existing single-
         family residence, the floor area is limited to 560 square feet.
    •    Dwellings modified in conjunction with an accessory unit shall be designed so that
         the appearance of the building remains that of a single family residence.
    •    The accessory unit applicant and all subsequent property owners thereafter shall
         annually certify by affidavit (oath statement) that they are abiding by the restrictions
         set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, and submit evidence that CC&Rs have been
         recorded with the County Recorder.
    •    Only one accessory dwelling unit shall be permitted per lot. The lot must be in a
         single family residential zone (R1E, R1R, R1S, R1, R1A) and have only one single
         family residence currently.
The City has approved 12 applications for secondary units since 2000, for an average of
one unit per year.
In addition to accessory dwelling regulations, within the R1A zone, a second detached
single-family dwelling is permitted on lots that are greater than 9,000 square feet. The R1A
zone is a neighborhood of approximately 330 parcels located in West La Mesa. These
parcels represent latent development potential for additional single-family dwellings.
Multi-Family Dwellings
According to SANDAG, multiple-family housing makes up approximately 45 percent of
the housing stock in La Mesa as of January 2010. The Zoning Ordinance provides for
multi-family developments in the R2, R3 and RB zones, as well as the commercial zones C,
CN, CM, CD, and the mixed-use overlay zone (MU). The maximum density for the R2
zone is 14 units per acre, while the maximum density for the R3 and RB zones is 18 units
                                                                     Housing Element | HE-59

per acre. The maximum residential density within the Mixed Use overlay zone is 40 units
per acre.
Mobile Home Parks
There are seven existing mobile home parks located in La Mesa with approximately 330
units. With the exception of one park located near Maryland Avenue Elementary, all of
the parks are concentrated in the neighborhood around El Cajon Boulevard. These parks
are non-conforming uses because they lack an approved site development plan, that is
required for parks located in residential zones or are located in a commercial zone, which
does not permit mobile home parks. The zoning ordinance provides for modifications but
not expansion of non-conforming uses with the issuance of a special permit.
A new mobile home park could be permitted in a residential zone with a site development
plan approval and compliance with all applicable state and federal laws related to the type
and quality of the mobile home units.
Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing can be an affordable housing option for low and moderate income
households. A manufactured home built after June 15, 1976, certified under the National
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Act of 1974, and built on a permanent
foundation may be located in any residential zone where a conventional single-family
detached dwelling is permitted subject to the same restrictions on density and to the same
property development regulations. Accordingly, the City permits manufactured housing
placed on a permanent foundation by right in the R1E, R1R, R1S and R1 zones.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities licensed or supervised by a Federal, State, or local health/welfare
agency provide 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons who are handicapped and
in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities
of daily living or for the protection of the individual in a family-like environment. The
Community Care Facilities Act (California Health and Safety Code) and Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act (California Welfare and Institution Code) require
that State-licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons (including foster
care) be treated as a regular residential use and therefore must be permitted by right in all
residential zones allowing residential uses. These facilities cannot be subject to more
stringent development standards, fees, or other standards than the same type of housing
single-family homes in the same district.
Residential care facilities are permitted in all residential zones provided that they are
licensed by the State and serve six or fewer persons. Residential care facilities serving more
than six persons are permitted in the R2 and R3 zones with a Site Development Plan and
within all other residential zones provided that they are located along a major collector
roadway. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are also permitted by
right in the C and CN Zones, and in the CD zone pursuant a Conditional Use Permit.
Recently in August 2011, the City approved the CUP for a 15-bed residential care facility in
the R1 zone. The CUP process does not constrain the development of large residential
care facilities.

Emergency Shelters
Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to identify one or more
zoning categories that allow emergency shelters (year-round shelters for the homeless)
without discretionary review. The statute permits the City to apply limited conditions to
the approval of ministerial permits for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have
sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the
City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population. La Mesa’s share of the
regional unsheltered homeless population is estimated to be 55 individuals.
Currently, the La Mesa Zoning Ordinance does not specifically address the provision of
year-round shelters pursuant to State law. Historically, the City has treated emergency
shelters for the homeless as "residential care facilities" or “community care facilities” in the
La Mesa Zoning Ordinance. Section 19.06 of the La Mesa Municipal Code also
establishes the procedure for obtaining emergency temporary shelter permits. The City
will amend its Zoning Ordinance within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to
explicitly address year-round emergency shelters. Objective development and management
standards will be established:
     •   The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the
         facility.
     •   Off-street parking based on demonstrated need.
     •   The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas.
     •   The provision of on-site management.
     •   The proximity to other emergency shelters provided that emergency shelters are
         not required to be more than 300 feet apart.
     •   The length of stay.
     •   Lighting.
     •   Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
The City will permit homeless shelters by right, without discretionary review, within the
General Commercial (C) and Neighborhood Commercial (CN) zones, consistent with
State law. These zones would be the most appropriate zones for emergency shelters since
it allows similar uses, including community care facilities. Properties zoned C and CN are
located along transportation corridors and services. Approximately 417 acres in the City
are designed C and CN. Specifically, properties designated C and CN along the City’s
mixed use corridors of El Cajon Boulevard, University Avenue, and La Mesa Boulevard
are currently developed with older and underutilized uses, offering adequate capacity for at
least one emergency shelter, as required by State law. For example, located along El Cajon
Boulevard within the C zone is an old and underperforming motel, which currently offers
weekly and monthly rentals. Conversion of this type of uses into emergency shelters is
feasible. In the CN zone around Lake Murray Avenue and El Paso Street, typical uses are
old strip commercial along with large surface parking. Many businesses are operating
marginally due to the economy. Reconstruction or adaptive reuse of these old commercial
uses into emergency shelters can be a feasible approach in this area.

Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801(i)) defines "transitional housing" and
"transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing developments,
but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some
predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. Residents of
transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the
homeless in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living
situation. Transitional housing can take several forms, including group quarters with beds,
single-family homes, and multi-family apartments and typically offers case management and
support services to help return people to independent living (often six months to two
years).
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless,
people with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. California Health
and Safety Code (Section 50675.2) defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit
on length of stay, that is occupied by the low income adults with disabilities, and that is
linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining
the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live
and, when possible, work in the community. Target population includes adults with low
incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance
abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided
under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Division 4.5, commencing
with Section 4500, of the Welfare and Institutions Code) and may, among other
populations, include families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the
foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, or homeless
people.
Currently, the City treats transitional housing for the homeless as "residential care facilities"
or “community care facilities” in the La Mesa Zoning Ordinance. Residential care facilities
are permitted in all residential zones provided that they are licensed by the State and serve
six or fewer persons. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are permitted
in the R2 and R3 zones with a Site Development Plan and within all other residential zones
provided that they are located along a major collector roadway. Community care facilities
serving more than six persons are permitted by right in the C and CN Zones and in the CD
zone pursuant a Conditional Use Permit.
However, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not currently address the provision of
supportive housing and the provisions regarding transitional housing do not comply with
current State law. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically define
transitional/supportive housing. Transitional housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code
Section 50801(i) will be permitted by right where housing is permitted, and subject to the
same development standards as other housing development. Supportive housing pursuant
to Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(a)(B)(2) will be permitted by right where
housing is permitted, and subject to the same development standards as other housing
development.

Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are
distinct from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must
contain a kitchen and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen
or bathroom, many SROs have one or the other and could be equivalent to an efficiency
unit.
The La Mesa Zoning Code does not contain specific provisions for SRO units. The City
will amend the Zoning Code within one year of the adoption of the Housing Element to
facilitate the provision of SROs, consistent with AB 2634 (Housing for Extremely Low
Income Households) enacted in 2007.

Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and Safety

permitted by right in an agricultural land use designation. Therefore, for properties that
permit agricultural uses by right, a local jurisdiction may not treat employee housing that
meets the above criteria any differently than an agricultural use. Furthermore, any
employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed
a single-family structure within a residential land use designation, according to the
Employee Housing Act. Employee housing for six or fewer persons is permitted wherever
a single-family residence is permitted. To comply with State law no conditional use permit
or variance will be required.
The City has no agricultural zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance permits agricultural uses
in the R1E, R1R, R1S, and R1 zones. However, agricultural uses in these zones are
accessory uses in the single-family zones with the agricultural products intended for
consumption by the household. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to clarify the
types of non-commercial agricultural activities allowable in the single-family zones as
accessory uses.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable
accommodations (that is, modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land
use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons
an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The City conducted an analysis of the
zoning ordinance, permitting procedures, development standards, and building codes to
identify potential constraints for housing for persons with disabilities. The City’s policies
and regulations regarding housing for persons with disabilities are described below.
Land Use Controls
Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (also known as the
Lanterman Act), small licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be
treated as regular residential uses and permitted by right in all residential districts. In
                                                                  Housing Element | HE-63

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                         2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
accordance with State law (Lanterman Developmental Disability Services Act, AB 846,
compiled of divisions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and Title 14 of
the Government Code), La Mesa permits residential care facilities serving six or fewer
persons in all residential zones. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are
permitted in the R2 and R3 zones with a Site Development Plan and within all other
residential zones provided that they are located along a major collector roadway.
Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are also permitted by right in the C
and CN Zones, and in the CD zone with a Conditional Use Permit. The City does not
have a local requirement for proximity between two special needs housing sites. However,
currently the City has no specific provisions in its Zoning Ordinance to address the
provision of emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room
occupancy housing,
Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing to qualify as a
“family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive
definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates between related and
unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the development and siting of group
homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing families that are similarly sized or
situated.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not contain a definition of family and therefore does
not restrict access to housing in any way.
Building Codes
Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in
multi-family buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or
more condominium units subject to the following building standards for persons with
disabilities:
    •    The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless
         exempted by site impracticality tests.
    •    At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
         served by an accessible route.
    •    All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an
         accessible route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject
         to this chapter may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms,
         bathrooms, living rooms, bedrooms, or hallways.
    •    Common use areas shall be accessible.
    •    If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
The Building Division of the City’s Community Development Department actively
enforces the California Building Code provisions that regulate the access and adaptability
of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. No unique restrictions are in place
that would constrain the development of housing for persons with disabilities.

Reasonable Accommodation
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations
may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling. For example, it may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with
disabilities to waive a setback requirement or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to
ensure that homes are accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular
modification is reasonable depends on the circumstances.
The City of La Mesa does not have a separate process for review and approval of requests
for reasonable accommodation with respect to zoning, permit processing or building laws.
Such requests would be considered in conjunction with the appropriate regulatory process
based on the nature of the request. If the request for accommodation does not require
regulatory review, there is no further involvement on the part of the City. All of the City’s
development regulatory processes provide for appeals procedures.
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to implement a formal reasonable
accommodation procedure to address reasonable accommodation requests.
Permits and Processing
Existing regulations provide for the review and approval of both large and small group
homes in several of the City’s residential zones as well as the Commercial and
Neighborhood Commercial zones. Depending on the zone classification of the property, a
group home for more than six persons requires either a site development plan or a
conditional use permit. There is no standard list of conditions; each site would be reviewed
and conditions assigned based on the specifics of the site and the proposed project. A site
development plan does not require a public hearing. A Conditional Use Permit requires a
public hearing.
A request to retrofit a property to increase accessibility would be processed through the
normal building permit procedures, if the proposed work required a permit. Information
about the zoning, permit processing and building law is provided to property owners,
developers and the general public, by telephone, the City’s web-site and at the Community
Development Department counter.
Conclusion
Overall, the City has no major constraints to housing for persons with disabilities.
However, the Zoning Ordinance will be amended within one year of the adoption of the
Housing Element to address the provision of emergency shelters, transitional housing,
supportive housing, and single-room occupancy housing, as well as reasonable
accommodation procedures.

Development and Planning Fees
Residential developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to process permits and
provide necessary services and facilities as allowed by State law. In general, these
development fees can be a constraint to the maintenance, improvement, and development
of housing because the additional cost borne by developers contributes to overall increased
housing unit cost. However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services
and other public services and facilities in the City. As part of the Housing Element update,
the City contacted several developers active in the City to discuss potential constraints to
housing development. City fees have not been found to act as a constraint to the
development of housing in La Mesa.
The La Mesa City Council adopted a Cost Recovery Policy for planning and building-
related services. The policy establishes the percentage of costs incurred by the City to
provide a service to be recovered in the form of a fee. With the exception of fees for
historic preservation review and discretionary permits and environmental review, the City’s
fee schedule reflects the fees necessary to recover 100 percent of the costs to provide these
services. The recovery policy for discretionary permits and environmental review is 50
percent and the policy for historic preservation review is 25 percent. The City Council
reviews the fee schedule as part of the annual budget process. In the future, fees will be
adjusted to maintain cost recovery objectives. Table HE-40 summarizes the most common
planning fees for the City of La Mesa and surrounding jurisdictions. In general, the City’s
fees are comparable to those in other nearby San Diego communities.

Development impact fees are charged to a new development in order to pay for the local
infrastructure needed to serve it. Within the San Diego region, all 18 of the local
jurisdictions and the County charge development impact fees. Impact fees can be charged
for a variety of public facilities, including utilities, parks, open space, fire stations, libraries,
and transportation improvements such as streets, highways, and transit. The City of La
Mesa charges impact fees for parks and recreation facilities ($3,945 to $5,441 per unit) and
sewer connection ($5,400 per unit).
In 2008, the City of La Mesa adopted an ordinance to implement a Residential Traffic
Impact Mitigation Fee Program. This regional program for collecting a traffic impact fee
on new residential development is required by the TransNet Extension Ordinance and
Expenditure Plan. The fee is intended to ensure that future development pays its fair share
of the cost of the regional arterial system and related regional transportation improvements.
Currently the fee is $2,200, increasing annually based on the percentage set forth in the
Engineering Construction Cost Index published by the Engineering New Record. All
jurisdictions the County of San Diego collect this fee, either at the time of the subdivision
map or as a condition of building permit approval.
An analysis of the building permit fees a housing developer can expect to pay was
conducted using the City’s building permit records and an interview with a developer that is
currently construction new housing. The analysis shows that the cost of building permits is
                                                                                   Housing Element | HE-67

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                         2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
between five and eight percent of the cost of construction. Variables such as number of
fixtures and special features affect the cost of a building permit. Based on interviews with
developers, the City’s fees are not considered a constraint to housing development in La
Mesa.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
In addition to developer fees and exactions, site improvements are an important
component of residential development and include roads, water, sewer, landscaping, and
other on-site infrastructure necessary to serve the new development. All new development
projects are required to install curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and lighting. Developments must
also provide connection to water and wastewater systems. Where roadways are not present,
developers are required to construct all internal roadways for a subdivision, and provide
connections to existing roadways.
Public street widths are established in a document entitled, “Design Criteria for Public
Improvements.” Provided to developers upon request, this document states how wide
streets should be based on type of street proposed. For a typical residential street, the City
requires a 56 foot ROW and 36 feet curb to curb. However, La Mesa is primarily built out
and it is unlikely that new public streets will be created by future housing development.
Future single-family development will most likely be authorized as a PRD with private
access. The width of the access will depend on the length of the proposed street, whether
or not it has through access, and whether it is intended to accommodate on-street parking.
There are no established standards for private streets other than that they must be wide
enough to meet standards established in the California Fire Code for Fire Department
equipment needs.
Required open space is defined in two places in the Zoning Ordinance. The open space
requirement for the R3 zone is 500 square feet for each unit for the first 10 units, 400
square feet per unit for units 11 through 20, and 300 square feet per unit for 21 or more
units. Open space standards are modified in areas covered by the Mixed Use Overlay.
Within the overlay, 200 square feet per unit is required for mixed use projects and 300
square feet for exclusively residential projects.
On- and off-site improvements are necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by
residents and ensure that public services and facilities are in place at the time of need. The
City can mitigate the cost of these improvement requirements by providing affordable
housing development incentives, assisting with land assemblage or write downs, assist
affordable housing developers in obtaining state and federal financing for their projects,
and reducing or deferring fees in exchange for long-term affordability of assisted housing
units.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of La Mesa has adopted the 2010 California Building Code. This code is
considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
No amendments have been made that diminish the ability to accommodate persons with
disabilities. There are no locally amended universal design elements; the universal design
provisions of the California Building Code are enforced. Exceptions or methods of
alternative compliance to the requirements to the California Building Code are contained

in the code. The City has no local ability to waive the provisions of the State building
codes. However, a mechanism within the building code allows for an appeals process to
challenge interpretations of the building code requirements.
Local Permits and Processing Times
The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is
commonly cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of
housing. Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the
time that elapses from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably.
Factors that can affect the length of development review on a proposed project include:
completeness of the development application submittal, responsiveness of developers to
staff comments and requests for information, and projects that are not exempt from the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), require rezoning or general plan
amendment, or are subject to a public hearing before the Planning Commission or City
Council.
Certainty and consistency in permit processing procedures and reasonable processing times
is important to ensure that the development review/approval process does not discourage
developers of housing or add excessive costs (including carrying costs on property) that
would make the project economically infeasible. The City is committed to maintaining
comparatively short processing times. Total processing times vary by project, but most
residential projects are approved within six months. Table HE-41 provides a detailed
summary of the typical processing procedures and timelines of various types of projects in
the City.

Single Family
A single-family dwelling, on an existing parcel, is subject to a building permit to ensure
compliance with zoning regulations and the building and fire codes. Approval of a building
permit for a single- family dwelling is administrative. Staff involved in the approval process
includes members of the Planning Department, Engineering Department, Building
Department and Fire Department. Processing time is approximately six weeks, but is highly
dependent on the quality of the initial submittal.
If the proposed single-family project does not conform to the development regulations of
the zone, it requires a discretionary action. Examples of discretionary approval include a
variance or special permit. This type of project is considered by the Planning Commission.
Approval is based on findings as outlined in the zoning regulations. Processing time for a
Planning Commission hearing is approximately two months.
A single-family project, which includes a minor subdivision, can be approved by the
Development Advisory Board. A single-family project, which includes a major subdivision,
requires a public hearing and approval of the Planning Commission. The basis for
approval is the City’s subdivision regulations and the permitted density of the underlying
zone. The City Council ratifies the Planning Commission decision. The length of time
required to process a subdivision map is variable, based on the size and complexity of the
project. In most cases, the approval process can be completed in 6 months to a year.
Multi-family Housing
Multi-family housing on an existing parcel in the R2 or R3 zone is subject to a building
permit to ensure compliance with zoning regulations and the building and fire codes.
Approval of a building permit for a multi-family project in the R2 and R3 zones is
ministerial. Staff involved in the approval process includes members of the Planning
Department, Engineering Department, Building Department and Fire Department.
Processing time is approximately three months, but dependent on the size of the project
and quality of the initial submittal.
Multi-family housing is subject to site plan and design review when the project is located in
the mixed-use overlay zone or any of the commercial zones. Site plan is a staff level of
review to ensure compliance with development regulations. The Design Review Board is
responsible for design review. Basis of the Design Review Board’s approval is based on
objectives of the Urban Design Guidelines and the Guidelines for Mixed-Use. The Design
Review Board approval of the project is ratified by the City Council. The timeline for site
plan and design review is between two to three months.
If the multi-family housing is proposed as a condominium the approval process also
includes a subdivision map. Processing time is approximately four to six months and the
project is subject to review by the Planning Commission and the City Council.
New residential development is subject to various review and permit processes. The
processing time for the most common residential development applications are
summarized in Table HE-42. These applications are processed concurrently.

General Plan Amendment and/or Zone Change
A proposed housing project may include a general plan amendment and/or rezone. This
type of approval is discretionary, requiring approval by the Planning Commission and City
Council. Approval of a rezone or general plan amendment would depend on the
applicant’s ability to show that the proposal would further and not detract from the City’s
established land use goals.
Site Plan Approval
Approval of some housing projects requires site plan review by the Development Advisory
Board. Site plan approval process is ministerial and is based on a determination of
compliance with applicable development standards, design objectives and health and safety
requirements. A representative from all of the City departments with project oversight
responsibilities, sit as the Development Advisory Board. The process pulls together the
comments from all departments involved in project review and approval. As a result,
deficiencies are more quickly ascertained, processing approval time is minimized, and
issuance of a building permit is facilitated.
CEQA Compliance
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance process determines the
timeframes for approval of many discretionary projects. Most projects are handled through
the negative declaration process, which is processed concurrently with other discretionary
approval processes. However, if an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required a
minimum of six months is added to the approval process.
Design Review Program
The City of La Mesa adopted the Urban Design Program 1987. The development and
adoption of the urban design program was in response to the observation that the design
quality of development occurring at the time was mediocre. La Mesa is nearly built-out.
Because of limited opportunity for new development in La Mesa it is important that all new
development contribute to, and not detract from, the quality of the City’s physical
character. The urban design program has proven to be instrumental in its contribution to
the overall improvement in the quality of new development in La Mesa.
                                                                        Housing Element | HE-71

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                        2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
The Urban Design Program is applied to the following:
    •   Projects in the Urban Design Overlay (D) Zone. The Urban Design Overlay Zone
        covers primarily commercial, downtown, and mixed use areas, as well as specific
        residential areas.
    •   Major projects or projects determined to be on sensitive sites by the Community
        Development Director.
    •   Density bonus projects.
    •   Planned residential developments.
    •   Development proposals, public projects, and other urban design related issues as
        directed by the City Council.
Implementation of the urban design program is fully integrated into the development
review process. The Development Advisory Board and Design Review Board meet on the
same day to review projects. The applicant leaves these meetings with a clear
understanding of the conditions that affect the City’s ability to approve the proposed
project. The Urban Design Program includes a policy to ensure that projects are reviewed
within the development permit processing time limits established by the City and State
Law. Design review does not change the density or the land use of proposed projects and
does not negatively affect housing production in La Mesa.
The design review process does not involve submittal of extraordinary materials. Materials
boards and colored elevations are required as part of project submission. However, these
requirements are typical for project approval processes. Colored elevations facilitate
understanding of how the project will fit into the surrounding area. Like site plan review,
design review also facilitates the process of issuing a building permit.
To assist the project developer, the City developed a Design Review Application that
outlines specific documents required for the review (including site plans, landscape plans,
conceptual grading plans, elevations and structure floor plans). A handout that summarizes
the purpose/intent of the Urban Design Program, the process, the Design Review Board,
and review criteria is also provided. The Urban Design Program does not prescribe any
particular style of architecture but lays out some guidelines to encourage creativity in
design, site planning, and architecture. The Design Review Board reviews a project with
the following general criteria:
    •   Will the project improve the quality of life and the spatial form of La Mesa?
    •   Will the project fit in La Mesa on an urban scale and on the proposed site?
    •   Does the project attempt to incorporate the basic principles of good urban design,
        such as: fit, function, access, structural orientation, safety, adaptability, vitality,
        congruence, sense of place, efficiency, and stability/durability.
    •   Have special features been added to the project to help it fit into the community or
        site, or to make it a memorable project and a source of community pride?
    •   How will the project look in years to come?
    •   Does it fit the plans for La Mesa?

    •   Does the project reflect La Mesa’s sense of history or other characteristics which
        help define the community?
    • Can the project be served adequately by the City and other public service
        providers?
The design review process does not add to the timeframe and cost of projects, it merely
ensures that proposed development fits in with surrounding neighborhood and contributes
to an attractive and well-designed urban environment.
An important, and often overlooked, benefit of the design review process is that it builds in
an extra level of community support for discretionary projects. As these projects advance
through the authorization process, an endorsement from the Design Review Board
provides support for final project approval.
Conditional Use Permit
A conditional use is a use determined by the City as having such unique or diverse
characteristics that predetermination of regulations for either its operation or location is not
practicable. The Planning Commission has the authority to grant, conditionally grant or
deny a conditional use permit application, based on the following findings:
    •   The project’s compatibility with other uses in the same vicinity.
    •   Whether the issuance of such a conditional use permit will lead to the creation of a
        nuisance or if it would endanger the public health, safety or order by: (1)
        Unreasonably increasing pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic in the area in which the
        premises are located; or (2) Increasing the incidence of disruptive conduct in the
        area in which the premises are located; or (3) Unreasonably increasing the level of
        noise in the area in which the premises are located.
    •   Whether the use is consistent with the general plan.
An application for a Conditional Use Permit requires a public hearing and appeals of any
Planning Commission decision can be made to the City Council.
Developer Interviews
In the Fall of 2011, a series of telephone interviews were conducted with various
developers who have recently completed residential projects in La Mesa. These
developers generally had positive experiences working with the City and expressed no
major concerns with issues or constraints.
All of the developers interviewed complimented City staff for being accessible and efficient
and many attributed this to the City’s small size. Several developers mentioned the City’s
design review process as the only drawback to the City’s relatively efficient approvals
process. They noted this additional step added several weeks to the overall timeline, but all
of those interviewed reiterated that the additional design guidelines were reasonable and
not an undue burden on the overall cost of development. A detailed summary of the
individual interviews and suggestions can be found in Appendix A.
                                                                    Housing Element | HE-73

Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Natural landforms, hazards, or habitat can constrain residential development opportunities
in a community. Portions of otherwise developable sites with steep or unstable slopes, soils
that are susceptible to liquefaction or other geologic conditions, or contain sensitive habitat,
could constrain development capacity. Another factor adding to the cost of new home
construction is the cost of providing adequate infrastructure such as streets, curbs, gutter,
sidewalks, water and sewer lines, and street lighting. The cost of these additions or
improvements is borne by developers and then, to the extent possible, added to the cost of
new housing units, impacting affordability.            This section summarizes potential
environmental and infrastructure constraints on residential development in La Mesa.
Geologic and Seismic Hazards
Most of La Mesa is underlain by soil of the Redding Series. Redding soils are derived from
the sedimentary rock of the marine terraces. The Redding soil series is characterized as
gravelly loam at the surface with a subsoil layer of gravelly clay. At a depth of
approximately 30” an impervious clay hardpan layer can sometimes be found.
There are three characteristics of Redding soils that are significant in an urban setting. The
first is the high degree shrink swell behavior. Because it contains relatively large amounts
of clay, this soil expands when wetted and contracts as it dries. Without adequate
reinforcement buildings and infrastructure constructed on this soil have been warped or
otherwise damaged. Redding soils are also highly erosive. Grading operations and land
stripped of vegetation increase the erosion potential of the soil. The third factor which is
significant in an urban setting is the high runoff potential characteristic of Redding soils.
Clay content and the presence of an impervious hardpan layer limit water percolation and
increase runoff. Runoff potential affects the size and configuration of flood control
facilities.
A variety of techniques are available to mitigate hazards related to soil. Once the particular
characteristics of a soil are known appropriate construction practices can be incorporated
into development plans. Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code contains basic
regulations governing grading. In 1974, the City of La Mesa City Council adopted a
Grading Ordinance which includes Chapter 70 with additional provisions which address
concerns specific to the City.
Several major active faults pass through the Southern California region. They are parallel,
trend in a northwest/southeast direction, and display lateral or sideways movement. The
San Andreas Fault is over 650 miles long and runs northwest from the Gulf of California to
north of San Francisco Bay. This fault is the most active fault in California and the
maximum magnitude of future earthquakes could range from 7.3 to 8.2. A magnitude 8
earthquake on the southern segment of the San Andreas could produce Mercalli intensities
of VII to IX in eastern San Diego County.
The San Jacinto fault is parallel to and west of the San Andreas. This fault stretches 125
miles and cuts diagonally across the northeast corner of San Diego County. The San
Jacinto Fault is the most active in San Diego County and portions of this fault are only 60

La Mesa General Plan
                                                                                        2012 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
to 80 miles from the City of San Diego. An earthquake of magnitude 7.0 could produce
Mercalli intensities of VI or VII in the coastal areas. The Elsinore Fault is approximately
135 miles and is the longest active fault in the County. An earthquake with a magnitude as
high as 7.0 is possible for this fault and could cause damage equal to intensity VII or
greater.
Ground shaking is by far the greatest seismic hazard. Distance mitigates ground shaking
originating on the San Andreas, San Jacinto and Elsinore faults and ground shaking from a
moderate earthquake centered on any of these faults might not be detected in La Mesa. In
addition to ground shaking, liquefaction, a soil phenomenon in which water saturated
unstable soil loses its strength when subjected to the forces of intense prolonged ground
shaking, can also occur. Most of La Mesa is underlain by sedimentary rocks of the marine
terraces. Soils developed from these rocks are clay rich and fairly well consolidated.
The La Mesa Safety Element of the General Plan provides policy guidelines in the area of
seismic safety. Policies requiring the implementation of the Uniform Building Code will
also reduce seismic risk for new construction.
Flood Hazards
In La Mesa, water courses providing drainage of storm runoff include Alvarado Creek,
Chollas Creek and Spring Valley Creek. Dry most of the year, these creeks can fill quickly
with water during storm episodes and can result in localized temporary flooding conditions.
Flood hazards in the City are primarily the result of a lack of adequate storm drain
facilities. Rapid growth of the 1950s and 1960s occurred at a time when little attention was
paid to cumulative impacts. As a result, flood hazard mitigation planning must retrofit
flood control facilities into a built up environment.
Existing development is at-risk throughout all the flood impacted areas in La Mesa. Along
the Alvarado Creek commercial development and portions of the trailer parks south of
Alvarado Road are at risk. Traffic hazard on Interstate 8 could result from flooding of
Alvarado Creek. A mix of businesses and residential uses on University Avenue are
affected by flooding within the Chollas Creek basin. Single-family residential uses as well as
Bancroft Drive and access to Highway 125 are located in the flood hazard area of Spring
Valley Creek.
All new development in the City is required to be elevated above the level of the 100 year
flood. New development, or substantial improvement of existing structures, requires
construction of flood protection improvements. Recent construction of flood control
facilities along the Alvarado Creek are the result of compliance with flood control
regulations affecting new development. Future redevelopment along Alvarado Creek will
provide additional flood control improvements.
The Safety Element of the City’s General Plan includes policies to provide flood control
and storm water drainage facilities that will protect the health and safety of La Mesa’s
citizens and minimize impacts to property to the greatest extent feasible.

Sanitation and Wastewater Capacity
The City of La Mesa provides sewer service to all areas within the city limits and owns,
operates and maintains approximately 165 miles of sewer mains. Wastewater is collected
from four drainage basins and conveyed to transmission and treatment facilities operated
by the City of San Diego’s Metropolitan Wastewater Department (MWWD). The City
currently owns capacity rights for transmission and treatment of 6.34 million gallons per
day (MGD) and anticipates a future increase in contract capacity of 0.6 mgd.
To protect surface water from contamination, environmental regulations related to sanitary
sewer overflows are increasingly stringent. In 2007 the City completed an evaluation of the
wastewater system to evaluate how the City complies with these regulations and identify
steps require to improve deficiencies. The wastewater master plan includes an analysis of
the existing flows, the capacity of the system to handle these flows and an assessment of
future capacity needs.
Existing wastewater flows were estimated to be approximately 5.38 mgd, which is 0.96 mgd
less than the City’s currently contracted capacity at the MWWD treatment plant. Based on
the La Mesa’s share of the RHNA allocation, approximately 1,250 housing units
(remaining RHNA) will be accommodated in the planning period of this housing element.
The wastewater capacity needs for 1,250 housing units is approximately 0.34 mgd, based
on a generation rate of 270 gallons per day per dwelling unit. This is well within the level
of excess capacity that currently exists.
Water Supply
The Helix Water District delivers water to a highly urbanized services area with a
population of approximately 268,000 residents and 55,600 service connections. Covering
nearly 50 square miles, the district serves the cities of La Mesa, El Cajon, Lemon Grove
and portions of the unincorporated communities of Lakeside and Spring Valley.
The District operates as a public agency under the Irrigation District Law of the State of
California. Governed by an elected Board of Directors, the District establishes water
charges, levy assessments and all policy, procedures and regulations related to providing
high quality water service to the District’s customers.
The District is a member of the San Diego County Water Authority, which is a member of
the Metropolitan Water Authority. The district purchases water from these wholesaler
agencies and does not sell water to other agencies. Based on historical averages,
approximately 17% of the District’s supply comes from sources within San Diego County
and 83% is imported from Northern California and the Colorado River via the
Metropolitan Water District and the County Water Authority.
As required by the California Water Code, in June of 2011 the Board adopted the 2010
Urban Water Management Plan Update. The Plan includes an analysis of the Districts
efforts to reduce urban per capita water use by 20 percent by the end of 2020 as required
by state law SBx7-7 enacted in 2009.

Approximately 77% of the District’s water is provided to residential users. Total annual
water demand within the district is 33,211 acre feet/year, with residential demand at 25,000
acre feet/year. Current per capita water production rate, a measure of per capita use, has
been steadily declining. The current per capita production rate of 110.7 gallons per capita
per day is the lowest on record.
The Urban Water Management Plan projects that, between 2010 and 2050, the land within
the District’s existing service area that is devoted to residential uses will increase by
approximately 1,200 acres. This increase in residential service will be the result of
diminished agricultural uses and redevelopment of currently served but under-developed
parcels. The Plan projects that 43,012 acre feet/year will be required to serve the needs of
District customers in 2050.
The Urban Water Management Plan includes an analysis of the District’s ability to serve
the water needs of low income housing. The SANDAG Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) for the 2005-2010 planning period is the basis for the analysis. Table
HE-43 shows the projected demand for water to serve the needs of lower income housing
units within the District’s service area between the present and 2035.

For the purposes of the La Mesa Housing Element, assuming 1,250 housing units during
the planning period and a household size of 2.3, future water demand for residential use is
316,250 gallons per day. The Helix Water District adopted the Urban Water
Management Plan in the summer of 2011. The Plan indicates adequate water supply to
meet the capacity requirements in La Mesa.
Fire Protection
Over the years fire services in La Mesa have changed as a result of changing needs. When
the area was less developed, wild land fires occurred more frequently than they do today.
As the land development pattern intensifies, higher density housing and multi-story
structures require a different type of response then the typical single family dwelling.
The City’s Fire Department is currently staffed at the minimum level based on equipment
operations. Most of the Department’s resources are directed at fire suppression. However,
                                                                      Housing Element | HE-77

the Department’s fire prevention division has been expanded to better inform and educate
residents about fire prevention.
La Mesa residents receive a high level of fire protection service. The Insurance Services
Office (ISO) evaluates fire services provided to communities to determine levels of fire risk
and therefore insurance risk. ISO evaluates a community’s fire protection records, staffing,
equipment and water supply. Points are assigned to all aspects of fire department
operations. La Mesa’s Fire Department currently has a rating of 2, which compares
favorably with other fire agencies in the area. ISO rating ranges from 1 to 10, with Class 1
representing the best public protection and Class 10 indicating no recognized protection.

Housing Resources
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in the City of La Mesa. This analysis includes an evaluation of the
availability of land resources for future housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its
share of the region’s future housing need, the financial resources available to support
housing activities and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the
City’s housing programs. Additionally, this section examines opportunities for energy
conservation.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
Future housing need refers to the share of the regional housing need that has been
allocated to the City of La Mesa. The State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) assigns a numeric regional housing goal to the San Diego Association
of Governments (SANDAG). SANDAG is then mandated to allocate the housing goal to
city and county jurisdictions in the region. In allocating the region’s future housing needs
to jurisdictions, SANDAG is required to take the following factors into consideration
pursuant to Section 65584 of the State Government Code:
     •  Market demand for housing;
     •  Employment opportunities;
     •  Availability of suitable sites and public facilities;
     •  Commuting patterns;
     •  Type and tenure of housing;
     •  Loss of units in assisted housing developments;
     •  Over-concentration of lower income households; and
     •  Geological and topographical constraints.
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the SANDAG region was adopted
in October 2011. This RHNA covers an 11-year planning period (January 2010 through
December 2020). The major goal of the RHNA is to assure a fair distribution of housing
among cities and counties within the San Diego region, so that every community provides
an opportunity for a mix of housing for all economic segments. The housing allocation
targets are not building requirements, but goals for each community to accommodate
through appropriate planning policies and land use regulations. Allocation targets are
intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning are made available to address anticipated
housing demand during the planning period.
The City of La Mesa’s share of regional future housing needs is a total of 1,722 new units
for the January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020 period. This allocation is distributed into
various income categories, as shown Table HE-44. The RHNA includes a fair share
adjustment which allocates future (construction) need by each income category in a way
that meets the State mandate to reduce the over-concentration of lower income households
in one community.

          Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are also required to project the housing needs of
          extremely low income households (0-30% AMI). In estimating the number of extremely low
          income households, a jurisdiction can use 50% of the very low income allocation or apportion the
          very low income figure based on Census data. As shown in Table HE-10, extremely low income
          households constitute 50% of the very low income group. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of 430

Credits toward RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010 as the baseline for growth projections for the
Housing Element planning period of 2013‐2020, jurisdictions may count toward the
RHNA any new units built or issued certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2010. From
January to December 2010, 470 housing units have been developed, under construction,
or entitled in La Mesa. Table HE-45 summarizes the units that can be credited against the
City’s RHNA.

Units Constructed: Since January 1, 2010, 298 new units have been constructed in La
Mesa, including the Pravada and Alterra at Grossmont Station project. The project was
developed by Fairfield Residential and is comprised of over 500 units, but 297 of these
units were issued Certificates of Occupancy in 2010. Of these units, 45 were set aside for
affordable households (18 very low income and 27 moderate income). The La Mesa
Community Redevelopment Agency assisted in the development of the project with $2.7
million in housing set-aside funds. While the remaining 252 units are not set aside
specifically for lower and moderate income households, the market rents for these units
are still affordable to moderate income households in La Mesa. Rents at the Pravada and
Alterra currently range from $1,390 for a one-bedroom unit to $1,985 for a two-bedroom
unit (see affordable housing costs in Table HE-31 on page HE-41.
Units under Construction: A total of 34 units are currently under construction in the City.
All of these units are part of the Mesa del Sol development. These units are market-rate
ownership units and affordable primarily to above moderate income households.
Units Entitled: In addition, the City has approved a number of market-rate housing
projects. These projects total 138 units.
Remaining RHNA: Accounting for the units constructed, under construction, and entitled,
the City has a remaining RHNA of 1,252 units (412 extremely low/very low income units,
326 low income units, 23 moderate income units, and 491 above moderate income units).

Residential Sites Inventory
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the land
inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the region’s projected
growth. This is accomplished through an evaluation of vacant and underutilized residential
and mixed-use properties with potential for residential development within the timeframe
of the Housing Element.
Sites Inventory Considerations
Realistic Capacity
Consistent with HCD Guidelines, methodology for determining realistic capacity on each
identified site must account for land use controls and site improvements. The La Mesa
Sites Inventory utilizes a conservative estimate of 75 percent of maximum development to
demonstrate realistic capacity for development in residential zones. This estimate is based
on existing patterns of development in residential areas and was derived using analysis of
densities on properties in residential areas.
Recent mixed use developments, however, have achieved densities very near actual
maximum densities, and many have exceeded maximums due to the use of density
bonuses in exchange for the provision of affordable housing. The Mixed Use Urban land
use designation allows for densities up to 40 units per acre. To encourage lot consolidation,
development projects on sites smaller than 10,000 square feet are only allowed a density of
30 units per acre. The Mixed Use Urban land designation permits solely residential
developments.       Mixed-use developments in Commercial designations require a
commercial component.
Table HE-46 lists four approved mixed use projects and two proposed mixed use projects.
These properties are all zoned General Commercial (C) with a Design Review Overlay (D)
and a Mixed Use Overlay (MU). Based on the mixed use development history in La
Mesa, the assumption that new mixed use development may occur at densities of 35 units
per acre represents a realistic and reasonable assumption.

Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate Housing Affordable to Lower Income
Households
The City recognizes that higher-density developments provide the potential for lower
construction costs because of economies of scale created and are therefore most suitable
for development of housing affordable to lower income households. Mixed use sites
included in the sites inventory have the greatest potential to accommodate housing
affordable to lower income households, as they allow densities of at least 30 units per acre
(up to 40 units per acre). Per Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B), the City’s
zoning is consistent with the 30 units per acre standard for metropolitan jurisdictions such
as La Mesa and therefore considered appropriate to accommodate housing for lower
income households (up to 80 percent AMI).
Lot Consolidation Potential
Many of the sites chosen for the sites inventory are comprised of contiguous parcels and
provide excellent opportunities for lot consolidation. The sites inventory tables (Appendix
B) also identify lot consolidation potential (contiguous parcels).
The City offers several policies to encourage lot consolidation and reuse of existing
properties in the mixed use areas. The Mixed Use Urban land use designation allows for
densities up to 40 units per acre. To encourage lot consolidation, development projects on
sites smaller than 10,000 square feet are only allowed a density of 30 units per acre. Several
projects have resulted from the joining of contiguous parcels, as indicated in Table HE-47.
The City’s history of approvals listed in Table HE-47 demonstrates that developers have
                                                                                   Housing Element | HE-83

  Sites Inventory-Residential Development Potential
  The City’s remaining share of the regional housing need will be addressed through the
  identification of available vacant land and underutilized, mixed use sites that are suitable
  and appropriately zoned for development of more intense residential uses. Appendix B
  includes a listing of individual sites, and identifies the size, zoning designation, general plan
  designation, and realistic capacity for each.
  Scattered Vacant Sites
  The City of La Mesa is largely built out (approximately 98 percent built out). The major
  constraint on new residential construction is the lack of developable land. The inventory
  of vacant land designated for residential or mixed use development totals close to 95 acres
  (Table HE-48). The most significant potential for new residential development occurs in
  areas designated in the General Plan Mixed Use Urban, Urban Residential, and Suburban
  Residential. Vacant residential properties are most prominent south of Interstate 8 (Figure
  HE-9).

Note: Realistic Potential Housing Units for residential sites were calculated at 75 percent of maximum allowed
development. This estimate is based on existing patterns of development in residential areas and was derived through
a GIS survey of densities on properties in residential areas. Realistic Potential Housing Units for mixed use sites (35
du/ac) are based on the mixed use development history in the City of La Mesa.
In several instances, parcels are included in the Sites Inventory Table (Appendix B) that yield no units based on the
size of the site. These are included in the inventory only if they are adjacent to a parcel or parcels that yield at least
one unit. This allows for a larger site development area.
Two vacant parcels are not included in the totals, as they are included in the sites inventory as part of the El Cajon
Boulevard North site. The site is comprised of two vacant parcels and five non-vacant parcels.

La Mesa General Plan

Mixed Use Opportunity Sites
The sites presented in this section represent the most realistic opportunities for recycling to
higher-density residential uses based on underutilized character of the site, developer
interest, ease of access from major roads, size of site, and location near transit and services.
Based on field work and staff input, this initial list was reviewed to eliminate properties with
potential development for other uses and properties with economically viable businesses.
The sites inventory analysis identified six sites with the potential for residential
intensification that have either a Mixed Use or Commercial designation. The six sites yield
a potential combined capacity for 4,384 units (Table HE-49). Figure HE-9 indicates the
location of all sites identified in this Housing Element, and a detailed listing of parcels is
included in Appendix C.
One of the greatest opportunities for infill development in La Mesa is found in areas
designated in the General Plan as Mixed Use Urban. The transit corridors along El Cajon
Boulevard, University Avenue, La Mesa Boulevard, Baltimore Drive south of I-8, and in
the neighborhood around the Spring Street Trolley Station are designated Mixed Use
Urban. The City’s vision for these areas include revitalization and renewal of deteriorating
properties, increased housing opportunities, and commercial activity that supports a
pedestrian-oriented environment. To facilitate development in these areas, in 2008 the City
Council approved the Mixed Use Urban Overlay zone, EIR, and Design Guidelines. The
overlay zone regulations and design guidelines promote revitalization of La Mesa’s transit
corridors by increasing options for the shape and function of future development.
Replacement of obsolete buildings and land uses with new housing opportunities and an
invigorated commercial sector is the desired outcome. The Mixed Use Urban designation
encompasses approximately 184 acres.
The potential for creation of residential units in mixed use areas is predicated on prior
development, demonstrated interest from developers, and the limited opportunities for
higher-density development elsewhere in the City or in the immediate surrounding area.
The Mixed Use Urban designation allows for solely residential developments at densities
of 40 units per acre. Mixed use developments approved in the City have achieved close to
or above the maximum densities. For the purposes of calculating capacity, a conservative
estimate of 35 units per acre has been used and is based on the established mixed use
development history in La Mesa (Table HE-46). The densities that can be achieved in
mixed use areas are appropriate to facilitate the production of housing that is affordable to
lower and moderate income households.
One site in this inventory is designated for regional commercial use. In the Regional
Commercial designation, mixed use developments (residential development with a
commercial component) are allowed, and no maximum density limit applies.

Site #1 - Police Station Site: The 1.3-acre
former Police Station site is located on
Allison Avenue between Date and Spring
Streets in downtown. The site formerly
housed the City of La Mesa Police
Department, which has been relocated to
University Avenue. This old police station
has already been demolished to make room
for future development. Envisioning a
development with a residential component
on the site, the La Mesa Community
Redevelopment Agency purchased the site
when the new police station was built. One
of the goals of the 2010-2014 Agency
Implementation Plan was to re-use the
former police station site to improve the
supply of low and moderate income
housing.              The Agency estimates
development potential of 50 affordable
residential units on the site.
                                                                            Site 1: Former Police Station Site
The Police Station property is also included
in the Downtown Village Specific Plan Area. One of the central goals of the Downtown
Village Specific Plan is to “retain and encourage residential development.”
The site is currently designated Civic Center; as part of the General Plan update the
designation will change to Downtown Commercial. The Downtown Commercial

designation allows for mixed use and sets no maximum density on the residential
component. Prior to the economic downturn that began in 2007, the City worked closely
with a developer interested in a mixed use project on the site that included 50 residential
units (38.5 units per acre) and a small commercial component. While the economic
climate caused the project application to be withdrawn, it does demonstrate developer
interest and the high potential for development on the site. A conservative, mixed use
density estimate of 35 units per acre is used for the purpose of calculating residential
development capacity and yields 46 residential units.
Site #2 - Park Station Site: The Park Station Site is located at the southeast corner of El
Cajon Boulevard and Baltimore Drive in downtown La Mesa. A development project
proposal for a mixed-use urban village named “Park Station at the Crossroads of La Mesa”
has been submitted to the City for review on this 6.5-acre infill site. The project is
undergoing the review process, and an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is currently
being completed. The proposed mixed use project would include approximately 499
residential units (77 units per acre) along with office, retail, and open space uses.
                       Site 2: Park Station Site
The 6.5-acre site is comprised of seven parcels and a street right-of-way that is included in
the development plan. The site is currently home to several small used car dealerships, a
small pump station owned by the City, and an American Legion building. The Legion is a
co-applicant on the Park Station project application. The remainder of the site is under
single ownership (minus the pump station). The site is located adjacent to Interstate 8.
The site’s proximity to the La Mesa Boulevard Trolley Station also provides for
increased utilization of public transportation. Based on the potential for commercial and
residential intensification and major access from light rail and an interstate freeway, the
current uses represent an underutilization of the properties.
The site is designated Mixed Use Urban, which allows residential and mixed uses with a
density of 40 units per acre. While the development proposal estimates 499 units (77 units
per acre density), there is no certainty those units will be achieved, as the proposal has not
been approved and the details of the type of housing are unknown at the time. At an
average, the site can accommodate a density of 35 units per acre and yield 228 residential
units.
                                                                      Housing Element | HE-89

Site #3 – Montebello North: Located on the north side of El Cajon Boulevard between
Thorn Drive and Woodyard Avenue, the El Cajon Boulevard North site is comprised of
six parcels. A single owner owns five of the parcels. Two parcels are currently vacant, two
parcels are occupied by single-family homes (one each), one parcel has a small commercial
building, and two parcels contain a rental mobile home park with 39 trailers.
The 3.18-acre site is included because
of developer interest shown prior to
the recession. In 2007, an applicant
submitted a development application
proposing 169 residential units (a
density of 54 units per acre with a
density bonus). That application was
eventually withdrawn due to worsening
economic conditions. In 2009, the
same applicant completed a General
Plan Amendment/zone change to
apply the City’s Mixed Use Urban
designation to the northernmost two
acres of the site. While the
development proposal has not been
resubmitted, subsequent correspond-
ence with the developer confirmed a
continued interest in the project.
Due to the property owner’s interest
in developing the site with higher-
density housing, tenant leases at the
mobile home park acknowledge that                      Site 3: El Cajon Boulevard North Site
the site is under consideration for
conversion. Under the withdrawn development plan, a relocation plan was included for
several long-term tenants.
The site is designated Mixed Use Urban, which allows residential and mixed uses with a
density of 40 units per acre. A conservative, mixed use density estimate of 35 units per acre
has been used for the purpose of calculating residential development capacity and yields
111 residential units.
Site #4 - Montebello South Site: Located on the south side of El Cajon Boulevard between
Park and Maple Avenues, the El Cajon Boulevard South site is comprised of a single, 1.5-
acre parcel. The existing use on the site is a vacant, older commercial building and parking
lot that has been fenced due to lack of use.
The site is included because developer interest has been shown in the site. In 2007, an
applicant submitted a development application proposing 80 residential units (a density of
54 units per acre with a density bonus). That application was eventually withdrawn due to
worsening economic conditions. While the development proposal has not been

resubmitted, subsequent correspondence

interest in the project.
The site is designated Mixed Use Urban,
which allows residential and mixed uses with
a density of 40 units per acre. A conservative,
mixed use density estimate of 35 units per
acre has been used for the purpose of
calculating residential development capacity
and yields 52 residential units.
Site #5 - University Avenue Site: The 2.75-
acre University Avenue site is comprised of
five parcels under single ownership. The site
is bounded on the north by University
Avenue, on the west by Parks Avenue, and
on the east by Dale Avenue. To the south
are a variety of higher-density residential
uses. Two parcels contain an auto garage
use, and the remaining three parcels contain
a closed, vacant used car dealership and a       Site 4: El Cajon Boulevard South Site
small U-Haul office.
The site was chosen due to single
ownership, location along a major
roadway, pedestrian and automobile
access on three sides of the site, and
the underutilized nature of the site.
The site is designated Mixed Use
Urban, which allows residential and
mixed uses with a density of 40 units
per acre. Based on the potential for
residential intensification and ease of
access, the current auto uses and
vacancies represent an under-
utilization of the properties. A con-
servative, mixed use density estimate
of 35 units per acre has been applied
for the purpose of calculating
residential development capacity and
yields 96 residential units.

comprised of two large parcels under

home to the Grossmont Shopping center. The site has been chosen due to its location
adjacent to the Interstate 8/Highway 125 interchange and adjacent to the region’s light rail
system. The Grossmont Center has also been designated as one of the City’s Smart Growth
areas and as a potential “Urban Center” for the City. An Urban Center is envisioned as
containing sub-regional business; civic, commercial, and cultural centers; mid- and high-rise
residential; and office and commercial buildings. An Urban Center is served by transit
lines and local bus services.
Due to the site’s high profile location
and age of buildings (over 50 years
old), there is a high potential for
intensification. The site is located
within the Grossmont Specific Plan,
which calls for the area to be
developed as a relatively high-density
urban center with densities “at the
upper end of ranges feasible under
market demand.” The area is
described as having the potential for a
broad range of office, retail, and
residential uses. The Specific Plan                    Site 6: Grossmont Mixed Use Site
states: “Where the opportunity exists,
mixed use developments should be encouraged, especially adjacent to the trolley corridor.”
The Specific Plan also envisions future expansion of the site.
The shopping center is surrounded by acres of parking lots, which could readily be
repurposed with more intense land uses. The immediate area has seen intensification
recently with the expansion of Grossmont Hospital and the Trolley Station project.
The Grossmont site is designated Regional Commercial, which allows mixed use
development with no cap on residential density. A residential density of 60 units per acre
has been assumed for the purpose of calculating residential development capacity on this
site. This density estimate is based on a previous, similar project, the Grossmont Trolley
Station project. The Grossmont Trolley Station included commercial and office uses, as
well as 527 residential units on eight acres at a density of 67 units per acre (including 80
affordable units). The Trolley station received Redevelopment Agency assistance of $2.7
million of Agency housing set-aside funds. The Trolley Station project was developed on a
significantly smaller site and as such, the City feels confident that a similar density would
work on this site. Assuming a density of 60 units per acre, the site could yield 3,851
residential units.
Adequacy of Sites for RHNA
The City’s vacant land inventory alone can accommodate 674 units, 236 of which are on
sites suitable for lower income housing (up to 80 percent AMI), based on their allowable
density of 40 units per acre. In addition, residential sites at a density of 23 units per acre
can facilitate the development moderate income housing. The Multiple Unit Residential
and Mixed Density Residential zones offer a capacity of 72 units at 23 units per acre.

 The City also has a substantial inventory of underutilized commercial properties that can
 easily be redeveloped with a residential component. Market studies in the region have
 indicated future growth will most likely be spearheaded by mixed use developments.
 These redeveloped sites are capable of providing residential opportunities for another
 4,384 units at a density suitable for lower income housing. Overall, the City has the ability
 to accommodate 5,058 units on vacant and underutilized sites, adequate to accommodate
 the City’s remaining RHNA of 1,252 units. Table HE-50 summarizes the City’s potential
 capacity in comparison to its RHNA status. Sites at higher densities can facilitate lower
 income housing but can also be used to accommodate moderate and above moderate
 income.

 Availability of Site Infrastructure and Services
 All residential and mixed use sites identified in the inventory are located within urbanized
 areas where infrastructure and public services are readily available. Public services and
 facilities are available to adequately serve all of the potential housing sites. Lateral water
 and sewer lines would be extended onto the properties from the adjoining public rights-of-
 way as development occurs. Any missing public improvements (e.g. curbs, gutters,
 sidewalks, etc.) along property frontages would also be constructed at that time.

Financial Resources
Providing affordable housing for lower and moderate income households require the
creative layering of multiple funding sources. Key funding sources available to the City of
La Mesa for the construction, acquisition/rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable
housing include the following:
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program was initiated by the
Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1974. The primary objective of
the program is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a
suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low
incomes (up to 80 percent AMI). CDBG funds can be used for a wide array of activities,
including:
    •   Housing rehabilitation;
    •   Lead-based paint screening and abatement;
    •   Acquisition of buildings and land;
    •   Construction or rehabilitation of public facilities and infrastructure;
    •   Public services for low income persons and persons with special needs; and
The City of La Mesa is an entitlement jurisdiction for CDBG funding and receives
approximately $400,000 annually. The City uses CDBG funds to provide a variety of
housing and supportive services for lower income residents and those with special needs.
HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME)
The HOME program provides federal funds for the development and rehabilitation of
affordable rental and ownership housing for households with incomes not exceeding 80
percent of area median income. The program gives local governments the flexibility to
fund a wide range of affordable housing activities through housing partnerships with private
industry and non-profit organizations. HOME funds can be used for activities that
promote affordable rental housing and homeownership by low income households
(households earning up to 80 percent of the AMI).
La Mesa is a participating jurisdiction that receives HOME funds through its participation
in the San Diego HOME Consortium. Each year, the City receives approximately
$200,000 in HOME funds. The City uses HOME funds to support a Downpayment and
Closing Cost Assistance program.
Housing Choice Voucher Program
The San Diego County Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
serves as the Housing Authority of the County of San Diego. HCD manages approximately

$6.5 million in federal funds committed to the Housing Choice Voucher Rental Assistance
Program on behalf of the City of La Mesa.
Administrative Capacity
Described below are public and private sector organizations that have been involved in
housing activities in La Mesa. These agencies are involved in the improvement of the
housing stock, expansion of affordable housing opportunities, preservation of existing
affordable housing, and/or provision of housing assistance to households in need.
City of La Mesa Community Development Department
The Community Development Department provides primary administrative oversight of
the City’s housing projects and programs. Within this department, the development
services division provides planning, building and engineering assistance to housing
developers. The housing division manages housing programs, assists developers with tax
credit applications, submits applications for HCD-sponsored housing grant opportunities,
administers the CDBG and HOME programs, manages the Downpayment and Closing
Cost Assistance program.
Redevelopment Agency
Since its formation in 1964, the La Mesa Community Redevelopment Agency has adopted
three redevelopment plans in the City. Pursuant State law, the La Mesa Redevelopment
Agency has established a Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Fund using 20 percent of the
tax increment revenue generated within each of the redevelopment project areas. The tax
increment revenue is intended to increase and improve the supply of low and moderate-
income housing. According to AB1X26 and the California Supreme Court decision of
December 29, 2011, the La Mesa Community Redevelopment Agency will cease to exist
on February 1, 2012.
San Diego County Department of Housing and Community Development
The County of San Diego, Department of Housing and Community Development
Department coordinates and administers Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of the City of
La Mesa. According to the Department, approximately 900 households were receiving
Section 8 assistance as of December 2011.
Housing Developers and Service Providers
The City collaborates with a number of affordable housing developers and service
providers to accommodate the housing needs of La Mesa residents. The following are
housing developers and service providers active in the region:
    •   San Diego Community Housing Corporation (SDCHC): SDCHC is a housing and
        community development organization focused on developing, preserving, and
        maintaining affordable housing. Since 1994, SDCHC has acquired/developed
        1,055 multi-family units, developed 48 new single-family homes, and rehabilitated
        58 single-family homes.

     •  San Diego Habitat for Humanity: Habitat for Humanity has worked throughout the
        County of San Diego to provide affordable single-family ownership housing for
        lower income households.
     •  Center for Community Solutions: The Center for Community Solutions provides
        services for battered women and their children including an emergency 30-day
        shelter, food, clothing, counseling services, and legal assistance. The agency also
        operates a 24-hour domestic violence hotline. Agency staff networks with other
        service providers to provide a full range of assistance to domestic violence victims.
     •  Center for Social Advocacy: The Center for Social Advocacy operates the Shared
        Housing Program to match people in need of housing with people who have
        housing resources. This effort provides affordable housing for the housing seeker
        and additional income for the housing provider.
     •  San Diego Interfaith Housing: San Diego Interfaith Housing Foundation (SDIHF)
        aims to reach out to seniors, the disabled and working poor not served by the
        traditional housing market. SDIHF attempts to create better and more affordable
        housing opportunities for neighbors throughout San Diego County. The
        organization has built and manages several successful communities consisting of
        over 900 affordable housing units. Their role in these developments included, but
        was not limited to project feasibility, land acquisition, analyzing and securing
        financing, coordinating and managing the development team of architects,
        engineers and contractors, lease-up, property management and resident services.
     •  Interfaith Shelter Network: Interfaith Shelter Network provides a Rotational Shelter
        Program for homeless families and individuals at East County churches during the
        winter months.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Title 24, Building Energy Standards for Residential Development, establishes energy
budgets or maximum energy use levels. The standards of Title 24 supersede local
regulations, and State requirements mandate Title 24 requirements through
implementation by local jurisdictions.
The City will continue strict enforcement of local and state energy regulations for new
residential construction, and continue providing residents with information on energy
efficiency. Specifically, the City of La Mesa website is linked to the San Diego Gas &
Electric (SDGE) Company website. SDGE provides an Energy Savings Assistance
Program that is designed to help lower the monthly bill, while making the home more
comfortable. Income qualified households can request SDG&E’s authorized contractors
to provide free:
     •  New, energy-efficient refrigerators, air conditioners, and lighting;
     •  New or repaired doors and windows;
     •  Microwaves, water heaters and high-efficiency clothes washers; and
     •  Insulation, weatherstripping and caulking to lower heating and cooling costs

Housing Plan, Goals, and Policies
The Housing Plan presents the City’s eight-year housing plan, which sets forth goals,
policies, and programs to address the identified housing needs and other important
housing issues. The City of La Mesa’s Housing Plan for addressing the identified housing
needs is detailed according to the following five areas:
    •    Maintenance and Preservation
    •    Provision of Adequate Sites
    •    Affordable Housing Opportunities
    •    Removal of Governmental Constraints
    •    Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
The City of La Mesa intends to implement the following goals and policies to address the
community’s identified housing needs.
Maintenance and Preservation
Substandard and deteriorating housing units, in addition to the obvious problems of blight,
can expose occupants to a wide range of hazards ranging from electrical fire to exposure to
toxic substances used in construction. Many factors can determine the “life expectancy” of
a dwelling unit including the quality of workmanship, age of building, type of construction,
and deferred maintenance. The City’s goal is to preserve the existing housing stock and to
avoid a degree of physical decline that will require a larger rehabilitation effort to restore
quality and value. As an older community with nearly half its housing stock over 30 years
old, it is important that the City facilitates an ongoing housing maintenance program. In
addition, it is important to preserve affordable housing units in the community to maintain
adequate housing opportunities for all residents.
Goal HE-1: High-quality and well-maintained residential neighborhoods.
Objective HE-1.1: Ensure that existing residential neighborhoods are well-maintained.
    Policy HE-1.1.1: Continue to utilize the City’s code enforcement program to bring
    substandard units into compliance with City codes and to improve overall housing
    conditions in La Mesa.
    Policy HE-1.1.2: Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents
    of the importance of property maintenance to long-term housing quality.
    Policy HE-1.1.3: Utilize neighborhood revitalization strategies to focus financial
    resources and efforts in improving targeted neighborhoods.

    Policy HE-1.1.4: Educate owners of historic properties on the benefits of home repair
    and remodeling using design and materials consistent with the character of their
    neighborhood.
    Policy HE-1.1.5: Preserve “at-risk” affordable units through monitoring, working with
    potential nonprofit purchasers/managers, and exploring funding sources available to
    preserve the at-risk units.
    Policy HE-1.1.6: Upgrade substandard infrastructure, such as storm drains and
    sidewalks, to benefit lower income neighborhoods.
    Policy HE-1.1.7: Provide for condominium conversion that creates affordable
    ownership housing opportunity, while minimizing impact on the availability of rental
    housing opportunities for lower income households. Provide sufficient relocation
    assistance to tenants displaced by condominium conversion.
Objective HE-1.2: Ensure that new development enhances existing residential
neighborhoods.
    Policy HE-1.2.1: Continue to assess reasonable development fees on new residential
    units to finance necessary public improvements.
    Policy HE-1.2.2: Encourage developers to provide street planting, landscaping, lighting,
    and underground utilities as part of any subdivision.
    Policy HE-1.2.3: Continue to implement design review criteria that encourage high
    quality standards of design and materials in all residential developments.
    Policy HE-1.2.4: Encourage cost effective energy efficient housing, including the use of
    passive systems, to decrease energy use.
Provision of Adequate Sites
The City of La Mesa encourages the production of new housing units that offer a wide
range of housing types to ensure that an adequate supply is available to meet the existing
and future needs of all groups. The provision of a balanced inventory of housing in terms
of     unit    type    (e.g.,   single-family,   apartment,       condominium,     mixed-use
residential/commercial), cost and style will allow the City to fulfill a variety of housing
needs.
Goal HE-2: Availability of a wide range of housing by location, type of
unit, and price to meet the existing and future needs of La Mesa
residents.
Objective HE-2.1: Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City.
                                                                   Housing Element | HE-113

    Policy HE-2.1.1: Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City,
    including single-family homes, townhomes, apartments, condominiums, and residential
    mixed use to fulfill regional housing needs.
    Policy HE-2.1.2: Encourage the production of housing for all segments of the La Mesa
    population, including those with special needs and extremely low incomes.
    Policy HE-2.1.3: Assist residential developers in identifying land suitable for housing
    development, such as opportunities for lot consolidation.
    Policy HE-2.1.4: Encourage housing constructed expressly for lower and moderate
    income households not be concentrated in any single neighborhood of the City.
    Policy HE-2.1.5: Encourage the development of residential units that are accessible to
    handicapped persons or are adaptable for conversion to housing for handicapped
    persons.
    Policy HE-2.1.6: Encourage developers to employ innovative solutions to meet housing
    needs, including adaptive reuse of existing non-residential buildings.
    Policy HE-2.1.7: Encourage the development of mixed-use residential projects along
    the City’s transit corridors.
    Policy HE-2.1.8: Facilitate infill housing developments to ensure the efficient use of
    land and a sustainable development pattern, as well as where smaller lots sizes are
    appropriate.
Affordable Housing Opportunities
The City recognizes the most cost-effective approach to providing affordable housing to its
lower and moderate income households is to maintain a supply of permanent or long-term
affordable housing units. The following policies are intended to expand the City’s
affordable housing inventory.
Furthermore, the option of home ownership has become a privilege in Southern
California, which is often not available to lower and even moderate income households,
particularly the first-time home buyers. While condominiums offer a relatively affordable
home ownership option in La Mesa, the down payment serves as a barrier to many
potential home-buyers.
Goal HE-3: Housing for lower income households, including ownership
and rental opportunities for moderate-income households.
Objective HE-3.1 Facilitate the development of housing for lower and moderate income
households.

    Policy HE-3.1.1: Facilitate the development of lower and moderate income housing by
    offering developers incentives such as: 1) density bonuses; 2) City participation in on-
    and off-site public improvements; and 3) flexibility in zoning and development
    standards.
    Policy HE-3.1.2: Encourage the development of housing for seniors and persons with
    disabilities by offering density bonuses and other zoning incentives, such as reduced
    parking requirements, and encourage such housing to be located within close proximity
    to community facilities and transportation services.
    Policy HE-3.1.3: Monitor all regulations, ordinances, processing procedures and fees
    related to the rehabilitation and/or construction of dwelling units to assess their impact
    on housing costs.
Objective HE-3.2 Assist in creating ownership and rental opportunities for moderate-
income households.
    Policy HE-3.2.1: Provide favorable home purchasing options to low and moderate
    income households using down payment assistance.
    Policy HE-3.2.2: Increase homeownership in the City through education, availability,
    and affordability.
Removal of Governmental Constraints
Due to their unique circumstances, certain groups in the community require special
assistance to attain decent and affordable housing. The following goals and policies
address the special housing needs of the elderly, disabled, homeless, agricultural workers,
and persons of lower and moderate income households, especially those of extremely low
incomes. In addition to polices designed to increase the availability and adequacy of the
City’s affordable housing stock, it is important that support services are available that
ensure efficient utilization of the housing stock. Of particular importance in La Mesa are
housing related services for seniors, the disabled, and the homeless.
Goal HE-4: A City that mitigates potential governmental constraints to
housing production and affordability.
Objective HE-4.1 Remove constraints to housing production and affordability.
    Policy HE-4.1.1: Continue to support and actively market shared housing as an
    affordable housing option for seniors.
    Policy HE-4.1.2: Continue to support and coordinate with social service providers and
    regional agencies to address the housing-related needs of La Mesa residents,
    particularly those with special needs.

     Policy HE-4.1.3: Review and adjust as appropriate residential development standards,
     regulations, ordinances, and processing procedures that are determined to constrain
     housing development, particularly housing for lower and moderate income households
     and for persons with special needs.
Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community, the City must ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all
residents.
Goal HE-5: A City where all residents have an equal opportunity to
reside in the housing of their choice.
Objective HE-5.1 Promote and support fair housing practices.
     Policy HE-5.1.1: Prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to
     race, color, religion, sex, familial status, marital status, disability/medical conditions,
     national origin, source of income, and sexual orientation.
     Policy HE-5.1.2: Continue to further fair housing choices through actively expanding
     housing opportunities and removing impediments to fair housing.
Implementing Programs
The goals and policies outlined above address La Mesa’s identified housing needs. These
goals and policies are implemented through a series of housing programs offered by the
City. This section describes the programs the City will carry out during the timeframe of
the Housing Element. Each program identifies the specific steps needed to carry out the
policies. Also provided under each program are the anticipated impacts (quantifiable
objectives if feasible, target population), the responsible agencies, financing, and the
schedule for completion. Table HE-53 at the end of this section summarizes the
quantifiable objectives set forth for the various housing programs.
The following programs address a range of housing needs and represent a commitment by
the City to address those needs in a responsible manner. The programs are designed to
build upon one another; no single program should be perceived as the panacea for all the
City’s needs. Most of the programs are continued from the previous housing element
cycle. Many of them are modified to reflect the changed market conditions or streamlined
to offer flexibility in implementation.
Maintenance and Preservation
The majority of the City’s housing stock is in good condition; however, given the age of the
housing stock, a proactive housing code enforcement program and rehabilitation program
is critical in addressing the issue of deferred maintenance.

Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program
In the past, the City of La Mesa has operated a Housing Rehabilitation Program. However,
this program generated very little interest with residents and the City discontinued this
program in June 2010 due to funding limitations. To replace this program, the City plans
to combine its Single-Family and Multi-Family Rehabilitation and Acquisition activities into
a single program to ensure the quality and maintenance of its housing stock.
In the past, the City has utilized HOME funds to enable households earning up to 80
percent of median income to purchase their first homes. The City uses non-profit agencies
to acquire and rehabilitate deteriorated single-family homes. Assistance is provided in the
form of a loan that is secured by a deed of trust. The rehabilitated homes were then sold to
income-qualified first-time homebuyers.
As part of the Comprehensive Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy, the City would
include acquisition and rehabilitation of deteriorated multi-family housing projects, with the
goal of generating privately initiated improvements in some of the other complexes in the
neighborhood. The City will provide funds to a selected developer (typically a non-profit)
to purchase a deteriorated multi-family rental property. The property would then be
rehabilitated, with the options to combine some of the smaller units into larger family units,
and/or converting the rental project into a condominium project. If the rehabilitated
project is structured as for-sale housing, the City would assist qualified tenants in purchasing
the units through its Downpayment and Closing Cost Assistance (DCCA) Program.
Relocation assistance would be provided to existing tenants who have to be either
temporarily or permanently located.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Facilitate the acquisition and rehabilitation of two housing units annually (16 units
        over eight years).
    • Contact qualified nonprofit housing developers annually to identify interest and
        opportunities for acquisition/rehabilitation, as well as potential funding sources.
    • Continue to evaluate potential program options and the suitability of this program
        annually.

Preservation of Historic Housing
The City of La Mesa dates to the early 1900s. Neighborhoods adjacent to downtown and
throughout the City have examples of housing units that date to that period. The City
conducted a survey of historic resources that resulted in an inventory over 375 structures
and sites that merit inclusion based on age, architecture and local history. The City
administers a program that allows owners of historic properties to obtain a local landmark
status, allowing for “Mills Act” property tax relief. The Historic Preservation program
supports the continued viability of the City’s older housing stock and provides a means of
making ownership of old homes more cost effective.

Enforcement of Uniform Housing Code
The La Mesa Building Inspection Division works in conjunction with the San Diego
County Department of Environmental Health to perform code enforcement on the City’s
housing stock. The County implements an aggressive code enforcement program
addressing substandard housing conditions among apartment houses and hotels in La
Mesa. The City’s Building Inspection Division performs code enforcement on a complaint
basis throughout the City. Inspections are also done at the invitation of a property owner
applying for rehabilitation financial assistance.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Continue to enforce the Uniform Housing Code.
    • Identify opportunities for acquisition/rehabilitation of housing units for lower and
        moderate income households.

Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Within the January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2023 “at-risk” housing analysis period,
two projects (Murray Manor and La Mesa Springs) are considered at risk of converting to
market-rate housing. These projects offer 346 housing units, inclusive of 326 units that are
affordable to lower income households. Both projects are at risk due to expiring Section 8
contracts. Detailed analysis on the potential conversion of this project into market-rate
housing is provided earlier in this Housing Element. The City of La Mesa will work with
property owners, interest groups and the State and Federal governments to implement the
following actions on an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Annually monitor the status of Murray Manor and La Mesa Springs, since both
        projects have the potential to lose their Section 8 subsidies due to discontinuation
        of the program at the federal level or opting out by the property owner.
    • If there is an opportunity, due to the pending sale of the property, establish contact
        with public and non-profit agencies interested in purchasing and/or managing units
        at risk. Where feasible, provide technical assistance to these organizations with
        respect to financing.
    • Should the property owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate, ensure
        that tenants are properly noticed and informed of their rights and that they are

Sustainable Building Program
In January 2006, the La Mesa City Council approved a sustainable building policy that was
recommended by the Sustainable Building Task Force. The purpose of a Citywide policy
on sustainable building is to demonstrate the City’s commitment to environmental,
economic, and social stewardship, to yield cost savings to the City taxpayers through
reduced operating costs, to provide healthy work environments and to contribute to the
City’s goals of protecting, conserving, and enhancing the region’s environmental resources.
It is the intent of the City to adopt best design and management practices to reduce storm
water run-off, water consumption, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and landfill
waste. It is also the intent of the City to provide healthy working environments for its
employees.
Under the new policy, the City of La Mesa will evaluate incorporation of sustainable
building principles and practices into the planning, design, construction, management,
renovation, operations, and decommissioning of all City facilities that are constructed and
owned by the City. This does not include those projects already under construction prior to
the adoption of this policy. All newly constructed or renovated City facilities and buildings
are encouraged to meet a minimum LEED Silver rating and exceed current State of
California Title 24 Energy Code requirements. Design and project management teams are
encouraged to meet higher LEED rating levels.
The City has also established sustainable policies relating to purchasing, building
maintenance and operation, City vehicles, education and outreach, and private
development.
     Time Frame and Objectives:
     • Evaluate incentives to encourage sustainable building practices for new construction
         and rehabilitation of residential and mixed-use developments in 2012.
     • Incorporate sustainable design principles and practices into the City’s Design
         Guidelines for residential and mixed-use developments by 2013.

Condominium Conversions
La Mesa strives to find a balance between affordable homeownership and affordable rental
opportunities in the community. Condominium conversions can create for-sale housing
opportunity for moderate income households (120 percent AMI). However, the
conversion of apartments to condominiums removes rental units from the City’s housing
stock and could impact lower income households and households with other special
housing needs. The City’s current policy regarding condominium conversions is codified in
Section 23.03.020 of the La Mesa Municipal Code. The number of rental units that can be
converted to condominiums in La Mesa is limited to 50 percent of the annual average of
the number of new apartments that were constructed in the preceding two fiscal years.
Given the current market condition, condominium conversion activities are limited.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Continue to implement the City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
    • Monitor condominium conversion activities to ensure the ordinance provides
        adequate protection of the rental housing stock.

    Financing:                  Departmental budget
Provision of Adequate Sites
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all segments of the community is the
provision of adequate sites for housing of all types, sizes and prices. This is an important
function in both zoning and General Plan designations.
Land Use and Urban Design Element
The Land Use and Urban Design Element of the La Mesa General Plan designates more
than half of the City’s land inventory for residential uses. A variety of residential types are
provided for in La Mesa, ranging from 3 to 40 dwelling units per acre, with higher densities
achievable through the State’s density bonus provisions and City’s senior housing policy.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Annually monitor the City’s land use inventory to ensure available capacity to meet
        the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 1,722 units (430
        extremely low/very low income units, 326 low income units, 302 moderate income
        units, and 664 above moderate income units).
    • Assist developers in identifying available sites for residential and mixed-use
        developments.

Lot Consolidation Program
The City’s Zoning Ordinance offers a key density incentive for lot consolidation. For the
Mixed Use Urban zone, parcels up to 10,000 square feet are allowed a density of 30 units
per acre while parcels with more than 10,000 square feet are allowed a density of 40 units

per acre. Such “graduated” density policy encourages consolidation of smaller parcels to
achieve a 33-percent increase in density. The City will play an active role in facilitating lot
consolidation, particularly as it relates to parcels listed in the sites inventory.
     Time Frame and Objectives:
     • Work with developers and owners of small sites to identify and consolidate parcels
         to facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income households.
     • Make the lot consolidation procedure easier to navigate by posting the procedure
         on the City website.

Affordable Housing Opportunities
New construction creates housing opportunity for prospective homeowners and renters.
However, the cost of new construction is substantially greater than other program
categories. Incentive programs, such as density bonus, provide a mechanism to facilitate
private sector production of new affordable housing development.
Facilitate the Development of Higher Density Housing
In an urbanized area like La Mesa, land represents a significant cost component in both
multi- and single-family development projects. One way to lower the cost of land per unit
is to allow a greater number of dwelling units per acre of land. Increased density generally
results in a lower land cost per unit, and greater unit affordability.
As a means of reducing residential land costs, La Mesa will encourage development at the
upper end of its residential density ranges, particularly in targeted areas such as the mixed
use districts along the City’s transit corridors. A key opportunity site for future
residential/mixed use development is the Grossmont Center, consisting of two parcels and
totaling 64.2 acres with a potential to accommodate 3,851 units.
     Time Frame and Objectives:
     • Contact qualified developers of high-density residential and mixed-use
         developments to discuss opportunities in the City. Facilitate the master planning of
         the Grossmont Center through actions such as expedited review and processing of
         development proposals and lot splits and updating the Grossmont Specific Plan.
         Work with qualified developers in their efforts to pursue State and federal funding,
         such as providing letters of support for funding application and assistance in
         compiling data and information needed for funding application.
     • During pre-application meetings with developers, communicate the City’s vision for
         sustainable development, particularly in the Mixed Use Urban district and other
         targeted neighborhoods for higher-density housing.

Land Assembly and Write-Downs
The City is authorized to utilize CDBG and HOME funds to write-down the cost of land
for the development of lower and moderate-income housing. The intent of this program is
to reduce land costs to the point that it becomes economically feasible for a private
developer to build units which are affordable to low and moderate income households. As
part of the land write-down program, the City may also assist in acquiring and assembling
property and in subsidizing on-site and off-site improvements.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Should a feasible opportunity arise, provide land write-downs for residential/mixed-
        use projects affordable to lower income households, especially if the projects
        include housing for extremely low income households.
    Responsible Agencies:       Community Development Department
    Financing:                  CDBG and HOME
Affordable Housing Development Incentives
The City has adopted a policy to facilitate the development of affordable housing for
seniors and persons with disabilities. This policy provides for flexibility in development
standards for housing for seniors and persons with disabilities through a specific plan
process. Through the specific plan process, developers proposing to build housing for
seniors and persons with disabilities are eligible for increases above the base density, as well
as reduced development standards including parking and open space requirements. The
package of development incentives provided is worked out on a case-by-case basis.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Continue to provide incentives for the development of affordable housing for
        senior and people with disabilities through implementation of the specific plan
        process.
    • Develop appropriate incentives in 2013 to encourage affordable housing projects
        that include units for extremely low income households.
    • Market incentives to housing developers via information on City website and at
        public counters.

Downpayment and Closing Cost Assistance (DCCA) Program
The DCCA Loan Program is a homeownership program designed to make funds available
to low and very low-income households to help with the purchase of their first home within
the City of La Mesa. This program provides supplemental financing in the form of a silent
second trust deed loan, which means that a buyer must still qualify for a first mortgage
through a qualified private lender but that the City will loan the buyer additional funds in
the form of a second mortgage to make the purchase affordable to the buyer’s income
level. As of December 2011, the maximum loan amount is $70,000 but the actual amount
available to the homebuyer will represent the amount needed to make an eligible property

affordable to a particular household. The actual loan amount will depend on several
factors, including but not limited to, the borrower’s household income, the purchase price
of the property, and the amount of borrower’s equity/assets contributed to the transaction.
The DCCA program will assist with purchases of condominiums, townhomes, or single-
family detached homes located anywhere within the municipal boundaries of the City of La
Mesa.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Assist three households annually (24 households over eight years).
    • Continue to promote the DCCA program by posting information on City website,
         making brochures available to the public, and through occasional articles in the
         City’s newsletter.

Coordination with Housing Developers
Both non-profit and for-profit housing developers can promote, assist, or sponsor housing
for lower and moderate income people. The following housing developers are active in
East San Diego County in the area of affordable housing production:
    •    San Diego Interfaith Housing
    •    San Diego Community Housing Corporation
    •    Habitat for Humanity
    •    Mexican-American Anti-Poverty Advisory Committee (MAAC)
    •    Affirmed Housing Group
    •    Fairfield Residential LLC
The City will contact these developers periodically to identify and pursue affordable
housing opportunities in the City.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Maintain a list of affordable housing developers for purposes of soliciting their
         involvement in development projects in La Mesa.
    • As funding permits, issue Request for Proposals (RFPs) to solicit the participation
         of a qualified Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) to work
         with the City to provide affordable housing opportunities.
    • Participate with affordable housing developers to review available federal and State
         financing subsidies and apply as feasible on an annual basis.
    • Assist and support developers of housing for lower-income households with site
         identification, supporting applications, conducting pre-application meetings,
         assisting with design and site requirements, and providing regulatory incentives and
         concessions.

Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) Program
The Housing Choice Voucher (formerly known as Section 8) program extends rental
subsidies to very low income (up to 50 percent of AMI) families and the elderly, who
spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the
difference between the excess of 30 percent of the monthly income and the actual rent.
Rental assistance is issued to recipients as vouchers, which permit tenants to locate their
own housing and rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in the area,
provided the tenants pay the extra rent increment.
The City of La Mesa contracts with the San Diego County Housing Authority to administer
the Housing Choice Voucher 8 program. As of December 2011 over 900 La Mesa
Households are beneficiaries of the Housing Choice Voucher program. Rental assistance
is the most efficient way to serve the very lowest income households. The City will support
the County Housing Authority in obtaining additional funding for this program.
     Time Frame and Objectives:
     • Continue to contract with the San Diego County Housing Authority to administer
        the Housing Choice Vouchers Program and support the County Housing
        Authority’s applications for additional allocations.
     • Assist the Housing Authority in marketing the program to home seekers and
        property owners.

Shared Housing Program
The Center for Social Advocacy (CSA) offers a Shared Housing Program, which matches
homeowners with those in need of affordable housing through a mutual exchange of
money, services, or personal care for the homeowner. CSA recommends three
arrangements:
     •  Shared Housing: the renter pays $450 per month plus utilities. The homeowner
        provides a bedroom and a shared common space. The renter may negotiate a
        lower rent in exchange of limited assistance. For example, the renter may be asked
        to cook, clean or drive.
     •  Even Exchange: The renter provides 20 hours, five days a week of household
        service. The homeowner provides a bedroom and shared common space. No
        money is exchanged between the renter and the homeowner.
     •  Live-in: The renter provides 24 hours, five days a week of personal care. The
        homeowner provides bedroom, shared common space, room/board and a
        compensation of $1,000 to $1,200 per month.

Quarterly support, training, and educational seminars for care-giving live-ins are also
provided. The City of La Mesa will continue to assist in program outreach efforts for the
shared housing program through advertisements in the City newsletter, and placement of
program brochures in key community locations.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Continue to provide financial assistance for the shared housing program to match a
        minimum of five lower income persons annually (40 persons over eight years).
    • Assist in marketing this program via City website and occasional articles in City
        newsletter.

Removal of Governmental Constraints
Pursuant to State law, the City is obligated to address, and where legally possible, remove
governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. Removing constraints on housing development can help address housing needs
in the City by expediting construction, and lowering development costs.
Housing for Special Needs Groups
Extremely low income households and households with special needs have limited housing
options in La Mesa. Housing types appropriate for these groups include: emergency
shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units.
The City of La Mesa Zoning Ordinance does not specifically address the provision of such
housing types. Pursuant to State law, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to address
these housing options.
    Time Frame and Objectives: Within one year of the adoption of the Housing
    Element, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to address the following:
    •   Emergency Shelters: The City has historically treated emergency shelters for the
        homeless as "residential care facilities" or “community care facilities” in the La Mesa
        Zoning Ordinance. Section 19.06 of the La Mesa Municipal Code also establishes
        the procedure for obtaining emergency temporary shelter permits. However, these
        provisions do not comply with current State law. The City will amend its Zoning
        Ordinance within one year of adoption of the Housing Element to explicitly
        address emergency shelters. The City will permit homeless shelters by right, without
        discretionary review, within the General Commercial (C) and Neighborhood
        Commercial (CN) zones, consistent with State law. The City will establish
        development standards that will encourage and facilitate the development of
        emergency shelters. Emergency shelters will only be subject to development and
        management standards that apply to residential or commercial development in the
                                                                 Housing Element | HE-125

      same zone except the City may apply written and objective standards for the
      following:
          o   Maximum number of beds;
          o   Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need;
          o   Size and location of on-site waiting and intake areas;
          o   Provision of on-site management;
          o   Proximity to other shelters;
          o   Length of stay;
          o   Lighting; and
          o   Security during hours when the shelter is open.
   •  Transitional and Supportive Housing: The City has historically treated transitional
      housing for the homeless as "residential care facilities" or “community care facilities”
      in the La Mesa Zoning Ordinance. Supportive housing is not expressly addressed
      in the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically
      define transitional/supportive housing. Transitional housing pursuant to Health
      and Safety Code Section 50801(i) will be permitted by right where housing is
      permitted, and subject to the same development standards as other housing
      development. Supportive housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section
      50675.14(a)(B)(2) will be permitted by right where housing is permitted, and
      subject to the same development standards as other housing development.
   •  Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units: The La Mesa Zoning Ordinance does not
      contain specific provisions for SRO units. The City will amend the Zoning
      Ordinance within one year of the adoption of the Housing Element to facilitate the
      provision of SROs, consistent with AB 2634 (Housing for Extremely Low Income
      Households) enacted in 2007.
   •  Farmworker Housing: The City has no agricultural zones. The City’s Zoning
      Ordinance permits agricultural uses in the R1E, R1R, R1S, and R1 zones.
      However, agricultural uses in these zones are accessory uses in the single-family
      zones with the agricultural products intended for consumption by the household.
      The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to clarify the types of non-commercial
      agricultural activities allowable in the single-family zones as accessory uses.
   •  Reasonable Accommodations: The City of La Mesa does not have a separate
      process for review and approval of requests for reasonable accommodation with
      respect to zoning, permit processing or building laws. The City will amend the
      Zoning Ordinance to implement a formal reasonable accommodation procedure to
      address reasonable accommodation requests.
   •  Accessory Units: Currently, the City allows attached accessory units by right in the
      R1E, R1R, R1S, R1 and R1A zones. The City will explore the appropriateness of
      allowing detached accessory units.

Fees for Development Services
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the costs of processing
permits and providing services and facilities. On a case-by-case basis, as part of a negotiated
affordable housing development agreement, the City may consider granting a partial fee
waiver or paying a portion of the project fees to facilitate the development and/or
rehabilitation of housing units affordable to lower income households.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Consider granting a fee deferral, partial fee waiver, or paying a portion of the
         required fees to facilitate the development and rehabilitation of housing units
         affordable to lower income households, especially projects that include units for
         extremely low income households.

Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community, the Housing Plan must include actions that promote housing opportunities for
all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national
origin, color, age, disability/medical conditions, sexual orientation, or source of income.
Fair Housing Services
La Mesa takes steps to affirmatively further fair housing by contracting the services of a
non-profit to provide fair housing services for the City. The City currently contracts with
the Center for Social Advocacy (CSA) to provide fair housing services for its residents and
housing professionals. The CSA focuses on education and training for property owners
and managers and also serves as an intermediary between complainant and the State and
federal housing authorities.
In 2010, the City, along with all other jurisdictions in San Diego County, participated in a
regional Analysis of Impediments (AI) to Fair Housing Choice. The City will continue to
implement the recommendations outlined in the AI.
    Time Frame and Objectives:
    • Continue to broadly disseminate information about fair housing rights via the
         website and informational brochures at city and civic buildings.
    • Implement recommendations of the San Deign County Regional Analysis of
         Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI).
    • Continue to contract with a service provider to provide fair housing services to La
         Mesa residents and housing professionals.

Housing Developer Interviews
Reynolds Communities
1908 Friendship Dr. #A
El Cajon, CA 92020-1129
Contact: Neal Reynolds, VP
Projects in La Mesa: In 2007, Reynolds Communities completed the Belvedere, a project
comprised of 21 detached three-story, single-family homes in La Mesa, affordably priced
from the mid-$400,000s with up to 1,423 square feet of living space.
Developer Comments: Mr. Reynolds stated City staff was efficient and responsive.
Obstacles to development in the City are the same as those that plague developers in any
municipality. Specifically, Mr. Reynolds stated the permitting process was lengthy. For his
21-unit project, Mr. Reynolds estimated the permitting and approval process took just
under one year, from the submittal of building plans to the start of actual construction. Mr.
Reynolds did note, however, that this was standard for any jurisdiction and that the
permitting process in La Mesa was actually much quicker than in other jurisdictions he had
worked with (which include the City and County of San Diego).
Bradley Land Group
457 Glencrest Drive
Solana Beach, CA 92075
Contact: Brad Tuck, President
Projects in La Mesa: Bradley Land Group is currently in the process of developing mixed-
use projects in the City of La Mesa. The projects are higher density residential projects with
ground floor retail components fronting El Cajon Boulevard.

Developer Comments: Mr. Tuck has worked in communities all over the state of
California and found the City of La Mesa’s staff to be efficient, cooperative and easy to
work with. He commented that the City’s small size meant that bureaucracy was minimal
and the staff was accessible. Mr. Tuck noted the staff seemed open to new and different
ideas and were not obstructionist in the least. He did not identify any obstacles to
development that were specific to the City of La Mesa and stated that his experience with
the City had been more positive than those he has had with other jurisdictions.
Roth Construction Corporation
4850 Talmadge Park Row
San Diego, CA 92115
Contact: Jim Roth
Projects in La Mesa: Roth Construction Corporation completed the Talmadge
Condominium project in La Mesa in 2007. The development consisted of 30 three
bedroom condominiums as well as some minor commercial remodeling.
Developer Comments: Mr. Roth stated that compared to other jurisdictions, the City of La
Mesa was very easy to work with, easily accessible and very competent. He stated that the
only notable complication with building in the City was its Design Review Board. The
design review process was an additional step in an already lengthy planning process. Mr.
Roth estimates that for his 30-unit development, the entire approvals process (including
design review) took approximately 8-9 months, which was comparable to other jurisdictions
but still time consuming. He noted the Design Review Board was not unreasonable and
made suggestions within reason. Mr. Roth was also sympathetic to the fact that their intent
was simply to ensure high quality development within the City. Overall, Mr. Roth had a
positive experience working with the City of La Mesa and his only suggestion to the City
was to look into ways of streamlining the approvals and design review process.
Zephyr Partners
11750 Sorrento Valley Road #130
San Diego, CA 92121
Contact: Chris Dahrling, Development Director
Projects in La Mesa: Zephyr Partners is in the process of developing the Mesa del Sol
project, a 36-unit single-family development in the City of La Mesa. The project is currently
under construction.
Developer Comments: Mr. Dahrling has a positive working relationship with the City of La
Mesa. He stated City staff was accessible, friendly and easy to work with. Mr. Dahrling
noted the additional step in the City’s approval process of getting approval from the Design
Review Board, but he stated that this step went rather quickly. For his 36-unit project, Mr.
Dahrling estimates the entire design review process took six to eight weeks and that most of
the review focused on the exterior design of his project. Overall, Mr. Dahrling’s experience
with the City was very positive but his one suggestion would be to have a single contact
                                                                 Housing Element | HE-135

person from the City assigned to each development project to enhance efficiency.
Currently, developers deal with multiple City staff persons in charge of different aspects of
the project (i.e. engineering, planning, etc) and it may be more efficient to have a single staff
member handling all aspects of a development so there is no overlap of requests or
unexpected delays.
Darmor Development
PO Box 3337
La Mesa, CA 91944-3337
Contact: Bob Spriggs, President
Projects in La Mesa: Darmor Development completed two planned residential
development projects in La Mesa in 2001 and 2004.
Developer Comments: Mr. Spriggs has developed projects all over San Diego County and
as far as local jurisdictions go, he states that his experience in La Mesa has been a very
good one. He noted that the approval process was similar to those in neighboring cities and
he estimates the entire process lasted just under one year for each project. For the most
part, Mr. Spriggs felt City staff was approachable and easy to work with. He noted that, for
his projects, what he found to be most difficult was complying with the City’s off-site
improvements requirements. Mr. Spriggs found the process of getting bonds exonerated to
be very difficult and his suggestion to the City would be for staff to review the bond
exoneration process. He suggests possibly incorporating a “hold back” or granting partial
releases to make things easier on future developers.
Fairfield Residential, LLC
5510 Morehouse Dr. Suite 200
San Diego, CA 92121
Contact: Brendan Hayes, Vice President
Projects in La Mesa: Fairfield Residential recently completed the 527-unit Alterra at
Grossmont Trolley development in 2010. Eighty of these units were set aside as affordable
for lower and moderate income households. The City of La Mesa assisted in the
development of these apartments with redevelopment set-aside funds.
Developer Comments: Mr. Hayes had a positive experience working with the City of La
Mesa. He stated that most likely due to its size, the City was exceptionally fast and efficient.
The project that Fairfield completed was quite a large development and not in keeping with
most of the City, which consists primarily of single-family neighborhoods, however, since
the project was located at a trolley station, the developers were able to utilize the City’s
flexible design standards for transit oriented development. As a part of Fairfield, Mr. Hayes
has worked all over the country and would put La Mesa in the top ten percent of all local
jurisdictions he has worked with. He noted that City staff seemed to be very in sync and
there seemed to be very good communication between the Planning staff, and the City
Manager’s office.
