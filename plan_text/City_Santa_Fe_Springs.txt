I.         INTRODUCTION
A.     COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The City of Santa Fe Springs is located approximately 13 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles and 18 miles north of the City of Long Beach.
Neighboring cities include Whittier, La Mirada, Cerritos, Norwalk, Downey, and
Pico Rivera. The City lies at the convergence of two major transportation routes
– Interstate Routes 5 and 605 – and is traversed by the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe rail corridors. Santa Fe Springs’ regional location and proximity to
major transportation corridors have been important factors contributing to the
City’s development as a predominately industrial community.
Santa Fe Springs incorporated in 1957, with the majority of its residential
growth occurring during the 1950s. Less than ten percent of the City’s nine
square miles is designated for residential use, with residential neighborhoods
historically concentrated in the western portion of the City away from industrial
uses, although small pockets of housing also exist along the City’s eastern
boundary adjoining residential areas in adjacent communities. The City contains
approximately 5,100 housing units, with single-family homes comprising two-
thirds of all housing, and a homeownership rate of 60 percent.
As Santa Fe Springs’ residential neighborhoods are entirely developed, the
majority of recent housing development has occurred as a result of the City and
its former Community Development Commission (CDC) assembling previous
commercial and industrial parcels, selling the land at a substantially reduced
rate, and rezoning for residential use. Examples of CDC supported projects
include the 144 unit Little Lake Village Senior Apartments, and the 25 unit
Lakeland Manor (AbilityFirst) for disabled adults.    In the former CDC's most
ambitious residential project, 101 prior oilfield parcels were acquired and
assembled for development of “The Villages at Heritage Springs” master planned
development, encompassing 384 single-family homes and townhomes, and 150
apartment units.
In addition to providing sites to accommodate future growth, the City’s 2014-
2021 Housing Element also focuses on conserving housing affordability, and
maintaining and improving housing conditions and the quality of life in the
community. Programs are geared towards meeting the needs of low and
moderate income households and special needs households, including large
family renters.

B.     ROLE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the availability,
adequacy and affordability of housing. Every jurisdiction in California is required
to adopt a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide its physical
development; the Housing Element is one of the seven mandated elements of
the General Plan. Housing Element law mandates that local governments
adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all
economic segments of the community. The law recognizes that in order for the
private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain housing development. As a
result, State housing policy rests largely upon the effective implementation of
local General Plans and in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element
statutes also require the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) to review local housing elements for compliance with State
law and to report their findings to the local government.
The Housing Element requires each jurisdiction to develop local housing
programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all
income groups. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is
responsible for developing and assigning these regional needs, or “RHNA”, to
southern California jurisdictions. Pursuant to the SCAG RHNA cycle, the Santa
Fe Springs Housing Element is an eight-year plan extending from 2014-2021.
Santa Fe Springs’ Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus
on: 1) preserving and improving housing and neighborhoods; 2) providing
adequate housing sites; 3) assisting in the provision of affordable housing; 4)
removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and 5)
promoting fair and equal housing opportunities. The Element consists of the
following major components:
     An analysis of the City’s demographic, household              and     housing
       characteristics and related housing needs (Section II)
     A review of potential market, governmental, and infrastructure constraints
       to meeting Santa Fe Springs’ identified housing needs (Section III)
     An evaluation of residential sites, financial and administrative resources
       available to address the City’s housing goals (Section IV)
     The Housing Plan for addressing identified housing needs, constraints and
       resources; including housing goals, policies and programs (Section V)

C.     DATA SOURCES
In preparing the Housing Element, and the Housing Needs Assessment in
particular, data is compiled from a variety of sources. The following identifies
the primary sources of information utilized, with the specific source referenced
beneath each table in the Element.
           Demographic and housing data is derived from the 2010 Census,
            2007-2011 American Community Survey, and the Southern
            California Association of Governments’ (SCAG) Existing Housing
            Needs Statement;
           SCAG’s 2008-2035 Regional Transportation Plan/ Sustainable
            Communities Strategy Growth Forecast provides population, housing
            and employment projections;
           Household income data by type of household is derived from the
            Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) prepared by
            HUD;
           2013 housing market information is obtained through internet rent
            surveys, and DataQuick sales transactions;
           Employment data by industry type and commuting patterns are
            provided through the Census 2012, OnTheMap Application;
           SCAG’s 2013-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
            provides information on projected housing needs; and
           Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans
            are provided through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)
            database.
D.     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Section 65583(c)(7) of the Government Code states that, “The local government
shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic
segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the
program shall describe this effort.” Opportunities for community stakeholders to
provide input on housing issues and recommend strategies are critical to the
development of appropriate and effective programs to address the City’s
housing needs. Santa Fe Springs solicits input from the public throughout the
housing element process: during development of the draft element; during
public review of the draft element; and during the adoption process.
Santa Fe Springs conducted two noticed public hearings/study sessions during
development of the 2014-2021 Housing Element update, the first on September
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT              1-3                        INTRODUCTION

23, 2013 before the Planning Commission, and the second on September 26,
2013 before the City Council. The purpose of these study sessions were to
provide background information on the Element, discuss goals and objectives for
the update, and to seek input from the public. Notification of the hearings were
provided in the local newspaper and posted on the City’s website. In addition,
direct notification was provided to local stakeholders including: non-profit
housing providers active in the City; affordable housing complexes in Santa Fe
Springs; service agencies representing special needs and lower income
populations; realtors; and adjacent jurisdictions. A copy of the meeting
notification and distribution list is included in the Appendix to the Element.
Upon completion of the draft Housing Element, the City circulated a Notice of
Availability to a variety of interested organizations. The Notice defines a 60 day
review and comment period, and identifies locations for review of the draft
document, including City Hall, the City library, the Gus Velasco Neighborhood
Center, and the Betty Wilson Senior Center. In addition, the draft Housing
Element is placed on the City’s website. The draft is also sent to the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review and
comment. Upon receipt of input from HCD, public hearings are held before the
Planning Commission and City Council during adoption of the Element.
Public input received through the City's outreach effort included:
     Suitability of affordable housing for families on the City-owned
        Lakeland/Laurel site, particularly given the adjacency of the Carmela
        Elementary School and Amelia/Mayberry Park.
     City has adequate affordable housing for seniors, and instead needs to
        attract more young families and nurture them to grow along with the City.
     Given the loss of Redevelopment Housing funds and greater reliance on
        outside programs, City should provide links to County housing programs
        on its website.
     City should encourage second units as a way to provide lower cost
        housing for seniors, family members, and renters.
The City's Housing Element is responsive to the input received from the public.
Program 8, Affordable Housing Development Assistance, includes an objective to
emphasize the provision of affordable housing for families on the two City-
owned housing sites. The Element commits the City to placing links on its
website and disseminating brochures for a variety of County programs for which
eligible Santa Fe Springs residents can participate, including first-time
homebuyer,       residential rehabilitation, fair housing and Section 8 rental
assistance programs (refer to Housing Element programs 5, 6,7,12 and 19).
And the City continues to encourage second units, as presented in Program 10
in the Element.

E.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The seven elements which comprise the Santa Fe Springs General Plan are
required by law to be internally consistent. Together these elements provide the
framework for development of those facilities, services and land uses necessary
to address the needs and desires of the City’s residents. To ensure these needs
are clearly addressed throughout the General Plan, the elements must be
interrelated and interdependent.
As part of the current Housing Element update, the other Elements of the
General Plan were reviewed to ensure consistency with the policies set forth in
those elements.      The City will maintain consistency between the Housing
Element and the other General Plan elements so that policies introduced in one
element are consistent with other elements. Whenever any element of the
General Plan is amended in the future, the Housing Element will be reviewed
and modified, if necessary, to ensure continued consistency between elements.
Pursuant to AB 162, the City will be amending its Safety and Conservation
Elements to include analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and flood
management, and will be reviewing its Land Use Element for those areas subject
to flooding. The City will review its housing element for internal consistency
with these amendments.
The City is aware of the requirements under SB 244 to identify any
"disadvantaged communities" present within its sphere of influence, and to
update the Land Use Element to analyze the availability of infrastructure and
services to such communities.         Santa Fe Springs will abide by these
requirements, and to the extent revisions are made to the Land Use, will review
the Housing Element for internal consistency.

    II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
    This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City’s
    population and housing stock as a means of better understanding the nature
    and extent of unmet housing needs. A variety of housing needs maps are
    presented based on census data; Figure 1 depicts the 2010 census tract and
    block group boundaries for Santa Fe Springs.
    A.      DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE
    Demographic changes can affect the type and amount of housing that is needed
    in a community. This section addresses population, age, race/ethnicity, and
    employment trends in Santa Fe Springs.
    1.      Population Growth Trends
    Table 2-1 presents population growth trends in Santa Fe Springs and
    surrounding communities from 1990-2013.                 During the 1990s, the City
    evidenced a 12 percent increase in population, well above that of most
    surrounding communities, as well as the seven percent increase Countywide. In
    contrast, the City’s population actually declined by seven percent during the
    most recent decade, though in the most recent three years (2010-2013) has
    again began to evidence modest growth.

    In terms of future growth trends, the Southern California Association of
    Government (SCAG) Regional Integrated Forecast forecasts a significant 25
    percent increase in Santa Fe Springs’ population between 2008-2035, with an
    estimated population of 20,300 residents by the year 2035. SCAG’s projections
    reflect build out of the 500+ units in the Villages at Heritage Springs and the
    associated population growth this will bring to the City.

 2.      Age Characteristics
 Housing need is often affected by the age characteristics of residents in the
 community. Different age groups have different lifestyles, income levels, and
 family types that influence housing needs. These housing choices evolve over
 time, and it is important to examine the changes in the age structure of Santa
 Fe Springs residents in order to identify potential impacts on housing needs.
 Table 2-2 displays the age distribution of the City’s population in 1990 and
 2010, and compares this with Los Angeles County. As shown in the table below,
 25 percent of the City’s population in 2010 is under the age of 18, a decrease
 from the 29 percent in 1990. Changes in Santa Fe Springs’ age profile also
 occurred in the young adult (25-44 years) and middle age (45-64 years) groups.
 The proportion of young adults declined from 30 to 26 percent of the population,
 decreasing by over 300 residents. Conversely, the middle age population grew
 by over 800 residents, increasing from 19 to 23 percent of the population.
 Senior citizens (65 years and older) also evidenced growth over the past two
 decades, with an increase of over 350 residents. At 13 percent, the proportion
 of seniors in Santa Fe Springs is above the 11 percent countywide.
 The population of Santa Fe Springs, as a whole, is aging. The 2010 Census puts
 the median age of Santa Fe Springs at 35.3 years, an increase from the City’s
 30.8 median age in 1990, and slightly above the median age of 34.8 years for
 the County. Factors contributing to this shift in the City’s age structure include
 an aging in place of young adults into middle age, a corresponding aging of the
 middle age population into senior citizens, and the limited number of new young
 adults and families moving into the community. As discussed later in the
 section, Santa Fe Springs has also experienced a decline in both the number and
 proportion of families with children over the past two decades.

3.      Race and Ethnicity
Like many communities in Southern California, Santa Fe Springs’ population has
become increasingly diverse over the past twenty years. These changes may
have implications for housing needs, because different ethnic groups sometimes
have household characteristics that may affect their preferences and housing
needs.       Understanding changes in race/ethnicity, especially among first
generation ethnic groups, provides a basis for addressing housing needs.
Table 2-3 displays the racial and ethnic composition of the Santa Fe Springs
residents in 1990 and 2010, and compares this with the Countywide distribution
in 2010. Hispanic residents continue to comprise the vast majority of the City’s
population, growing from 60 to 81 percent over the past two decades,
representing an increase in over 4,300 Hispanic residents. In contrast, White
residents declined from 37 to 12 percent of the population. Asians and African
Americans both evidenced modest increases, though remain a small segment of
Santa Fe Springs overall population.
Relative to the County’s racial and ethnic distribution, Santa Fe Springs has a
substantially higher percentage of Hispanic residents, while the proportion for all
other race/ethnic groups was lower than the Countywide percentage.

4.       Employment
Evaluation of the types of jobs held by community residents provides insight into
potential earning power and the segment of the housing market into which they
fall. Information on how a community’s employment base is growing and
changing can help identify potential housing demand changes in the future.
The State Employment Development Department estimates that as of July 2013,
8,000 Santa Fe Springs residents are in the labor force, with 9.0 percent
unemployment, compared to a Countywide unemployment rate of 10.8 percent.
Table 2-4 presents the jobs held by Santa Fe Springs’ residents by industry of
employment.           The most dominant employment sectors were Education/
Health/Social Services and Manufacturing, accounting for 40 percent of resident
employment. Approximately one-quarter of residents were employed in typically
lower paying industries – retail, accommodations/food services, construction,
and services.

B.      HOUSEHOLD PROFILE
Household type and size, income levels, and the presence of special needs
populations all affect the type of housing needed by residents, discussed in
detail in the following section.
1.      Household Type
A household is defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a
subset of households, as are single persons living alone, and “other” non-family
households. Group quarters, such as convalescent homes, are not considered
households.
The 2010 Census documents 4,747 households in Santa Fe Springs, with an
average household size of 3.38 persons (refer to Table 2-5). This represents a
fairly stable household size from 1990 (3.33 persons), and remains higher than
the Countywide average household size of 2.98. Larger household size can
translate into a greater number of overcrowded households, particularly among
renters due to the generally smaller size of rental units.

Families comprise 78 percent of Santa Fe Springs’ households, compared to 68
percent family households Countywide.             Families without children have
surpassed families with children as the predominant family type in Santa Fe
Springs. Over the past two decades, the City evidenced a decrease in over 400
families with children, reflecting an aging of young families with adult children
moving out form their parents’ homes, and fewer young families moving into the
community. Figure 2 depicts the location of family households with children by
census block group.

2.     Household Income
Household income is one of the most important factors affecting housing
opportunity and determining a household’s ability to balance housing costs with
other basic necessities of life.
Income Definitions
The State and Federal government classify household income into several
groupings based upon the relationship to the County adjusted median income
(AMI), adjusted for household size. The State of California utilizes the income
groups presented in Table 2-6, and are used throughout the Housing Element.

Table 2-7 presents the distribution of household income in Santa Fe Springs by
income category. At 40 percent, above-moderate income households (>120%
AMI) comprise the majority of households, though nearly 2,000 households earn
lower incomes (<80% AMI). Extremely low-income (ELI) households (<30%
AMI) comprise 15 percent of the City’s households), and have significant
housing needs. According to the CHAS Data compiled by HUD, 77 percent of the
City’s ELI households are

Many of the workers who make up Santa Fe Springs’ workforce earn modest
incomes, making it challenging to afford to live in the City. Table 2-8 presents a
sampling of occupations in Santa Fe Springs that fall within very-low, low and
moderate-income thresholds (based on a single worker household).                        The
analysis of housing costs and affordability presented later in this section
compares current market rents and sales prices in Santa Fe Springs with the
amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for housing.
This analysis illustrates that very low-income occupations, such as retail sales
workers, nursing aides, and preschool teachers and teacher assistants cannot
afford market rents in Santa Fe Springs. Median home and condominium sales
prices in Santa Fe Springs are beyond the level of affordability to both low and
moderate income households.

C.      SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS
California law recognizes that certain households face greater difficulties in
finding decent and affordable housing due to special circumstances, including
but not limited to income, age disability, household size and household type.
Special needs populations addressed in the Housing Element include the elderly,
persons with disabilities, families with female heads of households, large
households, farmworkers and the homeless. Table 2-9 summarizes the special
needs populations in Santa Fe Springs. Each of these population groups, as well
as their housing needs, is described below.

1.      Senior Households
At 29 percent, senior households represent a significant special needs group in
Santa Fe Springs. Consistent with trends throughout the nation, this population
is expected to continue increasing as the baby boom generation approaches
retirement.
Although often viewed as homogeneous, Santa Fe Springs’ senior population is
quite diverse. Among the City’s 1,383 senior households, 66 percent own a
home and 34 percent rent housing. Half of Santa Fe Springs’ seniors are 75
years of age and above, a population which may require more supportive
housing options as they age and become more frail. Some of the more pressing
housing needs of Santa Fe Springs’ seniors include:
       Rental affordability. Rising rents are a particular concern due to the
        fact that most seniors are on fixed incomes. Of Santa Fe Springs’
        approximately 460 senior renter households, 60 percent are very low
        income (<50% AMI). Market rents in Santa Fe Springs are beyond the
        level affordable to very low-income households, as confirmed by the
        Census, which documents two-thirds of the City’s very low-income senior
        renters spending more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent.
       Disabilities. The Census identifies 38 percent of Santa Fe Springs’
        seniors as having one or more disabilities, encompassing physical,
        sensory and mental disabilities, as well as conditions that limit the
        senior’s ability to leave their home.        Combined with the significant
        number of older seniors (age 75+), this indicates a large segment of the
        senior population, which may require various levels of housing support.
       Housing maintenance. Of Santa Fe Springs’ approximately 920 senior
        homeowners, one-quarter live alone. As these homeowners age, many
        may be unable to maintain their homes and may benefit from the
        installation of assistance devices to enhance accessibility.     Figure 3
        depicts the incidence of senior homeowners residing alone in Santa Fe
        Springs by census block group, with the greatest concentrations in the
        neighborhoods located south of Telegraph Road, between Norwalk and
        Pioneer boulevards.
The City offers a range of services for senior residents at the Gus Velasco
Neighborhood Center, the Betty Wilson Center, and the senior center located at
Little Lake Village Apartments. These centers offer case management services
for many housing related issues, as well as registry for in-home supportive
services. The centers also provide educational, health, legal and transportation
services to the elderly, including congregate lunch program at the Neighborhood
Center. The Hope Through Housing Foundation operates comprehensive “Living
Well Senior Services” at the Little Lake Village Center to enhance the overall
quality of life for seniors – emotionally, socially, and physically.

Addressing the diverse housing needs of Santa Fe Springs’ senior population will
require strategies that foster independent living (such as home accessibility
improvements, second units, rehabilitation assistance), as well as strategies that
encourage the provision of variety of supportive living environments for seniors
of all income levels.
2.      Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition (more than six months) that
impairs an individual’s mobility, ability to work, or ability to care for oneself.
Persons with disabilities include those with physical, mental, or emotional
disabilities. Disabled persons have special housing needs because of their often
limited incomes, shortage of accessible housing, and higher health costs
associated with their disability.
Approximately 21 percent of Santa Fe Springs residents (3,342 persons)
reported having one or more disabilities in the Census. Among the City’s senior
population, 38 percent suffer from a disability. As Santa Fe Springs’ population
continues to age, the number of residents with disabilities will also increase.
The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of
the disability. Many persons are able to live in an independent environment with
the help of other family members. To maintain independent living, persons with
disabilities may require assistance. This can include special housing design
features for the physically disabled, income support for those who are unable to
work, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.
Developmental Disabilities
Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code defines “developmental
disability” as a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18
years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes
a substantial disability for that individual. This term includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are
solely physical in nature.
The East Los Angeles Regional Center (ELARC) is among 21 regional centers
operated by the State DDS to serve the developmentally disabled population.
The goal of these centers is to: 1) prevent/minimize institutionalization of
developmentally disabled persons and their dislocation from family and
community; and 2) enable this population to lead more independent and
productive lives. Within the Santa Fe Springs zip code 90670, the East Los
Angeles Regional Center currently provides services to 115 residents with
developmental disabilities, generating an estimated need for 36 housing units:

    * The following need factors have been developed by the Golden Gate Regional Center and
    can be used to generally estimate housing needs for the developmentally disabled
    population by age group: age 0-14 25% need hsg; age 15-22 50% need hsg; age 23-54
    35% need hsg; age 55-65 25% need hsg; age 65+ 20% need hsg.
The regional centers have identified a number of community-based housing
types appropriate for persons living with a developmental disability: licensed
community care facilities and group homes; supervised apartment settings with
support services; SB 962 homes (for persons with special health care and
intensive support needs); and for persons able to live more independently, rent
subsidized homes, affordable inclusionary units, and Section 8 rental vouchers.
Santa Fe Springs supports the provision of housing for persons with disabilities,
has provisions in its Zoning Code to enable community care facilities and
supportive housing, and currently has one State licensed residential care facility
for up to five adults with developmental disabilities.
3.      Large Households
Large households are defined as consisting of five or more members and are
considered a special needs population due to the limited availability of affordable
and adequately sized housing. Large households tend to live in smaller units if
they are in the lower income groups. This often results in overcrowding. The
increased strain which overcrowding places on housing serves to accelerate the
pace of deterioration of the housing unit.
In Santa Fe Springs, large households comprise 26 percent of total households.
Of the City’s 1,220 large households, 413 are renter households and 807 are
homeowner households. The 2007-2011 American Community Survey
documents 503 rental units and 2,026 owner units in Santa Fe Springs with 3 or
more bedrooms, the appropriate size for households with 5-6 members.
4.      Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households typically have a special need for such services as
childcare and health care, among others. Female-headed households with
children in particular tend to have lower incomes, which limits their housing
options and access to supportive services. The 2010 Census identifies 965
female-headed family households (no husband present) in Santa Fe Springs,
comprising 20 percent of total households. Of these female-headed households,
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    2-14             HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

41 percent have children under the age of 18. Many of these households thus
need assistance with housing subsidies, as well as affordable day care.
The City’s Community Services Department provides a comprehensive child
development program for children ages 2 to 12, including subsidized childcare
based on income eligibility. The Family Services Section provides numerous
programs and resources for youth, including a new learning center, homework
help and computer lab, and after school programs.
5.     Homeless
The 2013 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, conducted by the Los Angeles
Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA) includes a count of homeless on the street,
in shelters, hidden homeless and youth. In eastern Los Angeles County, Service
Provider Area (SPA) 7, the total homeless population decreased 49 percent from
the 2011 count of 4,759 to 2,430 in 2013, the largest decrease of any of the Los
Angeles County SPAs. Characteristics of the homeless counted in SPA 7 include:
20% are “chronic homeless”; 28% experienced substance abuse issues; 28%
suffered from mental health issues; and 18% had a physical disability.
The L.A. Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse (L.A. CADA) administered the 2013
homeless count and registry within Santa Fe Springs, partnering with the city,
churches, service clubs, United Way, Whittier First Day, and others. Of the 74
homeless persons counted, in-depth surveys were conducted with 37
individuals. The characteristics of those surveyed include:
     Average age of 47 years
     Average of 3.5 years living on the street
     Half reported a major physical illness
     68% reported having at least one chronic medical condition
     33% reported or were observed as having a severe mental condition
     77% reported or were observed as having a substance abuse problem
L.A. CADA reports that there have been positive outcomes from the Santa Fe
Springs homeless count. The Whittier Police Department and Cal-Trans have
teamed up with Whittier First Day Outreach Team in order to help the homeless
at “hot-spots”. First Day now has Veterans vouchers and is housing homeless
vets as well as providing field based medical services that include a nurse who
can screen and transport for medical care.
Homeless families in the City are, more often than not, chronically homeless,
which makes it far more difficult to get them accepted into a shelter. These
families typically alternate between living in motels, staying with family and
friends, and sleeping some nights in their vehicles. Families with children are
usually referred by City staff to a homeless shelter or transitional living center.
If a shelter or transitional living center is not available, City case workers may
place them in a hotel for the night and request they return the next day when
more suitable housing can be found. Periodically, the City’s case workers assist
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT               2-15           HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

families who are only temporarily displaced. Temporarily displaced Santa Fe
Springs residents are typically provided some level of support or financial
assistance for a hotel stay during their transition.
The City has a variety of services aimed at assisting its homeless population.
The City has a staff of Case Managers that assess individual client situations
with a thorough assessment. These Case Managers are able to screen clients for
eligibility for other available programs throughout the community and also
develop individual case plans. Clients are then linked to the appropriate
agencies for social services. An on-site emergency food pantry that supplies
food to the homeless and families in need is also provided by the City.
City case workers refer homeless clients to several different resources. The
resource most often utilized is “Dial 211” L.A. County. Dial 211 tracks the
availability of homeless shelters countywide and can be used for individuals, as
well as families. Staff also refer clients to the Access Center for Homeless
Services to place homeless families into shelters on an emergency basis. Single
adults are typically referred to First Day Shelter in the City of Whittier, a facility
providing general case management and a transitional living program for
homeless adults.
Santa Fe Springs is home to the Salvation Army’s Transitional Living Center
(TLC), located at 12000 E. Washington Blvd in the northern part of the City. TLC
is the primary transitional living program in Southeast Los Angeles County for
homeless mothers and their children who are victims of domestic violence
and/or substance abuse. With 28 apartments, the Center can house up to 116
adults and children. TLC provides comprehensive services to clients, including:
counseling and case management to address domestic violence issues,
substance abuse support, family literacy and computer training, GED
completion, job readiness, vocational training referrals, life skills training, and
housing placement. Residents are required to save 80 percent of their income
while in the program, and use a portion of their savings to purchase a used car
to travel to work, and for security deposits for permanent housing when they
complete the program. Families are permitted to stay up to 24 months, although
the average stay is 18 months.
6.       Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
earned through seasonal agricultural work. While in many parts of southern
California agriculture production is an important contribution to local economies,
the City of Santa Fe Springs does not have any farm housing or land remaining
in agricultural use. Based on data compiled by SCAG, no Santa Fe Springs
residents are employed in the industries of farming, fishing or forestry. Because
of the urban nature of the City’s employment base, there are no specialized
housing programs targeted for farmworkers beyond overall programs for
affordability.

 D.      HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
 This section presents the characteristics of Santa Fe Springs’ physical housing
 stock including growth trends, housing conditions, housing costs and
 affordability, housing overpayment and overcrowding, and assisted housing at-
 risk of conversion.
 1.      Housing Growth
 Santa Fe Springs was developed as a predominantly industrial community with
 limited areas of residential use. Less than ten percent of the City’s nine square
 miles is planned for residential use, with more than 80 percent allocated to
 industrial and commercial uses. The majority of housing development has
 historically been concentrated in the western portion of the City away from the
 industrial uses, although small pockets of housing also exist along the eastern
 periphery of the City adjoining residential uses in the neighboring communities.
 Table 2-11 displays housing production in Santa Fe Springs and surrounding
 region over the past two decades. Housing growth has been fairly limited in this
 southeast area of the County, reflective of the older, established character of
 these communities. During the 1990s, Santa Fe Springs added a little over 100
 new units to its housing stock, with less than 50 units added during the most
 recent decade.

 Between 2010- 2013, 139 new units were developed in
 Santa Fe Springs, bringing the City’s total housing stock
 to 5,115 units. This level of growth well exceeded that
 in the surrounding communities and the County as a
 whole, and is reflective of the initial phases of the 500+
 new      units being developed within The Villages at
 Heritage Springs (southeast corner of Norwalk and
 Telegraph). This master planned community consists of
 five single-family and townhome communities, as well as
 a 150 unit apartment community.

2.     Housing Type and Tenure
Table 2-12 depicts the mix of housing types in Santa Fe Springs. Single-family
homes remain the dominant housing type, comprising 65 percent of the City’s
2010 housing stock, although a slight decrease from the 67 percent single-
family homes in 1990. With the development of 384 new single-family detached
and attached homes in the Villages, the relative proportion of single-family
homes in the community can be expected to increase.

Housing tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owned or rented. Tenure
influences residential mobility, with owner units generally evidencing lower
turnover rates than rental housing. As indicated in Table 2-13, 61 percent of
Santa Fe Springs households were homeowners in 2010, a slight reduction from
the 65 percent homeownership rate in 1990, though still well above the
Countywide homeownership rate of 48 percent. Corresponding to the increased
proportion of single-family homes anticipated with buildout of the Villages, the
City’s rate of homeownership can also be expected to increase.

Vacancy Rate
The vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and
is often a good indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are
meeting the current demand for housing. A low vacancy rate may indicate that
households are having difficulty finding affordable housing, which can lead to
overcrowding and/or overpayment. A particularly tight housing market with
insufficient vacant units for normal mobility may also lead to high competition
for units, placing upward pressure on rents and for-sale housing prices.
A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership
housing is generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance
between the demand and supply of housing. As measured by the 2010 Census,
the residential vacancy rate in Santa Fe Springs was 4.6 percent for all housing
units, a healthy increase from the 2.0 percent vacancy rate in 2000. More
specifically, 2010 vacancy rates in Santa Fe Springs were 5.5 for rentals and 2.1
for ownership units, indicating vacancy levels ideal for sufficient mobility.
With the opening of Little Lake Village Apartments in 2003, 144 affordable
senior apartments were added to the City’s supply of rental housing, helping to
ease previously low rental vacancies.

 3.      Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can provide an indicator of overall
housing conditions. Typically housing over 30 years in age is likely to have
rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation
work and other repairs. Table 2-14 displays the age of Santa Fe Springs
occupied housing stock by tenure based on the 2007-2011 American Community
Survey. Approximately 1,400 renter units and 2,300 ownership units in Santa
Fe Springs have reached the 30 year benchmark, representing over 70 percent
of the City’s occupied housing units.

The advanced age of the majority of Santa Fe Springs’ housing stock indicates
the significant need for continued code enforcement, property maintenance and
housing rehabilitation programs to stem housing deterioration. According to
City Housing staff, much of the City’s aging housing stock is in need of
rehabilitation and repair to the home’s infrastructure. Typical improvements
include roof replacements and repair, new and updated pipe water systems,
sewer line replacements, termite damage repairs, and extermination. The City
also recommends the replacement of original furnace units in older homes with
safer and more efficient models.
No current Citywide survey of substandard housing exists for Santa Fe Springs,
and City staff have not been informed of any substandard homes to remedy. As
deteriorated housing in Santa Fe Springs is largely related to housing age, City
Housing staff generally estimates five percent of the 2,600 housing units greater
than 50 years in age to be substandard, translating to 130 units. Of housing
considered substandard, an estimated 80 percent is suitable for rehabilitation
where necessary repairs are considered economically feasible.

The City’s Code Enforcement Division implements a property maintenance
ordinance which mandates the upkeep of properties. For owner occupied units,
the City operates a rebate and home repair program for rehabilitation of housing
units. To address upkeep of the City’s rental stock, the City implements a rental
inspection program that requires annual inspection of rental units to ensure they
are properly maintained. Under the Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation
Program (HARP) implemented by the prior Redevelopment Agency,
approximately two substandard homes per year are either substantially
rehabilitated, or depending on the severity of unit deterioration, replaced with a
new unit, and sold at an affordable housing cost to low and moderate income
purchasers. However, due to the elimination of Redevelopment funding, the
HARP Program is currently on hold until an alternate source of funds can be
identified.

Fe Springs residents.
Rental Housing Market
An internet rent survey was conducted in July 2013, supplemented by rent data
collected by the City’s Residential Rental Inspection Officer, to evaluate rental
costs in Santa Fe Springs. As presented in Table 2-15, average apartment rents
were $1,000 for a one-bedroom, $1,275 for a two-bedroom, and $1,550 for a
three-bedroom units. In comparison to 2007 rent levels (as documented in the
City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element), apartment rents have increased
significantly in Santa Fe Springs, with one bedrooms units increasing 18 percent
and two bedroom units increasing 21 percent.
In addition to the full rental units surveyed, approximately a dozen individual
rooms were listed for rent within homes. Rooms were more affordable than
small apartment units, ranging in price from $450 to $750, with an average
price of $575.

While the prior Table 2-16 provides an overview of the sub-regional housing
market during calendar year 2012, the following Table 2-17 provides more
detailed information on home and condominium sales within the Santa Fe
Springs during the most recent 12-month period (August 2012-July 2013). A
total of 91 single-family home sales were recorded during this period, with
median sales prices ranging from $290,000 (two-bedroom) to $325,000 (three-

   bedroom) and $340,000 (four or more bedrooms). The overall median sales
   price of $320,000 during this period reflects a seven percent increase from the
   $300,000 median documented in the previous calendar year. Average unit sizes
   are relatively modest, with two bedroom units averaging 980 square feet and
   three bedroom units averaging 1,255 square feet in size.
   A total of 189 condominiums were sold during this 12-month period for a
   median price of $337,000, nearly a 60 percent increase from the $213,000
   median price recorded in calendar year 2012. Many of the recent condominium
   sales in Santa Fe Springs have been within the Villages at Heritage Springs,
   increasing both the number and price of condominiums on the market.

Home Foreclosures
Approximately 1.5 million of the 8.7 homes and condominiums in California have
been involved in a foreclosure proceeding since 2007. In addition to impact of
people losing their homes, foreclosed properties can lead to other problems as
these homes are left abandoned, becoming potential blight and criminal
concerns. Fortunately, the number of mortgage default notices in California has
been consistently declining since its peak in 2009, with the number of default
notices filed in the first and second quarters of 2013 the lowest level in more
than seven years. According to the real estate information service DataQuick,
the drop in foreclosure notices is the result of a combination of rising home
values, an improving economy, and government efforts to reduce foreclosures.
Within Santa Fe Springs, www.Realtytrac.com identified 140 single-family home
and condominiums units in July 2013 in various states of foreclosure, including
“pre-foreclosure” having received a notice of mortgage default, notice of a
trustee sale, and bank-owned. The number of properties that received a
foreclosure filing in Santa Fe Springs in July was 62 percent lower than the
previous month and 75 percent lower than the same time last year, and
representing one filing for every 1,507 residential units in the City.                             In
comparison, the ratio of July foreclosure filings to total housing units in the
State, Los Angeles County, and nearby cities were higher than in Santa Fe
Springs.1

While foreclosures have been on the decline, lenders have been shifting towards
“short sales” – transactions where the sales price falls short of what is owed on
the property. In terms of distressed property sales, short sales are preferable to
foreclosures for several reasons: 1) units are typically occupied and in better
condition; 2) they tend to be higher priced; and 3) short sales are more
favorable financially for banks which may translate into improved lending
conditions. In 2012, short sales comprised 26 percent of statewide resale
activity.

  The foreclosure ratio is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units in the jurisdiction by
the total number of properties that received foreclosure notices that month. The lower the second
number in the ratio, the higher the foreclosure rate.

Housing Affordability
The affordability of housing in Santa Fe Springs can be assessed by comparing
market rents and sales prices with the amount that households of different
income levels can afford to pay for housing.                     Compared together, this
information can reveal who can afford what size and type of housing as well as
indicate the type of households that would most likely experience overcrowding
or overpayment.
For purposes of evaluating home purchase affordability, Table 2-18 presents the
maximum affordable purchase price for moderate-income households (110%
AMI), and compares this with market sales prices for single-family homes and
condominiums in Santa Fe Springs as previously documented in Table 2-17. As
illustrated below, the maximum affordable purchase price ranges from $267,000
for a three-person household to $300,900 for a four-person household. Median
single-family and condominium sales prices in Santa Fe Springs are
approximately ten percent above these moderate income affordability
thresholds. However, there are for-sale units at the lower end of the price
ranges identified in Table 2-17 affordable at the moderate income level.

Renter Affordability
Table 2-19 presents the maximum affordable rents for very low, low and
moderate income households by household size, and compares with average
apartment rents in Santa Fe Springs, as documented earlier in Table 2-15. As
the table below indicates, market rents are well above the level of affordability
for very low income households, with an affordability gap ranging from $247 for
two-person households (one bedroom units), up to $615 for four-person
households (three bedroom apartments). However, unlike many communities in
metropolitan Los Angeles, apartment rents in Santa Fe Springs are still within
the level affordable to low income households.

 5.     Housing Problems
 A continuing priority of communities is enhancing or maintaining the quality of
 life for residents. A key measure of the quality of life in Santa Fe Springs is the
 extent of “housing problems.” One measure of housing problems used by both
 the State and Federal governments is the extent of housing overpayment and
 overcrowding within a community.
 Overpayment
 Housing overpayment, as defined by the State and Federal government, refers
 to spending more than 30 percent of income on housing; severe overpayment is
 spending greater than 50 percent of income. Table 2-20 shows the incidence of
 overpayment in Santa Fe Springs.

2005-2009. Lower income overpayment derived from HUD CHAS.
Note: Severe overpayment is a subset of overpayment.
 The 2005-2009 American Community Survey estimates that 57 percent of
 renters in Santa Fe Springs were spending more than 30 percent of their total
 income on housing, with 34 percent spending more than half their incomes. This
 level of renter overpayment represents an increase from 2000 when 44 percent
 of Santa Fe Springs’ renters experienced overpayment. Similarly, the level of
 renter overpayment increased significantly in Los Angeles County over the past
 decade, and at 56 percent is comparable to that of Santa Fe Springs.
 In terms of overpayment among lower income households (<80% AMI), 686
 lower income renter households and 442 lower income owners were faced with
 overpayment in Santa Fe Springs. The impact of housing overpayment on the
 City’s lower income households is significant, with the community’s special

 needs populations – seniors, persons with disabilities, and female-headed
 households with children – most vulnerable to losing their housing due to an
 inability to pay.
 Overcrowding
 The State defines an overcrowded housing unit as one occupied by more than
 1.01 persons per room (excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways). A unit with
 more than 1.51 occupants per room is considered severely overcrowded. The
 incidence of overcrowded housing is a general measure of whether there is an
 available supply of adequately sized housing units.
 Table 2-21 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Santa Fe Springs and Los
 Angeles County by tenure in 2010 and 2000. As indicated, 14 percent of all
 households in Santa Fe Springs were living in overcrowded conditions, slightly
 above the incidence of overcrowding Countywide where overcrowding impacts
 12 percent of households, and a significant decline from 2000 when 23 percent
 of households in both Santa Fe Springs and Los Angeles County were
 overcrowded.
 Evaluation of overcrowding by tenure indicates that while homeowner
 overcrowding in Santa Fe Springs has declined significantly over the past
 decade, the incidence of overcrowding among renters has remained high and
 exceeds that of the County. Severe renter overcrowding continues to impact 16
 percent of the City’s renters, whereas Countywide severe renter overcrowding
 declined from 22 to 8 percent over the decade. Figure 5 graphically illustrates
 severe renter overcrowding by census block group, and identifies one primary
 concentration (> 30%) in the neighborhood in the vicinity of Paradise Memorial
 Park.

      E. ASSISTED HOUSING AT-RISK OF CONVERSION
      Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-
      restricted low income housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to
      propose programs or replace any units “at-risk” of conversion. This section
      presents an inventory of all assisted rental housing in Santa Fe Springs, and
      evaluates those units at risk of conversion during the ten year, 2013-2023
      planning period.
      Assisted Housing Inventory
      As presented in Table 2-22, Santa Fe Springs has 389 units of deed-restricted,
      affordable rental housing, representing over twenty percent of the City’s total
      rental housing stock. Approximately half of the City’s assisted rental housing is
      for families, and half is for seniors.

      Villa Verde is a 34 unit family apartment complex, with affordability previously
      tied entirely to the availability of Section 8 contracts and subject to periodic
      renewals from HUD.             In 2009, the former Santa Fe Springs Community
      Development Commission committed $1.4 million in financial assistance for the
      rehabilitation of Villa Verde in exchange for the property owner recording a
      Notice of Affordability Restrictions (pursuant to H&S Code Sec. 33334.3),
      restricting the property for affordable housing purposes for the next 55 years.2
      At-Risk Projects
      This section evaluates those lower income rental projects in Santa Fe Springs at-
      risk of converting to market-rate uses prior to June 30, 2023. As shown in
      2
          The City received RHNA credit in its 2008-2014 Housing Element for providing committed
      assistance for preservation of Villa Verde as long term affordable housing.
      2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                       2-31             HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

Table 2-22, two affordable housing projects are considered to be at-risk during
this period – Pioneer Gardens and Silvercrest Residences– both due to the
uncertainty surrounding the long term availability of Section 8 funding. These
two projects all maintain Section 8 project-based Housing Assistance Plan (HAP)
contracts with HUD subject to annual renewals.
Pioneer Gardens: In 2000, the City entered into an Affordable Housing
Agreement with the new owner of Pioneer Gardens Apartment, PRC Partners
Realty Capital, to preserve the 141 family units at affordable rents. The City
conducted a TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) hearing in support
of the developer obtaining State multi-family revenue bond financing.
Provisions of the Affordable Housing Agreement include City approval of the
Management and Maintenance Plan; provision of written notice to the City prior
to issuing an eviction notice to any tenant; and requirements for the property
manager to coordinate with the City in identifying tenants in need of City
provided social services, and referring such tenants to the City’s Neighborhood
Center. Pursuant to the bond financing, affordability controls are required to
extend a minimum of thirty years (2030), although Section 8 contracts continue
to be subject to annual renewals.
Silvercrest Residences: The 22 unit Silvercrest Residences senior housing
was financed under the HUD Section 202 program, and is owned and operated
by the Salvation Army.        The affordability controls under the Section 202
financing extend through 2025, but are contingent upon the continued
availability of Section 8 funding.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Santa Fe Springs has two rental projects considered at-risk of conversion due to
their dependence on continued Section 8 subsidies. However, Pioneer Gardens
refinanced to extend affordability controls, and Silvercrest Residences is owned
by a non-profit, both factors which would indicate these projects are at low risk
of conversion. Nonetheless, for purposes of the Housing Element, both projects
are technically considered at-risk, and are, therefore, included in this analysis.
Preservation or replacement of at-risk projects in Santa Fe Springs can be
achieved in several ways: 1) transfer of ownership to non-profit organizations;
2) provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources; and 3)
replacement or development of new assisted units. Each of these options are
described below, along with a general cost estimate for each.
Option 1: Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the at-risk projects to non-profit organizations has
several benefits: 1) affordability controls can be secured indefinitely; and 2)
projects become eligible for a greater range of governmental assistance. The
feasibility of this option depends on several factors, including the willingness of
the apartment owner to sell the project, the existence of qualified non-profit
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT              2-32           HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT

purchasers, and the availability of funding.              Potential funding sources for
acquisition include Federal tax credits, State mortgage revenue bonds and
County administered funds.
Of the two at-risk projects in Santa Fe Springs, only Pioneer Gardens is owned
by a for-profit developer. The current market value for this project can generally
be estimated based on its potential annual income and standard costs
associated with apartment maintenance and management. As shown in Table 2-
23, the market value of the 135 units in Pioneer Gardens is estimated at $16
million. This estimate is intended to demonstrate the magnitude of costs
relative to other preservation and replacement options; the actual market value
of this project will depend on the building and market conditions at the time of
appraisal.

               4-bd $1,600 Vacancy Rate = 5%
           2. Annual operating expense = 35% gross income + 1.1% property taxes
           3. Market value based on 6.5% capitalization rate
Option 2: Rental Assistance
The long-term availability of funding at the federal level for Section 8 contract
renewal is uncertain. If terminated, rent subsidies using alternative State or
local funding sources could be used to maintain affordability. Subsides could be
structured similar to the Section 8 program, whereby HUD pays the owners the
difference between what tenants can afford to pay (30% household income) and
what HUD establishes as the Fair Market Rent (FMR).
The feasibility of this alternative, in the case of the property owners, depends on
their willingness to continue to accept rental vouchers and limit rents to fair
market levels. Given the 156 Section 8 at-risk units in Pioneer Gardens and
Silvercrest Residences and their associated bedroom mix, the total cost of
subsidizing rents in these projects is estimated at approximately $88,000 per
month, or $1 million annually, translating to $20 million in subsidies over a 20-
year period.

An alternative way to structure rent subsidies is as a rent buy-down. This would
involve providing a one-time assistance loan to the property owner to cover the
present value of the decrease in rents associated with the extended affordability
term compared with market rents achievable on the units. This approach offers
a benefit to the owner in that they receive cash upfront from the loan.
Option 3: Construction or Purchase of Replacement Units
The construction or purchase of a replacement building is another option to
replace at-risk units should they convert to market rates.               The cost of
developing housing depends on a variety of factors, including density, size of the
units, location, land costs, and type of construction. Based on discussions with
a non-profit housing developer active in greater southern California, current
purchase prices for market rate apartment buildings range anywhere from
$180,000 - $200,000 per unit. Therefore, the cost to replace the 156 rent-
restricted units in Pioneer Gardens and Silvercrest Residences can generally be
estimated to range from $28 to $31 million.
Comparison of Options
In terms of cost effectiveness for preservation of the 156 at-risk units,
transferring ownership of Pioneer Gardens to a non-profit ($16 million), is less
expensive than 20 years with of rent subsidies for all 156 units ($20 million), or
purchase of replacement units ($28-$31 million). Transfer of ownership to a
non-profit offers additional benefits in that affordability controls can be secured
indefinitely, and projects become eligible for a greater range of funding.

F.     REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
The Regional Housing Allocation (RHNA) is a state-mandated process, which
determines the amount of future housing growth each city and county must plan
for in their housing elements. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to
ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not
only its resident population, but also for the jurisdiction’s projected share of
regional housing growth across all income categories. Regional growth needs
are defined as the number of units that would have to be added in each
jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted number of households, as well as
the number of units that need to be added to compensate for anticipated
demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
The RHNA process begins with the California Department of Housing and
Community Development’s (HCD) projection of future statewide housing growth
need, and the apportionment of this need to regional councils of government
throughout the state. As southern California’s designated Council of
Government, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the
agency responsible for developing an allocation methodology to allocate the
region’s assigned share of statewide need to cities and counties by income level.
In allocating the region’s future housing needs to jurisdictions, SCAG is required
to take the following factors into consideration:
      Market demand for housing
      Employment opportunities
      Availability of suitable sites and public facilities
      Commuting patterns
      Type and tenure of housing
      Loss of units in assisted housing developments
      Over-concentration of lower income households
      Geological and topographical constraints
SCAG has adopted the RHNA for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle, and has
allocated Santa Fe Springs the following share of the region’s housing needs:

The RHNA represents the minimum number of housing units each community is
required to provide “adequate sites” for through zoning and is one of the
primary threshold criteria necessary to achieve State approval of the Housing
Element. As the RHNA represents a planning target for new residential growth
and not a building quota, so long as a jurisdiction provides sufficient sites and
does not impose constraints to development, it is not penalized for falling short
of its RHNA target. Santa Fe Springs will continue to provide sites for a mix of
single-family, multi-family and mixed use housing, supported by a variety of
programs to enhance affordability, to accommodate its RHNA and contribute
towards addressing the growing demand for housing in the southern California
region.

III.           HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of adequate and affordable housing can potentially be constrained
by a number of factors. This section assesses the various governmental,
market, infrastructure and environmental factors that may serve as a potential
constraint to housing development and improvement in Santa Fe Springs.
A. Governmental Constraints
1. Land Use Controls
Santa Fe Springs has developed as a predominately industrial community, with
only ten percent of the City’s land zoned for residential uses. Due to its
pervasive industrial character, residential development has been concentrated
away from industry and is primarily located in the western portion of the City.
The City’s General Plan and Zoning Regulations provide for the following
residential categories:
       Single-family Residential (R-1) - 8.7 units/acre
       Multi-Family Residential (R-3) – 21.8 units/acre, or 25 units/acre with
           Planned Development Overlay
       Mobile Home
Table 3-1 summarizes the City’s residential development standards. Residential
parking standards require 2 parking spaces in a garage or carport for each
dwelling unit. The Planning Commission has the discretion through the PD zone
to reduce parking requirements for senior housing by up to 25 percent based on
the proximity of shopping and transit, as well as to reduce the proportion of
covered spaces by half for lower income senior housing.
                   Table 3-1: Residential Development Standards

 (R3)
As residential neighborhoods in Santa Fe Springs are entirely built-out, the
majority of recent residential development has been accommodated through a
Planned Development (PD) Overlay to allow the integration of housing in
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                   3-1           HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

traditionally non-residential areas. The PD overlay provides for flexibility in
development standards and allows for increased residential densities above
those permitted by the base residential zoning by not mandating an upper
density limit. The City utilized the PD overlay in conjunction with R-3 zoning as
a mechanism for development of Lakeland Manor (2001), a 25 unit apartment
complex for persons with disabilities on .68 acres; and for Little Lake Village
Senior Apartments (2003), providing 144 lower income units on 4.75 acres.
Most recently, the City rezoned 54 acres of Industrial land to R-1-PD and R-3-PD
to accommodate up 534 units at The Villages at Heritage Springs, utilizing the
PD overlay to allow for deviation from certain requirements of the underlying
zones and allowing the continuation of oil and gas production activities on a
portion of the site. The PD mechanism allowed for deviations in minimum lot
size and lot coverage, building setbacks, and height standards in the R-1 and R-
3 zones, resulting in an overall increase in density. For example, building
heights range from 30 to 40 feet; lot coverage for the multi-family product is at
80 percent, and single-family lot sizes range from 3,600 to 4,500 square feet.
             The Villages at Heritage Springs - example of PD Overlay
In summary, the City’s residential development standards have not served as a
constraint to the provision of housing due, in part, to the City’s practices of
utilizing the PD overlay as a tool to provide modified standards. Of the total 109
acres of R-3 property in Santa Fe Springs, 99 acres are zoned R-3-PD and just
10 acres are zoned R-3; these 10 acres are fully developed, with all remaining
developable multi-family property designated with the PD overlay. Should one
of the City's existing R-3 sites propose to be redeveloped, the City will
redesignate at that time with a PD overlay as necessary to provide flexibility in
development standards.

2.     Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to
be made available though appropriate zoning and development standards to
encourage the development of various types of housing for all economic
segments of the population, including multi-family rental housing, factory-built
housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional housing. Table 3-2
summarizes the housing types permitted in each of Santa Fe Springs’ residential
zone districts.

* Pursuant to SB 2, the City has drafted Zoning Code provisions to explicitly accommodate
emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, which was adopted by City Council in
December 2013. The City will undertake additional Code revisions in 2014 to explicitly permit
manufactured housing, community care facilities and SROs, as described in the narrative which
follows.
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                       3-3                HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

Second Units
In August 2003, the City adopted Section 155.644 of the Zoning Ordinance,
establishing a ministerial approval process for second units. The City allows
attached and detached second units on minimum 5,000 square foot parcels in R-
1 and R-3 zone districts, as long as the parcel is developed with an existing
residential dwelling. The second unit must comply with all of the property
development standards applicable to the residential zone in which it is located,
with the exception of parking: only one additional off-street parking space is
required, which may be uncovered and located in tandem with existing parking
on the site.
The City requires all second residential dwelling units that are rented to be
designated as "affordable" and be rented to low or very low income households.
An affordability covenant is required, and the property owner is required to
submit annual income and rent certification to the City in compliance with the
covenant.
The Director of Planning and Development maintains responsibility for reviewing
applications for second units for adherence to the standards established by the
ordinance. Upon approval by the Director, a building permit is issued.
Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
The City allows mobile home parks as a conditional use within the R-3 and M-2
zone districts, and has designated mobile home parks as a discrete land use
category in the General Plan.
As a matter of practice, the City permits manufactured housing by right within
all residential zones, consistent with State law. However, the zoning ordinance
does not currently explicitly identify manufactured housing as a permitted use,
except as it pertains to manufactured second units. In 2014, the City will
modify its Zoning Regulations to explicitly identify manufactured housing as a
permitted use in any district where single-family detached units are permitted,
subject to the same property development standards.
Community Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) is that
part of California law that sets out the rights and responsibilities of persons with
developmental disabilities. The Lanterman Act impacts local zoning ordinances
by requiring the use of property for the care of six or fewer disabled persons to
be classified as a residential use under zoning. More specifically, a State-
authorized, certified or licensed family care home, foster home, or a group home
serving six or fewer disabled persons or dependent and neglected children on a
24-hour-a-day basis is considered a residential use that is to be permitted in all
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                3-4               HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
residential zones. No local agency can impose stricter zoning or building and
safety standards on these homes.
The Santa Fe Springs Zoning Ordinance does not currently specify provisions for
community care facilities, does not subject such facilities to a use permit,
building standard, or regulation not otherwise required of single-family homes in
the same zone, and imposes no spacing requirements between community care
facilities. The City has permitted a licensed five-bed adult residential facility by
right on Davenrich, as well as several other unlicensed group homes.
The City will amend the Zoning Code in 2014 to explicitly allow small community
care facilities by right and large community care facilities with a conditional use
permit in residential districts. Due to the unique characteristics of larger (more
than six persons) community care facilities, a conditional use permit will be used
to ensure compatibility in the siting of these facilities, focusing on the use and
not the characteristics of the users. Santa Fe Springs does not require a public
hearing for approval of a conditional use permit.
Definition of Family: The City’s existing Zoning Code defines “family” as any
number of persons living together in a room or rooms comprising a single
housekeeping unit and related by blood, marriage, adoption, or any unrelated
person who resides therein as though a member of the family and including the
domestic employees thereof. Any group of persons not so related but inhabiting
a dwelling unit shall be considered to constitute one family for each five persons,
exclusive of domestic employees, contained in such group. As this definition of
family could be construed to limit six or more unrelated persons from residing
together in a single-family district, the City has updated this definition within the
Zoning Code (for adoption in November 2013) to provide greater consistency
with state and federal fair housing laws:
         “Family" means two or more persons living together as a single housekeeping
         unit in a single dwelling unit. Family also means the persons living together in a
         licensed residential facility as that term is defined in Health & Safety Code
         Section 1502(a) (1), which serves six or fewer persons, excluding the licensee,
         the members of the licensee's family, and persons employed as facility staff who
         reside at the facility.
Transitional and Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
Transitional housing is temporary housing (often six months to two years) for a
homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. This
housing can take several forms, including group housing or multi-family units,
and often includes a supportive services component to allow individuals to gain
necessary life skills in support of independent living. The City of Santa Fe
Springs provides for transitional housing similar to any multi-family residential
project. For example, Lakeland Manor, the 25 unit, Ability First transitional
housing project was developed through an R-3-PD zone. While the City has
permitted transitional housing facilities as a matter of purpose, until recently the
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     3-5                HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

Zoning Ordinance did not contain a discrete definition of such facilities. In order
to ensure compliance with recent changes in State law (SB 2) which require
transitional facilities to be treated the same as any other residential use within
the same zone, the City Council has adopted Zoning Code revisions consistent
with these new requirements, adding the following definition to the Zoning
Code, and explicitly permitting transitional housing in the R-1 and R-3 zone
districts:
        Transitional Housing (Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2(h)): Transitional
        housing and transitional housing development means buildings configured as
        rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call
        for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another
        eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall
        be no less than six months.
Supportive housing is generally defined as permanent, affordable housing with
on-site services that help residents transition into stable, more productive lives.
Services may include childcare, after-school tutoring, career counseling, etc.
Most transitional housing includes a supportive services component. The City of
Santa Fe Springs regulates supportive housing as a residential use, provided
supportive services are ancillary to the primary use and for use by the residents
of the facility. Similar to transitional housing, SB 2 requires supportive housing
to be treated the same as residential uses. The City has added the following
definition to the Zoning Code, and explicitly permitting supportive housing in the
R-1 and R-3 zone districts:
        Supportive Housing (Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(b)): Housing
        with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that
        is linked to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in
        retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or
        her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.               “Target
        population” means persons, including persons with disabilities, and families who
        are “homeless,” as that term is defined by Section 11302 of Title 42 of the United
        States Code, or who are “homeless youth,” as that term is defined by paragraph
        (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 11139.3 of the Government Code.
While Santa Fe Springs' Zoning Code has recently been amended to treat
transitional and supportive housing as a residential use within residential zone
districts, recent clarification of State statutes by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) indicates these uses must also be
provided for in non-residential zone districts where housing is permitted. Within
Santa Fe Springs' Planned Development (PD) Overlay zone, the Planning
Commission, after holding a public hearing, may approve a combination of land
uses which may include uses other than those permitted in the underlying zone,
provided that at least 60% of the area is developed with one or more of the
principal permitted, accessory, or conditional uses of the underlying zone. For
example, a PD overlay added to a commercial zone district could also allow for
the integration of residential uses. A program has thus been added to the
Housing Element for the City to amend the Zoning Code to clarify that
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     3-6                  HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

transitional and supportive housing would be permitted within areas designated
with a PD Overlay subject to the same approval processes as other residential
uses.
An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless on a limited
short-term basis. The Santa Fe Springs Zoning Ordinance does not currently
specify provisions for emergency shelters. Pursuant to SB 2, jurisdictions with
an unmet need for emergency shelters are now required to identify a zone(s)
where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a
conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must
have sufficient capacity to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum
provide capacity for at least one year-round shelter.          Permit processing,
development and management standards for emergency shelters must be
objective and facilitate the development of, or conversion to, emergency
shelters.
As discussed in the homeless section of the Housing Element Needs Assessment
(Chapter II), the 2013 homeless count and registry identified 74 homeless
individuals in Santa Fe Springs. In compliance with SB 2, Santa Fe Springs has
conducted a review of its zoning districts and determined the ML, Limited
Manufacturing, Administration and Research Zone is best suited to house an
emergency homeless shelter. The ML zone serves as a transitional district
separating industrial uses from more sensitive commercial and residential uses,
and provides for administrative offices, scientific research offices and
laboratories, restricted manufacturing and appurtenant uses compatible to the
development of an industrial park. ML zone districts are centrally located in the
city and transit accessible. The City’s Land Use Element identifies over 100 acres
of Light Industrial designated land. While there are a limited number of vacant
ML parcels, numerous ML properties are either underutilized or have existing
structures which could potentially be suitable for conversion to shelter use,
providing capacity for at least one emergency shelter.
City staff conducted a site availability survey in the ML zone and identified ten
properties available for lease, totaling over 124,000 in available building square
footage. Most of this leasable space is within concrete tilt-up “flex space”,
divisible into units as small as 1,500 square feet. Available properties are
located on Pioneer, Telegraph, and Alburtus, all of which are served by bus lines.
The City has drafted revisions to its Zoning Code to permit shelters in the ML
zone by right (for adoption by City Council on November 26, 2013), subject to
the same development and management standards as other permitted uses in
the zone. The City’s ML development standards are appropriate to facilitate
emergency shelters, and can be summarized as follows:
         Minimum lot size: 25,000 sq ft
         Minimum building size: none
         Maximum lot coverage: 50%
         Building height: 50 ft
         Front yard setback: 30 ft
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                3-7               HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

        Side and Rear Yard setbacks: none
        Outside storage: Screened from public view
        Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one room units (generally
100-250 sq. ft.) occupied by a single individual, and may either have shared or
private kitchen and bathroom facilities. SROs are rented on a weekly to monthly
basis typically without rental deposit, and can provide an entry point into the
housing market for extremely low income individuals, formerly homeless and
disabled persons. While the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not currently explicitly
address Single Room Occupancy uses, they would be treated the same as
motels and hotels, which are conditionally permitted in the C-4 Community
Commercial and M-2 Heavy Manufacturing zones.
The Santa Fe Springs Zoning Code specifies the following considerations in the
Planning Commission’s review of a CUP request:
        The proposed use will not be detrimental to persons or property in the
         immediate vicinity and will not adversely affect the city in general
        The Planning Commission shall consider the appearance of any proposed
         structure and may require revised architectural treated if deemed necessary to
         preserve the general appearance and welfare of the community.
The City will ensure zoning standards facilitate the provision of SROs, with
conditions of approval limited to ensuring compatibility and focusing on the SRO
use and not the users of the facility. In addition, in 2014, the City will revise its
Zoning Code to explicitly specify SROs as a conditionally permitted use within
the C-4 and M-2 zones, accommodating SROs both as new development and
adaptive reuse of existing structures.
Accessibility Accommodations
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make
reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning
and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to
afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For
example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to allow covered ramps in the
setbacks of properties that have already been developed to accommodate
residents with mobility impairments.
For new construction, Santa Fe Springs' building code requires new housing to
comply with the 1998 amendment to the Fair Housing Act, with multi-family
development also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
standards. New apartment buildings are subject to requirements for unit
“adaptability” on ground floor units.          Adaptable units are built for easy
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                 3-8                    HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

conversion to disabled access, such as doorway and hallway widths, and added
structural support in the bathroom to allow the addition of handrails.
On November 26, 2013, the Santa Fe Springs City Council is scheduled to adopt
Section 155.659 of the Zoning Code “Reasonable Accommodation Procedures for
Disabled Persons" to provide a mechanism through which the City can grant
reasonable adjustments to its zoning and land use regulations to avoid unequal
treatment towards individuals with disabilities. The procedures for reasonable
accommodation established by this Code section are as follows:
        A request for a Reasonable Accommodation may be made by any Disabled
         Person, his/her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for
         Disabled Persons, when the application of a zoning law, building code
         provision, or other land use regulation, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to a
         Disabled Person’s equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing.
        Reasonable accommodation requests are considered an administrative
         adjustment, with the Director of Planning serving as the decision-making body.
         Where the adjustment is combined with an application requiring discretionary
         action – such as a parcel map - the Planning Commission serves as the
         decision-maker.
        No application fee shall be required to process an application for a request for
         a Reasonable Accommodation pursuant to this Section. Where the
         improvements or modifications approved through a request for a Reasonable
         Accommodation would otherwise require a variance, a variance shall not be
         required.
        The Director, or designee, shall consider an application and issue a written
         determination. At least ten (10) calendar days before issuing a written
         determination on the application, the Director shall mail notice to the applicant
         and adjacent property owners that the City will be considering the application,
         advising of the standards for issuing an accommodation, and inviting written
         comments on the requested accommodation.
The decision-maker shall make the following findings upon granting an
accommodation:
         The dwelling that is the subject of the request for Reasonable Accommodation
          will be occupied by a Disabled Person;
         The requested accommodation is necessary to provide a Disabled Person with
          an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;
         The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or
          administrative burden on the City, as defined in the Fair Housing Laws; and
         The requested accommodation will not require a fundamental alteration to the
          City’s zoning or building laws, policies, and/or procedures, as defined in the
          Fair Housing Laws. In considering whether the accommodation would require
          such a fundamental alteration, the reviewing authority may consider, among
          other factors:
          (1) Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the
          character of the neighborhood;
          (2) Whether the requested accommodation would result in a substantial
          increase in traffic or insufficient parking;
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     3-9                HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

           (3) Whether the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any
           express purpose of either the City’s General Plan or an applicable specific
           plan; and
           (4) Whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized
           environment due to the number of, and distance between, facilities that are
           similar in nature or operation.
Farm Employee Housing
Based on Census data compiled by the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), no Santa Fe Springs residents are employed in the
industries of farming, fishing or forestry. The City has no land remaining in
agricultural use and does not have any farm housing. However, the City does
have some remaining agricultural zoning (A-1), and consistent with California
Health and Safety Code Section 17021.6, permits "living quarters of persons
regularly employed on the premises" within the A-1 zone; A-1 is the only zone in
the City allowing Agricultural use.
Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5 (Employee Housing Act) requires
jurisdictions to permit employee housing for six or fewer employees as a single-
family use. Employee housing shall not be included within the zoning definition
of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel, dormitory, or other similar term that
implies that the employee housing is a business run for profit or differs in any
other way from a family dwelling. Jurisdictions can not impose a conditional use
permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance of employee housing that
serves six or fewer employees that is not required of a family dwelling of the
same type in the same zone. A program has been added to the City’s Housing
Element to amend the Zoning Code to provide consistency with the Employee
Housing Act.

3. Fees and Improvements
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the costs of
processing permits and providing services and facilities, such as utilities, schools
and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are charged on a pro rata share
system based on the magnitude of the project’s impact or the extent of benefit
which will be derived. Table 3-3 presents a list of application fees associated
with development in the City.

As a means of assessing the cost that fees contribute to development in Santa
Fe Springs, the City has calculated total Planning, Building and Engineering fees
associated with three different residential prototypes: an individual single-family
unit; a six unit condominium subdivision; and a 20 unit apartment complex. As
indicated in Table 3-4, fees for the prototypical single-family project run
approximately $21,000 per unit, whereas per unit fees for condominium and
apartment projects are $42,000 and $22,000 respectively. In comparison with
the median single-family home price of $320,000 and median condominium
sales price of $337,000 (refer to Table 2-17), the City’s development fees
constitute approximately 7 percent of the single-family sales price and 12
percent of the condominium sales price. In terms of apartments, based on a
land cost of approximately $32 per square foot, combined with average
construction costs of $120 per square foot, the City’s development fees also
comprise a relatively small portion of the total costs of apartment development.
In summary, Santa Fe Springs’ fees are comparable, if not lower, than those in
other cities, and do not constitute a constraint to the production or improvement
of housing.
Given the scale of the 550+ unit master planned The Villages at Heritage
Springs project, the City required payment of a traffic mitigation fee of
approximately $400,000. This amount represented the owner/developer’s fair
share of the cost to construct offsite improvements identified in the project
traffic study. While the City does not have a standard traffic mitigation fee, to
the extent a project’s traffic study identifies needed off-site traffic and
intersection improvements, the project applicant pays a mitigation fee to pay for
the development’s fair share of the improvements.
Santa Fe Springs is highly urbanized with most of its necessary infrastructure,
such as streets, sewer, and water facilities, already in place. As such, the cost of
land improvement is less than in undeveloped suburban or rural areas. In terms
of site improvements, the City’s street design requirements are in compliance
with HUD guidelines. The City uses a standard 30-foot curb-to-curb width
requirement within a 54-foot right-of-way for local residential streets. Collector
streets are 36 feet curb-to-curb, within a 60-foot right-of-way.

4. Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City procedures can contribute to
the cost of housing in that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately
reflected in the unit's selling price. One way to reduce housing costs is to
reduce the time for processing permits.
As a small City with limited development, Santa Fe Springs does not experience
the backlogs in development typical in many larger jurisdictions. In most cases,
even when Planning Commission review is required, approval can be obtained in
about 45 to 90 days. Small projects, such as single-family units or small
duplexes, may receive over-the-counter approval with a simple site plan.
Projects greater than 10,000 square feet in size are subject to a Development
Plan Approval (DPA). As part of the application submittal, projects subject to
DPA require submittal of a preliminary site plan, floor plan, building elevations
and preliminary landscape design. DPA requires an action by the Planning
Commission, although it is not subject to a public hearing and can be made
simultaneously with an application for zone change, variance, conditional use
permit, modification or other request for Commission approval. In evaluating
applications for Development Plan Approval, the Planning Commission focuses
on the project design, not the use, and considers the following factors:
        That the architectural design of the proposed structures are such that
          they enhance the general appearance of the area
        That the proposed structures are considered on the basis of their
          suitability for their intended purpose, on the appropriate use of
          materials, and on the principles of proportion and harmony
        That consideration is given to landscaping, fencing and other elements
          of the proposed development to ensure the entire development is in
          harmony
        It is not the intent of Development Plan Approval to require any
          particular style of architecture, or to interfere with architectural design,
          except as necessary to harmonize with the general area
Design Review is conducted by staff, with recommendation to the Planning
Commission. The City publishes a list of standard development requirements on
its website, and provides these standards during initial discussions with
developers to serve as an early guide to project design.
The following outlines the development processing procedures for projects
requiring Development Plan Review:
       Pre-Application Submittal (optional): Applicant submits site plan for
         preliminary review by Planning, Public Works, Fire and Police. A project
         planner is assigned to the project, and compiles comments from the
         various departments within two weeks of submittal.              The project
         planner meets with the applicant to discuss the City’s initial comments,
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                3-14                 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS

         and reviews the additional items and fees necessary to submit a formal
         application.
       Application Submittal: The project planner reviews the application and
         deems the project complete or incomplete within 30 days. Once the
         application deemed complete, the project planner sends a Request for
         Conditions to various departments, who provide input within two weeks.
         Once the applicant agrees to the conditions of approval, the item is
         scheduled before the Planning Commission. Any required discretionary
         actions, such as Conditional Use Permit, Variance, or Modification of
         Property Development Standards, are processed concurrently with DPA.
For projects involving participation by the City or its former Community
Development Commission, the deal points of the Development Agreement are
established prior to undergoing the necessary planning entitlements. Little Lake
Village Senior Apartments reflects the efficiency of the City’s processes. The
former CDC assisted in assembly of the 4.7 acre site, and completed the
negotiation process for the Development Agreement in approximately four
months.     Entitlements for the 146 unit project involved a General Plan
amendment and zone change, along with CEQA compliance, which were
completed in approximately five months.
In summary, Santa Fe Springs processing and permit procedures are
streamlined in comparison to many jurisdictions, and do not serve as a
constraint to development.

5.      Building Code
Santa Fe Springs has adopted the latest version of the California Code of
Regulations, Title 24, along with all required updates. The City has also
incorporated the 2010 California Energy Code and California Green Building
Code Standards (CALGREEN) into the Municipal Code.
In January 2008, the City adopted the new International Building Code (IBC), as
required of all jurisdictions in California. The new IBC establishes construction
standards necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, and the local
enforcement of this code does not unduly constrain development of housing.
The new IBC brings California building codes into consistency with the rest of
the country. It is expected that changes from the previous State Building Code
will increase the costs of development. Santa Fe Springs continues to adopt
updates to its codes consistent with the County of Los Angeles, including most
recently the 2013 update to the Building, Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing and
Residential codes.
Santa Fe Springs has adopted the following local amendments to the City Code:
       Section 150.096 (Residential Rental Inspection Program) does not allow a
        person to rent, lease, occupy or otherwise permit any unit vacated by the
        previous occupant until such unit is registered with and inspected by the
        City Fire Department or provided with a certificate of exemption.
       Section 150.009 requires proposed developments that need either a
        building permit or grading plan approval to prepare a drainage plan or a
        drainage element. This drainage plan or element must be approved by the
        City Engineer prior to the issuance of any building permit or prior to the
        approval of any grading plan.
Santa Fe Springs maintains a Residential Rental Inspection Program as a means
of maintaining the habitable condition of rental units in the City. The City
conducts sensitive enforcement of its residential codes by providing a minimum
of three written notifications of code violations to property owners, allowing
sufficient time for compliance, and by providing information on available
rehabilitation assistance to code violators.

B. Market Constraints
1. Availability of Financing
The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors,
including the type of lending institutions active in the community, lending
practices, rates and fees charged, laws and regulations governing financial
institutions, and equal access to those institutions. Through analysis of Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the disposition of residential loan
applications, an assessment can be made of the availability of residential
financing within a community.
Table 3-5 summarizes HMDA data for both Santa Fe Springs and Los Angeles
County as a whole, providing information on the approval status of all home
purchase loan applications during 2011. Residential lending activity in Santa Fe
Springs was relatively modest, with just 343 applications for conventional and
FHA home purchase loans, reflecting home purchase activity on approximately
12 percent of the City’s ownership housing. At 73 percent, the mortgage loan
approval rate in Santa Fe Springs was slightly higher than the County’s approval
rate of 71 percent. Review of loan denials by census tract indicates no
residential tracts with loan denial rates significantly above the 13 percent
citywide average.

2.     Price of Land
The availability and price of land represents a significant market constraint to
housing production throughout most of southern California. Since there is very
limited residential land remaining in Santa Fe Springs, most new housing is built
on land formerly used or zoned for other purposes, and may involve costly site
clean-up. For example, the 500+ unit Villages at Heritage Springs involved
clean-up of a 54 acre former oilfield, with oil and gas production activities to
remain on a portion of the site. Based on analysis conducted by the City’s
economic consultant, multi-family residential land in Santa Fe Springs is valued
at approximately $32/square foot.
The City’s former Community Development Commission (CDC) had historically
played an important role in providing land write-downs in support of affordable
and special needs housing. Two sites transferred from the former CDC to the
City (3.9 acres at Lakeland/Laurel and 0.75 acres at 10934 Laurel) will continue
to provide land resources in support of affordable housing development.
3.    Cost of Construction
A major cost associated with the development of housing is the cost of building
materials, which have risen dramatically in recent years. According to the U.S.
Department of Labor Construction Cost Trends for 2013, the overall cost of
construction materials rose from approximately $178 to $205 per square foot
between 2006-2012, reflecting a 15 percent increase in materials costs. The
increase in construction costs is slowing, but were up 2-2.5% in the first half of
2012, with labor cost increases above that of materials (2.5% labor compared to
1.5% material cost increases).1
A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) can result in lower
development costs. As part of the City’s density bonus program, the City allows
for affordable units to be smaller in size (maintaining the same number of
bedrooms) and have different features and interior finishes than market rate
units, provided all project units were comparable in construction quality and
exterior design. Another factor related to construction costs is the number of
units built at one time. As that number increases, overall costs generally
decrease as builders are able to take advantage of the benefits of economies of
scale.

C. ENVIRONMENTAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
1.      Environmental Constraints
Like the entire southern California region, Santa Fe Springs is located within an
area of high seismic activity. Strong ground shaking can be expected during
major (6.0+) earthquakes from the San Andreas, Whittier, Norwalk and
Newport-Inglewood Faults.        The closest Type A fault to the City is the
Cucamonga Fault, located approximately 20 miles away, and the closest Type B
fault is the Elsinore-Whittier Fault, located approximately four miles away.
However, the City does not contain a State designated Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zone. The potential for strong ground shaking is accommodated through
building design consistent with the Uniform Building Code (ICBO 2008), and is
addressed in the City’s Safety Element.
Santa Fe Springs is not subject to major slope erosion or landslides, however,
developments contemplated in area of previous high water level should be
designed to address the potential loss of soil strength under moist conditions.
Also, as the City contains areas with potential risk for liquefaction, subsidence
should be considered in the City’s planning.
As historically industrial areas of the City are opened up to residential
development, a related health risk involves the presence of hazardous materials
utilized in many of the City’s industrial operations. The clean-up of the prior 54
acre Townlots Oilfield provides an example of the level of remediation involved
in rendering a large-scale industrial site environmentally suitable for residential
development. For the Townlots (The Villages at Heritage Springs) project, the
local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) at the City’s Fire Department and
Planning and Building Departments worked in conjunction with the Regional
Water Quality Control Board throughout the process to ensure proper site
closure activities were implemented to reduce potential exposure to hazardous
chemicals from residual chemicals in the soil and groundwater. Site mitigation
and closure requirements were identified based on the Cal EPA Department of
Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) Preliminary Endangerment Assessment (PEA)
Guidance. A human health risk assessment was then prepared for the property
and reviewed by the Cal EPA, and resulted in a determination that the project
site would not present a human health hazard after remediation was complete.
The Remediation Action Plan provides the procedure for remediation that
involves soil removal by excavation, and transport to a licensed facility.
While the cost of environmental remediation of the Townlots property is
significant, the Santa Fe Springs Community Development Commission
discounted the land to the developer to effectively reduce the cost of
remediation. In addition, in the Fiscal Impact Report on this project, the City’s
economic consultant concluded that residential redevelopment could be
designed so that it is economically feasible to clean up the Townlots Property
and prepare the former oilfield geotechnically for residential use.

2.      Infrastructure Constraints
As a completely urbanized community, the City of Santa Fe Springs already has
in place all of the necessary infrastructure to support future development. All
land designated for residential use is served by sewer and water lines, streets,
storm drains, and telephone, electrical, and gas lines. However, as an older
community, much of the City's infrastructure is aging and may require
improvements or replacement over time. On the Townlots/The Villages at
Heritage Springs project, the Water Availability Survey concluded there was
sufficient existing capacity to serve the project and that upgraded water and
wastewater conveyance lines were not required. Similarly, the City's Public
Works Department has confirmed that there is sufficient water and sewer
capacities to serve the city's regional housing needs for 324 additional units.

IV.        HOUSING RESOURCES
This chapter presents resources available for the development, rehabilitation,
and preservation of housing in Santa Fe Springs. This includes the availability of
land resources, financial resources available to support the provision of
affordable housing, administrative resources available to assist in implementing
the City’s housing programs, and resources for energy conservation.
A.     AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
SCAG has determined the projected housing need for its region for the 2014-
2021 Housing Element cycle, and has allocated this housing need to each
jurisdiction by income category. This Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(RHNA) represents the minimum number of housing units each community is
required to plan for by providing “adequate sites” through the general plan and
zoning. An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of
adequate sites for future housing development, and evaluation of the adequacy
of these sites in fulfilling the City’s share of regional housing needs (RHNA).
Santa Fe Springs has a RHNA allocation of 324 units distributed among the
following income groups: 41 extremely low income, 41 very low income, 50 low
income, 53 moderate income, and 139 above moderate income units.
The City plans to fulfill its share of regional housing needs using a combination
of the methods below, which are further described in the following narrative:
     Residential projects with development entitlements with post 12/31/13
       occupancy;
     Vacant residential sites, including sites owned by the Successor Agency to
       be developed with affordable housing; and
     Development/sale of HARP properties to first-time homebuyers.
In aggregate, the City’s residential sites capacity from the above sources
provides for 401 additional units, including 139 lower, 114 moderate and 148
above moderate income. Figure 6 at the end of this section maps the location of
Santa Fe Springs' residential sites and entitled housing projects for the 2014-
2021 Housing Element planning period.

1. Projects with Entitlements
Santa Fe Springs has three residential projects with development entitlements
that will contribute towards addressing its future 2014-2021 RHNA needs.
Projects under construction with occupancy projected to occur prior to 2014 are
discussed under Review of Accomplishments in Chapter V. Only those projects
with occupancy in the 2014-2021 planning cycle are credited towards the sites
inventory, as presented in Table 4-1.

     The Villages at Heritage Springs: This master planned development
      involved the former Santa Fe Springs’ Community Development
      Commission property acquisition and assembly of 101 lots in the Town
      Lots area and sale to The Villages at Heritage Springs, LLC. The complete
      54.5 acres of previous Industrial oil production land was rezoned to R-1-
      PD and R-3-PD and is being developed with a total of 384 single-family
      homes and townhome units, as well as 150 apartment units (described
      below). While the majority of the 384 ownership units will be completed
      and occupied in 2013, the developer's (Comstock Homes) Director of
      Sales and Marketing estimates 55 of the ownership units will become
      available for occupancy in 2014, and are thus accounted for under the
      2014-2021 Housing Element period.             The former CDC provided the
      developer $1 million in low/mod subsidies to buy the sales price down on
      ten of these units for moderate income first-time homebuyers.

      The Villages at Heritage Springs Apartments: In December 2012, the
       City’s Planning Commission approved a conditional use permit for a 155
       unit apartment complex to be developed by Comstock Homes. While
       none of the project units are deed-restricted as affordable, projected
       leasing rates for the 66 one-bedroom units, and 36 of the smaller two-
       bedroom units (Plan C), fall
       within moderate income rent
       thresholds ($1,453 for one
       bedrooms and $1,636 for two
       bedrooms).         The    project
       submitted for Plan Check with
       the City in Fall of 2013, with
       construction projected to be
       complete in 2014.
      The Jersey/Alburtis townhomes: In 2009, the City approved a zone
       change from ML to R-3-PD on three adjacent parcels on 9830 Jersey
       Avenue and 9841-51 Alburtis Avenue. Since that time, Comstock Homes
       assumed ownership of the 2.67 acre combined parcel, along with the
       associated entitlements for development of 50 townhomes. All of the
       project units will have three bedrooms and 2.5 baths, making the
       development well suited to families.
      9735 Bartley is a single-family home completed under the HARP
       program. While the unit was deemed final in June 2012, due to the
       elimination of Redevelopment and the suspension of first-time homebuyer
       loans being issued under HARP, the City has maintained ownership of the
       unoccupied unit on an interim basis. Upon completion of the State
       Controller’s Audit and confirmation of CDC Housing Assets, the City
       intends to sell its remaining HARP properties (both this home and the
       vacant HARP parcel identified in Table 4-2) for moderate income first-time
       homebuyers.
2. Vacant Residential Sites
Santa Fe Springs is a predominately industrial city, with more than 80 percent of
the City’s nine square miles designated for industrial use. Less than ten percent
of the City’s acreage is dedicated to residential use, and existing neighborhoods
are fully developed with no vacant sites remaining. While the City does include
some vacant land in its commercial and industrial zones, the introduction of
residential uses in most of these areas is inappropriate and may present
potential health hazards due to a variety of environmental conditions including
hazardous materials storage and processing, background contamination, noxious
odors, noise pollution, and truck and railroad traffic generated by industrial
operations. These factors, which tend to preclude the use of land for residential
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                4-3              HOUSING RESOURCES

purposes in much of Santa Fe Springs, must be considered in establishing
appropriate locations for future housing development.
In response to a shortfall in sites to address its regional housing needs (RHNA)
in the prior 2008-2014 planning period, the City rezoned the following two sites
R-3-PD at minimum 20 unit/acre densities as specified in the City’s Housing
Element:
      An approximately four acre vacant site located at the northwest corner
       of Lakeland and Laurel was acquired by the Santa Fe Springs
       Community Development Commission (CDC) in 2008 when an application
       for 110 residential units was withdrawn due to the soft real estate market.
       The CDC purchased the property for the purpose of developing affordable
       housing, and at an assumed density of 30 units/acre, the site could
       accommodate 118 units.            Prior to the Statewide dissolution of
       Redevelopment Agencies in February 2012, City staff was negotiating the
       final terms of a development agreement with a non-profit housing
       developer for an affordable housing project on the site; with the
       dissolution of the CDC, all negotiations ended.
       With the rezoning of the site to R-3-PD and transfer of ownership from
       the CDC to the Housing Successor Agency, the City has experienced
       interest from several developers in providing affordable housing on the
       site.    The City intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for
       development, as further described in the Housing Element programs
       section of the Element.
     Santa Fe Springs’ former CDC also owns the vacant, .75 acre site at
      10934 Laurel located adjacent to Lakeland Manor, a 25 unit housing
      facility operated by Ability First for physically disabled adults. Prior to the
      dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies, the CDC was in discussion with
      Ability First about constructing a second phase of the Lakeland Manor
      project on the parcels for a 21 unit affordable rental project for persons
      with disabilities; that project has sense been terminated.           With the
      rezoning of the site to R-3-PD, the site is now available for a new
      developer to build affordable housing, and will be packaged with the City-
      owned Lakeland/Laurel site located across the street in the City’s RFP for
      development.
In addition to these two multi-family sites, the City owns a vacant single-family
property originally purchased by the CDC for development with a home under
the HARP program, and resale to a moderate income family. With the Statewide
dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies, this property has been transferred to
the Successor Agency (City). The City intends to sell this property (along with
the vacant HARP home identified in Table 4-1) to a non-profit for development
with a moderate income, first-time homebuyer unit.

        Santa Fe Springs Regional Housing Needs
Table 4-3 compares Santa Fe Springs’ residential unit potential described in the
sections above (and quantified in Tables 4-1 and 4-2), and provides a
comparison with the City’s 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs (RHNA) for 324
units.

In terms of evaluating the adequacy of sites to address the affordability targets
established by the RHNA, Housing Element statutes provide for use of “default
densities” to assess affordability. Based on its population, Santa Fe Springs falls
within the default density of 20 units per acre for providing sites affordable to
very low and low income households; sites suitable for moderate income
households can be provided at 12 units per acre. Allocating Santa Fe Springs’
residential sites inventory based on these density thresholds, combined with the
113 moderate income units known in entitled projects, results in the provision of
sites suitable for development of 139 units affordable to lower income
households, 114 units affordable to moderate income households, and 148 units
for above moderate income households.             A comparison of this income
distribution with the City’s RHNA identifies sufficient sites at appropriate
densities to accommodate Santa Fe Springs’ regional housing needs.
It is to Santa Fe Springs’ benefit that its residential site capacity exceeds the
minimum RHNA required within each income category to help offset any sites
that may be developed with fewer units than assumed in the Housing Element
sites inventory. A healthy buffer above the required RHNA therefore provides a
“margin of safety” from having to rezone additional sites during the 2014-2021
planning period of the element.

4.     Availability of Infrastructure and Public Services
As a completely urbanized community, the City of Santa Fe Springs already has
in place all of the necessary infrastructure to support future development. All
land designated for residential use is served by sewer and water lines, streets,
storm drains, and telephone, electrical, and gas lines. However, as an older
community, much of the City's infrastructure is aging and may require
improvements or replacement over time. On the Townlots/Villages at Heritage
Springs project, the Water Availability Survey concluded there was sufficient
existing capacity to serve the project and that upgraded water and wastewater
conveyance lines were not required.
SB 1087, effective January 2006, requires water and sewer providers to grant
priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include units
affordable to lower income households. Pursuant to these statutes, upon
adoption of its Housing Element, Santa Fe Springs will immediately deliver the
Element to local water and sewer providers, along with a summary of its
regional housing needs allocation.

B.     FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The extent to which Santa Fe Springs can achieve its Housing Element goals and
objectives is in large part dependent upon the availability of financial resources
for implementation.
The primary local source of funds for affordable housing in Santa Fe Springs has
traditionally been its Redevelopment Agency’s Low- and Moderate-Income
Housing Fund.       However, due to passage of Assembly Bill (AB) 1X 26,
redevelopment agencies across California have been eliminated as of February
1, 2012, removing this tool for creating affordable housing. Loans made by
Santa Fe Springs' former Community Development Commission (CDC) using
Low and Moderate Income Housing Funds will return to the City acting as the
CDC's Housing Successor, and will be deposited into a Housing Asset Fund to
support future affordable housing development; proceeds from any land or
property sales purchased with Low/Mod funds will also contribute to Santa Fe
Springs' Housing Asset Fund.
The City will continue to explore new funding sources and programs, and
opportunities to partner with the private sector and local non-profit
organizations. Examples of potential new funding opportunities include:
      The $93 million Golden State Acquisition Fund (GSAF) was launched in
       early 2013 by State HCD in partnership with seven Community
       Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), providing developers and
       public agencies with access to favorably priced funds for developing and
       preserving affordable rental and ownership housing.
      Passage of SB 391, the California Home and Jobs Act of 2013, would
       generate approximately $525 million annually for affordable housing by
       imposing a $75 recording fee on real estate documents. The bill has
       secured a super majority in the Senate and two Assembly policy
       committees, and will remain on the Assembly Appropriations Committee’s
       calendar entering into the 2014 legislative session.
      SCAG Sustainability Program 2013-2014 Call for Proposals. This new
       local assistance planning program combines Compass Blueprint assistance
       for integrated land use and transportation planning with new Green
       Region initiative assistance for bicycle and pedestrian planning efforts.
Table 4-4 on the following pages identifies a variety of Federal, state, local and
private resources that may be available to carry out housing activities in Santa
Fe Springs.

C.     ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Described below are several non-profit agencies that are currently active and
have completed projects in Los Angeles County. These agencies serve as
resources in meeting the housing needs of the City, and are integral in
implementing activities for acquisition/rehabilitation, preservation of assisted
housing, and development of affordable housing.
National Community Renaissance (formerly Southern California Housing
Development Corporation): National CORE is a nonprofit 501(c)3 developer
with in-house capacity to construct and renovate large scale developments. Its
mission is to create affordable housing communities that contribute to
neighborhood vitality. The company owns and manages more than 4,500
multifamily units throughout Southern California and serves more than 10,000
residents. As part of its inclusive approach to improving quality of life in
Southern California communities, it staffs community resource centers at all its
properties. These centers are supported and administered by the Hope Through
Housing Foundation. National CORE was the developer of Santa Fe Springs’ 144
unit Little Lake Village Senior Apartments.
Ability First (formerly Crippled Children’s Society): Through 24 locations
across Southern California, Ability First provides a broad range of employment,
recreational and socialization programs to help children and adults with physical
and developmental disabilities reach their full potential throughout their lives.
Recognizing the critical need for accessible, affordable housing, Ability First has
become a leader in building and operating residential facilities for individuals
with physical and developmental disabilities, and currently operates ten
apartment complexes, an adult residential facility, and a residential home for
seniors. In 2001, Ability First worked in cooperation with the Santa Fe Springs
CDC to develop Lakeland Manor, a 25 unit affordable housing complex for
physically disabled adults.
Salvation Army: The Salvation Army operates a 28 apartment Transitional
Living Center for families in Santa Fe Springs. At this adult rehabilitation center,
individuals with identifiable and treatable needs receive adequate housing,
nourishing meals and necessary medical care, and engage in work therapy. They
also benefit from group therapy, spiritual guidance and skilled addictions
counseling in clean and wholesome surroundings.
Habitat for Humanity: Habitat is a non-profit, Christian organization that
builds and repairs homes for sale to very low income families with the help of
volunteers and homeowner/partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner
families at no profit with affordable, no interest loans. Santa Fe Springs' former
CDC previously donated a site to Habitat for Humanity which was subsequently
developed with a single-family home and sold to a first-time homebuyer.

D.      OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Housing Element statutes require an analysis of opportunities for energy
conservation with respect to residential development. The energy conservation
section of the element must inventory and analyze the opportunities to
encourage the incorporation of energy saving features, energy saving materials,
and energy efficient systems and design for residential development. Planning to
maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and
green building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners
and renters, in addition to promoting sustainable community design and reduced
dependence on vehicles. Such planning and development standards can also
significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases.
1.      Green Building Practices
Conventional building construction, use and demolition along with the
manufacturing of building materials have multiple impacts on our environment.
In the United States, the building industry accounts for:
                     65%  of electricity consumption
                     30%  of greenhouse gas emissions
                     30%  of raw materials use
                     30%  of landfill waste
                     12%  of potable water consumption
Interest in addressing these impacts at all levels of government has been
growing. In 2004, the State of California adopted legislation requiring LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for new and
renovated public buildings. Some local jurisdictions have not only adopted
similar standards for their public buildings, but have also recently required LEED
certification for larger commercial and residential developments. The City of
Santa Fe Springs has hired an architectural firm specializing in sustainable
buildings to design the City’s new Multi-Purpose Building to attain silver LEED
certification.
LEED certification building standards are just one piece of a coordinated green
building program. Why would a city adopt a more comprehensive green building
program? Most local building standards already consider energy and stormwater
issues. In addition, many jurisdictions have programs related to recycling,
water conservation, stormwater management, land use, and public health.
However, these programs are often overlapping and uncoordinated. One of the
primary goals behind establishing a green building program is to create a
holistic, integrated design approach to green building.
A green building program considers a broad range of issues including community
and site design, energy efficiency, water conservation, resource-efficient
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                 4-15             HOUSING RESOURCES

material selection, indoor environmental quality, construction management, and
building maintenance. The end result will be buildings that minimize the use of
resources; are healthier for people; and reduce harm to the environment.
The City of Santa Fe Springs applies green building criteria in the rehabilitation
and replacement of single and multi-family properties through the Home Repair,
Rebate, and HARP programs. For example, the City utilizes tankless water
heaters, Energy Star appliances, carpet made from recycled materials, bamboo
flooring, low flush toilets, low flow faucets and florescent lighting. All HARP
homes are built to the highest energy conservation standard approved by HUD.
The Villages at Heritage Springs planned development is designed as a solar
community, and combined with the numerous energy-saving features included
in every home, results in homes exceeding the National Energy Standard by 50
percent.
The City has established landscape guidelines for new development, including a
requirement for all landscaping designs and plans to consider the following
xeriscape materials and methods:
      Use of drought-tolerant shrubs, trees, ground cover and lawns.
      Incorporation of moisture sensor-activated controllers, rain detection
       devices and drip irrigation lines in irrigation design.
      On sites fronting a major or secondary highway, design of the irrigation
       plan to accommodate reclaimed water.
      Regarding grass lawns, on a case-by-case basis, the City will review the
       extent of lawn areas needed to satisfy the greenbelt requirements along
       Major and Secondary Highways.
The following presents a variety of additional ways in which Santa Fe Springs
promotes energy conservation:
      Advertise at City Hall and on the City’s website utility rebate programs
       and energy audits available through Edison and Southern California Gas,
       and State sponsored weatherization programs for lower income
       households. Provide brochure material to applicants in conjunction with
       the City’s highly active residential rebate program.
      Offer expedited plan check services for private developments that are
       building green to a LEED standard.
      Support the elimination of contamination in older buildings (lead-based
       paint, asbestos, etc.) during rehabilitation and code inspections.
      Promote funding opportunities for private green buildings, including
       available rebates and funding available through the California Energy
       Commission for installation of solar panels.
      Provide resource materials and training opportunities regarding green
       building and energy conservation.

2. Energy Conservation Programs Offered through Local
Utilities
In addition to green building, Santa Fe Springs can promote energy conservation
by advertising utility rebate programs and energy audits available through
Edison and Southern California Gas, particularly connected to housing
rehabilitation programs. Lower-income households are also eligible for state
sponsored energy and weatherization programs.
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides a variety of energy conservation
services under its Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). These services are
designed to help low-income households, senior citizens, permanently disabled,
and non-English speaking customers control their energy use. The Southern
California Gas Company offers an energy conservation service known as the
Community Involvement Program (CIP). This service provides weatherization
for the homes or apartments of low-income families, provided they meet the
federally-established income guidelines. These services are provided to the low-
income families free of charge while later being reimbursed by the Gas
Company.
Income-qualified Edison and So Cal Gas customers may be eligible for the
State’s Energy Savings Assistance program, and/or a 20% bill discount under
the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program.
Energy Upgrade California (EUC)
This new statewide program offers up to $4,000 in incentives to homeowners
who complete select energy-saving home improvements on a single-family
residence and two-to-four-unit buildings. The incentive packages encourage
customers to take the “whole house” approach by combining several
improvements at one time to achieve greater energy efficiencies and savings.
Homeowners are required to hire a contractor and perform an initial
assessment. EUC has a list of participating contractors and raters. Southern
California Edison (SCE) and Southern California Gas are among the five utilities
that participate in the EUC program across the State.

  V.         HOUSING PLAN
  Chapters II, III and IV establish the housing needs, opportunities and
  constraints in Santa Fe Springs. The Housing Plan presented in the following
  chapter sets forth the City’s quantified housing goals, policies and programs to
  address Santa Fe Springs’ identified housing needs.
  A.      EVALUATION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER ADOPTED
          HOUSING ELEMENT
  Communities are required to assess the achievements under their adopted
  housing programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements.
  These results should be quantified where possible, but may be qualitative where
  necessary. The results should then be compared with what was planned in the
  earlier element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned
  and what was achieved, the reasons for such differences must be discussed.
  The Santa Fe Springs 2008-2014 Housing Element sets forth a series of housing
  programs with related objectives for the following areas:
          Housing Maintenance and Rehabilitation
          Homeownership Assistance
          Housing Development/Provision of Sites
          Conservation of Affordable Housing
          Equal Housing Opportunities
  This section reviews the City’s progress to date in implementing these housing
  programs and their continued appropriateness for the 2014-2021 Housing
  Element. Table 5-1 summarizes the City’s housing program accomplishments,
  followed by a review of its quantified objectives. The results of this analysis will
  provide the basis for developing the comprehensive housing program strategy
  presented in Part C of this section.

                                            adequate sites to address its regional housing needs by

                                            Appropriateness: This program was completed and is

                                            promoting energy conservation and green building.
                                            Appropriateness: Continuing with ongoing education of

                                            households, although limited Section 8 funding restricts
                                            the number of residents that can be assisted.
                                            Appropriateness: The Section 8 program provides
                                            decent and safe living conditions to those who may not

                                            During the prior planning period, the City issued one
                                            building permit for a second unit.
                                            Effectiveness: While the demand for second units was
                                            limited during the prior planning period, the City’s
                                            ordinance was nonetheless effective in accommodating
                                            second units, and ensuring their affordability through
                                            covenants on rental units.
                                            Appropriateness: The second unit program remains

 New Construction: Goal reflects RHNA. Progress reflects 199 building permits issued between
 1/2006-12/2012, and 133 ownership units in the Villages at Heritage Springs under construction
 with occupancy to occur in 2013. Affordable units include 34 very low income units at Villa Verde
 produced through committed assistance, 1 low income second unit, and 2 moderate income HARP
 units; the 10 moderate income first-time homebuyer units in The Villages will be occupied in 2014
 and are thus counted in the future planning cycle.
 Rehabilitation: Goal reflects 1,800 home improvement rebates, home repair to 460 households,
 and 12 HARP homes.
 Conservation: Goal reflects preservation of190 units in Pioneer Gardens, Silvercrest Residences,
 and Villa Verde; and preservation of 230 Section 8 vouchers. An estimated half of these units are
 extremely low income and half are very low income.

C.      HOUSING PROGRAMS
The goals and policies of the Housing Element address Santa Fe Springs'
identified housing needs and are implemented through a series of housing
programs offered through various City departments, as well as through the Los
Angeles County Community Development Commission. The housing programs
define the specific actions the City will undertake in order to achieve its stated
goals for the 2014-2021 planning period. Pursuant to State Housing Element
law, the City’s housing programs must address the following issue areas:
       Conserving the existing supply of affordable housing
       Assisting in the provision of housing
       Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing
       Removing governmental constraints as necessary
       Promoting equal housing opportunity
The Plan for addressing these housing issues in Santa Fe Springs is described in
this section. The Housing Program Implementation Table 5-3 located at the end
of the section summarizes the 2014-2021 goals for each program, as well as
program funding source and time frame for implementation.
HOUSING MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS
1.      Home Improvement Rebate Program
Santa Fe Springs has offered a home improvement rebate program since 1978,
providing well over 6,000 rebates to low and moderate income homeowners.
While the program has been on hold since the elimination of Redevelopment in
2012, rebates have proven highly successful in helping to maintain the City’s
housing stock, and thus the City will pursue alternative funding to re-initiate the
program.
        2014-2021 Objective: Pursue outside funding, such as CDBG or
        Redevelopment Housing Asset Funds, to support re-initiation of the Home
        Improvement Rebate Program. Re-evaluate program guidelines in light of
        funding constraints to ensure an effective program. Seek to assist a
        minimum of 100 lower income households.
2.      Property Maintenance Program
The City’s Property Maintenance Ordinance establishes minimum standards for
exterior property maintenance. Property owners whose properties are not in
compliance with the Ordinance are notified in writing and given a reasonable
amount of time to bring the property into compliance. In the event of non-
compliance, property owners are provided two additional written notifications.
Code violators are also provided with information regarding available
rehabilitation programs to assist in completing repairs to the property.
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                  5-11                      HOUSING PLAN

       2014-2021 Objective: Provide for continued monitoring and sensitive
       enforcement of the Property Maintenance Ordinance. Provide information
       to code violators regarding available rehabilitation assistance. Seek to
       complete 60 residential inspections on an annual basis.
3.     Residential Rental Inspection Program
The City initiated this program in 1990 to ensure a high level of maintenance
among rental units in the City. Under this program, the City inspects the rental
property on an annual basis as well as prior to re-occupancy when a change in
tenancy occurs.
       2014-2021 Objective: Continue the annual inspection of rental units
       and assure that all units remain in compliance with the Uniform Building
       Code and other state and local codes relating to zoning, health, safety,
       and property maintenance.
HOME OWNERSHIP ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
4.     Sale of HARP Properties
HARP (Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation Lottery program) is designed to
both upgrade the housing stock and increase homeownership among the City’s
low and moderate income households. Under this program, the City purchases
vacant land or existing substandard homes, and either builds a new house or
completely rehabilitates the existing dwelling. The City then sells the home to a
qualified low or moderate income family.
With the elimination of Redevelopment, the City no longer has funds to
implement the HARP program. However, the Housing Successor Agency will be
disposing of several properties originally purchased by the CDC for development
with homes under the HARP program. The City intends to sell these properties to
a non-profit for development with moderate income, first-time homebuyer units.
       2014-2021 Objective: Transfer ownership of HARP properties to a non-
       profit for development with first-time homebuyer units. Seek to provide
       two moderate income units.
5.     County Homeownership Program (HOP)
The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC)
administers the HOP Program, offering up to $60,000 in deferred payment, 0
percent loans for downpayment and closing cost assistance for low income (80%
MFI) first-time homebuyer households. The HOP Program is funded using
federal HOME funds, and is available for existing, new construction, approved
short sales and real estate owned (REO) properties. Santa Fe Springs is a
participating jurisdiction in the HOP program, and has for-sale housing stock
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    5-12                   HOUSING PLAN

which falls within the sales price maximums. This program can be used in
conjunction with the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC), or the Southern
California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA) Program. Participants are required
to undergo an 8 hour first-time homebuyer seminar by a HUD approved agency
before closing escrow.
       2014-2021 Objective: Advertise the availability of the HOP Program in
       the City’s newsletter and on the City’s website, along with the schedule of
       the County’s bilingual first-time homebuyer seminars.
6.     Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA)
Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA) is a joint powers
authority between Los Angeles and Orange Counties to create first-time
homebuyer programs for low- to moderate-income households. The single-
family mortgage revenue bond program offered by SCHFA provides 30 year,
below-market fixed rate mortgage loans and a grant for downpayment and
closing costs assistance. Eligibility includes maximum household incomes of
approximately $100,000, and sales price limits of approximately $670,000, or
up to $820,000 in identified target areas (includes census tract 5041.02 in Santa
Fe Springs).
The program is administered by the Los Angeles County Community
Development Commission (CDC) and the Public Finance Division of the County
of Orange. SCHFA does not lend money directly to homebuyers. Homebuyers
must work directly with a participating lender.
       2014-2021 Objective: Advertise the availability of the SCHFA single-
       family bond program in the City’s newsletter and on the City’s website,
       along with a listing of participating MCC lenders.
7.     Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
The MCC program provides an annual federal income tax credit of up to 15
percent of the mortgage interest paid for first-time homebuyers. The program
helps first-time homebuyers qualify for a loan by allowing the lender to reduce
the housing expense ratio by the amount of the tax savings. Eligibility includes
maximum household incomes of approximately $100,000, and sales price limits
of approximately $670,000, or up to $820,000 in identified target areas
(includes census tract 5041.02 in Santa Fe Springs).
       2014-2021 Objective: Advertise the availability of the MCC Program in
       the City’s newsletter and on the City’s website, along with a listing of
       participating MCC lenders.

HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS/PROVISION OF SITES
8.      Affordable Housing Development Assistance
The City can play an important role in facilitating the development of quality,
affordable housing through provision of land write-downs and regulatory
incentives, and as available, financial assistance. Santa Fe Springs' Housing
Successor Agency owns two housing sites (Lakeland/Laurel and 10934 Laurel)
originally purchased with Low/Mod Housing Funds and recently rezoned R-3-PD
with minimum 20 unit/acre densities. Designating these sites with a Planned
Development (PD) Overlay eliminates any upper density limit and allows flexible
development standards, providing an effective regulatory mechanism to
facilitate affordable housing development.
Pursuant to AB 1484, once Santa Fe Springs' Successor Agency receives a
"finding of completion" by the State Department of Finance (DOF), the Agency
can develop a long-range property management plan which delineates the use
or disposition of all properties owned by the Successor Agency. Upon approval
of the property management plan by DOF and the oversight board, the City's
Successor Agency will issue a Request for Proposal for development of the two
vacant R-3-PD sites with affordable housing.
        2014-2021 Objective: Enter into a development agreement(s) for
        development of the 3.9 acre Lakeland/Laurel site and .75 acre site at
        10934 Laurel with affordable housing, with particular emphasis on family
        housing. Provide a land write-down and flexible development standards
        to enhance affordability, and waive Planning Dept application fees for
        projects with a minimum 10% extremely low income units. Seek to
        achieve a minimum of 100 affordable units on these two sites.
9.     Housing Element Monitoring/Annual Report
The Planning Department will be responsible for establishing the regular
monitoring of the Housing Element, and preparing an Annual Progress Report for
review by the public, City decision-makers and submittal to State HCD.
Completion of the Annual Report is required for the City to maintain access to
State housing funds.
The Report will document:
       Santa Fe Springs' annual residential building activity, including
        identification of any deed restricted affordable units and assignment of
        market rate units to an appropriate affordability category
       Progress towards the Regional Housing Needs Allocation since the start of
        the planning period; and
       Implementation status of Housing Element programs.
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    5-14                  HOUSING PLAN

In addition to the Annual Report, the City will conduct ongoing monitoring of the
Housing Element sites inventory in conjunction with development applications to
ensure the continued provision of adequate site capacity to address Santa Fe
Springs' regional housing needs. The City will also monitor any applications for
redevelopment of R-3 sites, and designate with a PD overlay as necessary to
provide development flexibility.
       2014-2021 Objective: Review the Housing Element annually and
       provide opportunities for public participation, in conjunction with the
       submission of the City’s Annual Progress Report to the State Department
       of Housing and Community Development (HCD) by April 1st of each year.
       Conduct ongoing monitoring of the sites inventory to ensure adequate
       capacity to address the City's RHNA needs. Should a potential shortfall be
       identified, redesignate additional sites as necessary.                Monitor
       redevelopment of R-3 sites, and add a PD overlay as appropriate.
10.    Second Dwelling Unit Program
A second unit is a self-contained living unit with cooking, eating, sleeping, and
full sanitation facilities, either attached to or detached from the primary
residential unit on a single lot. Second units offer several benefits. First, they
typically rent for less than apartments of comparable size, and can offer
affordable rental options for seniors and single persons. Second, the primary
homeowner receives supplementary income by renting out their second unit,
which can help many modest income and elderly homeowners remain in or
afford their homes.
Pursuant to current State law, Santa Fe Springs offers a ministerial process for
second unit applications, subject to review and approval by the Planning
Director. The City permits attached and detached second dwelling units on
minimum 5,000 square foot residential parcels within the R-1 and R-3 zones.
Second units that are rented are required to be designated as “affordable” and
be rented at affordable rents to very low and low income households.
       2014-2021 Objective: Through implementation of the City’s second
       unit ordinance, provide additional sites for the provision of rental housing.
       Based on past trends, seek to achieve at least three new second units
       during the planning period.
11. Sustainability and Green Building
Green buildings are structures that are designed, renovated, re-used or
operated in a manner that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability.
These structures reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency,
generate less waste, and lessen a building’s overall environmental impact. The
2010 California Building Standards Code establishes mandatory Statewide green
building standards. In addition to implementing the State CALGREEN standards,
Santa Fe Springs will continue to apply green building criteria in its Home
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                 5-15                       HOUSING PLAN

Rebate and HARP programs. Pursuant to City Ordinance No. 914, the City
requires builders to complete a Construction and Demolition Recycling form to
identify materials to be reused, recycled, or disposed of, with the City's goal to
reuse or recycle at least 75% of project waste. The largest residential project in
Santa Fe Springs - the 500+ unit Villages at Heritage Springs - was designed as
a solar community, and combined with the numerous energy-saving features
included in every home, has resulted in homes exceeding the National Energy
Standard by 50 percent.
As a means of encouraging energy conservation among its residents, the City
will advertise utility rebate, weatherization and energy audit programs available
through private utilities and the State.
       2014-2021 Objective: Provide outreach and education to developers,
       architects and residents on the CALGREEN code, and ways to incorporate
       sustainability into project design and in existing structures. Advertise
       energy conservation programs at City Hall, on the City’s website, and in
       conjunction with the City’s residential rebate program.
CONSERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
12.    Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
The Section 8 program extends rental subsidies to extremely low and very low
income households, providing a voucher to pay the difference between the fair
market rent (FMR) as established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay
(i.e. 30% of household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing
that costs above the payment standard, providing the tenant pays the extra
cost. The Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HaCOLA) coordinates
Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of the City. HUD requires that 75 percent
of new admissions be limited to extremely low income households (30% MFI).
Given the gap between market rents and what these lower income households
can afford to pay for housing, Section 8 plays a critical role in allowing such
households to remain in the community.
       2014-2021 Objective: Continue to participate in the Section 8 program
       administered by HACoLA and advertise to residents in the City's quarterly
       newsletter and through placement of brochures at the Gus Velasco
       Neighborhood Center and City Hall. Encourage landlords to register units
       with HaCOLA and to undergo education on the Section 8 program in
       conjunction with the City's annual Rental Inspection Program.
13.    Preservation of Assisted Rental Housing
Santa Fe Springs contains two projects at risk of conversion to market rate
during the 2013-2023 planning period – Pioneer Gardens and Silvercrest
Residences. However, each of these projects is considered at relatively low
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     5-16                 HOUSING PLAN

conversion risk due either to non-profit ownership, or recent debt refinancing.
Nonetheless, each of the project’s Section 8 Housing Assistance Plan (HAP)
contracts are subject to annual renewals from HUD, and therefore are
considered at-risk.
       2014-2021 Objective: The following are strategies the City will
       undertake to work towards preservation of its 156 units of at-risk rental
       housing:
         Monitor At-Risk Units: Maintain an ongoing dialogue with Pioneer
          Gardens and Silvercrest Residences to confirm the status of Section 8
          contract renewals.
         Rental Assistance: Should Section 8 contracts not be renewed by
          HUD, pursue alternative funding sources for rent subsidies to maintain
          affordability. While the City no longer has local funds for preservation,
          outside financial resources may include HOME, CDBG, and State
          preservation funds.
         Tenant Education: Based on California law, property owners are
          required to give a twelve month notice of their intent to opt out of low
          income use restrictions. The City will work with tenants, and as
          necessary, contract with specialists like the California Housing
          Partnership to provide education regarding tenant rights, preservation
          opportunities and conversion procedures.
REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
14.     Zoning Ordinance Revisions
As part of the Housing Element governmental constraints analysis, several
revisions to the Santa Fe Springs Zoning Code have been identified as
appropriate to better facilitate affordable housing and the provision of a variety
of housing types. These zoning revisions include:
          a. Add transitional and supportive housing within the Code’s definition
              section, and list as permitted uses within residential zone districts.
          b. Identification of emergency shelters as a by-right, permitted use in
              the ML zone.
          c. Modify the current zoning definition of “family” to ensure
              compliance with state and federal fair housing laws.
          d. Identification of manufactured housing as a permitted use in all
              residential zones.
          e. Listing of small community care facilities (6 or fewer) as a
              residential use under zoning, and identification of large community
              care facilities as a conditionally permitted use within all residential
              zones.
          f. Definition of single room occupancy hotels (SROs) and identification
              of SROs as a conditionally permitted use in the C-4 and M-2 zones.
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                  5-17                       HOUSING PLAN

          g. Clarification that transitional and supportive housing are permitted
              in areas designated with a PD Overlay subject to the same approval
              processes as other residential uses.
Due to significant cut backs in staffing associated with the end of
Redevelopment, as of mid-2013 the City had not yet adopted the specified
zoning ordinance revisions. In July 2013, the City hired contract Planning staff
who have completed drafts of Zoning Code revisions a-c, and were subsequently
adopted by City Council in December 2013. Zoning Code revisions d-g will
follow, with adoption in 2014.
      2014-2021 Objective: Amend the zoning ordinance in 2013 consistent
      with SB 2 to make provisions for transitional/supportive housing and
      emergency shelters, and adopt an updated definition of family. In 2014,
      amend the Code to make explicit provisions for manufactured housing,
      community care facilities and SROs, and transitional and supportive
      housing within PD zones.
15. Affordable Housing Density Bonus
The City is adding Section 155.612 to the Santa Fe Springs Municipal Code to
implement State density bonus law, providing a process for applicants of
residential projects with five or more units to apply for a density bonus and
additional incentive(s) if the project provides for one of the following:
           10 percent of the total units for lower income households; or
           5 percent of the total units for very low income households; or
           A senior citizen housing development or mobile home park that limits
            residency based on age requirements; or
           10 percent of the total dwelling units in a condominium for moderate
            income households.
The amount of density bonus varies according to the amount by which the
percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the established minimum
percentage, but generally ranges from 20-35 percent above the specified
General Plan density. In addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may
receive 1-3 additional development incentives, depending on the proportion of
affordable units and level of income targeting. The following development
incentives may be requested:
           Reduced site development standards or design requirements.
           Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing
            project.
           Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant
            or the City that would result in identifiable cost reductions.
In addition to development incentives, developers may request and receive
reduced parking as follows: 1 space for 0-1 bedroom units, 2 spaces for 2-3
bedroom units, and 2½ spaces for four or more bedrooms.

       2014-2021 Objective:         Adopt and maintain a local density bonus
       ordinance consistent with state requirements, and advertise on the City’s
       website.
16.    Fee Deferrals and/or Waivers for Affordable Housing
Santa Fe Springs collects various fees from development projects to cover the
costs of processing permits and providing services and facilities. While these
fees are assessed on a per unit share basis, they are an element in the cost of
housing and could potentially constrain the provision of affordable housing. The
deferral, reduction or waiver of City fees can lower the production costs of
affordable housing.
In order to specifically encourage the provision of housing affordable to
extremely low income (ELI) households (<30% AMI), the City will waive
Planning Department entitlement fees for projects with a minimum of 10%
extremely low income units.
In addition, the California legislature passed AB 641 in 2007, which helps to
address the cash flow challenges inherent in many affordable housing projects
during the construction phase. For affordable housing developments in which at
least 49 percent of the units are affordable to low or very low-income
households, AB 641 prohibits local governments from requiring the payment of
local developer fees prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy.
      2014-2021 Objective: In conjunction with affordable housing projects,
      inform developers that fee deferrals, reductions and waivers may be
      requested as an incentive. By 2014, update the Code to specify the waiver
      of Planning Department application processing fees for projects with a
      minimum of 10% Extremely Low Income units.
17. CEQA Exemptions for Infill Projects
Santa Fe Springs will continue to utilize allowable California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) exemptions for qualified urban infill and other residential
projects where site characteristics and an absence of potentially significant
environmental impacts allow. Use of the CEQA exemption must be consistent
with the environmental review of individual projects.
       2014-2021 Objective: Continue to utilize categorical exemptions under
       CEQA on a case-by-case basis as appropriate based on the facts and
       circumstances of individual residential and mixed use infill development
       projects.

18. Zoning for Small Employee Housing (6 or fewer)
California Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5 (Employee Housing Act)
requires any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer
employees to be deemed a single-family structure with a residential land use
designation. For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall not
be included within the definition of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel,
dormitory, or other similar term that implies that the employee housing is a
business run for profit or differs in any other way from a family dwelling. No
conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
required of employee housing that serves six or fewer employees that is not
required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone.
        2014-2021 Objective: Within two years of adoption of the Housing
        Element, amend the Zoning Ordinance consistent with the Employee
        Housing Act (H&S 17021.5) to permit employee housing for six or fewer
        employees as a single-family structure.
EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS
19.     Fair Housing Programs
A variety of housing-related services are offered through the City of Santa Fe
Springs Gus Velasco Neighborhood Center for Social Services. Legal counseling
on housing matters is provided, including review of leases, fair housing matters,
and landlord-tenant disputes. The population served generally tends to be low-
income renters. Where necessary, fair housing cases are referred to the Long
Beach Fair Housing Foundation.
        2014-2021 Objective: Promote the fair housing program through
        advertisements in the City's quarterly newsletter (mailed to every
        household in Santa Fe Springs), as well as through program brochures
        placed at City Hall and the Gus Velasco Neighborhood Center.
20.     Social Service Programs for Special Needs Groups
In addition to fair housing services, the Gus Velasco Neighborhood Center and
Betty Wilson Senior Center offer numerous social service programs for seniors,
families, and other special needs groups. These programs include the following:
         Housing Referral: The Neighborhood Center Program Coordinator
          maintains contact with the managers of the assisted housing
          developments in Santa Fe Springs and assists households in housing
          placement. If necessary, applicants are referred to the County Housing
          Authority for placement on the Section 8 waiting list for rental
          assistance.
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    5-20                  HOUSING PLAN

          Emergency Rental Assistance: The City provides emergency rental
           or financial assistance to families experiencing extreme hardship.
          Emergency Shelter Referral: Referrals are made to the Salvation
           Army      and    other    local    shelters  for  emergency    overnight
           accommodations. In emergency situations, the City may provide a
           voucher for overnight shelter in a local motel.
          Daily Nutrition Program:             The Southeast Area Social Services
           Funding Authority provides seniors with daily hot lunches at the
           Neighborhood Center. Home delivered meals are also available for
           qualifying seniors age 60 and over.
          Adult Day Care: Trained volunteers visit homebound seniors, as well
           as provide transportation to and from the senior center where a variety
           of activities are available.
          Food pantry and food vouchers for low-income households.
          Children Services Program: Morning and afternoon day care is
           subsidized based on a sliding income scale. Preschool is also provided
           at a subsidized rate.
          Employment Services:            Information and referral, as well as job
           training.
          Community Psychologist: A licensed psychologist is available to City
           residents for crises intervention involving family or domestic
           counseling, as well as teen counseling and diversion programs for high
           risk youth.
        2014-2021 Objective: Maintain a proactive social service program and
        augment with additional programs as deemed appropriate by the Social
        Services and Senior Citizen Advisory Committees.
21. Reasonable Accommodation
Pursuant to Senate Bill 520, jurisdictions are required to analyze constraints to
the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with
disabilities and take measures to remove constraints. As part of this Housing
Element, Santa Fe Springs has conducted a review of zoning, building codes,
and permit processing procedures and has not identified any institutional
barriers to the provision of accessible housing. Nonetheless, the City has not yet
adopted written procedures for requesting a reasonable accommodation, and is
in the process of doing so to further encourage and facilitate the provision of
housing for persons with disabilities. Section 155.612 “Reasonable
Accommodation Procedures for Disabled Persons" will be added to the Municipal
Code to provide a mechanism through which the City can grant reasonable
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     5-21                    HOUSING PLAN

adjustments to its zoning and land use regulations to avoid unequal treatment
towards individuals with disabilities.
       2014-2021        Objective:     Adopt   and     implement    a   reasonable
       accommodation procedure in 2013.          Beginning in 2014, inform and
       educate the public on the availability of the reasonable accommodation
       procedure through the dissemination of information on the City’s website
       and at the Planning Department’s public counter.
22. Housing Opportunities for Persons Living with Disabilities
The East Los Angeles Regional Center (ELARC) is among 21 regional centers
operated by the State Department of Developmental Services to provide
services and support for adults and children with developmental disabilities. The
ELARC currently provides services to 115 developmentally disabled residents
within the Santa Fe Springs 90670 zip code.
The Regional Center reports that 60 percent of their adult clients with
developmental disabilities live with their parents, and as these parents age and
become more frail, their adult disabled children will require alternative housing
options. The Regional Center has identified several community-based housing
types appropriate for persons living with a developmental disability, including:
licensed community care facilities and group homes; supervised apartment
settings with support services; and for persons able to live more independently,
rent subsidized, affordable housing. The City will coordinate with the ELARC to
implement an outreach program informing Santa Fe Springs families of housing
and services available for persons with developmental disabilities, including
making information available on the City’s website.
Santa Fe Springs supports the provision of housing for its disabled population,
including persons with developmental disabilities, through several means,
including:
           By-right zoning for licensed residential care facilities (6 or fewer
            residents) in all residential zones, and provisions for larger care
            facilities (7 or more residents) in all residential zones, subject to a
            conditional use permit.
           Adoption of zoning ordinance provisions to specifically define
            supportive and transitional housing as a residential use of property,
            and to permit in residential zone districts subject only to those
            restrictions and processing requirements that apply to other
            residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
           Procedures for an individual with a disability to request a reasonable
            accommodation from zoning and building standards. No special
            permit or fee is required.
           Programs to facilitate affordable housing, including Density Bonuses
            and Affordable Housing Development Assistance.

  2014-2021 Objective: Continue to support a variety of housing types to
  help address the diverse needs of persons living with disabilities, and work
  with the ELARC to publicize information on available resources for housing
  and services. Evaluate the use of State and Federal funds available for
  supportive housing and services in conjunction with future affordable housing
  developments, and coordinate with affordable housing developers to apply
  for funds at least once during the planning period.

                         NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
          STUDY SESSION-HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE 2014-2021
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a Public Hearing will be held before the Santa
Fe Springs Planning Commission and City Council on the Draft Housing Element
Update 2014-2021.
The City of Santa Fe Springs has begun the process of updating the Housing
Element of the General Plan for the 2014-2021 period as required by State law.
The Housing Element establishes policies and programs to address Santa Fe
Springs’ existing and projected housing needs, including the city’s fair share of
the regional housing need (or “RHNA”).
State law requires each city to regularly update its Housing Element to reflect a
community’s changing housing characteristics and needs. In addition to the
above, State law recognizes that public participation is an important and
necessary part of the housing element update process. Accordingly, the City
welcomes comments and opinions from the public on the proposed Draft
Housing Element Update 2014-2021. Written comments can be submitted to the
Director of Planning and Development at the address listed below. Either oral or
written comments can be presented at the Public Hearing.
THE PUBLIC HEARING/STUDY SESSION will be held before the Santa Fe
Springs Planning Commission on September 23, 2013 at 4:30 p.m., and City
Council on September 26, 2013 at 6:00 p.m. Both meetings will be held in
the City Council Chambers within City Hall, located at 11710 Telegraph
Road, Santa Fe Springs, California 90670. At that time anyone wishing to
speak in regard to the proposed Draft Housing Element Update 2014-2021 will
be given an opportunity to be heard.
If you have any questions concerning the study session or if you cannot attend
but wish to submit comments, please contact Mr. Wayne M. Morrell in the
Department of Planning and Development at (562) 868-0511, ext. 7550.

       City Council Study Session
           September 26, 2013
    What is the Housing Element?
 Part of the City’s General Plan
 4 Major Components:
   Housing Needs Assessment
   Evaluation of Constraints to Housing
   Identification of Residential Sites
   Program Strategy to Address Needs
 Each California city required to update every 5 years,
  subject to the statutory schedule
 Review by State HCD for compliance with State law
                                                  2

     Benefits of HCD Compliance

 If courts invalidate Element, suspend City’s authority to issue
  building permits until brought into compliance
 Maintain discretionary review over affordable housing projects
 Maintain eligibility for State housing funds
 Don’t face RHNA carry-over into next Housing Element cycle
