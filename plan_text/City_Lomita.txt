1.0 Introduction
1.1      Purpose of the Housing Element
All local governments are required to prepare long-range general plans to consider those issues
germane to the planning for future development. These general plans must contain elements
that consider specific issues such as land use, transportation, housing, health and safety, open
space, and natural resources. In 1967, the housing element became the third mandated general
plan element. During the ensuing years, many revisions have been made to the required scope
and content of housing elements.
Within the past several decades, the State            Purpose of the Housing Element

housing-related issues in California.          This   The primary purpose of this Housing Element is

range planning to determine how this growth
may be accommodated.
In 1981, Article 10.6 of the Government Code was enacted to better define the scope and
content of local housing elements. This legislation, commonly referred to as the Roos Bill,
required that local housing elements include an assessment of housing needs; an inventory of
housing resources; the identification of those constraints that may impede the development of
new housing; a statement of goals, policies, and objectives; and, a five-year housing program.
More recent revisions have focused on the need to identify affordable housing at risk of
conversion to market rate units and the identification of adequate sites for new residential
development.       This Housing Element is in conformance with the requirements of the
Government Code1 and addresses the four major issues listed below:
        The determination of the City’s existing and projected housing need;
        The identification of strategies that will enable the City to accommodate the identified
         need for housing, including affordable housing;

        The identification of the City’s goals and policies relative to housing; and,
        The identification of specific actions the City intends to implement to assist in
         accommodating identified needs.
The Government Code further articulates the Legislature's intent in enacting the most recent
revisions to the housing element law:
        Local governments must prepare and implement housing elements that, along with
         Federal and State programs, will assist in the attainment of the State’s housing goal;
        The individual locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required to
         contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal, provided that such a
         determination is compatible with the State’s housing goals and regional housing needs;
         and
        Any programs that focus on the improvement and development of housing must be
         designed for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
The legislature recognized that, in carrying out the aforementioned objectives, each local
government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors,
as well as community goals set forth in the general plan, and to cooperate with other local
governments and the State in addressing regional housing needs.
State law is very specific concerning the scope

         responsibilities in contributing to the attainment of the State’s housing goals;

        Each jurisdiction should participate in determining the necessary efforts required to
         attain the State’s housing goals; and
        Local governments must cooperate with other local governments to address regional
         housing needs.
State law requires that the Housing Element be updated periodically. This Housing Element for
the City of Lomita covers the planning period of October 15, 2013 through October 15, 2021.
1.2      Public Participation
The City created a Housing Element fact sheet for distribution at public counters (such as the
City Hall and the public library). This fact sheet provides a simple summary of the Housing
Element requirements and key housing programs offered by the City. Residents were
encouraged to provide comments regarding housing needs on the fact sheet. However, no
response was received from residents.
The City conducted two public hearings to receive public comments on the Draft Housing
Element - September 9, 2013, before the Planning Commission and October 8, 2013, before the
City Council. The hearing notices were posted at City Hall bulletin boards, the Library, Post
Office, and Lomita Park. The notices were also emailed to residents on the City’s distribution
list and to the Daily Breeze, as well as sent to the City of Torrance via mail. At both hearings,
one resident spoke to support the Housing Element and encouraged future development to
occur in the Mixed Use Overlay area, away from established low-density residential
neighborhoods.
The Draft Housing Element was available for public review on City website, City Hall, and
Library. No comment on the Draft Housing Element was received.
The City held a public hearing before the City Council on February 3, 2014 for the adoption of
the Housing Element. Notice of the public hearing was published in the Daily Breeze and sent
to developers and service providers. In addition, the City circulated the Initial Study for the
Housing Element for public review.
1.3      Format of the Housing Element
The City of Lomita Housing Element consists of five sections that together fulfill the State’s
housing element requirements. These sections are organized in a manner that will facilitate
future updating in accordance with State law. These sections include the following:
         Section 1.0 – Introduction
         This section provides an overview of the purpose and authority of the Element, as well
         as an overview of its organization.
City of Lomita                                                                             Page 3

                                                                         2013-2021 Housing Element
         Section 2.0 - Community Profile
         The background analysis that serves as the basis for the development of housing policy
         is detailed in this section. Key topics considered in this section include the City’s
         demographic characteristics, the characteristics of the existing housing stock, household
         characteristics, and socioeconomic characteristics.
         Section 3.0 - Land Use and Housing Need
         The existing and projected housing need for the City of Lomita is discussed in this
         section. In addition, the City’s land use policy, as it relates to the conservation of
         housing, residential development, and housing production, is discussed.
         Section 4.0 - Housing Constraints
         Those issues that could constrain the development and/or maintenance of housing,
         especially affordable housing, are identified in this section. These constraints are
         considered according to the following subject categories: governmental constraints, land
         use controls, non-governmental constraints, and environmental constraints.
         Section 5.0 - Policies and Programs
         The City’s long-range plans for accommodating existing and projected housing needs, as
         well as the maintenance and rehabilitation of housing in the City, are detailed in this
         section.
1.4      Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Elements that comprise the Lomita General Plan are required by State law to be internally
consistent. Together these Elements provide the framework for the development of facilities,
services, and land uses necessary to address the needs and desires of the City’s residents. To
ensure that these needs are clearly addressed throughout the General Plan, the Elements must
be interrelated and interdependent. This Housing Element is most directly related to the Land
Use Element, since it is the Land Use Element that designates the location and extent of
residential development throughout the City.
With respect to the City’s existing adopted General Plan, the following findings of conformity
may be made:
        This Housing Element does not propose any changes in land uses or in zoning that
         would result in any inconsistencies with the adopted Land Use Element or with the other
         General Plan Elements;
        This Housing Element will not change the adopted land use and/or development
         standards included in the Land Use Element;
        This Housing Element does not promote or propose any land use changes requiring the
         installation of any new streets or infrastructure not already anticipated in the General
         Plan;
City of Lomita                                                                               Page 4

                                                                        2013-2021 Housing Element
        The City's ability to accommodate new residential development is limited. As a result,
         the focus of this Element is to identify strategies that will be effective in conserving
         existing housing, while at the same time, to investigate opportunities to accommodate
         new infill residential development; and,
        Finally, this Element updates important background information used in the evaluation
         and/or formulation of housing policy.
The City understands that upon adoption of the Housing Element, the City is required to amend
the Safety and Resource Management Elements of the General Plan as necessary to address
flood hazards and flood management, pursuant to AB 162.
1.5      Overview of the City of Lomita
The City of Lomita is located 26 miles south of downtown Los Angeles and is bounded by the
City of Torrance on the north and west; the City of Los Angeles to the east; the City of Rolling
Hills Estates on the southwest; and the City of Rancho Palos Verdes and unincorporated County
land on the southeast. The City’s total land area is 1,261 acres or 1.97 square miles.
Freeway access to the City is provided indirectly by Pacific Coast Highway (SR-1), which is
oriented in an east-west direction through the City’s southern section. Pacific Coast Highway
connects to the Harbor Freeway (SR-110) approximately 3.5 miles to the east of the City.
Crenshaw Boulevard and Western Avenue are major arterial roadways along the western and
eastern borders of the City of Lomita, respectively. These two roadways provide connections to
the San Diego Freeway (I-405) approximately 8.0 miles to the north.
The City of Lomita “began” as a residential tract (Lomita Subdivision) in the early 1900s and
became part of the oil drilling land and agricultural area in the 1920s. The Lomita Subdivision
consisted of seven square miles in 1907. As the lots were sold, water wells, a school, a general
store (with a post office), and other businesses soon followed. In 1923, oil in the area was
discovered while drilling for water. The resulting “oil boom” in the area led to the conversion of
undeveloped residential lots into oil fields. Rapid growth occurred in the Lomita area, as egg
ranches, fruit orchards, and agricultural uses formed the community. Prior to World War II,
Lomita became a center for the agriculture and oil extraction activities in the South Bay area.2
In the 1940s and 1950s, portions of the Lomita Subdivision were annexed by adjacent cities.
By 1964, only 1.87 square miles of the Lomita Subdivision remained when the City of Lomita
finally incorporated. The City subsequently annexed land to the southeast and now includes
1.97 square miles within the City’s corporate boundaries. Today, the City is almost completely
developed, and the remaining vacant land is limited to scattered parcels. Existing development
in the City is characterized by residential neighborhoods at varying densities, with commercial
uses concentrated along Pacific Coast Highway, Lomita Boulevard, Crenshaw Boulevard,
Narbonne Avenue, and Western Avenue. The City's population according to the 2010 Census
was 20,256.

and socioeconomic characteristics of the City of Lomita. The information contained herein
indicates those trends that have occurred in the Lomita in the years following the City’s
incorporation in 1964. This section of the Element considers the following:
        Demographic Characteristics, including population growth trends in the City, age
         characteristics, and ethnicity;
        Housing Characteristics focuses on trends in residential development, housing unit
         types, and housing tenure;

         have special housing requirements.
2.1      Demographic Characteristics
The type and amount of housing needed in a community is largely determined by population
growth and various demographic variables.                 Factors such as age, race/ethnicity, and
employment trends work to influence the type of housing needed.
2.1.1    Population Growth Trends
In 1964, at the time of Lomita’s incorporation, the City’s population was approximately 15,000
residents. By the time of the 2000 Census, the population grew to 20,046 and, according to the
2010 Census, the City’s population increased slightly to 20,256 (Table 2).

The census data indicates that the City’s population was relatively stable between 1970 and
1980. During the decade following 1970, the City’s population actually declined. Since 2000,
the City’s population growth rate has been stagnant. From 2000 to 2010 Lomita experienced

an average rate of growth of just 0.1 percent annually. The variables affecting this relatively
low growth may be attributed to the lack of vacant land in the City and its aging population.
Similarly, the population of Los Angeles County experienced a growth rate of 0.3 percent per
year. Lomita’s population growth in the past decade is slightly less than that experienced in the
County as a whole.
Estimates of population growth in the City were developed by SCAG as part of the development
of the Integrated Growth Forecast for the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment. As shown in Table 3, the City is expected to experience limited
growth over the next 20 to 25 years.

2.1.2    Age Characteristics
One of the more significant indicators of population growth trends is a population’s age
characteristics. Table 5 charts the age characteristics of the City’s population between 2000
and 2010. As is evident from Table 5, the age cohorts that experienced the greatest amount of
decline were children under the age of nine and adult between 25 and 44, while the senior
population in the City grew significantly.
According to the Census, the median age of the City’s population was 35.5 years. By 2010, the
median age of the City’s population increased significantly to 39.6 years, which is a higher
median age than that reported for County residents (34.8 years). These statistics indicate that
the City’s population is older overall, compared to the age of the larger regional population.

Census data have been reformatted in Table 6 to depict the age statistics provided in Table 5
according to specific age categories (preschool-aged, school-aged, young adults, etc.). The
review of Table 6 underscores the trends discussed previously. The number of younger
children (under five years of age) decreased almost 20 percent while school-aged children (five
to 19 years of age) decreased about nine percent between 2000 and 2010. In contrast, the

2.1.3    Race and Ethnicity
Table 7 compares the 2000 and 2010 Census data that categorizes race and ethnicity for the
City’s population. In 2000, Lomita’s population was predominantly white (66 percent), with
approximately four percent Black, less than one percent American Indian/Eskimo, and about 12
percent Asian or Pacific Islander. By 2010, the white population decreased to 59 percent while
the Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Eskimo population, as well as people
of other races increased. The US Census classification for White persons included Hispanics
(Hispanics were classified as individuals with Spanish surnames in the 2000 and 2010 Census).
The City’s proportion of Hispanics increased from 26 percent in 2000 to 33 percent by 2010, as
indicated in Table 7. The Census allowed respondents to classify themselves as belonging to
two or more races for the first time. About 20 percent of the City’s population classified
themselves as belonging to “Other” races.

2.1.4    Educational Attainment
The educational attainment of Lomita’s population compared to California’s population over the
age of 25 is presented in Figure 1 below. Most Lomita residents have completed high school
and have some college experience. Lomita’s education attainment is comparable to the rest of
the state of California. California has a slightly higher proportion of residents with college
degrees while Lomita has slightly more residents with a high school diploma or equivalency.
Education attainment is strongly correlated with earnings potential which is linked to housing
choices. About 37 percent of Lomita residents have a college degree.

2.2      Household Characteristics
2.2.1    Household Characteristics
According to criteria established by the U.S. Census Bureau, a household consists of the
occupants of a housing unit. A household may consist of one individual, a family, or a number
of unrelated individuals. However, a “family household” is defined as a household consisting of
two or more individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption.
Table 9 lists the household characteristics for the City. As shown, the number of housing units
in the City experienced only slight increases between 1990 and 2010, consistent with the limited
increases in population during this same period. With the limited growth in population and
housing stock, average household size in the City remained stable between 2000 and 2010.

Smaller housing units are concentrated in the central portion of the City, while the larger units
(with correspondingly larger household sizes) are located at the northern and southern areas of
the City. According to the 2010 Census data, the average household size was smallest in
Census Tract 6701.00 (2.39 persons per household). Census tract 6700.02 had the largest
average household size of 2.71 persons (Table 10).

2.2.2    Household Income
For purposes of determining eligibility for housing assistance, the State Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) has established the following income groups based on the
Area Median Income (AMI) of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA):
        Extremely Low Income: 0-30 percent AMI
        Very Low Income: 31-50 percent AMI
        Low Income: 51-80 percent AMI
        Moderate Income: 81-120 percent AMI
        Above Moderate Income: >120 percent AMI
Collectively, households with Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low incomes are referred to as
lower income households.
Table 11 presents household income by income group based on ACS data. According to the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), 32 percent of the City’s households
were lower income, 17 percent were moderate income, and 51 were above moderate income.

Median Household Income
Household income is an important consideration when evaluating housing and community
development needs because lower income typically constrains a household's ability to secure
adequate housing or services. While housing choices, such as tenure (owning versus renting)
and location of residences are very much income-dependent, household size and type often
affect the proportion of income that can be spent on housing.
The median household income in Lomita was $61,327 in 2011. The City’s median income was
higher than the City of Los Angeles but lower than other neighboring cities Figure 2. It was
significantly lower than Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates.

2.3      Housing Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all residential dwelling units located
within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and
condition, tenure, vacancy rates, costs, and affordability are important in determining the
housing needs for the community. This section details Lomita’s housing stock characteristics in
an attempt to identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future
residents of the City.
2.3.1    Housing Unit Types
According to the 2010 Census, there were 8,412 housing units in the City in 2010. The 2007-
2011 ACS estimates that 49 percent of these units were classified as single-family detached
units (Table 12). Single-family “attached” units accounted for 11.8 percent of the City’s housing
stock. Approximately 5.8 percent of the units were mobile homes.

2.3.2     Housing Tenure
Housing tenure statistics for the City derived from the 1990 to 2010 Census are summarized in
Table 14. The percentage of owner-occupied units in the City has remained relatively stable
given the limited housing growth in the City.
City of Lomita                                                                                           Page 16

Vacancy
A vacancy rate is often a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and rental units are meeting
the current demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates of five to six percent for rental
housing and one to two percent for ownership housing are generally considered optimum,
where there is a balance between the demand and supply for housing. A higher vacancy rate
may indicate an excess supply of units and therefore price depreciation, while a low vacancy
rate may indicate a shortage of units and resulting escalation of housing prices. The 2010
Census data indicated that the overall vacancy rate in Lomita was 4.1 percent, inclusive of
second homes, and units rented or sold but not occupied. In 2010, 1.8 percent of units were
available for rent and 0.2 percent were for sale, indicating a very tight market.
2.3.3    Housing Condition
Table 15 depicts statistics on the age of the housing units in Lomita according to the 2007-2011
ACS. More than 40 percent of the housing units in the City were constructed prior to 1960,
comparable to the County as a whole (47 percent). The ACS shows that approximately 86
percent of the Lomita’s housing stock is more than 30 years old. The majority of these older
units are found near the central portion of the City, on scattered large lots, where newer units
are also located.

City of Lomita                                                                                    Page 17

An important indicator of the existing condition of the housing supply is the number of
structurally substandard units, or units needing rehabilitation or replacement. While the
majority of the housing units within the City are in relatively good condition, as the existing
stock ages, the number of housing units needing rehabilitation is expected to increase.
Residential neighborhoods between Pacific Coast Highway and Lomita Boulevard were
constructed on large lots between the 1940s and 1960s. They contain many of the City's older
housing units. Neighborhoods south of Pacific Coast Highway developed during the 1970s and
1980s, and consist largely of newer housing units on uniform-sized lots in subdivisions.
Based on the results of a previous housing conditions survey, approximately three percent (250
units) of the housing stock in the City might require minor repairs, another 0.5 percent (42
units) with major repair needs, and 0.1 percent (eight units) would be deemed substandard.
These substandard units will require major rehabilitation, and may be better replaced than
repaired.
2.4      Employment and Economic Characteristics
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 10,855 Lomita residents over the age of 16 were in the labor
force. Among these residents, 10,149 were employed with an unemployment rate of 6.4
percent. The State Employment Development Department reported a higher unemployment
rate of 7.5 percent as of February 2013.
Table 16 tabulates occupations of Lomita residents according to the 2007-2011 ACS, and
correlates the occupations with current (2012) wage scales in Los Angeles County. Among the
employed residents, about one-third held managerial and professional occupations that usually
command higher pays than service- and sales-oriented occupations. However, a large number
of Lomita residents were employed in lower-wage jobs with annual income less than $50,000,
below the median of all occupations.

The employment opportunities in Lomita are located mainly in the commercial retail and service
sectors found along the major roadways in the City. This limited employment base suggests
that most residents work outside the City in major employment centers in Torrance, Long
Beach, the Harbor, and the Carson-Compton area.
2.5      Housing Costs and Affordability
Housing affordability is a major consideration in providing suitable housing. The cost of housing
itself is not a problem, unless households in the area cannot find adequately sized units at an
affordable price. Affordability is defined as paying 30 percent or less of the gross monthly
income for housing, based on both State and federal standards.
2.5.1    Housing Costs
Rental Housing
According to data compiled from Craigslist.org shows that rental housing rates in Lomita are
among the lowest when compared to neighboring communities. The average rent for an
apartment in Lomita is $1,163 (Table 17), comparable to average rents at Carson ($1,025) and
Torrance ($1,120). Similarly, homes in Lomita are also renting at lower rates compared to
surrounding communities.

2.5.2    Affordability
Housing affordability can be estimated by comparing the affordable housing cost of owning or
renting a home in the City with the maximum affordable housing cost for households at
different income levels. Together, this information can show who can afford what size and type
of housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience overpayment and
overcrowding. Table 19 shows the affordable housing cost guidelines established in Section
50052.5 and 50053 of the California Health and Safety Code. The guidelines are based on the
median income calculated by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) income limits.
                               Table 19: Area Median Income Levels
                      Income Level                For Sale                  Rental

                      Very Low             30%   of 50% of AMI       30%   of 50% of AMI
                      Low                  30%   of 70% of AMI       30%   of 60% of AMI
                      Moderate             35%   of 110% of AMI      35%   of 110% of AMI
                      Note: Affordability Levels should be adjusted for household size.
Using the State income limits on maximum housing cost-to-income ratios, the maximum
affordable home rental and purchase prices are presented in Table 20.   
 
Based on the rental and home sale prices presented in Table 17 and Table 18, most extremely
low and very low income households would not be able to afford housing in Lomita. Some low
income households may be able to afford condominiums, but not single-family homes in Lomita.
Only small rental units are affordable to low income households. Moderate income households
are generally able to afford market rents and condominiums as well as smaller single-family
homes (Table 20).
Figure 3 illustrates the median wages for different occupations and the income needed to
purchase the median home (sale price based on Table 18) and median rental housing (based
on Table 17). The only occupation paying enough to own a home or rent an apartment in
Lomita is a management position. Professional occupations pay well enough to afford rent in
the City but a single-income household would not be able to purchase a home. Service oriented
positions generally cannot afford average rents in the City.

2.6      Housing Problems
2.6.1    Overpayment (Cost Burden)
Overpayment, also known as cost burden, is defined as households spending more than 30
percent of their gross household incomes on housing costs. HUD’s Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data provides information on housing overpayments by income
group (Table 21). Overall, 32 percent of households in the City experienced housing
overpayment between 2005 and 2009. However, almost two-thirds of the extremely low and
very low income households and more than half of the low income households overpaid for
housing.
Housing overpayment impacted certain groups more severely than others.                            Particularly,
overpayment was more prevalent among the following groups:
        Elderly homeowners with extremely low incomes
        Large family renters with low incomes
        Large family homeowners with extremely low and low incomes

   2.6.2    Overcrowding
   Overcrowding is typically defined as those housing units containing more than one person per
   room (including living and dining rooms but excluding bathrooms and kitchen), and units with
   more than 1.5 persons per room are considered as severely overcrowded.
   In 2000, 12.1 percent of the occupied units were overcrowded. Specifically, 19.2 percent of
   renter-occupied housing units and 4.7 percent of owner-occupied units were considered
   overcrowded. According to the ACS, overcrowding in Lomita has decreased. Table 22 provides
   an overview of overcrowding conditions by tenure between 2007 and 2011. Approximately 10
   percent of the renter-occupied units and four percent of the owner-occupied units were
   considered overcrowded.

   2.7      Special Needs Population
   Local housing elements must include an analysis of special housing needs. Under State law,
   special needs refer to those households that contain seniors, disabled, large households,
   female-headed households, homeless, and farmworkers.

   2.7.1    Senior Households
   In 2010, 2,532 persons, or 12.5 percent of the City’s population was 65 years of age and over
   (Table 5). Senior households are households with a member aged 65 or over. Their housing
   needs are often related to a disability and limited mobility, as well as their fixed incomes.
   Senior households are often unable to afford constant increases in housing rents and major
   repairs for housing. The 2010 Census reported 1,971 households in the City included one or
   more senior members, representing 24 percent of all City households. Specifically, 1,169
   households were headed by seniors (over 20 percent of City households).

Senior services in the area include the Adult Protective Services, H.E.L.P., South Bay Senior
Services, Always Best Care Senior Services, Long Term Care Ombudsman, Meals on Wheels, the
Elder Abuse Hotline, and Dial-a-Ride. The City also offers the Lifeline Personal Response
System to seniors. Additionally, senior residents can benefit from programs offered by the
City’s Parks and Recreation Department, including, the Lomita Goodtimers Senior Citizen Club
and weekly exercise classes.
2.7.1    Persons with Disabilities (Including Persons with Developmental Disabilities)
Disabled persons are identified as those with physical, visual, hearing, and mental disabilities.
Persons with disabilities have special housing needs. These needs include ramps instead of
stairs, elevators for units with two or more stories, modified bathrooms, wider doorways, lower
shelves, etc. Recent changes in State law require all new construction to be accessible to the
handicapped, but existing housing units are often not accessible or designed for the
handicapped.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, 1,933 residents with one or more disabilities were living in
Lomita, representing 9.5 percent of the City’s population. As shown in Table 24, cognitive
disabilities affected 82 percent of the youth age five to 17 years of age. For seniors and those
of working age (18-64 years of age), ambulatory, independent living, hearing, and cognitive
disabilities were equally prevalent.

A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
        Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
         impairments;
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;

        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
         major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d)
         mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-

         interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
         assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
         coordinated.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services (DDS) maintains statistics on
clients served by its Regional Centers. Data are aggregated at the ZIP Code level and
categorized by age and housing arrangement. According to DDS, 73 adult residents (age 22 to
64) from ZIP Code 90717 (Lomita) were being served by the Harbor Regional Center as of
November 2012. Among these adults, 37 were residing at community care facilities and 36
were living at home with parents or guardians. Another 91 children under 18 years of age
living at home with parents or guardians were also being served by the Harbor Regional
Center.3
Resources
Disabled services in the area include the Adult Protective Services, Disabled Resources Center of
Long Beach, South Bay Senior Services, Always Best Care Senior Services, Meals on Wheels, the
Elder Abuse Hotline, and Dial-a-Ride. The City also offers the Lifeline Personal Response
System to disabled persons with serious health problems.
2.7.3    Large Households
According to the HCD’s definition, the term "large household" refers to a household with five or
more persons. They often require larger dwelling units that may not be available at costs the
large household can afford. The increase in the number of household members does not
proportionately increase the earning power of the household. Often, it means an additional
dependent child. Thus, large households present a need for large but inexpensive housing
units in the City.
The number of large households in Lomita increased slightly from 762 households (9.5 percent)
in 2000 to 782 households (9.7 percent) in 2010. Among the 782 large households, 339 were
large owner-households and 443 were large renter-households.
Resources
Large households can benefit from family services supported by the City and in neighboring
areas including the Center for the Pacific-Asian Family, Family Crisis Center, Rainbow Services,
and the Torrance Family YMCA. Additionally, the City’s Parks and Recreation Department
supports a variety of activities, classes, and sports for youth of all ages.

  While there may be additional clients from other residential settings (such as foster homes, independent
living, and supported independent living), DDS suppresses the data when the number of clients in a
specific ZIP Code is fewer than 25.

2.7.4    Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households tend to have lower incomes because there is only one working adult
to support children. Female single-parent households are even more likely to be in poverty.
Based on census data, families with female heads-of-households decreased from 697 (8.7
percent) in 2000 to 558 (6.9 percent) in 2010. Of the 558 female-headed families, about 24
percent had incomes that were below poverty level. This number bears importance in relation
to social service needs, such as child care, recreation programs, and health care, which are of
special concern to these households.
Resources
Single-parent households can benefit from family services supported by the City and in
neighboring areas including the Center for the Pacific-Asian Family, Family Crisis Center,
Rainbow Services, and the Torrance Family YMCA. Additionally, the City’s Parks and Recreation
Department supports a variety of activities, classes, and sports for youth of all ages.
2.7.5    Farmworkers
Farmworkers are considered a special housing group because of the seasonal nature of their
work and the low wages for these employees. Farmworkers include employees of nurseries,
stables, and agricultural and livestock operations. Farmworkers generally have limited and
seasonal incomes, which present a need for affordable housing near their places of work on a
seasonal basis, rather than year-round. The 2007-2011 ACS indicated only 71 Lomita residents
were employed in Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing and Hunting/Mining industries. It is likely that
these residents were employed in occupations associated with landscaping nurseries,
landscaping services, stables, gardens, and equestrian centers in the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Resources
Given the limited number of workers in the agriculture industry, no special programs are
required to address farmworker housing needs.
2.7.6    Homeless Persons
Two categories of need should be considered in discussing the homeless: 1) transient housing
providing shelter only and usually on a nightly basis; and, 2) short-term housing, usually
including a more comprehensive array of social services to enable families to re-integrate
themselves into a stable housing environment (such as transitional and supportive housing).
Various circumstances that may lead to homelessness include the following:
        Single adult transients passing through the City on the way to some other destination;
        Seasonal and/or migrant homeless individuals seeking seasonal employment in the City;
        The chronically homeless, single adults, including non-institutionalized, mentally disabled
         individuals, alcohol and drug abusers, seniors with insufficient incomes, and others who
         voluntarily, or are forced, due to financial circumstances, to live on the streets.
        Minors who have run away from home;

         are in the process of searching for a home (single-parent families, mostly female-

The primary agency that deals with the issue of homelessness in the City is the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department, which serves Lomita. The County Sheriff's Department reports
about 12 homeless persons in Lomita and daily about 10 to 20 transients pass through the
City.4    Most of homeless persons in Lomita are men. There are no homeless families in the
City. The Sheriff’s Department has made attempts to take them to shelters but most refused
help. Homeless shelters in the area are listed in Table 25 and include facilities in San Pedro,
Wilmington, and Long Beach.

2.8      Affordable Housing
2.8.1    Inventory of Affordable Rental Housing and At-Risk Status
A number of publicly subsidized housing projects are located in Lomita. Lomita Kiwanis
Gardens, is a senior housing project with Section 202/811 financing and a Section 8 contract.
This project is at risk of conversion to market-rate housing between July 1, 2008 and June 30,
2018. In addition, the City has two permanent affordable housing projects.
Lomita Kiwanis Gardens
The Lomita Kiwanis Gardens project is located at 25109 Ebony Lane and has 67 assisted units.
Among these units, 17 units are studios and 50 units are one-bedroom units. The Section 8
contract for Lomita Kiwanis Gardens will expire on July 8, 2016.
Lomita Manor
Lomita Manor is owned by the City and is likely to remain affordable for the life of the project.
The Lomita Housing Authority oversees the management of this project. Lomita Manor was
constructed in 1985 as a senior housing project at 24925 Walnut Avenue. This development
provides 78 units for seniors. It has four two-bedroom units and the rest are one-bedroom
units.
Harbor Hills
Harbor Hills is a public housing project owned by the Los Angeles County Housing Authority.
This project is maintained as permanent affordable housing for families.

2.8.2    Preservation Options
One project, totaling 67 units for seniors and persons with disabilities, is considered to be at risk
of conversion to market-rate housing. To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the
City works to preserve the existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units.
Depending on the circumstances of at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve
or replace the units. Preservation options typically include: 1) transfer of project to non-profit
ownership; and 2) provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources. In
terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted multi-family
housing units. These options are described below:
City of Lomita                                                                                   Page 29
                                                                                     2013-2021 Housing Element
        Transfer of Ownership: Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit
         housing provider is generally one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units
         remain affordable for the long term. By transferring property ownership to a non-profit
         organization, low income restrictions can be secured indefinitely and the project would
         become potentially eligible for a greater range of governmental assistance. However, all
         at-risk projects in Lomita are nonprofit-owned already. Therefore, transferring the
         projects to nonprofit ownership is not an option.
        Rental Assistance: Rental subsidies using non-Section 8 funding sources can be used
         to maintain affordability of the 67 at-risk units. These rent subsidies could be structured
         to mirror the Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference between
         what tenants can pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what HUD
         estimates as the fair market rent (FMR) for the unit. In Los Angeles County, the 2013
         FMR was $911 for a studio unit and $1,101 for a one-bedroom unit.
         The feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent upon the availability of a sustainable
         funding source to make rent subsidies available and the willingness of the property
         owner to participate in the program. As indicated in Table 27, the total cost of
         subsidizing the rents at all 67 at-risk units is estimated at $20,763 per month or
         $249,156 annually.

        Construction of Replacement Units: The construction of new lower income housing
         units is a means of replacing the at-risk units should they be converted to market-rate
         units. The cost of developing housing depends upon a variety of factors, including
         density, size of the units (i.e. square footage and number of bedrooms), location, land
         costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average construction cost of $125,000 per
         unit, it would cost approximately $8.38 million (excluding land costs) to construct 67 new
         assisted units. Including land costs, the total cost to develop replacement units would be
         even higher.
Cost Comparisons

options. The annual costs of providing rental subsidies to preserve the 67 assisted units are

relatively low ($249,156); however, a sustainable funding source must be available. The option
of constructing 67 replacement units is also costly ($8.38 million, excluding land costs) and
constrained by a variety of factors, including growing scarcity of land zoned for residential use
and rising land costs.
Resources for Preservation
Available public and non-profit organizations with the capacity to preserve assisted housing
developments include Los Angeles County, State of California HCD, and various non-profit
developers. As a small city, Lomita has limited access to funding. Available resources are
discussed in detail in Section 4 of this Housing Element.

3.0 Constraints to Housing Development
There are many factors that may affect the type, timing, and cost of new housing construction.
The State of California Government Code that dictates the scope and contents of Housing
Elements require the Element to consider those variables that may constrain the development
of new housing. These “constraints” considered in this Element include the following:
        Non-Governmental or Market Constraints refers to economic factors (land values,
         construction costs, interest rates, etc.).
        Governmental Constraints refer to those actions undertaken by the government
         that may restrict or otherwise impede the development of new housing, especially
         affordable housing;
        Environmental Constraints refer to those environmental factors, such as limited
         available land, infrastructure, or hazards, that may affect the construction of new
         housing; and,
3.1      Non-Governmental or Market Constraints
Three market factors are cited by State law as a necessary part of the constraints analysis: 1)
land cost; 2) construction costs; and, 3) financing availability. The scope of the Lomita market
analysis has been enlarged to include an assessment of prevailing prices and rents. Housing
costs as a constraint on affordability must be examined in light of the rental and ownership
costs within the means of various economic segments.
3.1.1    Land Prices
Land costs are a major contributor to overall housing production prices. Land costs make up 10
to 30 percent of housing costs. Land in some areas costs more than others based on the
availability of services, neighborhood quality, distance to business and commercial centers as
well as other factors. Few vacant properties remain in the City. Only one vacant property was
listed for sale at about $99 per square foot for a single-family lot.5 In comparison, multi-family
and mixed use properties are probably more expensive on a per-square-foot basis but less
expensive on a per-unit basis.
3.1.2    Construction Costs
Construction costs include the materials and labor necessary to build the structure. These can
vary widely depending on size of units and the quality of amenities offered (such as grade of
carpeting and tiles, appliances and light fixtures, quality of cabinetry and woodwork, fireplaces,
etc.). “Soft costs” such as architectural fees, permits, and financing typically adds additional
costs to the development. For multiple-family attached units, construction costs are slightly

lower as developers can usually benefit from economies of scale with discounts for materials
and diffusion of equipment mobilization costs. Construction costs are relatively consistent
throughout Los Angeles County, and therefore high construction costs are a regional constraint
on housing development rather than a local constraint.
3.1.3    Financing Cost Trends
Home mortgage interest rates are a function of the national economy and personal credit
ratings. Low rates make housing purchase attractive to prospective homebuyers and decrease
monthly mortgages, because increased rates create differences in the monthly mortgage
payment by as much as a few hundred dollars for each interest point.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) mandates that lending institutions disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender and race of loan
applications. In 2011, 250 Lomita households applied for conventional home mortgage
financing and 80 households applied for financing backed by the government. Both types of
home purchase loans had comparable approval rates. However, home improvement loans and
refinancing had lower approval rates in comparison.

Foreclosures
The California housing market had been seriously impacted by foreclosures during past five
years. However, the number of homeowners entering the foreclosure process has decreased
sharply in recent months. According to DQNews.com, Notices of Default fell more than 51
percent during the first quarter of 2013. In April 2013, 27 homes in Lomita were listed in
foreclosure process, compared to 36 homes in May of 2008.6

3.2      Governmental Constraints
City ordinances, policies, and other regulations can impact the price and availability of housing
in Lomita. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other
local programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve constraints to housing
development. The following public policies can affect overall housing availability, adequacy,
and affordability.
3.2.1    Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element of the Lomita General Plan indicates the location and extent of current
and future residential land use in the City. The City of Lomita Zoning Ordinance implements the
land use element of the General Plan and the City’s Zoning Map delineates permissible
residential land uses by parcel. Each basic residential zone is described according to: residential
use permitted; minimum lot size; density; parking requirements; and, minimum dwelling unit
size. Other land use controls pertain to second units, manufactured housing, and mobile home
parks.
Land use and development within the City of Lomita is governed by the Lomita General Plan.
The General Plan’s Land Use Element indicates the location and extent of permitted land uses
and development within the City. The Land Use Element provides for the following residential
land use designations, with the implementing zoning district in parenthesis:
        Agricultural (A1): This designation applies to areas that are lower-density in
         character and the keeping of animals is permitted. This land use designation
         corresponds to those areas zoned A-1, and allows development intensities of up to 8.7
         units per acre. The maximum population density is 22 persons per acre.
        Low-Density Residential (R1): This designation applies to areas of the City that are
         developed with single-family residential land uses. The allowable development intensity
         is 5.8 to 8.7 units per acre. The maximum population density is 22 persons per acre.
        Medium-Density Residential (RVD): This designation applies to sections of the City
         that are developed with multi-family residential land uses and trailer parks. The
         allowable development intensity for this category is 8.2 to 19.8 units per acre. The
         maximum population density is 50 persons per acre.
        High-Density Residential (RVD): This designation applies to sections of the City
         that are developed with multi-family residential land uses and trailer parks. The
         allowable development intensity for this category is 19.8 to 43.6 units per acre. The
         maximum population density is 110 persons per acre.
        Mixed-Use (MU): This designation is an overlay zone for portions of Narbonne
         Avenue and Lomita Boulevard. The designation allows multi-family developments at 22

         intensity, expressed in Floor Area Ratio (FAR), for commercial development in the
         Mixed-Use zone is 1.0 to 2.0.
One of the more significant constraints to the development of substantial numbers of new
housing units is related to the availability of land to accommodate such development. As
indicated in the previous sections of this Element, the City has been fully developed for a
number of years. The City has a total land area of 1,261 acres, with approximately 980 acres
of land actually developed and the remainder (281 acres) devoted to streets, public rights-of
way, and easements. Of the total land area available for development, approximately 55
percent is developed as residential.
3.2.2    Residential Development Standards
Development standards and required on- and off-site improvements for dwelling units influence
the cost of housing. The Zoning Ordinance regulates building height, minimum lot sizes,
maximum lot coverage, and parking and yard setbacks. The residential development standards
in the City are summarized in Table 29. The standards are generally the same among the
different zones, except for the building density, open space, and parking requirements for the
RVD zone (requires guest parking spaces). While these restrictions add to building costs, they
promote public health and safety in residential developments.
Although the General Plan High Density Residential designation and corresponding RVD-1,000
zoning district provide for development up to 43.6 units per acre, this General Plan designation
and the zoning district were created to recognize existing development on two properties only.
Such intensity of development is out of character with the rest of the community and no other
sites in the City are zoned RVD-1,000.
The development standards mandated by the Zoning Code are provided in Table 29. Zoning
standards including building height, density, lot coverage and setbacks are given in the table
and discussed below. The standards are established to provide guidance in development and
ensure safety as well as aesthetic appeal.

Lot Standards
Minimum residential lot sizes range from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet and minimum lot depth
limits are the same throughout the three residential development zones. Although many lots in
Lomita are smaller than the required minimum lot size they still contain residential dwelling
units. Also, many parcels have only two- to three-foot side yard setbacks and 15- to 18-foot
front yard setbacks. The City allows these parcels to remain non-conforming and allows small
renovations on these lots. Any new development is required to comply with the current zoning
standards.
Residential Density
Because Lomita is a built out city within a major metropolitan area, allowable residential
densities are mixed and allow for high density development. The Agricultural (A-1) Zone allows
up to 8.7 dwelling units per acre while the variable density sites (RVD) allow up to 43.6 dwelling
units per acre. This high density zone (RVD-1000) allows up to 43.6 dwelling units per acre as
well as minimum lot size of 1,000 sq. ft.
City of Lomita                                                                                   Page 36

Lot Coverage
The City has established a maximum lot coverage of 60 percent within all residential zones.
The combined maximum lot coverage and minimum lot size could make achieving the allowable
density difficult on smaller lots. The larger the lot, the more likely it will be to achieve the
maximum allowable density.
Yard Setbacks
Figure 4 illustrates the current minimum setback requirements for single-family dwellings
(summarized in Table 29) and accessory buildings. The minimum rear setback is 20 feet.
Accessory buildings can be located within the rear setback, but must maintain a minimum of six
feet between buildings. The driveway must maintain a width of 12 feet and the vehicle back up
area is 25 feet. In some cases, these requirements determine the setback. Accessory buildings
must be at least three feet from the rear property line and an interior side property line. A
minimum setback of five feet is required if a dwelling exists or would be permitted within 10
feet on an adjoining lot. On a corner lot, the exterior side yard setback is 10 feet and a garage
must be located a minimum of 20 feet from the side property line.
                               Figure 4: Setback Requirements
Height Limits
The City has established a height limit of 27 feet, or two stories, for residential zones, except
for an area south of Pacific Coast Highway, where the limit is 16 feet (unless a height variation
permit is granted) when there is a significant view. The majority of multi-family projects in the
City are two to three stories above grade with subterranean parking. To encourage affordable
housing development, the City will consider a height variance to exceed the 27-foot/two-story
City of Lomita                                                                            Page 37

limit in residential zones. To facilitate mixed use development, where the majority of the City’s
future growth is expected to occur, the City revised the Zoning Ordinance in 2011 to remove
the two-story limit. This change in the height limit will allow a developer to utilize semi-
subterranean parking in the development. As a result, residential uses (mixed-use) in the C-G
and D-C zones can reach 35 feet. As part of the CUP for the mixed use development, the
development can also request to exceed the 35-foot height limit.
Open Space
Open space requirements are included to ensure that sufficient privacy and open space are
afforded to enhance and maintain the quality of life for residential neighborhoods. These
requirements mitigate noise from traffic, neighbors and other noise generating uses that affect
the quality of life. The City has established a minimum of 500 feet of open space per multi-
family unit. Open space requirements include both common and private open space.
Parking Standards
Lomita’s parking standards require a minimum of two garage spaces for all housing types with
one to three bedrooms and three garage spaces for larger single-family homes. Multi-family
housing requires similar parking with the addition of guest parking spaces. Providing garage
parking for multi-family units is costly and may be difficult for developers.

          Residential Zone                                 Parking Requirement

To facilitate mixed use development within the MUO, the City revised the parking standards for
Mixed Use development in 2011 to reduce the parking requirements: one space for a studio
unit; two spaces per unit for other unit sizes; and one guest parking space per four units.
Developers of affordable and senior housing who are eligible for a density bonus pursuant to
Government Code Section 65919-65918 are eligible to use parking standards established by
State law. The following maximum parking standards for eligible affordable and senior housing
projects include guest and handicap parking:
        Zero to one bedroom: 1 parking space
        Two to three bedrooms: 2 parking spaces
        Four or more bedrooms: 2.5 parking spaces
Further reductions in parking standards are available as incentives under the City’ Density
Bonus program.

Density Bonus
Density bonuses, together with the incentives and/or concessions, can result in a lower average
cost of land per dwelling unit thereby making the provision of affordable housing more feasible.
SB 1818 (enacted 2005) and SB 435 (enacted 2006) changed the requirements of State law
regarding the mandatory provision of density bonuses, incentives and concessions to affordable
housing developers that meet certain criteria. A density bonus up to 35 percent over the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning district is available
to developers who provide affordable housing as part of their projects. Developers of
affordable housing are also entitled to at least one concession or incentive. In 2008, the City
adopted a density bonus ordinance to comply with SB 1818 (enacted 2005) and SB 435
(enacted 2006). The density bonus ordinance specifies the types of regulatory concessions and
incentives to be offered consistent with State law.
Conclusion
The City recognizes the importance of the MUO as a key strategy for accommodating growth in
the future. To facilitate mixed use developments in the MUO, the City revised the Zoning
Ordinance in 2011 to remove the two-story limit and reduce parking requirements for small
units. The City tested these development standards on a 30,000-square foot site. At 22 units
per acre, this site would allow 15 units plus the required commercial component. With the
revised parking standards, all 15 units (with a combination of one- and two-bedroom units) can
be accommodated, allowing the project to achieve the maximum permitted density of 22 units
per acre.

3.2.3    Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multi-family rental
housing, factory built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, transitional housing,
supportive housing, single-room occupancy units, and farmworker housing.                       Table 31
summarizes Lomita’s current provisions for a variety of housing types.

Single Family
Single-family residences are permitted in the A-1 and R-1 zones; they are not permitted in RVD
zone as that zone is reserved for higher density housing.
Multi-Family
Multi-family housing is only permitted RVD zone. It requires additional guest parking as well as
open space.
Mobile Homes
Mobile homes or factory built housing on permanent foundation and meeting the City standards
are permitted where single-family homes are permitted (in the A-1, R-1, and RVD zones).
Mobile home parks are classified as non-conforming; however, they: 1) do not have
amortization schedules; 2) may remain in residential use indefinitely; and 3) can be altered or
rehabilitated.
Second Units
Recent amendment to State law requires that a local jurisdiction review and approve a second
unit using a ministerial procedure if the application meets pre-established conditions. While the
local jurisdiction may tailor these conditions to meet local needs, it may not adopt conditions
that are more stringent than those outlined in State law. Second Units are allowed in the A-1,
R-1, and RVD zones if the following criteria are met:
        The lot is developed with one single-family residence and its required parking;
        The applicant is the owner-occupant of the existing residence;
        Both primary and second units remain permanently under one ownership;

        Second unit is detached from the main unit and has the same height limits as other
         accessory structures;
        Second unit cannot exceed 1,200 square feet or meet the requirements of an efficiency
         unit, whichever is greater;
        The second unit must meet all required yard setbacks (refer to Figure 4);
        The maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is 0.6:1.0 for all primary and accessory structures
         combined; and
        One garage parking space per bedroom for the second unit, except when the unit is for
         a senior person 62 years of age or older
The second dwelling unit ordinance has been successful in Lomita with the construction of 14
secondary units between 2008 and 2012 (an average of three units per year). Staff prepared a
handout “What you need to know about second units” and have made it readily available to the
public to promote the program. Applications are reviewed administratively and City staff simply
works with applicants to revise plans in order to meet the City’s requirements.
Emergency Shelters
In June 2013, the City revised its Zoning Ordinance to permit emergency shelters by right in the
M-C (Light Manufacturing and Commercial) zone. The M-C zone is primarily developed with
lower intensity uses. A total of 51 parcels in the City are zoned M-C; 30 of these have an
improvement-to-land value ratio of less than 1.0, a typical indicator of underutilization. Median
year of construction for the M-C properties is 1963, an age when many buildings are outdated
and/or require substantial improvements to maintain their viability.
Transitional Housing
Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless
individuals and families to permanent housing. Transitional housing can take several forms,
including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multiple-family apartments and
typically offers case management and support services to return people to independent living
(usually between six and 24 months). In June 2013, the City revised the Zoning Ordinance to
consider transitional housing as a residential use of property and therefore permitted in zones
that allow residential uses, subject to the same standards as those residential uses in the same
zone.
Supportive Housing
The California Health and Safety Code (50675.14 [b]) defines supportive housing as housing
with no limit on length of stay that is occupied by a target population as defined in subdivision
(d) of Section 53260, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive
housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his
or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. In June 2013, the City revised
the Zoning Ordinance to consider supportive housing as a residential use of property and
therefore permitted in zones that allow residential uses, subject to the same standards as those
residential uses in the same zone.
Single-Room Occupancy
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen

and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many
modern SROs have one or the other. The Lomita Zoning Ordinance does not currently address
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units.7 The City amended the Zoning Ordinance to specify SRO
as a conditionally permitted use in the RVD zone. Conditions for approval relate only to the
performance of the facility, such as parking, management, and required unit amenities.
Residential Care Homes
The City’s Municipal Code defines adult residential care as any adult home, group care and
similar facility which provides 24 hours per day nonmedical care and supervision to adults.
Residential care homes for six or fewer persons are permitted in all residential zones, except the
RVD zone. Small residential care facilities must be permitted as standard residential uses in
residential zones.
Large residential care homes for seven to 12 persons require approval of a Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) in all residential zones. Large residential care facilities for the elderly for seven to
15 persons require a CUP in the A-1 and R-1 zones. CUP applications must be filed with the
Planning Commission. Large residential care homes and residential care facilities for the elderly
are evaluated according to the following criteria:
        The residential care units must be the sole dwelling on a parcel and cannot be within
         300 feet of another parcel with a residential care units;
        City business license must be obtained as well as necessary social service department
         permits and a fire permit;
        If the property is within 30 feet of a residential use a six-foot high block wall shall be
         constructed;
        The owner of the property must be the care provider or a notarized authorization is
         required.
The Commission may also require additional features such as special yards, fencing,
landscaping, street dedications, parking facilities and signage in addition to a number of other
options.
Agricultural Workers
Pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and Safety Code),
employee housing for agricultural workers consisting of no more than 36 beds in a group
quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a single-family or household is permitted by
right in an agricultural land use designation. Therefore, for properties that permit agricultural
uses by right, a local jurisdiction may not treat employee housing that meets the above criteria
any differently than an agricultural use.
Furthermore, any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall
be deemed a single-family structure with a residential land use designation, according to the
Employee Housing Act. Employee housing for six or fewer persons is permitted where a single-
family residence is permitted.
7
  With high housing costs, many communities in California are exploring the use of SRO to fulfill the
affordable housing needs of certain segments of the community, such as seniors, students and single-
workers.
City of Lomita                                                                                Page 42

The 2007-2011 ACS indicated only 71 Lomita residents were employed in Agriculture/Forestry/
Fishing and Hunting/Mining industries. Pursuant to State law, farm employee housing and farm
labor camps are permitted by right in the City’s A-1 zone. Farm labor camps are viewed as an
incidental use permitted in the zone and subordinate to the primary use of the property. In
addition, single-family homes are permitted in the A-1 zone.
Mixed Use
Horizontal or vertical mixed residential/commercial uses are conditionally permitted via the
Mixed Use Overlay in the C-G zone along the portions of Lomita Boulevard and Narbonne
Avenue. Amended in September 2006, the Overlay permits residential uses (such as
apartments, townhomes/ condominiums, and live/work spaces) up to 22 units per acre. Mixed-
use projects have a height limit of two stories and 35 feet in the C-G zone. A developer can
apply for an increased height limit as part of the CUP process. To facilitate mixed use
development, the City revised the Zoning Ordinance in 2011 to remove the two-story limit and
to reduce parking requirements: one space for a studio unit; two spaces per unit for other unit
sizes; and one guest parking space per four units.
3.2.4    Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Housing options for persons with disabilities are often limited. The Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) came into effect in 1990. Multi-family housing built prior to 1990 does not typically
include accessible units on the ground floor. With limited multi-family construction between
1990 and 2008, few rental housing units in Lomita are accessible. ADA also does not cover
single-family homes. Rehabilitation to accommodate the accessibility needs of disabled
residents is needed, particularly to the older single-family housing stock. Therefore, it is
important that City’s codes, policies and regulations are free of undue constraints to encourage
rehabilitation of the existing housing stock and to comply with ADA requirements.
Land Use Controls
Small family homes, foster family homes, adult day care and adult residential facilities providing
care to six or fewer adults are permitted by right in the A-1 and R-1 zones. They will also be
permitted by right in the RVD zone following the Zoning Ordinance amendment.             Residential
care facilities for seven to 12 elderly persons are also permitted with a CUP in the A-1 and R-1
zones. Large family and adult care homes for up to 12 children/adults providing 24-hour care
are permitted in the RVD zone subject to specific conditions that relate to compliance with the
following:
        300-foot distance requirement between similar uses
        Parking requirements
        City business license
        Filing all necessary permits and licenses from the Department of Social Services with the
         City
        Proof of Fire Department's approval
        Construction of a six-foot tall block wall along the property line when the outdoor play
         area is located within 30 feet of a residential use and/or structure
        Compliance with City Noise Ordinance

According to the State Department of Social Services, there are over 11 residential care facilities
located in Lomita as of April 2013. These include:
        Adult Residential Care – 5 facilities serving 22 people
        Residential Care for the Elderly – 6 facilities serving 42 adults
Most of these facilities are small and serve six or fewer people.
Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing to qualify as “family” by
the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family”
that limits the number of and differentiates between related and unrelated individuals living
together may illegally limit the development and siting of group homes for persons with
disabilities but not for housing families that are similarly sized or situated.8 In December 2006,
the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to remove the definition of family.
Reasonable Accommodations Procedure
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct
local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications or exceptions) in
their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary
to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback requirement so that a paved path of
travel can be provided to residents who have mobility impairments. Another example would be
to waive the maximum lot coverage requirement may be a reasonable accommodation to allow
a disabled person to create a bedroom on the ground floor.
The City of Lomita has adopted a formal procedure for reasonable accommodations request in
Article 35 of the Municipal Code. Applications must include the current use of the property in
question, a description of the accommodation required and the basis for the claim that the
applicant is considered disabled, a detailed explanation of why the accommodation is
reasonable and necessary to afford the applicant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a
dwelling in the city. Completed applications submitted to the Community Development
Department must be reviewed in 30 days. Applications are reviewed based on the following
criteria:
        Accommodation is reasonable considering the nature of the applicant’s disability, the
         surrounding land uses and the rules, standard, policy, or practice from which relief is
         sought;
        The accommodation will allow the applicant equal opportunity to enjoy and use a
         dwelling;
8
  California court case (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981,
etc.) have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more
persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of
unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a
manner that distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any
legitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a
municipality and therefore violated rights of privacy under the California Constitution.
City of Lomita                                                                                  Page 44

        The accommodation will have only incidental economic or monetary benefits to the
         applicant and the primary purpose of the accommodation is not to assist with real estate
         speculation or excess profit taking;
        The accommodation does not create a substantial adverse impact on surrounding land
         uses, or a public nuisance, that cannot be reasonably mitigated;
        The accommodation is reasonably feasible considering the physical attributes of the
         property and structures;
        There are no alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of
         benefit to the applicant, while minimizing adverse impacts on surrounding land uses and
         lessening the financial and/or administrative burden on the city;
        In the case of a determination involving a one-family dwelling, whether the household
         would be considered a single housekeeping unit if it were not using special services that
         are required because of the disabilities of the residents;
        The requested accommodation does not impose an undue financial or administrative
         burden on the city; and
        The requested accommodation does not require a fundamental alteration in the nature
         of a program.
Within 30 days of receipt of the application, the applicant, as well as any additional interested
parties, will be provided written notice of the Community Development Department Director’s
decision. Any person can make a request for a Director’s hearing within 10 days of the notice
being mailed. If there is no request for a hearing the decision is final. The Director will conduct
a hearing within 30 days of the request and review the application for reasonable
accommodation and issue a decision within five days of the hearing. This decision is final
without a timely appeal to the Planning Commission.
Building Codes
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and
adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. California Government Code
Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in multifamily buildings
without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or more condominium units
are subject to the following building standards for persons with disabilities:
        The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted
         by site impracticality tests.
        At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
         served by an accessible route.
        All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
         route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
         may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
         bedrooms, or hallways.
        Common use areas shall be accessible.
        If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.

No unique Building Code restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the City’s Municipal Code,
California Code of Regulations, California Building Standards Code, and the Federal Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building and Safety Department as a
part of the building permit submittal.
Conclusion
The City will update the Zoning Ordinance to allow small residential care homes by right in the
RVD zone. The Zoning Ordinance was amended to address the provision of emergency
shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and SRO units. Given the presence of small
residential care homes in the City, there are no significant constraints to housing for persons
with disabilities.
3.2.5    Fees and Taxes
Permit processing fees, development impact fees, and construction taxes can increase the cost
of housing development in Lomita. While City fees and taxes offset the cost of development,
they could serve to constrain housing production, especially production of affordable units.
Permit Processing Fees
The schedule of planning and development fees in Lomita is provided in Table 32. The City
contracts with the County of Los Angeles to provide plan checking services. Plan checking fees
are set by the County of Los Angeles to cover the costs of services. The City has not adjusted
its fees since October 2007.

Construction Taxes
The City also charges a development tax for all new construction. This tax is equal to $1,000
for every new housing unit or for every 5,000 square feet of commercial/industrial building floor
area. Although second units and affordable units are subject to this tax, second unit
construction has been active in the City, with 14 secondary units between 2008 and 2012 (an
average of three units per year). Therefore, the construction tax does not appear to be a
constraint or deterrent to second unit construction. The City will consider waiving the
construction tax for affordable units as an incentive for affordable housing development. This
tax has not increased since 1990. Affordable housing developments for seniors or persons with
disabilities owned and operated by non-profit agencies may be exempt from this tax.
Development Impact Fees
In addition, the City also charges various fees to offset the impact of new development on
public facilities. These include:
        Quimby Act Fees: equivalent to 1.5 acres per 1,000 population
        Park and Recreation Facilities Tax: $300 per unit
City of Lomita                                                                           Page 47

        Water Facility fees:
         o 1 percent of building valuation for single-family residences
         o 1.25 percent of building valuation for duplex
         o 1.5 percent of building valuation of apartments (two-story maximum)
         o 2 percent of building valuation of apartments (three-story and over)
These taxes and fees can increase the cost of housing and may influence the economic
feasibility of affordable housing projects. There is also a Road Improvement Fee. For
construction, addition and/or improvement of structures exceeding $35,000, road improvement
fees are required to provide curb gutter and sidewalk.
When all development fees are considered for a typical development in Lomita, the average
total development fee is about $16,282 for a single-family unit and $14,266 for a multi-family
unit (Table 34). A 2012 National Impact Fees Survey surveyed 37 jurisdictions in California.9
The study reports average impact fees of $31,014 per single-family unit and $18,807 per multi-
family unit in California. The City of Lomita’s development impact fees are well below the
statewide average.

Conclusion
Overall, the City of Lomita planning fees and development fees are low comparing to
neighboring jurisdictions. Like all jurisdictions in the State, the City also charges building permit
fees. However, the City does not differentiate the permit fees for single-family versus multi-
family units. Fees in Lomita are not a constraining factor to residential development in the
community.

3.2.6    Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence of existing
improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed development. In general, most
residential areas in Lomita are served with infrastructure. The Zoning Ordinance holds any
person constructing any building, parking lot of developing any area responsible to pay for a
number of improvements including: curbs, gutters, sidewalks, paving and drainage structures.
Private streets widths must be wide enough to meet the standards established by the Los
Angeles County Fire Department requirements. The City uses the standards and codes adopted
by the County of Los Angeles.
3.2.7    Permits and Processing Times
Residential projects in the City are reviewed by the Community Development Department and
the County Building and Safety Department. Single-family residential uses are permitted by
right in the A-1 and R-1 zoning designations. Development of a single unit is reviewed at the
staff level only; no public hearing is required. Multi-family and condominium projects are
allowed in the RVD zones; multi-family projects (new construction) require site plan review by
the Planning Commission. Multi-family projects and other residential projects requiring a
variance must also be reviewed by the Planning Commission.
Conditional Use Permits
The City uses the CUP process to control the location and operation of certain types of land
uses to ensure public health, safety, or general welfare, or to mitigate/avoid material detriment
to the property of other persons in the vicinity. The Lomita Zoning Ordinance sets forth specific
conditions that the Planning Commission may consider which are discussed in the residential
care homes section above.
A CUP requires a public hearing and an application fee. The CUP fee charged by the City of
Lomita is significantly lower than most surrounding communities. Typically, a project requiring
a CUP takes about two to three months in processing time. In comparison, a project requiring
only a Site Plan Review takes about six weeks. The CUP process potentially extends the
timeframe by four to six additional weeks. This delay is not excessive and therefore should not
impact the feasibility of a project.
Variances
Variances permit alterations of development standards as they apply to particular uses when
practical difficulties develop from the strict interpretation and enforcement of zoning codes.
Zone variances may be granted, or variances may be required in particular cases for building
setbacks, height, bulk and density, parking, landscaping, walls, and fencing and business
operation. A variance can take approximately two months to process.
Zone Change
In some cases it is allowable to change the zoning on a particular property. Zone changes are
allowed only when the change will not be materially detrimental to the property of other
persons located in the vicinity. The zone change is applicable to the subject property only.
City of Lomita                                                                            Page 49
                                                                           2013-2021 Housing Element
Height Variation Permit
A Height Variation Permit is required for any residential property south of Pacific Coast Highway
proposing new construction, or addition to an existing home exceeding 16 feet above natural
grade. The process initially requires a completed application form, construction plans and all
applicable fees paid.
If less than five percent of those notified object within 14 days of notification, and the Planning
Department finds that the proposed construction is designed and situated in such a manner as
to minimize view obstruction and meets all other zoning and subdivision requirements of the
City, the Community Development Director may approve the application. If objections are
received from five percent or more of those notified, a public hearing will be conducted before
the Planning Commission.
Subdivisions
Any subdivision of land into four lots or units or less requires a parcel map and any subdivision
of five lots or units or more requires a tract map prepared by a registered civil engineer.
Tentative maps are first submitted to the Community Development Department with application
form and required fees are submitted to the Regional Planning Department of the County of Los
Angeles. Comments and corrections required by the County or other departments or agencies
will be provided. The tentative map is then scheduled for Planning Commission and City
Council for approval. The Commission and Council will review the tentative map for consistency
with the applicable City land development regulations. Final maps are to be completed within
the time frame allowed, and are again scheduled for City Council approval.
A project before the Planning Commission takes approximately 1.5 months for development
approval and an additional 2.5 months with the City Council. After approval by the Commission,
the project goes through the plan check process with the Building and Safety Department. Plan
check and final building permit approval takes approximately two to three weeks. Subdivision
projects usually take more time to process, and could take six to nine months before planning
permits are obtained.
Site Plan Review
Site plan review is established in order to provide a visual and factual document that may be
used to determine and control the physical layout, design or use of a lot or parcel of land,
buildings or structures. The City’s Zoning Ordinance has established specific requirements for
the site plan review and basis for approval or disapproval as follows:
        Compliance with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
        Suitability of the site for the particular use or development intended, and the total
         development, including the application of prescribed development standards, shall be so
         arranged as to avoid traffic congestion, insure the protection of public health, safety and
         general welfare, prevent adverse effects on neighboring property and shall be in general
         accord with all elements of the General Plan.
        Suitable and functional development design, but it is not intended that such approval be
         interpreted to require a particular style or type or architecture.
City of Lomita                                                                               Page 50

                                                                         2013-2021 Housing Element
The City has a variety of housing types, including single-family homes, second units,
duplex/triplex developments, low- to medium-density condominiums/townhomes, medium- to
high-density apartments, and senior apartments and condos. Site plan review is conducted
concurrently as part of development approval, and does not add to the permit processing time.
The City does not have specific design review procedures.
Development permit review is necessary to ensure projects do not degrade health, safety, and
welfare in Lomita. Permits and lengthy processing times discourage construction by increasing
the time and costs associated with gaining permit approval. The three-month to nine-month
permit processing in Lomita is relatively short compared to other cities, and is not considered an
undue constraint to housing development.
3.2.8    Codes and Code Enforcement
The City of Lomita adopted the County of Los Angeles codes by reference in the Municipal
Code. The County adopted the 2007 California Building Standards Code, which includes the
2006 International Building Code, in 2008. The 2007 California Building Standards
Code establishes standards and requires inspections at various stages of construction to ensure
code compliance. The California Building Standards Code also requires new residential
construction to comply with the federal American with Disabilities Act. Although these standards
and the time required for inspections increase housing production costs and may impact the
viability of rehabilitation of older properties which are required to be brought up to current code
standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-efficient
housing.   The codes serve to protect residents from hazards and risks, and are not considered
to be undue constraints to housing production. 
3.2.9    Infrastructure
Development on existing undeveloped land or redevelopment to higher residential densities
would not require the provision of new infrastructure systems, but may create a need for
upgrades to existing storm drain lines, water lines, sewer lines, streets, telephone lines, and
other infrastructure. These upgrades will add to development costs, which could render
housing units unaffordable to lower-income households without subsidy. The upgrade of the
water system and other infrastructure serving Lomita is ongoing as part of the City’s Capital
Improvement Program (CIP).
3.2.10 State Tax Policies and Regulations
Proposition 13
Proposition 13, a voter initiative that limits increases in property taxes except where there is a
transfer of ownership, may have increased the cost of housing. The initiative forced local
governments to pass on more of the costs of housing development (e.g., construction of
infrastructure and community facilities) to developers who use Mello Roos as a way to offset
facilities and improvement costs.
City of Lomita                                                                              Page 51

Federal and State Environmental Protection Regulations
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs, resulting from fees charged by local
government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analyses and from
delays caused by mandated public review period, also add to the cost of housing. However, the
presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental quality
for Lomita residents.
3.3      Environmental Constraints
A number of environmental factors in Lomita affect the character and density of development in
the City. These include natural resources and hazards and safety concerns. Water supply and
soils in the City as well as earthquake and flood risks are addressed.
3.3.1    Natural Resources
Water Supply
Groundwater resources in Lomita consist of aquifers and aquicludes, as found in the Los
Angeles groundwater basin within the Los Angeles coastal plain. The City of Lomita is located
on the southern end of the Torrance plain which is underlain by water-bearing sediments that
form a complex system of interlayered aquifers and aquicludes. The City is within the West
Coast groundwater basin. The groundwater is estimated by the Los Angeles County Safety
Element to be approximately 30 feet from the ground level at the City and the surrounding
area. This indicates that the area is conducive to perched water conditions. The City is in the
process of adopting a Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance which requires water conservation
practices in landscape irrigation for new public and private developments.
Soil
The soil types throughout the City of Lomita vary from a slight to moderate erosion hazard and
are not considered a housing hazard.
3.3.2    Hazards/Safety Concerns
Seismic
The City of Lomita is located within the rolling plain, just northeast of the Palos Verdes Hills.
This area is bounded by two of the most active faults in southern California, the Palos Verdes
fault on the south and Newport-Inglewood fault on the northeast. The Palos Verdes Fault zone
runs along the northeastern section of the Palos Verdes Hills and crosses the southern tip of the
City of Lomita. The Newport-Inglewood fault is located five miles from the City. The Torrance-
Wilmington fault is also located northeast of the City.
These faults have the potential for generating earthquakes that would result in strong ground
shaking and perhaps even surface rupture in the City. Strong shaking can result in liquefaction,
landslides or structural damage. Liquefaction may occur when loose, unconsolidated, saturated
fine-to medium-grained sandy soils are subjected to ground vibrations during a seismic event.
City of Lomita                                                                           Page 52
                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element
Development in the City of Lomita may be constrained by the presence of the Palos Verdes
Fault in the southern section of the City and the presence of liquefaction hazards. Projects to
be located on areas with geologic constraints would require special engineering design in order
to reduce and prevent risks to future residents. These design considerations may limit the
density of housing in these areas and/or add to housing costs.
Geological Hazards
While numerous landslides have occurred in the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the southern
portion of Lomita consists of hillside areas, a review of the Los Angeles County Safety Element
shows that no definite or probable landslide hazards exist within Lomita. Also, the hillside areas
are largely developed, paved and landscaped. Thus, landslide potential is limited.
Flooding
A 100-year flood event is that flood with a probably of occurring once every 100 years, or that
has a 1/100 chance of occurring in any one year. The City of Lomita is located in an area
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps as
Zone C, where minimal flood hazards exist. Also, dam inundation hazards do not exist in the
City since there are no large dams or reservoirs located near the City, except the Palos Verdes
Reservoir. Dam failure and potential inundation from this reservoir will lead to localized
flooding east and southeast of the reservoir and will not affect Lomita.
These environmental conditions are typical to communities in the South Bay region. No
significant constraints exist to impede residential or mixed use development in the City of
Lomita during this planning period. Adequate water supply and sewage treatment capacity
exist to serve the City’s projected housing needs for the planning period.

4.0 Housing Resources
The extent of housing needs in a community often far exceeds the resources available. The
City of Lomita must pull together limited resources and use them efficiently in order to address
the current and projected housing needs of Lomita residents. This section of the Housing
Element provides an overview of resources available to the City.
4.1      Residential Development Potential
4.1.1    Regional Housing Needs Allocation
Pursuant to State law, every jurisdiction in the State has a responsibility to accommodate a
share of the projected housing needs in its region. The process of allocating regional housing
needs to individual jurisdictions is called the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The
RHNA for jurisdictions in the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region was
developed for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle and the City of Lomita has been assigned a
RHNA of 47 units, divided into the following income categories as follows:
        Extremely Low Income (up to 30 percent AMI)10 – 6 units (13 percent)
        Very Low Income (31 to 50 percent of AMI) – 6 units (13 percent)
        Low Income (51-80 percent AMI) – 7 units (15 percent)
        Moderate Income (81-120 percent AMI) – 8 units (17 percent)
        Above Moderate Income (>120 percent AMI) – 20 units (47 percent)
4.1.2    Availability of Land Suitable for Residential Development
This section provides an inventory of land supply in Lomita. Under present law, the Housing
Element must include a listing of land suitable for residential development, including vacant
sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of
zoning and public facilities and services to those sites.
Realistic Capacity
For the purpose of this Housing Element, calculations of realistic capacity assume that
properties will achieve a density that is 80 percent of the maximum allowed density. This
reduction accounts for applicable land use controls and site requirements and takes into
consideration recent development trends in the RVD-1,000 and RVD-2,500 zones. Two of the
10
   The City has a RHNA allocation of 12 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units).
Pursuant to new State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing
needs based on Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as
extremely low. According to the CHAS data developed by HUD using 2005-2009 ACS data, the City has
19 percent very low income households (9.4 percent extremely low income and 9.2 percent very low
income). Therefore the City’s RHNA of 12 very low income units may be split into six extremely low
income units and six very low income units. However, for purposed of identifying adequate sites for the
RHNA, State law does not mandate the separate accounting for extremely low income category.
City of Lomita                                                                                 Page 54

                                                                            2013-2021 Housing Element
City’s recently approved residential projects have achieved 80 percent or more of the maximum
density allowed, including:
        25819 & 25825 Eshlman Ave. (RVD-1,000) – 87 percent of maximum density11
        26035 Cypress St. (RVD-2,500) – over 100 percent of maximum density
Vacant and Underutilized Multi-Family Residential Sites
In July 2008, the City conducted an analysis of vacant and underutilized multi-family residential
properties to determine buildout capacity in the City. Underutilized residential sites are defined
as sites with an improvement-to-land value ratio of less than one and where potential units on
site (based on 80 percent of the maximum density) can more than double the existing units on
site. Underutilized multi-family residential properties in the City are characterized by various
uses but mostly are occupied by single-family/duplex homes, and small older commercial uses
occupied by independent businesses.
Table 35, updated in 2013, provides the capacity of vacant and underutilized multi-family
residential land in Lomita by zoning category. A list with potential for residential development
of these vacant properties is included as Appendix B. Overall, vacant and underutilized multi-
family residential sites in the City can accommodate 94 potential units based on a density factor
of 80 percent of the maximum allowable densities. The vacant land in the City consists mainly
of small scattered parcels in the City’s RVD zone. With limited vacant residential sites, recent
residential development has involved primarily the recycling of underutilized properties and
subdividing larger lots for condominium and townhome developments.
While based on density alone, RVD-1000 and RVD-1500 sites can potentially facilitate the
development of lower income housing, the small size of some of these sites are not conducive
to affordable housing development. Therefore, in assessing the feasibility of these sites for
accommodating the City’s lower income RHNA, only sites that can accommodate at least ten
units (size of a typical small apartment building) are used. Only two underutilized residential
sites with a total capacity of 20 units are counted toward the City’s lower income RHNA; the
remaining residential sites (74 units) are counted toward the City’s moderate income RHNA.

   This project expired in April 2013. No development plans are currently approved for this site.

Mixed Use Overlay
Mixed use developments are conditionally permitted in the Mixed-Use Overlay zone. The
Lomita General Plan has designated about 58 acres as Mixed Use Overlay. Properties
designated as Mixed Use Overlay are primarily concentrated along Lomita Boulevard and
Narbonne Avenue. Approximately 200 properties are located within the Mixed Use Overlay
area. Figure 6 illustrates the Mixed Use Overlay in the City of Lomita and the zoning of
properties within this overlay.
The Mixed Use Overlay area covers properties along the City’s two major transportation
corridors – Lomita Boulevard and Narbonne Avenue. Properties are zoned Commercial (C-G) or
Downtown Commercial (D-C) within the Mixed Use Overlay area. Many of the parcels in this
area are large in size but occupied by low-intensity and nonconforming uses (such as single-
family homes) constructed between 1940s and 1960s, with a median year of construction being
1948. Many commercial properties along these two corridors are underperforming, with high
vacancy rates and marginal economic viability. Furthermore, most properties were developed
prior to the 1950s, with outdated configurations for modern uses. Based on these market
conditions, the City believes the area is ripe for redevelopment and therefore adopted the Mixed
Use Overlay zone to facilitate intensification and redevelopment in the area. To encourage
mixed-use development, the City offers incentives such as height increase beyond 35 feet as
part of the conditional use permit process and shared parking is encouraged.
Overall, much of the Mixed Use Overlay area is considered underutilized based on the current
zoning and development standards as well as the conditions of some buildings. If properties in
the Mixed Use Overlay were to recycle in the long term, this area would provide ample
opportunities for new development. However, for the purpose of assessing redevelopment
potential, the Assessor’s database was reviewed to identify the realistic development potential
within the short term. In assessing the status of the properties within the Mixed Use Overlay
area, an improvement-to-land value ratio of below 1.0 was used. Field survey was conducted
by staff to identify parcels with redevelopment and lot consolidation potential. While most
parcels are small, 19 parcels are at least 0.5 acre in size, which by the land use patterns in
Lomita, are considered large parcels within the City. The City will undertake outreach and

marketing efforts to encourage lot consolidation in order to facilitate mixed use development in
the City.
The City based the selection of sites on existing conditions of businesses and buildings, prior
development interests, discussions with property owners, as well as discussions with developers
regarding the feasibility of these sites and their appropriateness for mixed-use development
given their locations and conditions. Specifically, property owners have expressed interests in
redevelopment on the following sites:
        24412 Narbonne Avenue (Chabad of South Bay, Inc.) – 25,870 square feet
        24730 Narbonne Avenue (Narbonne Avenue Baptist Church) – 29873 square feet
        24825 Narbonne Avenue – 12,497 square feet
The City has also approved a lot merger within the MUO. However, due to the economy, the
merger was ultimately not recorded by the property owners. While the current market
conditions are not favorable to foster redevelopment at this time, the City anticipates
development interests will resume when the economic conditions improve. Overall, with the
sites identified, which represent only a portion of the underutilized sites in the Mixed Use
Overlay, the development potential well exceeds the City’s RHNA.
Table 36, updated in 2013, presents the Mixed Use Overlay sites identified using GIS and field
survey. Appendix B presents the sites information in detail. For the purpose of this Housing
Element, only sites that can accommodate at least ten units are included in this inventory. The
Mixed Use Overlay area contains more capacity than presented in Table 36. Capacity is
estimated at 80 percent (17.6 units per acre) of the maximum permitted density of 22 units per
acre. These sites can accommodate 172 units.

Second Units
Based on lot sizes and existing uses, the implementation of the second unit ordinance, at least
500 units of the City’s over 4,000 single-family residences can accommodate second units.
Based on City records, an average three second units have been constructed per year between
2008 and 2012. This level of second unit construction was lower than during 2000-2008,
probably due to the economy. Based on this recent trend, 24 second units can be expected for
the next eight years. According to rental listings from Table 17, one-bedroom apartments in
Lomita are renting for an average of $1,075. Given the size of the second units, they are
typically affordable to low income households (see Section 2.6.1 for more information on
current rental rates and affordability in the City). Furthermore, a large portion of the City’s
second units are expressly reserved for seniors, whose incomes typically fall within the very low
and low income levels. Conservatively, half of the second units are assumed to be affordable to
lower income households and half to moderate income households.

4.1.4    Adequacy of Sites Inventory in Accommodating Remaining RHNA
Pursuant to AB 2348, a density threshold of 20 units per acre is established for small
jurisdictions (under population 25,000) in metropolitan areas in facilitating the development of
lower income housing. The City has adopted a Mixed Use Overlay with a density of 22 units per
acre, exceeding this density threshold. Table 37 summarizes the City’s strategy for meeting its
RHNA. Based on targeted search of vacant and underutilized multi-family residential and mixed
use sites, the City has the capacity for 290 additional housing units, adequate to meet the City’s
RHNA of 47 units. Specifically, the City’s RHNA of 19 lower income units can be met by multi-
family residential sites alone, and will be far exceeded with the inclusion of sites in the Mixed
Use Overlay area. Smaller multi-family sites and second unit potential will fulfill the City’s RHNA
of 28 moderate and above moderate income units.

4.2      Financial Resources
As a small and built out community, Lomita has limited financial resources available for
affordable housing. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds represent the one
single source of funding for the City for housing activities. The CDBG program was initiated by
the Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1974. The primary objective of the
program is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living
environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low incomes (up to 80
percent AMI). CDBG funds can be used for a wide array of activities, including:
        Housing rehabilitation;
        Down payment and other homeownership assistance;
        Lead-based paint screening and abatement;
        Acquisition of buildings and land;
        Construction or rehabilitation of public facilities and infrastructure;
        Public services for low-income persons and persons with special needs;
        Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential buildings; and
        Loans and grants for businesses that provide employment for low-income persons.
City of Lomita                                                                                 Page 60

The City of Lomita does not qualify as an entitlement jurisdiction to receive annual CDBG
allocations directly from HUD.12 The City participates in the CDBG program through the Urban
County program administered by the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission
(LACDC). Annually, the City receives approximately $150,000 in CDBG funds through the
County. Funding is primarily used to support rehabilitation activities, in the City.
4.3      Administrative Resources
4.3.1    Lomita Housing Authority
The Lomita Housing Authority oversees the management and administration of the City-owned
78-unit senior housing community, Lomita Manor, located at 24925 Walnut Street.
4.3.2    Los Angeles County Community Development Commission
The City of Lomita participates in a range of programs administered by LACDC. These include
the CDBG program and first-time homebuyer assistance (such as Mortgage Credit Certificates
and Home Ownership Program). Nonprofit housing developers may also directly apply for
HOME funds from the LACDC to develop affordable housing in Lomita.
4.3.3    Nonprofit Housing Developers
In pursuing the development and preservation of affordable housing in the future, the City will
work with qualified nonprofit housing developer in order ensure the long-term affordability of
housing provided. The following nonprofit developers have expressed interest in providing
affordable housing in the region:
        Bridge Housing
        Habitat for Humanity
        Jamboree Housing Corporation
        Los Angeles Community Design Center
12
   A jurisdiction must have a population of 50,000 or over to qualify as an entitlement jurisdiction to
receive annual funding from HUD directly.

committed to the identification of prospective development sites for a continued variety and
diversity of new housing, as indicated by the following Housing Element policies.
    Policy 3.1: The City will promote and encourage the use of flexible and innovative
    techniques of site and housing design within the framework of the Zoning Ordinance and
    Building Code.
Issue Area No. 4 - Equal Housing. The following policies indicate the City’s desire to
continue to promote equal housing opportunities in the City.
    Policy 4.1: The City will continue to promote equal housing opportunity for all persons.
    Policy 4.2: The City will vigorously oppose prejudices, practices, and market behavior that
    results in housing discrimination.
    Policy 4.3: The City will cooperate with other public agencies involved in the enforcement
    of laws aimed at promoting access to housing (fair housing laws) and non-discrimination.
    Policy 4.4: The City will strive to make sure that the new residential development pays its
    own way in terms of infrastructure costs.
5.2      Housing Programs
Specific actions to address unmet housing needs and achieve the City’s housing goals and
quantified objectives are described in this section of the Housing Element. Under Article 10.6 of
the State Planning and Zoning law, the housing program of a local housing element must
include actions that "conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing
stock.” This section of the law deals with the improvement of the condition of housing (e.g.,
rehabilitating deteriorating housing), and the conservation of the current supply of affordable
housing (e.g., protecting the rental supply from conversion to condominiums). The potential
funding source, responsible agency, the timing of implementation, and the goals are identified
for each program. The goal refers to the City’s objective for either housing assistance or new
housing development.
5.2.1    Housing Rehabilitation Grant Program
The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Grant Program is restricted to lower income homeowners
(including extremely low income homeowners) who meet the current HUD income guidelines.
The units proposed for rehabilitation must be owner-occupied. The maximum grant is $5,000
to eligible low income mobilehome owners and $7,000 to eligible lower income homeowners.
The funds are primarily used for the correction of building safety and health code violations and
correction of hazardous structural conditions.

5.2.2    Code Enforcement
The City implements a code enforcement program that involves both building and zoning code
violations. This program is implemented by responding to complaints and through field
observations. On a continuing basis, the City conducts drive-throughs to obtain information
concerning the physical condition of individual units. The most common violations are generally
zoning code violations involving property maintenance violations, converted garages, and
inoperable vehicles. Violations involving structural features are not as common as zoning code
violations.
Objectives and                Monitor housing conditions and code violations and work with
Time Frame:                    property owners to correct all code violations.
                              Continue to provide information on rehabilitation assistance to

5.2.3    Mobile Home Park Conservation Program
Mobile home parks represent a significant housing resource for very low income and extremely
low income households, especially senior households. The City coordinates activities for
possible purchase of mobile home parks by park residents. The City has assisted one mobile
home park previously and will continue to offer this technical assistance service to other
interested mobile home parks in the City. The City will cooperate and provide administrative
support to any mobile home park wishing to incorporate and purchase their park under the
state regulations.
Objectives and                Annually monitor the condition and ownership status of mobile

5.2.4    Low Income Housing Preservation
Lomita Kiwanis Gardens, a publicly assisted housing project with a total of 67 units – is at risk
of conversion to market-rate housing. The City will continue to work with local non-profit
agencies and other entities to ensure the continued availability of affordable housing projects in
the City. The City will work towards maintaining the rent restrictions in these projects by
monitoring any changes in ownership, management, and status of deed restrictions.
Objectives and                 Monitor the project-based Section 8 contract for Lomita Kiwanis
Time Frame:                     Gardens.

5.2.5    Second Units/Granny Flats Program
The City allows second units or “granny flats” in single-family residential zones. Senior second
units are expressly for senior occupancy and based on a sample of senior second units recently
constructed, the majority are for senior family members at no cost. Therefore, senior second
units represent a significant resource for the very low and extremely low income seniors in the
community. Such units must meet certain development criteria and be located on lots of over
10,000 square feet. The implementation of the second unit ordinance, granny flats, and move-
on units will also have a capacity of at least 500 units on the City’s over 4,000 single-family
residences.
Objectives and                 Distribute brochures at public counters to promote the use of this
Time Frame:                     program.
                               Achieve an average of three second units annually for a total of

5.2.6    Zoning and Other Incentives
The City will continue to provide incentives to zoning regulations to promote and encourage the
provision of a variety of affordable housing types. The City provides density bonuses for low
income housing projects, in accordance with the State’s Density Bonus Law. As part of the
density bonus incentives, the City will consider the following incentives, as adopted in the City’s
Density Bonus Ordinance:
        Additional density provided the overall density bonus received for the entire residential
         development does not exceed 35 percent.
        A reduction in site development standards such as:
         o Reduced minimum lot sizes and/or dimensions.
         o Reduced minimum lot setbacks (up to 30 percent).
         o Reduced minimum private and/or common outdoor open space.
         o Increased maximum building height (up to one additional story).
         o Reduced on-site parking standards, including garage requirements (parking study
             required).
        Change of zone to the City’s Mixed-Use zoning designation, but with a 20-percent
         commercial maximum. The proposed commercial land use shall be compatible with the
         housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the
         proposed housing project will be located.
        A 10-percent decrease in the commercial requirement for a mixed-use project in the
         Mixed-Use Overlay District. If the proposed mixed-use project also consolidates at least
         two parcels for a minimum 20,000 square feet a 20-percent decrease shall be permitted.
        Other regulatory incentives that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual
         cost reductions.
In addition, the City will offer the following assistance to facilitate affordable housing
development:
        Identification of potential sites;
        Pre-application consultation and technical assistance;
        Waiver of the Development Tax;
        Expedited processing; and
        Letter of support for funding applications if proposed project is consistent with the City’s
         General Plan

5.2.7    Lot Consolidation
The majority of the parcels within the City are smaller in size. To facilitate mixed use
development within the MUO, the City will undertake efforts to promote lot consolidation.
Specifically, under the MUO, the City offers the following incentive for lot consolidation:
        For mixed use projects involving lot consolidation, the commercial requirement in the
         Mixed-Use Overlay District is reduced to 20 percent (instead of 30 percent).
        For mixed use projects involving lot consolidation of at least two parcels for a minimum
         20,000 square feet, the commercial requirement is reduced to 10 percent (instead of 30
         percent).
These significant reductions in commercial requirement encourage lot consolidation to result in
projects with greater residential capacity.         In addition, the City modified development
standards, including eliminating the two-story height requirement, reducing the minimum unit
size of 700 square feet to provide accommodate studio units (at 500 square feet), and reducing
parking requirements to one space per studio unit and two spaces per unit of other sizes, as
well as one guest parking space per four units.
Objectives and                 Prepare a marketing brochure in 2014 about mixed use
Time Frame:                     development in the MUO and incentives offered by the City,
                                including lot consolidation incentives.
                               Visit property owners annually of key sites within the MUO to
                                discuss potential for redevelopment.
                               Provide priority ministerial processing of lot consolidation.
                               Annually monitor the sites inventory to evaluate effectiveness lot

5.2.9    First-Time Homebuyers Programs
Residents of Lomita can obtain first-time homebuyer assistance through the Los Angeles County
Community Development Commission. Three programs are offered by the County:
Home Ownership Program
The Home Ownership Program (HOP) provides loans up to $60,000 for downpayment and
closing costs. The HOP loans are shared equity loans (at zero interest) with no monthly
payments until the home is sold, transferred, or refinanced. The home must be owner-
occupied for the life of the loan, which is 20 years. Eligible properties are single-family homes
or attached/detached condominium units or townhomes within the purchase price limits
established by HUD. The borrower must contribute a minimum of one percent of the
downpayment.        Also, the borrower must complete an eight-hour education course in
homeownership by a HUD-approved counseling agency.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
This program offers the first-time homebuyer a federal income tax credit by reducing the
amount of federal taxes to be paid. It also helps a first-time homebuyer qualify for a loan by
allowing a lender to reduce the housing expense ratio by the amount of tax savings. The credit
is subtracted dollar-for-dollar from his or her federal income taxes. The qualified buyer is
awarded a tax credit of up to 15 percent with the remaining 85 percent taken as a deduction
from the income in the usual manner.
Southern California Home Financing Authority
Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA) is a joint powers authority between Los
Angeles and Orange Counties formed in June 1988 to create first-time homebuyer programs for
low to moderate income households. SCHFA does not lend money directly to the homebuyers;
the homebuyers must work directly with a participating lender. The program provides
downpayment and closing cost assistance in the form of a gift equal to four percent of the first
loan amount.

Description of Vacant and Underutilized Properties
The following features the key vacant and underutilized sites in the Mixed Use Overlay Area.
2150-2168 250th St (Site ID #12): This site has four parcels and is 1.24 acres in size.
Current land uses include stores and residential. This property could potentially achieve 20
units under the Mixed-Use zoning (at an average of 17.6 units per acre).
2403-2439 Lomita Boulevard (Site ID #4): Located along one of the City’s major
commercial corridors, this 1.38-acre site offers potential for recycling to higher-intensity use
with a capacity of 20 units at an average density of 17.6 units per acre (80 percent of maximum
density).
This site is comprised of several contiguous parcels with existing nonconforming single-family
homes and a nonconforming auto repair shop. The auto repair shop occupies a significant
portion of the site but has only a narrow frontage on Lomita Boulevard. This is a marginally
performing business and does not represent the highest and best use for the property. The
existing single-family units on site do not constitute an impediment to redevelopment as recent
trends have demonstrated the market feasibility of recycling of properties with existing units.
All parcels on this site are under a single ownership. The City has had several conversations
with the property owner who has indicated interest in redeveloping these properties.

                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element
2332-2360 Lomita Boulevard (Site ID #5): This site includes six contiguous parcels with a
total area of 2.12 acres. Current land uses include stores, a beauty school, and one single-
family dwelling. Structures on site are at least 30 years old and at least half of the entire site is
used for surface parking. These contiguous parcels with old structures and marginally
operating businesses offer an excellent location for a mixed use development. One lot with an
area of 0.17 acres is vacant. This property could potentially achieve 34 units under the Mixed-
Use zoning (at an average of 17.6 units per acre).
24825 Narbonne Ave, 2200 248th St (Site ID #11): The total area of this site is 0.98
acres. The site includes two lots, one used for retail and the other a vacant lot 0.69 acres in
size. Prior to the economic downturn the City had discussions with the property owner
regarding development of this property as a mixed use development.

24516 Narbonne Ave, 2173 Lomita Blvd rear, 2154 245th St (Site ID #7 and #8): This
site has three parcels under common ownership including a vacant lot with an area of 0.32
acres. The total area of the site is 0.75 acre. The other two lots included in the site are all
parking lots. The City met with the owner who has expressed interest in redeveloping this site.
The owner has previously developed conceptual drawings for a mixed-use development.
This site can yield 12 units at an average density of 17.6 units per acre (80 percent of
maximum density).
24730 Narbonne Avenue (Site ID #10): This 0.7-acre lot is located at the northeast corner
of Narbonne Avenue and 248th Street. The site is currently occupied by a church and can
potentially yield 12 units if developed as mixed-use residential at an average density of 17.6
units per acre (80 percent of maximum density).

25401-25419 Narbonne Avenue (Site ID #14): This site has an area of 0.97 acre and
contains three contiguous large parcels that comprise one-quarter of the entire block. The
current land use for two of the parcels is residential while the final residential building has been
converted into a wellness clinic between the two homes. The interrupted uses encourage the
redevelopment of the three parcels as a single development. This lot can accommodate 15
units at an average density of 17.6 units per acre.
25019-25101 Narbonne Ave (Site ID #13): This site includes six parcels with a total area
of 1.28 acres. The land uses of the parcels include stores, office building and residential. The
lots are long and with narrow frontages along Narbonne Avenue.                   This configuration
encourages lot consolidation to achieve more efficient use of land. This lot can accommodate
18 units at an average density of 17.6 units per acre.
25342-25412 Narbonne Ave (Site ID #15): This site consists of five contiguous parcels
and has a total area of 0.94 acres. The lots are all residential with the exception of one store.
The lots are long and with narrow frontages along Narbonne Avenue. This configuration
encourages lot consolidation to achieve more efficient use of land. This site can accommodate
14 units at an average density of 17.6 units per acre.
