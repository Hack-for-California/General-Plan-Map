Land Use Elemen

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
                                    Land Use Element
Introduction
The purpose of the General Plan Land Use Element is to provide an orderly plan for the general
distribution, location and intensity of land uses within the City of Buellton. The Land Use
Element describes long-range goals for the physical development of the community, both in
terms of land use type and intensity, as well as urban character and form. This Element
includes the General Plan Land Use Map, which presents a graphical representation of land use
policy that corresponds with descriptions of the General Plan land use designations and zoning
districts. The Land Use Element also describes the intensity or density of development
expected for the community based on the proposed land uses.
The City Limits, the Buellton Urban Growth Boundary, and the boundaries of the City’s Sphere
of Influence and Planning Area, are depicted on Figure LU-1. This Land Use Element provides
for the opportunity for infill development within the City limits and the Buellton Urban Growth
Boundary line. The City’s Sphere of Influence is currently coterminous with the City Limits
and the Buellton Urban Growth Boundary line, and the Land Use Element does not currently
project growth outside of the existing City Limits and the Buellton Urban Growth Boundary
line. However, the Land Use Element contains policies and programs that may call for a future
Sphere of Influence study to identify planned growth areas in the future. The City also has a
“Comment Area” that consists of County lands for which the City will review future
development applications for consistency with City goals and policies and present comments to
the County as appropriate.
The Land Use Element goals, policies, and programs, particularly as they relate to the Buellton
Urban Growth Boundary, are intended to preserve the small town character of Buellton.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements and the Zoning Ordinance
The Land Use Element sets forth the policies for the types and location of land uses throughout
the City. The Zoning Ordinance Zoning Map implements the Land Use Element and its policies
by establishing specific City regulations and standards for the development of parcels of land.
The Zoning designation for a site must be consistent with the General Plan in relationship to
land use category.
Section 65300.5 of the California Government Code requires the General Plan and its Elements
to be “an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies...”. The Land
Use Element is consistent with the other elements of the General Plan, supporting and
complementing the Plan’s goals and policies. For example, the Land Use Element provides
adequate sites for housing development to meet the affordability requirements and other
special needs of the community as identified in the Housing Element. The amount,
distribution, and timing of growth expressed within the Land Use Element must be coordinated
with the anticipated road capacity and performance standards established in the Circulation
Element. Similarly, the other General Plan elements ensure that future development occurs in
an appropriate manner and that the unique aesthetic and environmental qualities of Buellton
are safeguarded and enhanced.
                                                                                      City of Buellton

Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
City of Buellton Urban Growth Boundary
The voters of the City of Buellton have, through the initiative process, established and adopted
an urban growth boundary line denominated the Buellton Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Its
purpose, principals, implementation procedures, and methodologies for amendment are set
forth in this subsection.
1.       Purpose
The purpose of this UGB is to ensure that the development policies and underlying goals,
objectives, and principals set forth in the Buellton 2025 General Plan relating to land Use are
inviolable against transitory short-term political decisions and that agricultural, watershed, and
open space lands are not prematurely or unnecessarily converted to other non-agricultural or
non-open space uses without public debate and a vote of the people.
2.       Principals
Continued urban encroachment into agricultural and watershed areas will impair agriculture
and threaten the public health, safety, and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion,
associated air pollution, and potentially serious water problems such as pollution, depletion,
and sedimentation of available water resources. Such urban encroachment would eventually
result in both the unnecessary, expensive extension of public services and facilities, and
inevitable conflicts between urban and open space/agricultural uses.
The unique character of the City of Buellton and the quality of life of its residents depend on the
protection of a substantial amount of surrounding open space, natural resources, and
agricultural lands. The protection of such lands not only ensures the continued viability of
agriculture, but also contributes to flood control and the protection of wildlife, environmentally
sensitive areas, and irreplaceable natural resources. As importantly, adopting a UGB will
promote the formation and continuation of a cohesive community by defining the boundaries,
by encouraging economic development of the Buellton Revitalization Area, and by helping to
prevent urban sprawl. Such a UGB will promote efficient municipal services and facilities by
confining urban development to defined development areas.
3.       Implementation
a.       The City of Buellton hereby establishes and adopts a UGB. The UGB is established
coterminous with the existing City Limits and in the same location as the Sphere of Influence
line. The City Limits, Sphere of Influence line, and the UGB line are illustrated in Figure LU-1.
b.       Until December 31, 2025, the City of Buellton shall restrict urban services (except
temporary mutual assistance with other jurisdictions) to within the UGB, and only uses
consistent with agriculture and the preservation of open space lands as set forth in Government
Code Section 65560(b) as of March 31, 2008, shall be allowed beyond the UGB, except as
provided herein. Other than the exceptions provided herein, upon the effective date of this
General Plan amendment, the City and its departments, boards, commissions, officers, and
employees shall not grant, or by inaction allow to be approved by operation of law, any General
                                                                                       City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
Plan amendment, rezoning, specific plan, tentative subdivision map, special use permit,
building permit, or any other discretionary entitlement which is inconsistent with the UGB,
unless in accordance with the amendment procedures of this General Plan amendment.
c.       “Urban services” shall include, but not be limited to, water and sewer services.
4.       Amendment Procedures
Until December 31, 2025, the foregoing Purposes, Principals, and Implementation provisions
may be amended only by a vote of the people commenced pursuant to Article I of Chapter 3 of
Division 9 of the Elections Code, or pursuant to the procedures set forth below.
a.       The City Council may amend the UGB described herein if it deems it to be in the public
interest, provided that the amended boundary is within the limits of the UGB established by the
Buellton Growth Boundary Initiative.
b.       The City Council, following at least one public hearing, may amend the UGB to comply
with State Law regarding the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community.
For that purpose the City Council may amend the UGB as described herein and as designated
on Figure LU-1 in order to include lands to be designated for residential uses. Such amendment
may be adopted if the City Council makes each of the following findings based on substantial
evidence:
         i.        That the land is immediately adjacent to the existing UGB and to serviceable
         water and sewer connections; and
         ii.       That the proposed development is necessary to comply with a State Law imposing a
         mandatory housing obligation (e.g., the provision of low and very low income housing), and the
         area of land within the proposed development will not exceed the minimum necessary to comply
         with the mandatory housing obligation; and
         iii.      That there is no existing land available within the UGB to accommodate development
         that will address the housing need identified in the analysis by which the City has determined that
         it is not in compliance with State Law.
c.       The City Council, following at least one public hearing, may amend the UGB if the City Council
makes each of the following findings:
         i.        Application of the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 of these amendment procedures are
         unworkable as applied to a specific parcel, and failure to amend the UGB would constitute an
         unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property for which compensation would be required; and
         ii.       The amendment and associated land use designations will allow new land uses only to the
         minimum extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property.
d.       The City Council, following at least one public hearing, may place any amendment to the UGB or
provisions of this initiative on the ballot in the manner provided by State Law.
                                                                                              City of Buellton

Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
e.       The City Council may, following at least one public hearing, amend the UGB to include land
contemplated for construction of public schools or public parks. Such amendment may be adopted only if
the City Council makes each of the following findings:
         i.       The land is immediately adjacent to existing compatibly developed areas and there is
         evidence that the Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public Works, the
         Community Services Department, and the applicable water and sewer districts within the
         jurisdiction over such land have or will provide adequate capacity to accommodate the proposed
         development and provide it with adequate public services; and
         ii.      That there is no existing land available within the UGB to accommodate the proposed
         development.
f.       The City Council may reorganize, reorder, and renumber General Plan provisions, including the
provisions of this General Plan amendment.
                                                                                           City of Buellton

Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan
Currently, the City’s "downtown" lacks well-defined boundaries, since commercial uses in the
City are arranged to serve travelers on Highways 101 and 246. As a consequence, the focal
points of business, cultural and government activities in the City are spread along Avenue of
Flags and Highway 246. The Avenue of Flags area has served as the community's gathering
place, and the traditional focus of commercial and cultural activities. The wide, grassy medians
down the middle of the Avenue are an aesthetic asset that provides a sense of identity for the
community.
Many of the properties in the commercial core of the City, bisected by Avenue of Flags and
Highway 246 near Highway 101, are underutilized. Many of the businesses are small and
diverse, ranging from small motels and restaurants to shops catering to the needs of visitors and
local residents.
In response to these conditions, an Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan has been
prepared to provide an overall vision for Buellton’s downtown core. The Avenue Revitalization
Area boundaries are depicted in Figure LU-6. The Plan was completed in December 2002 and
outlines a variety of recommendations regarding land use, circulation, parking and streetscape
improvements. The Plan encourages commercial retail uses along the Avenue of Flags and
Highway 246 as a destination and not just a pass-through area for highway users and visitors to
the Santa Ynez Valley.
Fundamental recommendations put forth in the Urban Design Plan and reflected in the policies
and programs of the General Plan Land Use Element are discussed below.
         Visitor Services/Highway Commercial
         Visitor services should include the following uses mostly at the district edges: traveler
         related retail, hotel or motels, and RV parking. The downtown core should include
         visitor services that allow travelers to exit the highway, use the services, and enter back
         onto the freeway efficiently.
         Retail and Office Development
         The properties directly fronting the Avenue should include new retail and office
         development to support Buellton residents and visitors. This should consist of buildings
         with storefronts oriented towards the enhanced street environment.
         Mixed Use Development
         In the Revitalization Area, new mixed use development should be developed to create a
         core of uses and activities that will become the “downtown” of Buellton. New uses
         include:
               •  A commercial focus (retail and office)
               •  Visitor Focus Retail (hospitality and entertainment)
               •  Civic uses (government and recreation)
                                                                                        City of Buellton

               •   Residential integrated throughout the Downtown district area (vertical)
         Residential Development
         New residential uses in the Revitalization Area should be integrated into mixed use
         developments (above and behind street front commercial uses) and as stand alone
         attached housing, such as condominiums, apartments and townhouses. This will occur
         on the east side (lot depth) behind street fronting retail/office. The residential
         development should take advantage of existing infrastructure, as well as be located in
         the core area of Buellton.
         Civic Center
         A new Civic Center facility with City Hall/Community Center should be located
         downtown. In the future, reuse of existing civic uses such as City Hall, police, planning
         department, library and others along Highway 246 can open up new development
         opportunities within the Revitalization Area.
         Open Space and Recreation
         Opportunities for open space and recreation include a new passive park and trail along
         Zaca Creek (east of the Avenue). This would help buffer noise from Highway 101 along
         the Avenue. The trail would also link to the Santa Ynez River and trail to the south.
         A “linear park” along the Avenue, with a pedestrian walkway, can also be created on
         the existing median. The Avenue median would have usable community space and
         would be developed into different use areas including:
               •  Exhibits area for art pieces such as sculptures and other local art exhibits
               •  Walkway and community gardens
               •  A special water feature located in the median
               •  A visitor serving/community gathering area and kiosk
               •  Space for community events area for car shows and farmers markets along the
                  edges of the existing median
General Plan Land Use Plan
The City’s Land Use Classification System provides an organized approach for defining land
uses and the allowable density or intensity of development for each use. The term density is
used for residential uses and refers to the population and development capacity of residential
land. Density within this Element is described in terms of dwelling units per net acre of land
(du/acre), exclusive of existing and proposed streets and rights-of-way.
Table LU-1 lists the acreage for each land use category under the City’s proposed General Plan
Land Use Element. These land use categories are depicted on Figure LU-2, General Plan Land
Use map. The corresponding City zoning map is depicted on Figure LU-3.

The City’s land use classifications are described below:
         Very Low Density Residential (VLDR)
         The Very Low Density Residential designation is applied to lands intended for single
         family detached and attached homes, secondary residential units, public and quasi-
         public uses, and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 1-
         2 units per acre, except in areas where topography or other conditions warrant even
         lower densities. The possible range of low density residential products includes custom
         dwellings, tract homes and planned development projects that allow for design
         flexibility and innovation.
         Low Density Residential (LR)
         The Low Density Residential designation is applied to lands intended for single family
         detached and attached homes, secondary residential units, public and quasi-public uses,
         and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 3-6 units per
         acre, except in areas where topography or other conditions warrant even lower
         densities. The possible range of low density residential products includes custom
         dwellings, tract homes and planned development projects that allow for design
         flexibility and innovation.
         Medium Density Residential (MDR)
         The Medium Density Residential designation is intended to accommodate both attached
         and detached single family residential development, including mobile homes, duplexes,
         condominiums and planned development projects. Residential densities shall be in the
         range of 4-8 units per acre.
         Multi-Family Residential (MFR)
         This designation provides for single and multi-family residential units, public and quasi-
         public uses, and similar compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 9
         to 16 units per gross acre.
                                                                                                  City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
         Neighborhood Commercial (NC)
         The Neighborhood Commercial designation is intended to provide retail sales and
         personal services primarily for the convenience of surrounding residential areas, and
         secondarily to provide shopping opportunities for the City as a whole. More specifically,
         this designation is intended to accommodate the development of retail centers that
         include a grocery store, drug store and ancillary uses such as a laundromat, barber, and
         video rental store, provided, however, that the size of individual businesses or tenant
         spaces shall not exceed 5,000 square feet in floor area. In addition, this designation
         allows public and quasi-public uses and similar compatible land uses.
         General Commercial (GC)
         This designation is applied to lands intended to
         accommodate the widest range of commercial, retail,
         wholesale and office uses, as well as similar compatible
         uses. This designation also allows for the development of
         mixed use at a maximum density of ten dwellings per
         gross acre, as determined by the variable limit. The
         General Commercial designation has been applied to the
         existing commercial core of the City along Highway 246
         and Avenue of Flags, as well as to the large undeveloped
         parcels on the east side of Highway 101. The General
         Commercial designation may also accommodate motels,
         restaurants and similar businesses oriented toward
         tourists.                                                      Avenue of Flags Commercial
                                                                        District
         Service Commercial (SC)
         This designation is intended for heavier commercial and/or light industrial uses that
         often need large lots and buildings, but would be inappropriate for either the General
         Commercial or Light Industrial land use designations. Such uses would include
         furniture stores, new or used car sales, farm and ranch supply stores, and
         hardware/lumber stores as well as food processing and manufacturing which does not
         generate a lot of noise or waste. This designation has been applied to the parcels
         fronting Thomas Road at the intersection of McMurray Road.
         Industrial (I)
         The Industrial designation provides for light
         manufacturing, warehousing, trucking and similar
         and compatible uses. This designation is applied to
         parcels along Industrial Way south of Highway 246,
         and Easy Street and Commerce Drive east of
         McMurray Road.                                             McMurray Road Industrial District
                                                                                           City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
         Public/Quasi-Public (P)
         This designation provides for government owned facilities, schools and quasi-public
         uses such as churches and meeting halls. This designation is applied throughout the City
         on City owned land, schools, churches and other public or quasi-public lands.
         Open Space/Parks and Recreation (OS)
         This designation will be applied to public and private open space and parkland within
         the City. Open space includes areas subject to hazards such as flooding and steep
         slopes, as well as areas to be preserved for their visual, biological and/or recreational
         value.
The City of Buellton’s overlay designations are described below:
         Redevelopment Area Plan
         The Buellton Redevelopment Plan (or “Improvement Plan”) was adopted in 1993 and
         establishes a redevelopment area of about 180 acres generally bounded by Central
         Avenue to the west, Freer Drive to the east, the southerly terminus of McMurray Road
         to the south and the intersection of Avenue of Flags with the U.S. 101 Freeway to the
         north (refer to Figure LU-4). The Redevelopment Plan delineates land uses, policies and
         programs, circulation, access and related features. The Buellton Redevelopment Plan
         serves as a guide for long term development and improvements that can be funded
         through redevelopment funds.
         Areas Subject to Specific Plan
         This designation is applied to lands with potential for significant growth to promote
         specific planning and performance standards. The only area in the City that is currently
         designated as “Specific Plan” is the Oak Springs Village Specific Plan area, located in the
         northeast portion of the City, north of Highway 246 and east of McMurray Road.
         Affordable Housing Overlay Zone
         The Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) designates key sites to be “stand alone”
         residential projects irrespective of the underlying zone designation at a density of 25
         units/acre. The sites shown on Figure LU-5 reflect the current inventory of candidate
         properties and the basis of environmental review conducted in association with the
         General Plan Update. The AHOZ designation provides property owners with a
         voluntary option to develop housing at densities greater than the underlying zoning
         designation would otherwise allow. The AHOZ institutes a bifurcated land use
         entitlement process which grants a 2:1 density bonus (two market rate units above the
         base density for each affordable
                                                                                        City of Buellton

 low and very low income unit) up to a maximum combined density of 50% above the
 base. In addition, it imposes an inclusionary requirement based on the apportionment of net
 RHNA goals, mandating that a minimum of 20% of the base density be affordable to very low,
 low and moderate income households. The final designation of AHOZ sites shall be
 undertaken in association with Land Use Element Policy L-20 and periodically updated in
 association with Housing Element Programs 2.a and 21.a.
 Implications of Land Use Policy
 Lands within the existing City Limits are currently substantially built out; few vacant parcels
 remain in the City. Nevertheless, as changes in land use or land use intensity occur citywide
 consistent with this Land Use Element over the General Plan buildout horizon of 2025, the
 overall distribution of land use will change. Table LU-2 summarizes the distribution of land use
 and the corresponding buildout level of development anticipated to result from implementation
 of land uses in accordance with the Land Use Map, and the goals, policies, and programs
 contained in this Element. It should be noted that the buildout projections in Table LU-2 have
 been adjusted for environmental constraints.
                          Table LU-2. Land Use Element Buildout Projection
         Land Use                 Existing in 2004           Development Potential            Total at Buildout (2025)
Single-Family Residential             1,204 Units                     143 Units                          1,347 Units
Multi-Family Residential               568 Units                     1,660 Units                         2,228 Units
Commercial                           2,874,176 ft2                   411,753 ft2                        3,285,929 ft2

Note: The relative amount of multi-family residential and commercial development that could potentially occur under 2025
buildout conditions is dependent upon the extent to which potential AHOZ sites with a base zoning designation of General
Commercial (CR) convert to multi-family housing in accordance with the permissive AHOZ designation, which allows property
owners the option of applying to develop with commercial or multi-family residential housing.
 Residential buildout in the City is projected to occur between the years 2009 and 2024,
 depending on the level of future housing demand in the City. Commercial buildout is projected
 to occur by 2025. Industrial buildout of the City is projected to occur between the years 2020
 and 2025.

Land Use Element Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                   Goals
1.       To provide effective standards for the location, amount, rate, type and quality of new
         development so that the local economy remains healthy, attractive residential
         neighborhoods can expand, the character of the City is preserved, surrounding
         agriculture is enhanced and maintained, and the natural environment is protected.
2.       To manage the growth of the City so that adequate facilities and services can be
         provided in pace with development.
3.       To expand shopping and services that better provide for the needs of the residents.
4.       To revitalize the Avenue of Flags and Highway 246 core as an identifiable “downtown,”
         the physical and social center of Buellton and an inviting place for visitors and residents
         alike.
5.       Focus growth inward to accommodate population increases and housing needs.
         Compact contiguous development within existing City boundaries is preferred over
         annexation and sprawling development.
                                                  Policies
General Policies
L-1      The Buellton Urban Growth Boundary, sphere of influence, planning area, and land use
         designations are shown on Figures LU-1 and LU-3. The land use designations and
         policies of this General Plan apply to the sphere of influence. Public improvements and
         significant new private development proposed in the planning area shall be reviewed by
         the City.
L-2      Further annexations to the City may occur when:
         a. Substantial public benefit may be realized through the annexations, such as the
               provision of public open space, additional parkland, or the protection of scenic
               vistas, or natural resources; or special type of use is proposed that cannot be
               practically accommodated in the existing city limits.
         b. The annexations constitute fiscally sound additions to the City, as documented in a
               Fiscal Impact Report;
         c. Consistency with State law and Local Agency Formation Commission standards and
               criteria can be assured;
         d. Neighborhood identities are not compromised by the annexations;
         e. Adequate municipal services can be provided to the annexed area;
         f. Annexations are complimentary to ongoing redevelopment efforts regarding infill
               housing and the vitality of the City’s downtown commercial center.
                                                                                         City of Buellton

         g. Annexations support optimal return from public investment on existing and new
               roads and bridges, schools, utilities and drainage facilities, transit systems, or other
               public services and facilities.
         h. Ample park land is provided for residential annexations, especially on the east end
               of the City.
         The Planning Commission shall review the merits of a request for annexation based on
         these criteria, and make a recommendation to the City Council. City Council shall then
         review the merits of a request for annexation, based on the above criteria, and make a
         presentation to the people of Buellton, as required by this General Plan.
L-3      Encourage locally serving businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies, hardware
         stores, banks, day care, dry cleaning, and post offices, as well as schools, parks and
         social centers to locate within easy walking distance (generally ½ mile) of residences.
         Similarly, new residential neighborhoods should remain within easy walking and
         bicycling distance from the City center.
L-4      New development shall be restricted from areas where natural conditions are likely to
         pose a substantial threat to public safety or produce excessive maintenance costs.
L-5      New development shall not be allowed unless adequate public services are available to
         serve such new development.
L-6      New development shall pay its fair share of providing additional public services needed
         to accommodate such development. The City shall prepare a fiscal impact assessment
         model to evaluate the fiscal impacts of new development. The model will assess the net
         fiscal benefit or cost of new development by comparing projected tax benefits to City
         service costs. All future development projects, with the exception of affordable housing
         and projects that require only a zoning clearance, shall be required to prepare a fiscal
         impact report using this model. All projects for which the fiscal impact assessment
         model identifies a net negative fiscal impact shall be heard by the City Council.
L-7      New residential development that has the potential of adding significant new school-
         aged children to the City’s population should be coordinated with affected school
         districts. The proponents of such development shall be encouraged to meet and confer
         with school officials in advance of the application submittal to coordinate project
         development with fee payment and facility capacity.
L-8      New development and changes in existing use should adhere to the pattern of land use
         recommended in the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan for the Avenue
         of Flags Revitalization Area (refer to Figure LU-6 and the discussion of the Urban
         Design Plan in the introduction). Non-conforming uses should be encouraged to relocate
         elsewhere at locations appropriate to the use. Vertical and horizontal mixed-use
         development should be encouraged in relation to lot depth, and a commercial
         orientation shall be maintained along the street frontage of the Avenue.
                                                                                           City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
L-9      The entrances to Buellton from the east and west on Highway 246, and from the north
         and south on the US 101 freeway and Avenue of Flags should be considered important
         features. New public and private development in these locations should include
         elements such as signage, landscaping and appropriate architectural detailing that
         announces that one has arrived in Buellton. Such elements should also be designed to
         reduce the speed of vehicles entering the City for the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists
         using and crossing arterial roads. Entrance monuments, as described in the Avenue of
         Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan shall also be encouraged.
L-10     The City should encourage the protection of historically or architecturally significant
         buildings from substantial changes in outward appearance in a way that diminishes the
         historical character.
L-11     New development shall incorporate a balanced circulation network that provides safe,
         multi-route access for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians to neighborhood centers,
         greenbelts, other parts of the neighborhood and adjacent circulation routes.
L-12     All exterior lighting in new development shall be located and designed so as to avoid
         creating substantial off-site glare, light spillover onto adjacent properties, or upward
         into the sky. The style, location and height of the lighting fixtures shall be submitted
         with building plans and shall be subject to approval by the City prior to issuance of
         building or grading permits, as appropriate.
L-13     Master plans for sewer, water, roads, drainage and other public improvements shall be
         required for new development that includes at least 100 housing units or 200,000 square
         feet of commercial or industrial development, unless otherwise specified by the City
         Public Works Director. The scope of these master plans shall be further defined in the
         General Plan Public Facilities and Services Element.
L-14     To help maintain the beauty of the City, property owners shall be encouraged to
         maintain their property in a neat and orderly manner. The City will continue to enforce
         the property maintenance standards of the Buellton Municipal Code.
L-15     The City shall monitor the gap between the availability of jobs and housing within
         Buellton and work with SBCAG to explore options for reducing the City’s jobs/housing
         imbalance.
Residential Development
L-16     Higher residential densities should be concentrated along major transportation corridors
         to maintain the existing small town character of Buellton.
L-17     Maintain the pace of new residential growth by requiring phasing of large residential
         projects (i.e., projects of 100 or more units). Phasing shall regulate the timing of
         residential growth in an orderly way considering the following: infrastructure, local
                                                                                         City of Buellton

Land Use Element (Revised December 22, 2008)
         employment increases, environmental resources, economic factors, school enrollment
         and sustainability.
L-18     The maximum allowable residential density for new residential subdivisions or
         development projects shall be computed based on the gross area of the lot before
         dedications for highway setbacks, parks, streets, or other requirements.
L-19     The form, scale and character of new residential development should be compatible
         with the existing development context (e.g., density, design features, etc.) of adjacent
         development areas.
L-20     Amend the zoning ordinance to include an “Affordable Housing Overlay Zone”
         (AHOZ) that promotes the development of affordable housing, as described in Program
         2 of the Housing Element. The AHOZ designates the key development sites (consisting
         of one or more candidate properties shown in Figure LU-5) and permits, but does not
         require residential development as an alternative to the base zoning.
L-21     The City shall encourage the development of secondary dwelling units within
         residential areas (in furtherance of Program 4 of the Housing Element) as a way to
         provide for more efficient use of a limited land resource while dispersing affordable
         housing over a larger geographic area.
L-22     The City shall promote mixed-use projects and the development of multi-family infill to
         existing developed properties (in furtherance of Programs 3 and 4 of the Housing
         Element) that is architecturally and environmentally sensitive and is compatible with
         neighboring land uses. The re-designation of properties located at 359, 355, and 353
         Palm Way from Low Density Residential RM-7 (7 units per acre) to Multi-Family
         Residential RM-16 (16 units per acre) is expressly subject to further review at the time
         new development is proposed; specifically, issues of utility installation, vehicular access
         and off-street parking shall be evaluated before existing land use may be intensified.
L-23     For property with a General Commercial (GC) land use designation and frontage upon
         Avenue of Flags or Highway 246, new residential development may only be allowed: (i)
         as part of mixed use projects, subordinate in character and scale to principal permitted
         commercial uses; (ii) located above or behind commercial uses facing the street; and (iii)
         where sufficient vehicle access and parking is provided for both residential and
         commercial uses. Exemptions to this policy may only be granted by a majority vote of
         the City Council when all of the following findings can be made: (i) compelling public
         interests are served (e.g., provision of affordable housing) or circumstances particular to
         a project or site warrant such an exemption (e.g., site characteristics, development
         constraints, neighborhood compatibility, environmental setting, community benefits and
         other relevant factors); (ii) the viability of the remaining commercial corridor is not
         jeopardized; and (iii) the City’s economic and fiscal goals are not compromised.
                                                                                        City of Buellton

Commercial Development
L-24     New commercial development shall be encouraged in Buellton along Avenue of Flags
         and Highway 246. In general, new commercial development should provide a wider
         range of retail shopping opportunities for the community.
L-25     The visitor-serving sector of the local economy should be maintained and, as demand
         increases, expanded.
L-26     Offices should be allowed on Avenue of Flags.
L-27     Sidewalk areas in the commercial core along Avenue of Flags and Highway 246 should
         allow for the free flow and safe of pedestrians.
L-28     New commercial development should incorporate elements to encourage pedestrian
         access and to screen parked areas from public view.
L-29     Residences shall be allowed in conjunction with compatible commercial development on
         land designated General Commercial. The City shall encourage mixed use development
         as outlined in Program 3 of the Housing Element by adopting a variable limit for mixed
         use units, increasing allowed building heights, allowing off-street parking credits for on-
         street and shared parking, and using a density definition that is adjustable for unit sizes.
         The mixed use development shall only occur in the General Commercial (CR)
         designation.
L-30     New development should be required to incorporate streetscape features promoted in
         the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan or otherwise contribute toward
         the cost of installing such features along the property frontage. New development
         should also adhere to planning principles promoted in the Avenue of Flags/Highway
         246 Urban Design Plan: storefronts should be sited close to the street to better define the
         street edge and building frontages at street level should be appropriately designed at a
         human scale (refer to the picture below).
                                                                                      City of Buellton

L-31     The City should identify one or more potential sites for a new civic center to compliment
         revitalization goals and create a discernable downtown. To the extent feasible, the Civic
         Center should incorporate a new City Hall, leisure and cultural services (e.g., library,
         senior/community center, etc.) and public services performed by other governmental
         agencies (e.g., sheriff, fire administration, building and safety, etc.).
L-32     The City should actively promote and pursue development of a unified street scene
         along the Avenue of Flags as envisioned in the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban
         Design Plan (see Avenue of Flags conceptual streetscape master plan on following
         page). Elements include new district monumentation and signage, thematic paving
         features, decorative street furnishings (e.g., a clock, benches, banners, flags, light
         standards, trash receptacles, etc.), embellished pedestrian crosswalks and
         redevelopment of center medians into park-like settings.
L-33     The conversion of commercially-designated lands to residential use should only be
         allowed when the City receives substantial public benefit, including or exceeding the
         public benefit realized by the provision of affordable housing in accordance with the
         City’s affordable housing programs.
Industrial Development
L-34     Industrial development shall be encouraged in the area east of McMurray Road on Easy
         Street and Commerce Drive, and on Industrial Way.
L-35     Encourage agricultural support businesses on appropriately designated lands so that
         Buellton remains a regional center for the surrounding agricultural, ranching, and rural
         residential areas.
L-36     Existing businesses that cater to the needs of ranching and agricultural operations
         should be encouraged to locate in the Service Commercial or Light Industrial districts, as
         appropriate.

Circulation Element
                                   Circulation Element
Introduction
The Circulation Element describes the transportation system serving Buellton, and establishes
policies, standards and programs to meet the present and future transportation needs of the
community.
The Circulation Element must be consistent with the other elements of the General Plan. The
amount, distribution, and timing of growth discussed in the Land Use Element must
correspond with the circulation service levels and conditions anticipated in the Circulation
Element. The General Plan assumes road improvements anticipated to be implemented within
the 20-year planning period. The policy direction regarding the amount, distribution and
timing of future development in the City through the year 2025 are described in detail in the
Land Use Element.
Based on projections of traffic congestion at key intersections under General Plan buildout
conditions, the Circulation Element identifies the need to study future circulation
improvements in a Project Study Report (PSR), which will establish appropriate alternatives for
major local and regional improvements at the Highway 246 intersections at McMurray Road,
and the Highway 101 northbound ramps, and at the Damassa Road/Highway 101 interchange.
Major transportation improvements that could be recommended by the PSR include:
construction of a new Highway 101 interchange near the northern City limits, the addition of an
exclusive right-turn lane on the westbound Highway 246 approach to the Highway 101
northbound on-ramp, and/or improvements to the Highway 246/McMurray Road intersection,
including the addition of lanes on the eastbound and westbound Highway 246 approaches to
McMurray Road.
The Buellton Circulation System
The circulation system serving Buellton consists of
automobile, truck, pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
There are no rail or air transportation facilities in or
near the City; the automobile remains the primary
mode of travel within the City and between
Buellton and surrounding areas.
Streets and Highways
The City of Buellton is located in the Santa Ynez
Valley at the intersection of Highway 101 and State
Highway 246. Highway 101 is a four-lane, divided         Highway 101, Which Bisects Buellton, Is the Major

left turn lane from Freear Drive west to the City limits. Highway 246 on both the east and west
sides of Highway 101 is the major commercial corridor in the City. Outside of urban areas, the
highway is primarily two lanes. There are signalized intersections on Highway 246 at the US
101 interchange, at McMurray Road, Freear Drive, and Avenue of Flags.
                                                  In the 1960s, Highway 101 was realigned to the
                                                  east and improved as a four-lane divided freeway.
                                                  The old right-of-way was converted to a local
                                                  commercial street and is now Avenue of Flags,
                                                  which consists of four travel lanes divided by
                                                  wide, grassy medians that have come to be
                                                  identified with Buellton.

                                                  Plan, prepared in December 2002, recommends
                                                  circulation, bicycle, and parking improvements to
                                                  the Avenue to address vehicle, bicycle, and
Highway 246 Is the Major East-West Transportation
Corridor Through the City.                        pedestrian concerns. Vehicle circulation
                                                  recommendations include alley improvements,
truck and RV accommodation, reconfiguring the Jonata Park Road/Highway 101 off-ramp, and
improving circulation along Avenue of Flags from Central Avenue to Damassa Road. Parking
recommendations include diagonal parking along the Avenue and interconnected off-street
parking lots behind street fronting parcels along the east side (refer to “Parking” below for
additional discussion of the Urban Design Plan parking concepts). Truck routes and parking
would be provided along the portion of the Avenue north of Damassa Road. Pedestrian
improvements recommended in the Urban Design Plan are discussed below, under “Pedestrian
Circulation”. Bicycle improvements recommended in the Urban Design Plan are discussed
below, under “Bicycle Circulation”.
The City has developed with a hierarchy of local, collector and arterial streets generally in a grid
pattern design. The overall condition of the local street system varies, as well as the standard to
which streets were originally constructed.
Parking
In addition to parallel on-street parking provided on City streets, the City also requires off-
street parking with all new development. The City zoning ordinance requires varying numbers
of required off-street parking spaces depending on the land use.
The Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan calls for the reconfiguration of the
Avenue right-of-way from four to two travel lanes, along with the elimination of median
parking, which would slow traffic, provide for more on-street parking and create a more
intimate pedestrian-oriented experience within the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban
                                                                                         City of Buellton

Design Plan Revitalization Area1 (see Figure LU-6). The street reconfiguration would double
the amount of on-street parking that is located immediately adjacent to properties that front the
Avenue. This added capacity would provide opportunity for inducing new development by
reducing on-site parking requirements. This would be particularly important for properties
along the west side of the Avenue where shallow lot depths make development problematic. It
could also be used to foster mixed-use projects where shared parking is possible. Further
efficiencies could be realized through the interconnection of driveways and reciprocal parking
at the rear of properties along the east side of the Avenue. The Urban Design Plan also
envisions the creation of off-street public parking, including identifiable truck and RV parking,
in the Study Area.
Truck and RV Accommodation
Accommodations for truck and RV parking within the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban
Design Plan Revitalization Area will change as the area transitions from its current state to a
new, mixed use destination. For the initial phases of street improvements, truck and RV
parking will still be allowed along the Avenue at certain locations. However, as street
improvements are implemented as called for in the Urban Design Plan and as the area attracts
new development and destination uses over time, trucks and RV highway users will be
accommodated in off-street public parking lots. RV destination users that need special parking
configurations to visit the Avenue will still be provided with parking options in the district.
          Transitional designs for the Avenue between Jonata and Damassa
          The Urban Design Plan suggests a transitional improvement scenario for the segment of
          the Avenue between Jonata and Damassa. The near term concept suggests that this area
          of the Avenue will remain largely traveler-oriented where highway related uses serve
          visitors seeking easy on-and-off traveler services. The long term concept suggests that
          this area ultimately transition from a largely auto and highway dominated area to a
          destination area similar to the balance of the Study Area.
          Near Term: Traveler-Oriented Circulation from Central to Damassa
          Until the Jonata Avenue intersection is reconfigured, the area between Central and
          Damassa is planned to serve travelers entering the Avenue. Circulation and parallel
          parking for trucks and RVs will be retained in this area separate from the core
          pedestrian oriented district to the south. Highway commercial traffic may be kept
          outside the core area by providing services in this area, which allows easy access to and
          from the highway.
          Southbound there will be two travel lanes with parallel parking on both sides of the
          street. Heading northbound there will be one travel lane with parallel parking on both
          sides. Truck and RV parking will remain on the street in this area. An interim gateway
          feature is proposed at Damassa.

  The Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan Revitalization Area generally includes all of the properties fronting the
Avenue of Flags on the west side, all properties east of Avenue of Flags up to Zaca Creek. The northern boundary of the
Revitalization Area is the Highway 101 off-ramp for Avenue of Flags and the southern boundary is where Zaca Creek passes under
the Avenue south of Highway 246.

         Long Term: Destination/Pedestrian-Oriented Circulation from Central to Damassa
         The long term plan for land uses and circulation improvements between Central and
         Damassa is aimed at creating a pedestrian-oriented environment. With new intersection
         improvements at Jonata, better traffic control will allow for destination uses that front
         along the Avenue. Circulation improvements in the area may include new configuration
         of travel lanes and on street parking. Southbound, there will be one travel lane with
         diagonal parking on the west side of the street. Heading northbound, there will be two
         travel lanes with parallel parking on the east side of the street. Street improvements
         include new gateway monumentation at the Jonata/Central Intersection, street trees, an
         enhanced median with pathway, and pedestrian features such as special paving at
         crosswalks.
Bicycle Circulation
The flat topography, relatively low traffic volumes and compact form of the City make bicycle
riding a viable alternative to the use of motor vehicles in Buellton. For these reasons, bicycle
circulation should be encouraged as a non-polluting transportation mode for local trips,
exercise and recreation.
Although informal trails currently exist along the Santa Ynez River and portions of Zaca Creek,
there are currently a very limited number of dedicated bikeways in the City of Buellton (Kyle
Abello, Buellton Recreation Coordinator, City of Buellton, Written Communication, February
12, 2004). Improvements to route connectivity and intersection safety, however, would promote
bicycle use for transportation and recreation. The City adopted the Buellton Bikeway Master
Plan in 1993 and later incorporated it into the Parks and Recreation Master Plan which was
adopted in 1995. This plan illustrates a number of proposed bike trials including the “Buellton
Loop Trail” which would run along Highway 246 and link Second Street, Central Avenue,
McMurray Road, and Freear Drive.
Bicycle use of the Avenue of Flags was also identified as an issue in the Avenue of
Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan. The plan includes enhanced bicycle connections
between the McMurray Road area and the Avenue.
Bicycle parking/racks are also envisioned along the
Avenue of Flags to promote bicycle ridership.
Pedestrian Circulation
As with bicycle circulation, Buellton's size and
character make walking an attractive transportation
option. Existing residential neighborhoods in the City
are all within relatively short walking distance of
                                                               High Quality Pedestrian Facilities Have Been

areas in the City are centrally located.
Almost all of the streets and roadways in the City have been constructed with sidewalks. The
potential for an urban trails system exists in Buellton along the Santa Ynez River and the
numerous creeks that pass through the City.
                                                                                              City of Buellton

Highway 101, which divides the City from north to south, limits east-west pedestrian and
bicycle circulation. Children walking to school from the Thumbelina residential neighborhood
east of McMurray Road usually travel Highway 246 which leads past a major freeway
interchange where the volume and speed of traffic makes walking an unpleasant and
potentially dangerous experience. Similarly children walking to school from residential
neighborhoods south of Highway 246 must cross Highway 246 to reach Jonata Elementary
School or Oak Valley Elementary School, which is also dangerous given the volume and speed
of traffic. To enable safe and efficient circulation to the new school site and neighborhood
commercial center, one or more new traffic signals will be needed on Highway 246. In addition,
a pedestrian bridge crossing of Highway 101 may be needed.
Pedestrian use of the Avenue of Flags was also identified as an issue in the Avenue of
Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan. The plan concludes that safe, continuous pedestrian
movement can be achieved through the development of new sidewalks at the street edges, a
walkway along the center of the Avenue median, a pedestrian walkway along Zaca Creek and
enhanced pedestrian and bicycle connections between the McMurray Road area and the
Avenue. Improved pedestrian access at Damassa Road, Highway 246 and a potential future
pedestrian bridge connection at the east end of Second Street would also help to improve non-
vehicular access to the Avenue of Flags area.
Buellton is surrounded by open space and ranchland and is adjacent to the Santa Ynez River.
Zaca Creek and Thumbelina Creek pass through the City as tributaries to the River. The creek
corridors and surrounding open space provide an opportunity to establish an urban trail system
through and around the City. Such a trail system could help provide safe routes to school, and
connect the east and west sides of the City.
Public Transit
Santa Ynez Valley Transit (SYVT) is operated by a private contractor under an agreement with
the City of Solvang, which is the system administrator under a Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA) between the Cities of Buellton and Solvang, and Santa Barbara County. SYVT provides
fixed-route and demand-response service. The fixed-route service is available from 7:00 AM to
6:50 PM Monday through Saturday between the City of Buellton and the park –and-ride lot
near the Highway 246/154 junction. The demand-response service includes the cities of
Solvang and Buellton and the unincorporated communities of Santa Ynez, Ballard, and Los
Olivos, and is available Monday through Saturday. The buses are wheelchair accessible, and
drivers will assist in boarding. SYVT offers one-way fares and 12-trip booklets, as well as dial-
a-ride service.
The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (SBMTD) initiated the Santa Ynez Valley
Express commuter bus service in March 2005. The “Valley Express” consists of four buses that
operate Monday through Friday, departing Buellton between 6:20 AM and 7:00 AM, with the
last daily bus arriving in Buellton between 5:27 PM and 6:00 PM. The Valley Express stops in
Buellton at the corner of the Avenue of Flags/Second Street, and provides service to Solvang
and 15 additional stops in the Cities of Goleta and Santa Barbara. The service offers one-way
fares, as well as 10-day and 30-day passes.

Additionally, the Central Coast Shuttle Services, Inc., provides services from Santa Maria and
Buellton to Los Angeles International Airport. Greyhound Lines, Inc. also operates inter-city
bus service, providing two daily round trips linking Buellton, Lompoc and Santa Maria with
destinations to the north and south county.
Circulation Element Map
Figure C-1 is the Circulation Element Map for the City of Buellton. The map describes
improvements to the circulation system necessary to meet the present and future needs of the
City in support of the land uses described in the Land Use Element. The Circulation Element
Map assigns a roadway classification to the streets and highways serving the City, which are
described below (refer to Figure C-2 for standard roadway cross sections in the City):
Local Streets
Local streets serve adjacent properties, only, and carry little through traffic and low traffic
volumes. Speed limits on local roadways normally do not exceed 25 miles per hour. New local
streets should generally have a right-of-way of 60 feet in width.
Collector Streets
Collector streets provide a link between local streets and roadways with higher traffic capacity,
such as arterials and highways (see below). Usually, several local streets will connect to a
common collector street. Collectors may also serve adjacent properties. Generally, collectors
carry light to moderate traffic volumes, and speed limits are usually between 25 to 45 miles per
hour. The Circulation Element distinguishes between two types of collector streets.
         Residential Collectors
         Residential collectors provide the connection between local streets serving residential
         neighborhoods and the arterials and commercial collectors that provide connections to
         other parts of the City. Residential collectors are intended to carry higher traffic volumes
         than local streets, but lower volumes than commercial collectors or arterials. Speed
         limits on residential collectors normally do not exceed 25 miles per hour. Roadways
         designated as residential collectors by the Circulation Element include Calor Drive and
         Second Street.
         Commercial/Industrial Collectors
         Commercial collectors are intended to provide access to commercial areas from arterials
         and the freeway. Commercial collectors carry higher traffic volumes than local
         commercial streets and may serve as a 'minor arterial' in areas where commercial traffic
         is shared with traffic utilizing the freeway interchanges and Highway 246. The Avenue
         of Flags and McMurray Road, among others, are designated as commercial collectors.

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Circulation Element
Arterial Roadways and Rural Highways
Arterial roadways are fed by local, collector and other arterial roadways, and provide for cross-
City travel. Arterials carry larger volumes of traffic, and usually consist of two to four lanes
divided by a median or left-turn lane. Because of the high traffic speeds and traffic volumes, no
direct access to adjacent properties should be provided from arterials, except where access to
more than one property may be consolidated in safe locations. Such access may be restricted to
right-turn-in, right-turn-out only movements. Speed limits on arterials are usually at least 40
miles per hour. Highway 246 is classified as an arterial.
Rural highways serve a similar role as arterials, but primarily provide connections between
urban areas. Traffic volumes are similar, but speeds are usually higher (up to 55 miles per
hour).
Freeways
Freeways serve both inter-City and intra-City travel. Freeways carry high volumes of traffic at
high speeds, and provide no access to adjacent properties. Traffic is carried to freeways by
collector and arterial streets; access to the freeway is then provided by on-ramps, rather than
intersections. Freeways provide connections to other regional highways and usually have the
highest speed limits allowed by law. Highway 101 is the only freeway in the Buellton area.
Circulation Standards
The most often used indicator of the ability of a roadway or intersection to accommodate traffic
is Level of Service (LOS), which sets a standard based on a scale from LOS "A", free-flow
conditions, to LOS "F", which refers to unstable conditions approaching gridlock. A more
complete description of each Level of Service standard is contained in the General Plan Update
Baseline Report.
All of the signalized intersections within the City currently operate at LOS B or better during
the P.M. peak hour periods. The delayed movements at all the unsignalized City intersections
operate at LOS C or better during the P.M. peak hour period.
It should be noted, however, that although all of the study area intersections technically operate
at acceptable levels of service, the intersection of Jonata Park Road/Avenue of Flags has been
identified as problematic due to safety concerns. The intersection of Jonata Park Road/Avenue
of Flags is located immediately adjacent to the U.S. Highway 101 southbound off-ramp to
Avenue of Flags, which presents a potential safety hazard due to the high speed of vehicles
exiting the highway and the angle of right-turns from the off-ramp onto Jonata Park Road. In
addition, to improve general circulation through the City and relieve potential future
congestion on Highway 246, the City anticipates the need for future roadway connections
between McMurray Road and Highway 246 at approximately Freear Drive (behind the Buellton
Town Center shopping center).
Several intersections in the City are forecasted to operate at an unacceptable LOS D or worse
with General Plan buildout traffic. These intersections include the Highway 246 intersections at
Industrial Way (northbound approach only), Avenue of Flags, McMurray Road, and the
                                                                                       City of Buellton

Circulation Element
Highway 101 northbound ramps, and the Damassa Road/Highway 101 intersection at the
westbound through/right-turn lane and eastbound through/left-turn lane. Programmatic
implementation of transportation infrastructure improvements, including improvements to the
Highway 101/Damassa Road interchange, Highway 101/ Highway 246 interchange, Highway
246/McMurray Road intersection (lane additions), and/or Highway 246/Industrial Way
intersection (signalization), would return traffic levels of service to acceptable levels. Future
development projects in the City would be required to pay a fair share of the cost of identified
improvements to mitigate their incremental impacts.
                                                                                        City of Buellton

                                                 Policies
General Policies
C-1      The City should support county-wide and local programs to reduce the number of
         vehicle trips associated with employment, school attendance and shopping.
C-2      Facilities that promote the use of alternate modes of transportation, including bicycle
         lanes and connections, pedestrian and hiking trails, park-and-ride lots and facilities for
         public transit shall be incorporated where feasible into new development, and shall be
         encouraged in existing development.
C-3      The City will continue to support the policies and programs of the Santa Barbara County
         Congestion Management Plan.
C-4      New development shall be required to dedicate easements and incorporate circulation
         features promoted in the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan or
         otherwise contribute toward the cost of completing such features at a later date. These
         circulation features include: (i) creation of secondary access along the Avenue of Flags
         between Highway 246 and Damassa Road, interconnecting parking lots at rear of parcels
         along the easterly side of the Avenue; (ii) improvement of the existing alleyway for
         parcels along the westerly side of the Avenue; and (iii) development of a pedestrian
         walkway along Zaca Creek.
Streets Policies
C-5      Level of Service "C" or better traffic conditions shall generally be maintained on all
         streets and intersections, lower levels of service may be accepted during peak times or as
         a temporary condition, if improvements to address the problem are programmed to be
         developed.
C-6      The street system in new residential neighborhoods should have safe and logical
         connections to the existing street pattern. New local streets shall be consistent with the
         goals, policies and programs of the Land Use Element of the General Plan.
C-7      The City should discourage new commercial or industrial development that allows
         customers, employees or deliveries to use residential streets. The circulation system
                                                                                        City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Circulation Element
         should be designed so that non-residential traffic (especially truck traffic) is confined to
         nonresidential areas.
C-8      The City should manage the street network so that the standards presented in policy C-
         10 are not exceeded. The City will require new development to mitigate the traffic
         impacts it causes, or the City will limit development along streets where congestion
         levels are unacceptable.
C-9      The number of new driveways on Highway 246 should be minimized.
C-10     The following standards apply to the streets and truck circulation routes shown on
         Figure C-1.

C-12     Traffic calming measures shall be implemented at all arterial approaches to the City.
         Such measures shall be designed to slow traffic entering City Limits and enhance
         pedestrian, bicyclist and motorist safety.
Transit Policies
C-13     Public transit to surrounding communities should be encouraged.
C-14     A ridesharing program shall be expanded as appropriate in Buellton to encourage
         carpooling for trips to other communities.
Parking Policies
C-15     Parking and storage for recreational vehicles and boats should be provided so as not to
         compete with or diminish the availability of off-street parking is available for passenger
         vehicles. In particular, RV and boat parking within the Avenue Revitalization Area
         should be accommodated as recommended in the Urban Design Plan.
C-16     The City shall require the provision of adequate off-street parking in conjunction with
         all new development. Parking shall be located convenient to new development and shall
         be easily accessible from the street. The City may reduce required off-street parking for
         projects that employ transit demand management strategies that reduce vehicle trips to
         the site, where there is on-street angular parking along the Avenue of Flags, and for
                                                                                              City of Buellton

         mixed use shared parking. The adequacy and appropriateness of parking requirements
         in the Zoning Ordinance shall be periodically evaluated and adjusted, if necessary.
Bicycle Circulation Policies
C-17     The City shall support safe and effective connectivity between adjacent neighborhoods
         for all new development and shall pursue such connectivity for existing neighborhoods,
         where necessary and appropriate (e.g., provision of a bicycle/pedestrian connection
         between the Thumbelina neighborhood and Ballard Canyon Road).
C-18     The City shall revise and implement the Buellton Bikeway Master Plan, and promote the
         goals of establishing a continuous bicycle/walking network around the City connecting
         with other nearby communities where possible, improving bicycle safety, convenience
         and awareness, increasing commuter and recreational opportunity with emphasis on
         environmental enhancement, and providing for thorough implementation of the
         Bikeway as described in the Bikeways Master Plan.
C-19     Existing and planned bikeways are described in the Buellton Bikeways Master Plan. The
         Bikeway network should be developed when:
         a) street sections are repaved, restriped, or changes are made to its cross-sectional
               design,
         b) street sections are being changed as part of a development project,
         c) new development or expansions of existing development are on or adjacent to
               property where planned bikeway improvements are located, or
         d) the construction of bike lanes or paths is called for by the City’s Capital Improvement
               Plan.
C-20     In the process of considering development proposals the City shall use the full amount
         of discretion authorized in the municipal code and CEQA for setting conditions of
         approval to require new development to provide bicycle storage and parking facilities
         on-site as well as reserve an offer of dedication of right-of-way necessary for bikeway
         improvements.
C-21     The City should encourage that bike racks are installed on regional transit vehicles.
C-22     New ridesharing facilities in the City shall include bike lockers and/or racks.
Pedestrian Circulation Policies
C-23     The City should complete a continuous network of sidewalks and separated pedestrian
         paths connecting housing areas with major activity centers such as shopping areas,
         schools, and recreation.
C-24     New development should provide sidewalks and pedestrian paths consistent with
         applicable State, federal and local plans, programs and standards.
                                                                                        City of Buellton

C-25     Pedestrian crossings at heavily traveled intersections should be made as safe as possible.
         Crossing controls should be installed when traffic levels or pedestrian demand warrants,
         or as a result of demand modeling.
C-26     A pedestrian/bicycle crossing of the 101 freeway should be considered as a supplement
         to Highway 246 as determined by the Buellton Planning Commission and City Council.
         Possible locations are the easterly extension of Second Street to McMurray Road, and/or
         widening and enhancing the Damassa Road or Highway 246 overpasses to safely
         accommodate bicycles and pedestrians.
C-27     Establish and maintain safe paths to school for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
                                                Programs
It should be noted that the program timeframes identified below represent tentative estimates.
Actual timeframes for program implementation will depend upon staff and funding
availability, and other factors.
1.       The City shall pursue funding and preparation of a Project Study Report (PSR) for the
         entirety of the Highway 101 and Highway 246 corridors through the City to identify
         appropriate alternatives for local and regional improvements to address projected future
         traffic congestion at the Highway 246 intersections at McMurray Road, and the Highway
         101 northbound ramps, and at the Damassa Road/Highway 101 interchange. The cost
         of the PSR shall be added to the City’s traffic mitigation fee program. The PSR shall
         investigate the following potential future improvements to these facilities:
         •     Construction of a new Highway 101/Jonata Road interchange at the northerly City
               limits. Implementation of the future Highway 101 interchange option at the
               northerly City limits should be coordinated with land use and development plans
               related to Key Sites I and II.
         •     Improvements to the Highway 101/Highway 246 interchange, including the
               addition of an exclusive right-turn lane on the westbound Highway 246 approach to
               the Highway 101 northbound on-ramp.
         •     Improvements to the Highway 246/McMurray Road intersection, including the
               addition of lanes on the eastbound and westbound Highway 246 approaches to
               McMurray Road.
         •     Improvements to the Damassa Road interchange between McMurray Road and
               Avenue of Flags to accommodate projected traffic flows at buildout and pedestrian
               circulation. Interchange improvements should consider intersection operations (and
               possible improvements) at the Damassa Road/Avenue of Flags intersection and the
               Damassa Road/McMurray Road intersections. Pedestrian circulation improvements
               should consider widening the overpass or limiting vehicle use of the overpass.
         •     Widening of the two-lane segment of McMurray Road between Highway 246 and
               Damassa Road.
         •     Construction of a roadway interconnection behind Albertsons shopping center to
               better integrate and provide secondary access for adjacent parcels back to Highway
                                                                                       City of Buellton

               246 and to relieve congestion on the Highway 246 intersections with McMurray
               Road and the Highway 101 ramps.
         •     Implementation of northbound Highway 101 hook ramps to and from McMurray
               Road south or north of Highway 246. Access linkage between Highway 101 hook
               ramps north of Highway 246, at Second Street, and the Oak Springs Village Specific
               Plan site should be evaluated.
         •     Reconfiguration of the Jonata Road/Central Avenue/Highway 101 off-ramp to
               improve safety and calm traffic exiting Highway 101. The reconfiguration may
               include one of the following improvements: a 4-way stop; realignment of the 101 off
               ramp at Jonata Park Road; the addition of median left turn channelization for autos
               to merge onto the Avenue (see Figures C-3 and C-4 below).

         Highway 101 northbound ramps, and at the Damassa Road/Highway 101 interchange
         to determine the timing of future traffic facility improvements as identified in the Project
         Study Report (PSR) (refer to Program 1). Monitoring should consist of traffic counts
         conducted during peak travel periods at these intersections, a review of the City’s
         progress toward land use buildout and associated traffic implications, and an
         assessment of the availability of funds for improvements to these intersections and
         interchanges. The traffic monitoring should be coordinated with the annual review of
         the City’s Housing Element.

3.       As new development occurs, the intersections of Highway 246 with roadways west of
         Avenue of Flags, including Sycamore Drive and La Lata Drive shall be periodically
         monitored to evaluate the need for a traffic signal or other arrangements to
         accommodate safe traffic and pedestrian circulation. As a demonstration project, the
         City should divert Highway 246 side street traffic to Sycamore Drive by creating cul de
         sacs at the northern and southern Riverview Drive and Calor Drive approaches to
         Highway 246. As warranted, the City should implement part of the West End

Conservation and Open Space Element
                       Conservation and Open Space Element
Introduction
Conservation of open space within and around Buellton will contribute to the City’s quality of
life. Buellton is characterized by its agricultural and naturally scenic setting that provides
economic and recreational opportunities. Agricultural lands supply a great source of income to
business and employees in the Buellton area. Scenic land is a prized asset to Buellton and will
remain one of the principal attractions for residents and visitors of the City. The City will
preserve land for recreational activities, and encourage private recreational developments and
other uses beneficial for the residents of the City.
The Conservation and Open Space Element establishes policies and programs to protect and
preserve the natural resources in and around Buellton, including creeks, hillsides and scenic
areas.
Waters Resources and Water Quality
Major surface water features within the City are described below and shown on Figure C/OS-1.
Zaca Creek, Thumbelina Creek and Petersen Creek all flow through Buellton to the Santa Ynez
River, which borders the City to the south. Nojoqui Creek flows north and joins the Santa Ynez
River south of the City limits.
The Santa Ynez River watershed, located in central Santa Barbara County, California, is about
900 square miles in area. The Santa Ynez River flows west about 90 miles from its headwaters at
4,000 feet in the San Rafael Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Bradbury Dam and Cachuma
Reservoir, located 48.7 river miles from the ocean, splits the watershed nearly in half.
Immediately upstream from Cachuma Reservoir, the river passes through a narrow trough
between the mountains. Below Cachuma Reservoir, the river flows over broad alluvial
floodplains. West of Buellton, it
flows through a narrow
meandering stretch to the Lompoc
Narrows and outlets to the Pacific
Ocean after emerging onto the
broad, flat Lompoc Plain.
The City’s main water sources are
a State Water allotment and four
groundwater wells, three of which
are located adjacent to the Santa
Ynez River and one of which is
located at 140 West Highway 246.
Groundwater used by the City
draws from the Santa Ynez River
Alluvial Basin and Buellton
Uplands Basin.                          Santa Ynez River
                                                                                       City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Conservation and Open Space Element
The Buellton Uplands Groundwater Basin encompasses about 29 square miles located about 18
miles east of the Pacific Ocean and directly north of the Santa Ynez River. The Santa Ynez River
Riparian Basin sediments overlie portions of the Buellton Uplands in the south-east part of the
basin. Due to the hydrologic gradient (generally north to south), it is likely that the Buellton
Uplands Basin discharges into the Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin. The Santa Barbara County
Water Agency (SBCWA) has estimated average annual rainfall in the basin to be about 16 inches
per year (Santa Barbara County Groundwater Report, 2005).
The Santa Ynez River Alluvial Basin consists of the unconsolidated sand and gravel alluvial
deposits of the Santa Ynez River. These deposits are up to 150 feet thick and several hundred
feet across, and extend 36 miles from Bradbury Dam to the Lompoc Plain. Groundwater in the
Alluvial Basin is in direct hydraulic communication with surface flow of the river. Inflow to the
basin is from underflow from adjacent basins (Santa Ynez Uplands, Buellton Uplands, and
Lompoc Basin) and percolation from rainfall and infiltration of river flow. In accordance with
existing requirements included in State Water Resources Control Board agreements, water is
released from Cachuma Reservoir to recharge the Alluvial Basin based on water levels in
monitoring wells and "credits" of water held in reservoir storage. Thus, the Cachuma Project at
certain times, controls basin water levels. This basin is not subject to overdraft (i.e. a progressive
long-term drop in water levels) because the average annual flow to the Santa Ynez River (the
main recharge source) is greater than the volume of the basin. Water is extracted from this basin
for municipal and agricultural uses by many entities both private and public (Santa Barbara
County Groundwater Report, 2005).
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM;
September 30, 2005) of the Buellton area indicate there is the potential for flooding along the
Santa Ynez River, Zaca Creek, and Thumbelina Creek. Much of the downtown area south of
Highway 246 is designated as a floodway fringe of the Santa Ynez River and lands adjacent to
both Zaca and Thumbelina Creeks are subject to flooding during major storm events. Refer to
the Safety Element for policies and programs related to flood hazards. Flood hazard areas are
depicted on Figure S-3 of the Safety Element.
Both Thumbelina and Zaca Creeks have been modified by human activities over the years.
Zaca Creek north of Highway 246 and adjacent to Pea Soup Andersen's has been directed
underground in a culvert. In addition, the southerly section of Zaca Creek and the northerly
section near Thomas Avenue have been channelized. The westerly end of Thumbelina Creek
terminates in a concrete drainage channel adjacent to 272/280 East Highway 246 (Nielson's
Market).
No natural lakes of any substantial size are located within the City. However, Lake Cachuma is
located about seven miles upstream of Buellton on the Santa Ynez River. It is the main source of
water for much of southern Santa Barbara County, including the City of Santa Barbara, the City
of Goleta, the City of Carpinteria, the City of Lompoc, Montecito, Summerland, and the Santa
Ynez River Water Conservation District. The Bureau of Reclamation releases water from Lake

Topography
The topography within the City ranges from nearly flat with hillsides to the north and to the
south across the Santa Ynez River. The elevation of the Santa Ynez River bed drops at a gentle
gradient. Topography immediately north of the riverbed is characterized by a gently sloping
alluvial terrace rising to the gently rolling hillsides that comprise the area north of the City
limits. Most of the City north of the Santa Ynez River has an average elevation of
approximately 350 feet above sea level. In the hills to the north and northeast of the City, hills
rise to an elevation of 800 feet.
Water Quality
The primary sources of pollution in surface and groundwater resources include stormwater
runoff from paved areas, which can contain hydrocarbons, sediments, pesticides, herbicides,
toxic metals, and coliform bacteria. Seepage from sewage treatment lagoons can further
contribute to degraded water quality in the form of elevated nitrate levels. Improperly placed
septic tank leach fields can cause similar types of contamination. Illegal waste dumping can
introduce contaminants such as gasoline, pesticides, herbicides and other harmful chemicals.
Septic tanks are also a source of pollution to some wells in both alluvial and granitic rocks.
Septic tanks discharging into alluvium have a high potential to pollute wells producing from
the same deposit because of high permeability and low gradient. In the winter, the rains raise
the water table in these areas, which can exacerbate possible contamination.
Current water quality data for the Buellton Uplands Groundwater basin is limited. However,
data from the late 1950s and early 1960s indicate total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations
between 300 and 700 mg/l for several wells within the basin (Santa Barbara County
Groundwater Report, 2005).
The quality of the water from the Santa Ynez Valley River Basin is good, but the basin has high
concentrations of manganese and iron, which cause discoloration and an objectionable taste.
The City uses the riparian basin as an additional water source, but the water is treated before it
is delivered to residences and businesses. The water delivered by the City meets all applicable
standards for quality for domestic water supplies.
A well network has been established by the SBCWA to monitor changes in the water quality in
relation to changing activities and natural features. Monitoring is a joint effort by the SBCWA,
the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the City of Buellton. Ground water depths are
monitored once or twice per year. The data is used by the SBCWA for more efficient
groundwater management and planning (Santa Barbara County Groundwater Report, 2005).
Agricultural Land/Soils
Buellton is surrounded by agricultural parcels ranging in size from 10 to 200 acres. Agriculture
outside the City includes grazing and pasture land to the north, west, and east, and crop
production to the south adjacent to the Santa Ynez River. Within the City, there is no land
currently zoned for agriculture. It should be noted, however, that approximately 15 acres along
                                                                                        City of Buellton

the northernmost edge of the City and approximately 10 acres along the southern edge of the
City, near Highway 101, are currently used for pasture and rotational crops, respectively.
The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Natural
Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) has surveyed and mapped
soils complexes in Buellton
(see Figure C/OS-2). The NRCS has
developed a system for classifying soils
in accordance with their capability to
support certain types of agriculture
operations. The system uses a scale
from I to VIII, with Class I having the
most desirable characteristics, and
Class VIII having the least desirable
characteristics. Soils classes I and II are
considered prime agricultural land.
Within the City, soils vary in quality.        Existing Croplands Located Just Outside City Limits
Plants and Animals
The City is situated in the Santa Ynez Valley and bound by the Santa Ynez River to the south
and the foothills of the outer Coast Ranges to the north. The City is primarily characterized by
urban land uses. Accordingly, the City supports ornamental, non-native, and native plant and
wildlife habitats. Ornamental plant communities are located throughout the residential,
commercial and industrial areas of the City. Non-native annual grassland occurs within urban
areas and on the fringes of native habitat types. A brief description of these habitats and
potential common wildlife that use them follows. Plant communities of special concern are also
discussed, and special-status plant and wildlife species potentially occurring within these
habitats are further discussed below in the special-status plant and wildlife species section.
Habitat Types
         Riparian
         Within the City, the
         riparian habitat type is
         primarily associated with
         the Santa Ynez River and is
         a combination of woodland
         and scrub. Limited
         amounts of riparian habitat
         are also located along
                                          Zaca Creek Riparian Habitat
         Zaca Creek and
         Thumbelina Creek as this habitat type has been impacted and fragmented by urban
         development. Limited riparian habitat could also be found in smaller tributary
         drainages. Typical riparian trees in the City include cotton wood (Populus spp.),
                                                                                                   City of Buellton

         willow (Salix spp.) and coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia). Many of the common shrubs of
         coastal scrub habitat grow on the upland fringe of riparian species and include coyote
         brush (Baccharis pilularis var. consanguinea) and wild rose species (Rosa spp.).
         The multi-layered riparian habitat types provide some of the highest quality habitat and
         wildlife diversity, including cover, forage, water, nesting habitat, and movement
         corridor opportunities for a variety of species. Some of the birds expected to occur
         within this habitat include common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), Nuttall's
         woodpecker (Picoides nuttallii), yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), and song sparrow
         (Melospiza melodia). Riparian habitats also provide roosting and foraging habitat for
         several raptor species. Amphibians and reptiles expected to occur within this habitat
         include Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla), common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis),
         and western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis).
         Because of its high value for wildlife and overall decline statewide, riparian habitat is
         considered a plant community of special concern by the California Department of Fish
         and Game (CDFG). The past losses of riparian habitat throughout central and southern
         California have resulted in a decline in the population of certain plant and wildlife
         species that are uniquely associated with this habitat type. Additionally, the national
         inventory of wetland plants (Reed 1988) lists cottonwoods and willows as facultative
         wetland (FACW) species, which could potentially indicate a protected wetland resource.
         The Santa Ynez River riparian corridor is one of the City’s major riparian wetland
         resources. Many migratory bird species are restricted to riparian habitat and depend on
         it for breeding. Overall wildlife diversity is normally higher in riparian zones than in
         surrounding habitat. Natural drainages and associated vegetation also function to
         control water quality and provide local and regional wildlife corridors. Modifications to
         riparian habitat may require permits and/or authorization from the CDFG, U.S. Army
         Corps of Engineers (Corps), Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), or the
         United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Additional regulatory information is
         provided in the Regulatory Framework section below.
         Oak Woodland
         Oak woodland elements and occasional oak woodlands occur in the City. Oak
         woodland is situated in patches that co-mingle with non-native annual grassland and
         coastal scrub habitat types. The dominant trees observed in these areas were primarily
         coast live oak, although blue oak (Quercus douglasii) occasionally mixes with coast live
         oak on hillsides. Understory associated with the oak woodlands is either non-native
         annual grassland or the neighboring coastal scrub elements.
         Oak woodlands, in general, provide high quality habitat for a variety of wildlife species
         as they provide nesting sites, cover, and food for many birds and mammals. Oak
         woodland is expected to provide habitat for acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus),
         Nuttall's woodpecker (Picoides nuttallii), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), scrub jay
         (Aphelocoma corulescens), western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus), and mule deer
         (Odocoileus hemionus) in addition to other wildlife species.

         Coastal Scrub
         Coastal scrub habitat occurs mainly adjacent to riparian habitat within the Santa Ynez
         River corridor. Coastal scrub habitat consists almost exclusively of coyote brush with
         occasional blue elderberry (Sambucus mexicana) closer to the River.
         Coastal scrub habitat types typically provide cover and nesting for a variety of
         mammals, birds, and reptiles common to the Central Coast region. This habitat type is
         limited in size in the City and likely contains wildlife typical of the adjacent grassland,
         oak woodland, and riparian habitat types.
         Wetlands
         Wetlands include a variety of habitats that are characterized by a prevalence of
         hydrophytic (water-loving) vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland hydrology. Wetland
         habitat in the City is likely to exist in areas where drainages and creeks converge with
         the Santa Ynez River floodplain. Wetlands could also occur further upstream along
         drainages or in topographic depressions in and around the river floodplain and adjacent
         agricultural ponds. Uniform stands of bulrushes (Scirpus spp.) or cattail (Typha spp.)
         often characterize this habitat, but it can also be characterized by short herbaceous
         vegetation such as rushes (Juncus spp.) and sedges (Carex spp.).
         Many wildlife species depend on wetland habitats for foraging, nesting, water, and
         cover. Wetlands provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates such as water striders and
         boatmen, amphibians such as the Pacific tree frog, and birds such as red-winged
         blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and great egret (Casmerodius albus). The non-native and
         invasive bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) has overtaken a number of these areas.
         Due to the great reduction and alteration of wetland habitats in California since the early
         1900s, wetland habitats have been identified by the CNDDB as a plant community of
         special concern. Modifications to wetland habitat may require permits and/or
         authorization from the CDFG, Corps, RWQCB, or the USFWS. Additional regulatory
         information is provided in the Regulatory Framework section below.
         Non-native Annual Grassland
         This habitat type occurs in limited amounts within urbanized areas throughout the City.
         It also occurs in openings of and as an understory within oak woodland and coastal
         scrub habitats. Non-native annual grassland can also be found interspersed with
         riparian habitat. Most of the dominant species in the grasslands are a mix of introduced
         annual grasses of Eurasian origin such as rip-gut brome (Bromus diandrus), and broad-
         leafed exotic plant species such as perennial mustard (Hirschfeldia incana), horse weed
         (Conyza canadensis), and white-stemmed filaree (Erodium moschatum).
         Grasslands on a regional scale provide habitat for small mammals which in turn serve as
         a prey base for a variety of animals, including snakes, raptors (“birds of prey”), coyotes
         (Canis latrans), and bobcat (Lynx rufus). The grasslands within infill areas do not support
                                                                                         City of Buellton

         as diverse a flora and fauna as grasslands of the region because they are surrounded by
         urban development and are likely to have been disturbed in the past.
         Non-native annual grasslands are not considered a plant community of special concern
         as this habitat type is common throughout the region and state. A caveat to this finding
         is in those instances where special status resources (such as rare plants) and their
         specific microhabitat are found within non-native annual grassland habitat. The specific
         microhabitat within the non-native annual grassland would be considered sensitive in
         addition to any setback distance that may be specified by the resource agencies.
         Although most of the grassland habitat within the City is non-native annual grassland,
         patches of native perennial grassland may exist. Native perennial bunch grasses
         generally occur in small amounts within non-native annual grassland and are included
         with the non-native annual grassland habitat type description. If occurrences of native
         perennial bunchgrass habitat of 0.5 acre or greater with 10% or greater coverage are
         identified, the specific occurrences would be considered native bunchgrass habitat and
         may be under the scrutiny of the CDFG due to the statewide loss of this habitat type.
         Urban Landscape
         The City is predominantly urbanized. Urban plant habitat types are primarily
         composed of ornamental non-native shrubs, trees, and grasses. Some of the plant
         species present include pine (Pinus spp.), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.), and juniper
         (Juniperus spp.). These areas provide habitat for a variety of native and non-native
         wildlife, including northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), European starling (Sturnus
         vulgaris), American robin (Turdus migratorius), scrub jay, house sparrow (Passer
         domesticus), house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), acorn woodpecker, mourning dove
         (Zenaida macroura), Brewer’s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus), turkey vulture
         (Cathartes aura), western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, gopher snake, California
         ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyi), and Botta’s pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae).
Special-Status Species
For the purpose of this report, special-status species are those plants and animals listed,
proposed for listing, or candidates for listing as threatened or endangered by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA); those considered
“species of concern” by the USFWS; those listed or proposed for listing as rare, threatened, or
endangered by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) under the California
Endangered Species Act (CESA); animals designated as “Species of Special Concern” by the
CDFG; and the CDFG Special Vascular Plants, Bryophytes, and Lichens List (September 2004). This
latter document includes the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) Inventory of Rare and
Endangered Vascular Plants of California, Sixth Edition (Tibor, 2001) as updated online. Those
plants contained on CNPS lists 1B and 2 are considered special status species.
The following species information is based on a review of the California Natural Diversity

status plants and animal species that could potentially occur in the City was compiled using the
CNDDB data and available literature cited previously.
         Special-Status Plants
         The CNDDB contains records of 9 special-status plant species that are known from
         relatively localized occurrences near the City. Undisturbed, native habitat is limited in
         the City especially for habitat types other than riparian. Although there is the potential
         for some of the following species to occur within the City, their occurrences would be
         limited due to the fragmentation and size of the remaining suitable habitat, with the
         exception of those found within the Santa Ynez River. The following lists the habitat
         types that occur within the City and the special-status plant species that could be found
         within these habitat types.

               It is unlikely that any special-status plant species would occur in areas that have
               been landscaped.
Special-Status Wildlife
The CNDDB recognizes 25 special-status wildlife species that are known from the vicinity.
Potential occurrence is based on the availability and quality of suitable habitat.

         Amphibians/Reptiles
         The western spadefoot toad and California tiger salamander (CTS) breed in seasonal
         water sources such as vernal pools, but utilize upland grassland habitat as aestivation (a
         form of hibernation) sites. However, according to the lack of suitable habitat and
         distance to recorded occurrences of CTS, the likelihood for CTS to occur within the City
         and its environs is very low. California red-legged frog (CRLF) and two-striped garter
         snake (TSGS) typically require permanent water sources associated with dense
         vegetation. The Santa Ynez River is known as a seasonal river. However, during times
         when water is flowing, water could collect and remain throughout the year in localized
         pools. If perennial water sources are present, TSGS could be present. The western
         spadefoot could occur within the City if the water sources are seasonal in nature and do
         not allow perpetuation of predator species. Regardless of the presence of water, all three
         species could use upland habitat for movement between suitable habitat sites.
         Tributaries to the River and other water sources such as agricultural ponds in the
         vicinity of the City could provide suitable habitat for these species. Southern Pacific
         pond turtle also requires a permanent water source but lays its eggs along banks of
         creeks and ponds and can nest up to one-half mile away in adjacent uplands. There is
         potential for this species to inhabit permanent water sources including streams, ponds,
         and irrigation ditches within agricultural land. Silvery legless lizard and coast horned
         lizard could occur in the sandy soils of the Santa Ynez River or other scrub areas with
         loose soil and scattered vegetation.
         Birds
         Several bird species, such as the Cooper’s hawk, ferruginous hawk, golden eagle, sharp-
         shinned hawk, white-tailed kite, loggerhead shrikes, northern harrier, tricolored
         blackbird, burrowing owl, California horned larks, yellow warblers, yellow-breasted
         chat, and willow flycatcher could forage, roost, or breed in habitats located in the City,
         such as oak woodlands, riparian areas, and/or native grasslands.
         Least Bell’s vireo (LBV), and southwestern willow flycatcher (SWWF) are known to
         occur within the Santa Ynez River region. One LBV and five pairs of SWWF in addition
         to ten SWWF nests containing young were observed in the riparian habitat within the
         Santa Ynez River along the southern boundary of the City of Buellton (Greaves, 2002).
         Fish
         Steelhead require fast flowing, highly oxygenated, clear, cool fresh water where riffles
         tend to predominate pools. Steelhead are expected to occur in the Santa Ynez River
         during times in which it is flowing and is connected to the Pacific Ocean. West coast
         steelhead populations have been divided into 15 Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs)
         based on natural geographic boundaries that foster genetic isolation. Each ESU is
         treated as a distinct population by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) for
         determination on the need for listing as threatened or endangered. The specific
         geographic area(s) that are essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered
         species and that may require special management and protection are designated as
                                                                                       City of Buellton

         critical habitat by the USFWS and NMFS. The Santa Ynez River is included in critical
         habitat in Santa Barbara County for the Southern California ESU for steelhead. Critical
         habitat is designated to include all river reaches accessible to listed steelhead within the
         range of the ESU up to the first natural or manmade barrier, in this case the Bradbury
         Dam.
         Mammals
         American badgers occur most frequently in open grasslands where there is an
         abundance of ground squirrels and gophers. Although it is unlikely due to the
         proximity of urban areas to grasslands, this species could occur in grassland habitats on
         the outskirts of the City. The non-native grasslands in the City could also provide
         foraging habitat for Pallid bat. Roost sites could be found within oak and riparian
         woodland adjacent to grasslands, and sometimes in crevices in urban structures.
Wildlife Movement Corridors
An approximate 2-mile section of the Santa Ynez River skirts the southern boundary of the City.
Zaca and Thumbelina Creeks and other drainages also wind through the City. The Santa Ynez
River is considered an important wildlife dispersal and migration corridor for a variety of
wildlife species. As mentioned previously, the River is designated by the CDFG as a Southern
California Steelhead Stream and as such is considered to provide habitat for steelhead during
times when the river is flowing. Zaca and Thumbelina Creeks provided wildlife corridors of
limited quality due to surrounding urban development, especially Thumbelina Creek, which is
mainly concrete lined. Past urban development has decreased the aerial extent of riparian
habitat adjacent to the Creeks that could provide cover for some species while traversing these
corridors. The Creeks are also crossed by roadways, including Highways 246 and 101, which
further limit their value as movement corridors.
Visual Resources
The visual character of the Buellton area is a combination of a natural and built environment.
The rural County areas adjacent to the City are primarily intact visually as natural or
agricultural countryside.
The three major components of the Buellton visual setting are the topography, the vegetation,
and the character of its built environment. The parallel ridgelines to the north and south
provide a scenic backdrop to the community, while the surrounding fields establish a pastoral
feeling. The Santa Ynez River provides a natural visual boundary to the City in the south. The
River, as well as Thumbelina and Zaca Creeks, include visually important riparian habitat along
their channels.
Recent developments in the City have been constructed in accordance with the City’s
Community Design Guidelines. In addition, design improvements have been implemented
along Avenue of Flags in accordance with the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Design Plan.
These design documents are described in the paragraphs below.
                                                                                         City of Buellton

         Community Design Guidelines
         The City of Buellton Community Design Guidelines, adopted in November 2005,
         describe desirable elements encouraged to be incorporated into new developments and
         redevelopment community-wide within the City of Buellton. The Design Guidelines
         focus on single-family residential, multi-family residential, commercial and commercial
         mixed-use and industrial land uses. Fundamentally, the Design Guidelines are intended
         to aid property owners, designers, and decision-makers by providing a clear statement
         of the City’s expectations for new development.
         The Design Guidelines reflect architectural influences of the surrounding farms and
         ranches of the Santa Ynez Valley, and to a lesser extent, the California Missions. The
         Design Guidelines provide an architectural focus with a mix of Agrarian, Mission
         Revival, Ranch, and Contemporary Ranch styles.
         Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan
         The Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan, adopted in December 2002,
         includes recommendations for beautification and enhancement of the Avenue of Flags.
         The objectives of the Urban Design Plan are: to identify and located “Gateway”
         improvements to the Avenue and the downtown district; to help unify vehicular signage
         for the traveling public; to enhance and promote the increase usage of the medians
         within the right of way; to develop design options for the reconfiguration of the Avenue
         right of way including increased parking opportunities, widened sidewalks, lane
         reductions and traffic calming features; and to provide a streetscape “Master Plan” to
         identify and locate physical improvements on the Avenue. This includes sidewalk
         widening and improvements, new landscape treatment, lighting, street furniture
         recommendations, and urban design strategies to emphasize pedestrian use and safety
         on the Avenue. Several Avenue of Flags design improvements, such as a median
         sculpture garden, other median landscaping and improvements, and pedestrian and
         parking improvements, have been implemented.
Commercial buildings constructed prior to 2005 do not reflect a particular unifying style or
theme, but rather reflect the individual tastes of owners at the time of construction. The result is
a mix of architectural styles, including Victorian, Spanish, contemporary commercial, western
storefront, and half-timber. However, recent commercial and industrial projects have been
designed and constructed in accordance with the Community Design Guidelines, which
provide an architectural focus with a mix of Agrarian, Mission Revival, Ranch, and
Contemporary Ranch styles. In addition, while vacant lots and gas stations create gaps in the
commercial frontage along Avenue of Flags, the very wide median strip is a strong unifying
element to the street and has recently been improved with public art, landscaping, walking
paths and benches in accordance with the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan.
Main residential areas within the City include: Sycamore Ranch, Oak Creek, La Pita Hillside,
Twin Oaks, and Calor-La Lata neighborhoods west of Avenue of Flags and north of Highway
246; Meadow Ridge, Ranch Club, River Grove, Valley Station, and Rancho de Maria
neighborhoods to the west of Avenue of Flags and south of Highway 246; and the Thumbelina
                                                                                      City of Buellton

and Ballard Canyon neighborhoods to the east of Freear Drive and north of Highway 246. These
neighborhoods are primarily single-family residences on relatively uniform-sized lots.
Rectilinear streets and a traditional development pattern provide the framework for these
established residential communities. Industrial districts are located in the northeast area of the
City along McMurray Road and in the southern area of the City along Industrial Way.
Primary Viewsheds and Gateways
Principal viewsheds and gateways are important to an analysis of aesthetic features because they
define the vantage point for the largest number of views. U.S. Highway 101 and State Route 246
are the primary regional highways serving the area and are important gateways to the City.
Avenue of Flags is the major north-south arterial roadway located west of and parallel to U.S.
Highway 101.
         U.S. Highway 101
         Highway 101 is the major public viewing corridor traversing the City in a north/south
         direction (see Figure C/OS-4). It is not considered a locally-designated or State-
         designated scenic highway or route. Highway 101 approximately bisects the City, with
         foreground views of predominantly commercial and residential development and
         background views of hillsides, including the Santa Ynez Mountains, and agriculture to the
         north and south.
         State Route 246
         Highway 246 is another major public viewing corridor that traverses the City in a
         east/west direction (see Figure C/OS-5). It is not considered a locally-designated or
         State-designated scenic highway or route. Highway 246 is the primary route linking
         Buellton with Lompoc to the west and Solvang to the east. Highway 246 approximately
         bisects the City, with foreground views of commercial development near Highway 101,
         and residential development further from Highway 101, and background views of hillsides
         and agriculture to the east and west. Much of the residential development along Highway
         246 is partially blocked from view by soundwalls and landscaping.
         Avenue of Flags
         Avenue of Flags is a north-south arterial roadway located west of and parallel to U.S.
         Highway 101. This roadway extends from Jonata Park Road on the north to Santa Rosa
         Road south of Buellton. Avenue of Flags is 2 to 4 lanes wide and is divided by a 76-foot–
         wide landscaped median. Recent design improvements to Avenue of Flags, consistent
         with the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 Urban Design Plan, have created a visually
         appealing median that includes a meandering walking path, native landscaping, public
         art, and park benches (see Figure C/OS-6). North of State Route 246, prominent visual
         features include foreground views of primarily commercial buildings and the wide
         landscaped median and flagpoles, and background views of the hillsides. South of State
         Route 246, prominent visual features include foreground views of primarily residential
         buildings and vegetation, and background views of the hillsides.

Air Quality
Climate and Meteorology
The City of Buellton is part of the South Central Coast Air Basin (SCCAB) which includes all of
San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties. The climate of northern Santa Barbara
County and all of the SCCAB is strongly influenced by its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and
the location of the semi-permanent high pressure cell in the northeastern Pacific. With a
Mediterranean-type climate, the City is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool winters
with occasional rainy periods. Maximum summer temperatures in the County average about 70
degrees Fahrenheit near the coast, while inland valleys are often in the 90s. Average minimum
winter temperatures range from the low 30’s along the coast to the low 20’s inland.
Airflow around the County plays an important role in the movement and dispersion of
pollutants. The speed and direction of local winds are controlled by the location and strength of
the Pacific high pressure system and other global patterns, topographical factors, and
circulation patterns resulting from temperature differences between the land and the sea. The
region is also subject to seasonal “Santa Ana” winds. These are typically hot, dry northerly
winds which blow offshore at 15-20 mph, but can reach speeds over 60 mph. Two types of
temperature inversions (warmer air on top of cooler air) are created in the area: subsidence and
radiational. The subsidence inversion is a regional effect created by the Pacific high in which air
is heated as it is compressed when it flows from the high pressure area to the low pressure areas
inland. This type of inversion generally forms at about 1,000 to 2,000 feet and can occur
throughout the year, but it is most evident during the summer months. Surface inversions are
formed by the more rapid cooling of air near the ground during the night, especially during
winter. Both types of inversions limit the dispersal of air pollutants within the regional airshed,
with the more stable the air (low wind speeds, uniform temperatures), the lower the amount of
pollutant dispersion.
The federal and state governments have been empowered by the federal and state Clean Air
Acts to regulate the emission of airborne pollutants and have established ambient air quality
standards for the protection of public health. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is the federal agency designated to administer air quality regulation, while the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) is the state equivalent in California. Local control in air
quality management is provided by the CARB through county-level or regional Air Pollution
Control Districts (APCDs). The CARB establishes air quality standards and is responsible for
control of mobile emission sources, while the local APCDs are responsible for enforcing
standards and regulating stationary sources. The CARB has established 14 air basins statewide.
The City is located in the South Central Coast Air Basin and is within the jurisdiction of the
Santa Barbara County APCD.
Federal and state standards have been established for ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulates less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), and
lead. California has also set standards for sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and

         Ozone
         Ozone is produced by a photochemical reaction (triggered by sunlight) between
         nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive organic gases (ROG). Nitrogen oxides are formed
         during the combustion of fuels, while reactive organic gases are formed during
         combustion and evaporation of organic solvents. Because ozone requires sunlight to
         form, it mostly occurs in serious concentrations between the months of May and
         October. Ozone is pungent, colorless toxic gases with direct health effects on humans
         including respiratory and eye irritation and possible changes in lung functions. Groups
         most sensitive to ozone include children, the elderly, persons with respiratory disorders,
         and people who exercise strenuously outdoors.
         Suspended Particulates
         PM10 is small particulate matter measuring no more than 10 microns in diameter. It is
         mostly composed of dust particles, nitrates and sulfates. PM10 is a by-product of fuel
         combustion and wind erosion of soil and unpaved roads, and is directly emitted into the
         atmosphere through these processes. PM10 is also created in the atmosphere through
         chemical reactions. Fine particulate matter poses a serious health threat to all groups,
         but particularly to the elderly, children, and those with respiratory problems. More than
         half of the fine particulate matter that is inhaled into the lungs remains there, which can
         cause permanent lung damage. These materials can damage health by interfering with
         the body’s mechanisms for clearing the respiratory tract or by acting as carriers of an
         absorbed toxic substance.

          Carbon Monoxide
          Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas, is a local pollutant that in high
          concentrations is found only very near the source. The major source of carbon
          monoxide is automobile engines. Elevated concentrations, therefore, are usually only
          found near areas of high traffic volumes. Carbon monoxide’s health effects are related
          to its affinity for hemoglobin in the blood. At high concentrations, carbon monoxide
          reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood, causing heart difficulties in people with
          chronic diseases, reduced lung capacity and impaired mental abilities.
Current Ambient Air Quality
The APCD is required to monitor air pollutant levels to assure that the air quality standards are
met, and if they are not met, to also develop strategies to meet the standards. Depending on
whether or not the standards are met or exceeded, the air basin is classified as being in
“attainment” or as “nonattainment.” Santa Barbara County is in attainment for all standards
except the state Ozone and PM10 standards. In August 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) reclassified the County as “Attainment” for the federal one-hour ozone standard.

Ozone is a secondary pollutant that is not produced directly by a source, but rather it is formed
by a reaction between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive organic gases (ROG) in the presence
of sunlight. Reductions in ozone concentrations are dependent on reducing the amount of these
precursors. The major sources of ozone precursor emissions in Santa Barbara County are motor
vehicles, the petroleum industry, and solvent usage (paint, consumer products, and certain
industrial processes). The major sources of PM10 in the County are mineral quarries, grading,
demolition, agricultural tilling, road dust, and vehicle exhaust.
Sensitive Receptors
Ambient air quality standards have been established to represent the levels of air quality
considered sufficient, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect public health and welfare.
They are designed to protect that segment of the public most susceptible to respiratory distress,
such as children under 14; the elderly over 65; persons engaged in strenuous work or exercise;
and people with cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. The majority of sensitive
receptor locations are therefore schools and hospitals.
Archaeological, Cultural and Historical Resources
Cultural resources include prehistoric resources, historic resources, and Native American
resources. Prehistoric resources represent the remains of human occupation prior to European
settlement. Historic resources represent remains after European settlement and may be part of
a "built environment," including man-made structures used for habitation, work, recreation,
education and religious worship, and may also be represented by houses, factories, office
buildings, schools, churches, museums, hospitals, bridges and other structural remains. Native
American resources include ethnographic elements pertaining to Native American issues and
values.
State Senate Bill (SB) 18, passed in 2004, requires cities and counties proposing a General Plan
Amendment to provide Native American groups with a direct opportunity for consultation
regarding the project. SB 18 requires contact with the Native American Heritage Commission
(NAHC), notification to tribal contacts, and consultation with tribes if requested.
Prehistoric Background
The broad patterns of regional prehistory are well known. The earliest habitation of the region
is thought to have occurred during the Early Holocene, circa 8000-6000 B.C. (Erlandson,1994).
At that time population density was low, technology was simple, and social organization was
relatively egalitarian. In Santa Barbara County, small, mobile bands of individuals probably
subsisted on plant resources, shellfish foraging, and hunting small mammals. There are very
few known archaeological sites representing this period of time.
The population began to increase dramatically after circa 6000 B.C. Sites from the period
between 6000-1400 B.C. often contain numerous ground stone implements, specifically manos
                                                                                     City of Buellton

and metates, used to mill hard seeds (Glassow, 1996). These larger populations required a more
diversified subsistence base that included terrestrial and marine mammals, fish, and shellfish,
along with seeds and other plant resources.
Several new technologies were adopted between circa 1400 B.C. to A.D. 1150 (referred to as the
Middle Period by King [1981]). The mortar and pestle came into use for acorn processing, and a
diverse assemblage of hunting tools became common. Elaborate shell ornaments and beads
were increasingly manufactured for trade (Erlandson, 1994). As the population continued to
increase between A.D. 1150-1300, social and political hierarchies became established to integrate
growing numbers of people (Arnold, 1992).
Several new artifact styles became common after A.D. 1300, including leaf-shaped and
triangular concave-based arrow points, “flowerpot” mortars, and circular shell fishhooks
(Glassow 1990:2-14). The first European explorers of the region encountered large coastal
villages inhabited by the Chumash.
The specific prehistory of the City and the Santa Ynez Valley in general, is as yet poorly known.
There is little evidence for occupation of the City during the Early Holocene. Although a few
milling stone sites have been discovered along the Santa Ynez River (Woodman et al. 1991),
intensive use of the area around Solvang probably did not occur until the Middle Period.
Surveys conducted to date indicate that permanent occupations tended to be focused along the
river, where resources were more reliable, while short-term, intermittently occupied camps
were found along the tributary streams and in the surrounding hills.
         Ethnography
         At the time of European contact, the Chumash domain included the Santa Barbara
         Channel Islands and the region stretching from Carpajo Creek in San Luis Obispo County
         south to Malibu Creek in Los Angeles County (Kroeber 1925; Gibson 1991) and as far east
         as the Carrizo Plain. Kroeber (1925: 883) estimated that Chumash population exceeded
         10,000 individuals by 1770, but by 1910 the population had declined to 1 percent of the
         aboriginal number. This was largely the result of disease and dietary and lifestyle
         changes introduced by Europeans.
         At the time of Spanish exploration, the upper Santa Ynez Valley was occupied by the
         Ynezeno, an inland subgroup of the Chumash, the Ynezeno occupied the Santa Ynez
         River watershed from the mouth of Zaca Creek eastward (Glassow, 1979). Their territory
         contained 18 villages, the largest of which were home to perhaps 200 individuals.
         Glassow (1979: 155) estimated that the average village population was about 80 people,
         and the total Ynezeno population was between 1000 and 1800. With the exception of
         villages established at the Mission, very few archaeological sites have been directly
         linked to the Ynezeno.
Historic Resources
Buellton, the newest of the five towns of the Santa Ynez Valley was established in 1920, and
later incorporated in 1992. However, looking back into the history of the area, the Buell Ranch
was a complete town within itself as far back as 1875. By that date R.T. Buell had established a
                                                                                       City of Buellton

general store, a post office, bunkhouses, blacksmith
shop and family homes. In 1865 R.T. Buell
purchased one quarter of the 26,000 acre Rancho
San Carlos de Jonata, a Mexican land grant owned
by Jose Maria Covarrubias and Joaquin Carrillo of
Santa Barbara. By 1872 R.T had bought the entire
Rancho. The Rancho San Carlos de Jonata covered
more than 26,000 acres, from the west to mission
Santa Ynez, from the middle of the Santa Ynez
River on the south to Zaca Station (north on Hwy
101). The Buell ranch became a model of a fine
working ranch, as R.T. had the ability to operate a
prosperous horse and cattle ranch and dairy farm.
Buell Flat, to the East, grew wheat and other grains
on 4,200 acres. After a drought in 1876 and 1877
R.T went into debt to bankers in San Francisco,
so to pay his bills he sold the choicest part of the    Buellton Historical Society Display
ranch to his creditors, the Buell Flat/Llano
Grade. R.T. Buell died in 1905 at the family farm at age 78. He was buried in the family plot,
now the parking lot of Pea Soup Andersen's Hotel. His body was later moved to Oak Hill
Cemetery, in Ballard.
The area of Buellton began to change rapidly after the turn of the century, with more settlers
coming to farm and start businesses and with the routing of Highway 101 through Buellton in
1927. By 1911 Danish settlers were spilling over into the Buellton area, and there was a great
need for a post office. William Budd opened a post office and it became an official United States
Post Office in 1920.
Stores were being built on the main street of the community, and it was Anton and Juliette
Andersen who bought a store from William Budd and opened a restaurant in 1924 called the
Electrical Cafe. Juliette brought with her from her native France a recipe for pea soup, and this
was the beginning of the now famous Pea Soup Andersen's restaurants.
Buellton has always been strategically located as the gateway to the Santa Ynez Valley, feeding
traffic north and south, east and west. In the 1930s Highway 101 was improved as more traffic
used the road. In the 1940s Avenue of Flags was an eight-lane road through town, four lanes
for local traffic, and four for north and south travel on the highway. In the early 1960s Highway
101 was moved to its current location, and Avenue of Flags remains as the main street of
Buellton. Buellton became an incorporated city on February 1, 1992.
Chapter 12.20 of the Buellton Municipal Code promotes the economic welfare and prosperity of
the City by preserving and protecting those places, sites, buildings, structures, works of art and
other objects having a special historical or esthetic character or interest, for the use, education
and view of the general public and to remind the citizens of this county and visitors from
elsewhere of the historical background of the City. Under an agreement with the City, the Santa
Barbara County advisory landmark committee reviews applications to designate such resources

Energy Resources
The main forms of household energy consumption are electricity and natural gas.
Transportation energy consumption is comprised primarily of petroleum use. Energy
consumption is anticipated to grow proportionately with increasing population and
development within the City through buildout.
Given limited supplies of energy resource, energy conservation and use of renewable energy
resources will become increasingly important as the City grows. Energy efficient design,
construction, and maintenance of buildings (including through the use of “green building”
techniques, use of energy efficient appliances, and sustainable use of renewable resources, such
as wind and solar energy), can result in substantial energy conservation. Energy conserving
building practices, including building orientation, shading, windows and landscaping design,
reduce energy consumption.
Land use and associated transportation patterns also affect energy use. Compact urban areas,
mixed use (residential/commercial) development, and infill development, reduce trip lengths,
affect alternative transportation trip decisions, and reduce associated transportation energy
consumption. Vehicle trip reduction programs, including pedestrian and bicycle
improvements, ridesharing, and public transportation, directly reduce the amount of petroleum
and other transportation energy consumption.
Recycling programs also reduce consumption of resources. In accordance with AB 939,
recyclables are sorted from the refuse, and the residual waste is transferred to the landfill. It is
estimated that the City currently diverts approximately 40% of its waste stream. In an effort to
reduce waste, effectively prolonging the life of Tajiguas Landfill, where City waste is currently
disposed, and to comply with the California Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public
Resources Code Section 40000 et. Sec.), the City has adopted City Council Ordinance No. 06-01,
adding chapter 17.06 of the municipal code, titled: “Construction and Demolition Materials.”
The purpose of the ordinance is to reduce landfill waste by requiring an applicant for every
“covered project” to divert a minimum of 50% of the construction and demolition materials
resulting from that project in compliance with state and local statuary goals and policies and to
create a mechanism to secure compliance with the states diversion requirements. Refer to the
Public Facilities and Services Element for additional discussion, policies and programs related
to solid waste.
Mineral Resources
Sand, gravel, and rock are presently extracted from the Santa Ynez River bed near Buellton by
Granite Construction and the Buellflat Rock Company. The area mined by the companies’ totals
almost 300 acres, although neither company operates within the Buellton city limits.
                                                                                      City of Buellton

C/OS-2            Encourage implementation of Best Management Practices to eliminate/minimize
                  the impacts of urban run-off and improve water quality.
Agricultural Lands/Soils and Open Space
C/OS-3            Encourage the preservation of open space within the City.
C/OS-4            Encourage Santa Barbara County to:
                  a. Maintain agriculturally productive lands for agricultural uses, and require
                      urban uses to locate within the City;
                  b. Maintain agricultural land use designations on agricultural lands, and
                      agricultural lands in the County's agricultural preserve program; and
                  c. Locate new highways and other similar linear projects away from
                      agricultural land as feasible, or along the border of agricultural lands rather
                      than dividing viable agricultural land.
C/OS-5            Encourage Santa Barbara County to require public and private development to:
                  a. Locate urban uses within the City;
                  b. Maintain large parcel agricultural zoning and prohibit the subdivision of
                      agricultural lands to smaller lots unless such development: (1) is part of a
                      cluster project, (2) the project will not conflict with adjacent agricultural
                      operations; (3) will not substantially hamper or discourage long-term
                      agricultural operations either onsite or on adjacent agricultural lands; and (4)
                      will not substantially impact adjacent agricultural production, individually or
                      cumulatively; and
                                                                                           City of Buellton

Conservation and Open Space Element
                  c. Incorporate design, construction, and maintenance techniques that protect
                      agriculture and minimize conflicts with adjacent uses.
C/OS-6            Encourage activities that support local agriculture, such as farmers markets and
                  other special events.
C/OS-7            Support the County's right-to-farm ordinance and other efforts to reduce
                  potential impacts caused by urban development located contiguous to county
                  agricultural lands. These additional measures may include establishing a buffer
                  on land to be developed between new urban development and surrounding
                  agricultural lands.
Plant, Animal and Related Habitat Protection
C/OS-8            Support state and federal laws and policies to preserve populations of rare,
                  threatened, and endangered species and sensitive habitats by ensuring
                  development does not adversely affect such species or habitats or by mitigating
                  adverse effects in accordance with state and federal regulations.
C/OS-9            Encourage new development to incorporate oak woodlands, native grasslands,
                  wetlands, and riparian habitats into project design.
C/OS-10           Require new development to provide sufficient open space.
C/OS-11           The City should limit the recreational activities in open space areas with sensitive
                  habitats to those activities that have minimal impact on sensitive habitats, such
                  as hiking and other passive uses.
Tree Preservation
C/OS-12           Promote preservation of native trees to maintain the character of the City,
                  preserve the City’s beauty and identity, and protect native habitat.
C/OS-13           Development should be designed to avoid native trees with a trunk diameter at
                  breast height of 8 inches or more. A native tree is defined as a perennial woody
                  plant, such as an oak or sycamore, that is a historical element of a natural
                  California habitat. When considering the approval of activities that result in the
                  removal of mature trees, the following factors shall be considered:
                  a.     The size, age, health and species of tree(s) to be removed.
                  b.     Whether or not the removal of the tree(s) is necessary for the reasonable
                         development and use of the site.
                  c.     Whether the tree(s) to be removed is (are) a native or introduced species.
Scenic Resources
C/OS-14           Encourage new development to protect visual amenities, including hillsides, by
                  implementing the standards in the Community Design Guidelines.
                                                                                         City of Buellton

Conservation and Open Space Element
C/OS-15           Arterial approaches to the City, including State Route 246 eastbound approach to
                  the City, shall be redesigned with visual cues, such as landscaping, visual
                  medians, and signage, to indicate the entrance to the City as a means to control
                  traffic speed and improve public safety.
Air Quality
C/OS-16           Encourage the improvement of air quality in Buellton and in the region by
                  implementing the measures described in the Santa Barbara County Air Quality
                  Management Plan. Such measures include, but are not limited to, new or
                  expanded sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian paths, safe street and parking lot
                  crossings, planting of shade trees, theft proof and well lit bicycle storage
                  facilities, and placement of parking lots and building entrances to favor
                  pedestrians rather than cars.
C/OS-17           The City shall, to the extent practicable, physically separate sensitive land uses
                  from substantial sources of air pollution.
Archaeological, Cultural and Historical Resources
C/OS-18           Encourage the preservation of cultural resources consistent with state and federal
                  requirements by ensuring development does not adversely affect such resources
                  or by mitigating adverse effects in accordance with state and federal regulations.
Energy Resources
C/OS-19           Encourage the conservation of energy resources in new and existing
                  development through the use of “green construction and building practices”, as
                  described in the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and
                  Environmental Design (LEED)tm rating system.
C/OS-20           Encourage a City wide recycling effort that reduces waste and promotes the use
                  of recycled paper products in governmental and private offices.
Mineral Resources
C/OS-21           Commercial mining operations should be prohibited within the City due to
                  environmental and aesthetic concerns, as well as neighborhood compatibility
                  issues associated with urban uses adjacent to mining operations.
C/OS-22           Encourage Santa Barbara County to require mining operations to:
                  a. Provide a buffer between existing or likely adjacent uses and the mining
                      operation to minimize incompatibility with other nearby uses, and
                      environmental and aesthetic impacts associated with that mining operation.
                  b. Require reclamation plans to mitigate environmental impacts and
                      incorporate an adequate security to guarantee proposed reclamation.
                  c. Minimize impacts to local residents and City roadways.
                                                                                          City of Buellton

6.       The City shall:
         a. Require new development to protect, maintain, and/or restore creeks and riparian
               habitat to protect the community's water quality, wildlife diversity, aesthetic values,
               and recreation opportunities, where feasible and where protection or restoration
               does not interfere with good flood control practices.
         b. Only allow creek alterations if no practicable alternative is available, to protect
               public health and safety, or to implement good flood control practices. If alterations
               are allowed the proposed project should utilize natural creek alterations as a first
               priority (i.e., stabilization methods which maintain an earthen channel and provide
               additional riparian vegetation). If the first priority method is demonstrated to be
               infeasible, a second priority would be the utilization of gabions, rocks, and other
               bank stabilization methods which allow plantings (both trees and shrubs) within the
               bank protection. If the first and second priority methods are demonstrated to be
               infeasible, a third priority would be hard bank protection which does not allow for
               plantings (such as solid walls). Hard bank protection should only occur within
               existing urbanized areas. If hard bank protection occurs, off-site habitat restoration
               of natural creek areas shall be provided. Notwithstanding the above priorities, the
               Planning Commission or City Council may allow other alterations to creeks, in
               consultation with regional, state, and federal agencies as appropriate, to allow
               reasonable development of property to achieve other goals, policies and programs of
               the General Plan.
         c. Require public or private development to locate development outside the 50-foot
               creek corridor setback area and 200-foot Santa Ynez River setback area except in the
               following cases: (1) no practicable alternative is available; (2) the proposed location is
               necessary to protect public health and safety; (3) the location is necessary for the
               repair of roads, bridges, trails, or similar infrastructure; or (4) the location is
               necessary for the construction of new roads, bridges, trails, or similar infrastructure
               where the Planning Director determines the project has minimized environmental
               impacts through project design and infrastructure placement.

8.       Require public and private development on sites that contain or are located adjacent to
         creeks and/or riparian habitat to:
         a. Preserve creek corridors and creek setback areas through easements or dedications.
               Parcel lines (in the case of a subdivision) or easements (in the case of a subdivision or
               other development) shall be located to optimize resource protection. If a creek is
               proposed within an open space parcel or easement, allowed uses and maintenance
               responsibilities within that parcel or easement should be clearly defined and
               conditioned prior to map or project approval.
         b. Designate such easement or dedication areas (as enumerated in a above) as open
               space.
         c. Enhance creek corridors and their habitat value by: (1) providing an adequate creek
               setback, (2) maintaining creek corridors in an essentially natural state, (3) employing
               creek restoration techniques where restoration is needed to achieve a natural creek
               corridor, (4) restoring riparian vegetation within creek corridors, and where possible,
               within creek setback areas, (5) prohibiting the planting of invasive, non-native plants
               (such as vinca major and eucalyptus), and (6) avoiding tree removals within creek
               corridors.
         d. Provide recreation and public access near creeks consistent with this Element.
         e. Utilize design, construction, and maintenance techniques that:
               1. Ensure that development near a creek will not cause, or make worse, natural
                   hazards (such as erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or water pollution);
               2. Include erosion and sediment control practices such as: (a) turbidity screens and
                   other management practices. These methods shall be used as necessary to
                   minimize siltation, sedimentation, and erosion. Such erosion and sediment
                   controls shall be left in place until disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent
                   vegetation that will prevent the transport of sediment off site, and (b) temporary
                   vegetation sufficient to stabilize disturbed areas.

9.       Require developers of properties located within 500 feet of watercourses, including Zaca
         Creek and the Santa Ynez River, to conduct surveys for State and/or federally listed
         sensitive species (e.g., southwestern willow flycatcher, least Bell’s vireo in areas near the
         Santa Ynez River) and require the provision of appropriate buffers or other mitigation
         necessary to protect the habitat for listed species.

Tree Preservation
11.      When mature non-native trees (i.e., trees with a trunk diameter at breast height of 8
         inches or more) are removed to accommodate new development, they shall be replaced
         at a ratio of at least two new trees for every one tree removed, or such additional
         number and size of trees as considered appropriate by the reviewing body at the time of
         approval of such development. Mature native trees with a trunk diameter at breast
         height of 8 inches or more, including oaks, shall be replaced at a ratio of at least 5 new
         trees for every one tree removed. Replacement trees for removed native or non-native
         trees should be native, from locally-sourced stock, using species indicated on the City’s

Scenic Resources
14.      Require new public or private development to protect scenic resources by:
         a. Prohibiting structures that silhouette along ridgelines or hilltops from a public
               viewpoint;
         b. Utilizing natural landforms and vegetation for screening structures, access roads,
               building foundations, and cut and fill slopes;
         c. Requiring landscaping which provides a landscape transition between developed
               areas and adjacent open space or undeveloped areas; and is compatible with the
               scenic resource being protected;
         d. Incorporating sound Natural Resource Conservation Service practices and
               minimizing land alterations. Land alterations should be minimized by: keeping cuts
               and fills to a minimum; limiting grading to the smallest practical area of land;
               limiting land exposure to the shortest practical amount of time; replanting graded
               areas to insure establishment of plant cover before the next rainy season; and
               creating grading contours that blend with the natural contours on site or look like
               contours that would naturally occur;
         e. Designing roads, parking, and utilities to minimize visual impacts. Proposed
               utilities, as well as existing utilities located on any portion of a development site
               shall be placed underground, unless determined unreasonable or impractical by the
               Planning Director. Roadways and parking should fit the natural terrain; and
         f. Designing projects to fit the site's scale and character. Structures should be designed
               and located so: roof lines and vertical architectural features blend with and do not
               detract from the natural background or ridge outline; residential density and
               massing is decreased with increased elevation where it would mar the scenic quality
               of the scenic resource; they fit the natural terrain, and they utilize building materials,
               colors, and textures that blend with the natural landscape and avoid the creation of
               high-contrast situations.
         g. Complying with and implementing the City’s Urban Design Plan and Community
               Design Guidelines, as applicable.

15.      Require public or private development to:
         a. Locate structures, accessory structures, paving, and grading at the base of a hill
               (generally that area below 15 percent slope) unless: (1) no practicable alternative is
               available, (2) the location on a greater slope or at a greater elevation provides more
               aesthetic quality, or (3) the location is necessary to protect public health and safety.
         b. Utilize design, construction, and maintenance techniques that: (1) preserve and
               enhance the hillsides; (2) ensure that development near or on portions of a hill do not
               cause, or make worse natural hazards (such as erosion, sedimentation, fire, or water
               quality concerns); (3) include erosion and sediment control practices including
               temporary vegetation sufficient to stabilize disturbed areas; (4) minimize risk to life
               and property from slope failure, landslides, and flooding; (5) maintain the character
               and visual quality of the adjacent hillside.
         c. Incorporate recreation and public access on or near hillsides consistent with this
               Element and the Parks and Recreation Element and Parks and Recreation Master

Economic Development Elemen

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Economic Development Element
                             Economic Development Element
Introduction
The Economic Development Element establishes goals, policies, and programs to guide City
efforts to maintain an economically viable community. In this sense, economically viable means
providing a range of retail and employment opportunities that meet the needs of residents and
workers alike, that attract families and businesses to create demand for planned land uses, and
that establish and fund public service levels to preserve Buellton’s quality of life.
Economic Sustainability
The American Planning Association defines economic sustainability as “any change in a
community that enables greater production, increased employment, and a better distribution of
goods and services.” In order to achieve a level of “economic sustainability” in Buellton, the
City shall endeavor to broaden the range of commercial products and services, target businesses
and industries that offer higher paying wage scales, and draw upon the heritage of the Santa
Ynez Valley to maximize opportunities.
Business Retention and Expansion
The fundamental purpose of economic sustainability is to create and maintain an economically
healthy community. This requires the enhancement of existing economic assets balanced with a
diversification of the City’s economic base. The City’s existing economic assets include
automobile dealerships and hospitality establishments.
Business Attraction
In addition to enhancing existing economic assets, such as the hospitality industry, there is a
need for the attraction of new businesses in the City of Buellton to both diversify the City’s
economic base and provide retail and employment opportunities for City residents. Currently,
City residents often travel outside of the community for work and retail needs. Industrial or
professional businesses that provide high paying jobs are limited, creating a need for local jobs
that better meet the skills of the local work force.
Providing high paying jobs and retail opportunities in the City of Buellton would not only
increase local sales taxes and other revenues to the City, but also improve the quality of life for
Buellton residents. As fewer persons commute to work and shopping destinations, less traffic
will be generated on local highways, improving air quality and decreasing congestion.
Tourism and Retail
As a crossroad of Highway 246 and Highway 101 and the entrance to the Santa Ynez Valley,
Buellton is well suited for visitor-serving uses. Expanding such businesses and attracting
tourism would bring additional revenue to the City.
                                                                                      City of Buellton
                                                  E-1

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Economic Development Element
In addition, an absence of retail opportunities that cater to residents, rather than travelers,
results in a leakage of municipal revenues as residents travel to other communities for a variety
of retail goods.
Economic Revitalization
Commercial uses in the City are currently arranged to serve travelers on Highways 101 and 246.
As a consequence, business activities in the City are spread along Avenue of Flags and
Highway 246. Development of vacant commercial land along these roadways would help
strengthen the City's tax base and provide jobs. Redevelopment of non-vacant areas in and
around the town center may additionally provide retail, employment, and visitor serving
opportunities as well as consolidate irregularly configured lots and improve circulation.
The Buellton Redevelopment Plan (or “Improvement Plan”) was adopted in 1993 and
establishes a redevelopment area of about 180 acres generally bounded by Central Avenue to
the west, Freer Drive to the east, the southerly terminus of McMurray Road to the south and the
intersection of Avenue of Flags with the U.S. 101 Freeway to the north. The Redevelopment
Plan delineates land uses, policies and programs, circulation, access and related features. The
Buellton Redevelopment Plan serves as a guide for long term development and improvements
that can be funded through redevelopment funds. Redevelopment funds, including housing
set-asides, in addition to federal affordable housing home consortium funds, and federal
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, are a major funding source for the City’s
economic development programs.
As discussed in the Land Use Element, the City seeks to establish a combined City/County
government complex within the Avenue of Flags corridor. The Civic Center complex is
envisioned to incorporate a new City Hall, leisure and cultural services (e.g., library,
senior/community center, etc.) and public services performed by other governmental agencies
(e.g., sheriff, fire administration, building and safety, etc.). Implementation of a civic center
complex would increase economic activity within the Redevelopment Area. In addition the
future reuse of existing civic uses such as City Hall, police, planning department, library and
others along Highway 246 can open up new development opportunities within the
Redevelopment Area.

            CITY OF BUELLTON – HOUSING ELEMENT
PART ONE: HOUSING GOALS,                                  PROGRAMS,                POLICIES
AND QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
Community Context: The City of Buellton is a California central coast community of 4,893
persons (Department of Finance, January 1, 2014) located on U.S. Highway 101 in the Santa
Ynez Valley of Santa Barbara County, approximately mid-way between Santa Barbara and Santa
Maria (Figure H-1 – Vicinity Map, on the following page). The City has a mix of residential,
commercial, and industrial uses within its 1.6 square miles and is surrounded by equestrian
ranches, farms, vineyards and wineries. In the planning period of 2010 to 2014, Buellton
experienced a growth of 0.6% in housing and 1.3% in population. Comparatively speaking,
Buellton’s rate of growth was one of the lowest among the jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County.
Buellton’s growth rate was slightly higher than Guadalupe and Goleta, which had the lowest
growth rates. On November 4, 2008, the citizens of Buellton adopted an Urban Growth
Boundary (UGB) that is co-terminus with the City Limits. The UGB requires that all annexations
and all extensions of public services outside the City Limits go to a vote of the people within the
City of Buellton. Exceptions are included for affordable housing projects and other housing
related projects that are the subject of State mandates that cannot be accommodated within the
City Limits. The UGB is in place until 2025.
Statutory Overview: Obligations of the City to provide affordable housing are embodied in the
California Land Use Law applicable to all local governments. Principal requirements of
California Land Use Law applicable to Buellton include: adoption of Housing Elements as part
of each community’s General Plan; and inducements to provide affordable housing through
density bonuses and secondary dwellings.

Housing Element Requirements: Housing Element law is codified in Article 10.6 of the
California Government Code commencing with Section 65580. Under these statutes, all
communities in California are required to have a Housing Element as part of their adopted
General Plan. Furthermore, these Elements are to be updated every five or eight years. State law
has permitted some jurisdictions to be updated every eight years. The is permitted if their
Metropolitan Planning Organization/Regional Transportation Planning Agency’s elect to shift
from a 5-year to a 4-year Regional Transportation Plan update by December 26, 2014, and meet
requirements as specified in Government Code Sections 65080(b)(2)(M) and 65588(e)(3)(c).

2015 Housing Element                     Page 2

The Santa Barbara County Association of Governments elected the 4-year Regional
Transportation Plan. Therefore, Buellton’s Housing Element is updated every eight years.
Buellton’s original Housing Element was adopted on November 17, 1993, along with the City’s
first General Plan. The Housing Element was last updated on July 23, 2009 and amended on
November 12, 2009. The City is required to update its Housing Element by February 15, 2015,
reflecting a Housing Element planning period of February 15, 2015, to February 15, 2023, and a
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) time period of January 1, 2014 through
September 30, 2022. In summary, the Housing Element is required to contain: (i) an
identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs; (ii) a statement of goals,
policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
improvements, and development of housing; (iii) the identification of adequate sites for housing,
including rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and emergency shelters; and (iv)
shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of
the community. Table H-1 correlates the Sections of the Housing Element to corresponding
subdivisions set forth in Section 65583 of the California Government Code.

Update Process: The express focus of the 2015 Housing Element update consists of the
following: (i) evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the 2009 Housing Element
programs; (ii) review, and revise as necessary, the goals, policies, and programs of the 2009
Housing Element; (iii) will ensure compliance with current statutory requirements; and (iv) will
be updated to reflect the current RHNA allocation to the City of Buellton. The 2015 Housing
Element consists of a policy document (Part One) accompanied by a technical appendix (Part
Two).
Public Participation: The California Government Code expressly requires that diligent efforts
be made to engage the public in the process of preparing and adopting Housing Elements. As
part of drafting this updated document, a series of public hearings were conducted with the
Planning Commission and City Council regarding the 2015 Housing Element. These sessions
were noticed to the groups indicated in Table H-4. In addition, a notice was posted on the City’s
web site, www.cityofbuellton.com, in August 2014. This updated Housing Element has been
drafted in consideration of this early outreach, along with direction furnished by the Planning
Commission and City Council.
Noticed public hearings were conducted by the Planning Commission and City Council in the
time and manner stipulated in Sections 65352, 65353, 65355 and 65589.7 of the California
Government Code.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements: General Plan law requires that all component
elements, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent with one another. Moreover, no one
element has priority over the other and all implementing actions that follow must be found in
conformance with General Plan policies. All Elements of the City’s General Plan 2025 are
consistent with one another. Implementation of the various programs from the 2009 Housing
Element as described in Part Two, Section VI have reconciled the theoretical development
potential, environmental carrying capacity, and land use designations necessary to accommodate
the City’s proportionate share of regional housing needs from the last Housing Element and
RHNA cycle. The city will continue to review for consistency when the annual General Plan
Report is prepared.

includes the policy document (Part One) accompanied by a technical appendix (Part Two). The
information contained in this Section II summarizes pertinent information appearing in Part Two.
Income Profile: Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and programming is geared toward
four target income groups: extremely low, very low, lower and moderate. These terms are
benchmarked against the median income defined for each of the State’s 58 counties. The upper
limit of extremely low income is 30% of the area-wide median, very low income is at 50%,
lower income is at 80%, and moderate income is at 120%. Based on 2010 Census data, target
income groups comprise 54% of all households in Buellton with large groupings at each end of
the spectrum (very low income at 25% and above moderate income at 46%). Comparatively
speaking, Buellton’s income distribution falls in the midrange of jurisdictions in Santa Barbara
County.
Housing Profile: Buellton experienced an increase of 0.6% in dwelling units from 2010 to
2014. This rate was slightly higher than Goleta and Guadalupe, which had the lowest growth
rates. This was second lowest in the actual numeric increase. In terms of housing type and
occupancy, Buellton has the highest percentage of owner-occupied housing of any jurisdiction
and the lowest percentage of multiple family dwellings. Buellton also has the highest percentage
of mobile homes that, due to a predominance of older householders, contributes to the City’s
high median age. The overall vacancy rate of 4.6% is close to the ideal benchmark of 5%. While
the growth in multiple family dwellings has outpaced single family homes, the numeric increase
is quite modest. As a consequence of the relatively low number of multi-family dwellings, the
principal source of rental housing is single family homes that typically rent at rates higher than
for apartments.
Existing Housing Needs: Housing affordability represents the single biggest obstacle for
Buellton residents (i.e., 35% of all households pay in excess of 30% of their income toward
housing). This need is higher for renters, of whom 53% overpay while only 26% of owners
overpay. Persons living in overcrowded conditions are skewed toward renters (i.e.,
approximately 21% for renters and 1% for owners). Field surveys reveal that two dwelling units
are in a state of moderate despair, and 14 dwelling units show signs of deferred maintenance. As
much as 32% of the City’s housing stock may contain lead-based paint based on the most recent
Census data. The data also suggests an imbalance in jobs and housing (with the consequence of
increased commuting) as well as a mismatch in the size of dwellings (relative to bedroom
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 11

counts) and households (relative to number of persons). Finally, disabled, homeless and
farmworkers together represent 11% of the City’s total population while elderly, large families
and female-headed households comprise 52% of all households.
Future New Construction Requirements: The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (“RHNA”)
process is part of a statewide mandate to address housing issues related to future growth in the
State. The needs assessment process sets numeric targets with the overriding goal of assuring an
equitable geographic distribution of needs and responsibilities. The numbers are first generated
by HCD and then refined by regional planning agencies in cooperation with local government.
While the methodology takes into account land use and zoning, the numbers are not necessarily
constrained by institutional limits. Indeed, a fundamental purpose of RHNA is to assure that
adequate sites and zoning exist to address anticipated housing demand. Consequently, it is not
inconceivable that housing numbers assigned to a particular jurisdiction exceed its theoretical
carrying capacity. The number assigned to the City of Buellton for the current Housing Element
cycle is 275, of which roughly 55% is assigned to target income groups.
Opportunities and Constraints: Cost inefficient and unpredictable permit processes,
counterproductive and inflexible development standards, burdensome fees and untimely
collection and under-zoned properties and inadequate densities are the primary constraints to
providing affordable housing in Buellton. Comparatively speaking, Buellton has a far less
onerous system relative to duration of process. In this regard, the time required to process
discretionary land use applications ranges from 9 to 21 months. Based on a survey of the fees
charged by the cities of Buellton, Lompoc, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and the County of Santa
Barbara, the fees charged by the City are lower than the average charged for single-family homes
and multi-family construction elsewhere in the County. The City’s Zoning Ordinance provides
for maximum residential densities ranging from a low of six dwellings per acre to a minimum of
25 units per acre (AHOZ sites). The actual build-out for the AHOZ properties has ranged
between 20 and 25 units per acre. The City’s land use policies provide allowable densities to
stimulate the affordable apartment construction, specifically the AHOZ sites that require a
minimum of 25 units per acre for residential projects.
Development Potential: Development capacity is a function of land availability, use
designations and environmental thresholds. From a resource standpoint, the City has a build-out
potential of 397 dwellings on vacant and underdeveloped properties presently zoned for
residential and mixed-use. Another 1,278 dwellings could be built on the Affordable Housing
Overlay Zone (AHOZ) properties that were rezoned in 2005 as required by the 2004 Housing
Element (at a minimum gross density of 25 units per acre). The City also has the capacity, due to
changes in the secondary unit ordinance, to accommodate over 700 secondary dwelling units on
single family zoned properties. In total, the City’s inventory of available land can yield
approximately 1,692 dwelling units. In comparison, the number of units required to achieve
RHNA goals is 275. In summary, the City does have sufficient land resources to achieve
forecasted housing needs without rezoning additional land, including the potential for 1,278 units
on land with a minimum density of 25 units per acre.

Past Performance: Two thirds of the stated objectives within the previous Housing Element
have been achieved and need not be continued or have continued relevance and should be
retained; and about one third were either not achieved, were partially achieved or require
retooling. Overall, the City realized 0.6% of its new construction goals for moderate, low and
very low income households. There continues to be a clear and convincing need for deeper
subsidies, land use incentives and layered funding to make development of affordable housing
possible. The most likely locations for low and very low income units will continue to be on land
that is available for mixed use development and AHOZ sites.

SECTION III: ADEQUATE HOUSING SITES
AHOZ Zoning (25 Units Per Acre)
The City’s existing Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) has designated certain
commercial and industrial properties within the City to be developed with completely residential
projects if they are built at a minimum density of 25 units per acre. These properties are shown in
Table A-1. As Table A-1 demonstrates, the City has the potential for 1,278 dwelling units on
these properties which accommodates the City’s total RHNA allocation of 275 units and the
requirement for 110 low, very low, and extremely low income units.
Since adoption of the AHOZ overlay in 2005, three projects have taken advantage of this overlay
and have demonstrated that the concept is attractive for residential developers.
         In August 2006, the City Council approved the first AHOZ project on AHOZ Site V (not
          shown in Table A-1 since the site is under construction and no longer vacant). The
          project consists of 44 condominium units of which four are affordable to very low
          income persons and three are affordable to low income persons. A $85,635 housing in-
          lieu fee will also be collected. All of the units have been constructed and are occupied.
         In April 2008, the Zoning Administrator approved a second AHOZ project on AHOZ Site
          IV. The project consists of 53 apartment units of which five are affordable to very low
          income persons, three are affordable to low income persons, and the remainder, since
          they are apartments, would qualify as moderate income units. Unfortunately, this project
          was not constructed and the Development Plan has expired.
         In September 2013, the City Council approved a third AHOZ project on AHOZ Site X.
          The project consists of 62 apartment units of which five are affordable to very low
          income persons, four are affordable to low income persons, and the remainder, since they
          are apartments, would qualify as moderate income units. An application for a building
          permit has not been submitted at this time, but construction is expected during the current
          Housing Element planning horizon.
To further illustrate this point, in the period since the AHOZ ordinance was adopted (January
2005 through December 2013), more housing units have been entitled under the AHOZ program
than the City’s inclusionary housing program (Source: City of Buellton General Plan Annual
Reports to State HCD).
           AHOZ Program: 159 total units (37 market rate, 14 very low, 10 low, and 98 moderate)
           Inclusionary Program: 75 total units (60 market rate, 7 very low, 6 low, and 2 moderate)
The net area shown in Table A-1 takes into account, and removes, all environmentally sensitive
and constrained areas of the properties. Therefore, the net buildable area reflects the portions of
the sites that are developable. The net area is derived from Table 2-8B of the Final EIR for the
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                           Page 14

General Plan Update-Land Use and Circulation Elements, August 4, 2005, and codified in Table
5 of Section 19.16.013 of the Buellton Municipal Code (AHOZ Ordinance). Acreage shown is
estimated and the actual net acreage will be determined at the time of entitlements.
Based on the Buellton General Plan 2025, the City has adequate water and sewer capacity to
meet expected build-out in 2025 (an approximate population of 6,100). This population increase
equals an additional 431 dwelling units (2.8 persons per dwelling unit). Therefore, the City has
the infrastructure and capacity to serve the 275 unit RHNA allocation. Dry utilities, such as
power and gas, are available to all designated sites.
Other Residential and Mixed Use Zoning
Additional housing sites based on other residential and mixed use zoning have been developed
using a detailed assessment of parcel data, coupled with field surveys. The results are provided in
Tables A-2 through A-5 and shows that the City has the potential for an additional 414 units on
properties not designed with the AHOZ overlay. These additional units are located on a
combination of vacant residentially zoned land, vacant non-residentially zoned land (mixed use),
underdeveloped residentially zoned land, and vacant non-residentially zoned land (mixed use).
The entire City, including these sites, was analyzed in the Final EIR for the General Plan Update-
Land Use and Circulation Elements (August 4, 2005). Impacts of a general nature were identified
City-wide and standard mitigation measures for all projects were adopted. Each particular parcel
is required to undergo specific environmental review pursuant to CEQA in order to address site
specific impacts and mitigation. However, major site constraints, such as flood areas and habitat
areas, are included with the 2005 Final EIR. All utility infrastructure and capacity are available
to the identified parcels.
Secondary Units
Secondary units are an allowed use in the City’s single family zoning district and are permitted
on all lots of 6,000 square feet or greater. In theory, the potential exists for over 700 secondary
dwelling units. However, historically, the City has approved approximately one to two secondary
units per year. In the eight year planning period, the City expects to permit about eight to 16
secondary units. The City counts these as moderate income units. Government Code Section
65852.150 acknowledges that secondary dwellings are a valuable form of housing that is
provided at below market rates.
Mixed Use
In December 2008 the City Council adopted regulations for mixed use development. Previously,
mixed use development was only permitted in General Commercial zones. The updated
regulations provide a greater opportunity for mixed use development with a combination, in part
or in whole, of residential, commercial, office, industrial, live/work uses within a livable urban
environment. In November 2011 the City Council made some amendments to the adopted
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 15

regulations for mixed use development. The permitted density is 8 to 12 units per acre in General
Commercial, Neighborhood Commercial, Service Commercial, and Industrial zones. Previously,
only 5 units per acre were permitted in the Service Commercial and Industrial zones.The City
Council decided not to approve a 100 unit limit for mixed use projects.
Summary
The City has eight properties zoned at a minimum density of 25 units per acre. They will provide
the capacity for 1,278 dwelling units. This capacity compares favorably to the new construction
RHNA goal of 275 units, of which 110 units must be affordable to low, very low, and extremely
low income persons and families. In addition, the City has another 36 sites that could
accommodate an additional 414 dwelling units at a range of densities from 6 to 16 units per acre.
Secondary dwelling units are expected to contribute eight to 16 moderate income units during the
planning period. A summary of the potential total build-out is provided in Table H-5. A map
identifying these sites is provided as Figure H-2.
Goal: Maintain adequate sites with appropriate zoning, development standards and public
infrastructure to facilitate development of the broadest range of housing for all income levels and
population segments sufficient to attain compliance with the City’s fair share allocation of
regional housing needs. This includes the 25 unit per acre AHOZ properties as shown in Table
A-1.
Policies:
H-1 The City shall maintain the inventory and development capacity of residential property
through zoning designations, density bonuses, and modification of development standards, and
shall discourage the conversion or downzoning of existing land currently designated for
residential use.
H-2 The City shall promote mixed-use development throughout the City, with particular focus
along Avenue of Flags, and shall implement smart growth principals.
H-3 The City shall promote integration of all economic and population segments in each
residential project; however, scales of economy and management efficiencies require that certain
projects are made exclusive to target groups and such concentration shall not be the sole basis of
project denial.
Programs and Actions:
1.        Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ). The City will keep the existing AHOZ
sites in the AHOZ inventory but will re-evaluate and re-allocate sites in 2015. The AHOZ sites
shall continue to have a minimum density of 25 units per acre to ensure affordability. If any of
those properties is developed with a non-residential project or any development that does not
meet the requirements of the AHOZ, a comparable acreage shall be rezoned to the AHOZ
designation to offset the loss. In addition, for AHOZ sites in excess of two acres, the City will
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 16

encourage and give favorable consideration to land divisions and specific plans resulting in
parcel sizes that facilitate the development of affordable housing projects in light of state and
federal funding programs that typical favor projects of between 50 and 150 units. The City will
facilitate the development of these sites for low income housing using the methods described in
Programs 8 and 9 (Targeted Assistance and Public-Private Partnerships).

                                                       25 units per acre
2.        Secondary Units and Underdeveloped Multifamily Infill. The City has the capacity to
accommodate secondary dwellings on the majority of single family zoned lots. In addition, 33
multifamily units could be developed on existing under developed multi-family zoned parcels.
Intensifying the development of under-built properties would provide for more efficient use of a
limited land resource while dispersing affordable housing over a larger geographic area. The City
shall: (i) maintain the current secondary unit regulations that allow secondary units on smaller lot
sizes and exempts them from the inclusionary housing requirements; (ii) continue to provide a
2:1 density bonus for infill multifamily units up to a maximum increase of 50% above the base
density; and (iii) continue to allow a reduction in development standards for infill multifamily
units by discretionary review as an additional density bonus incentive under the current
affordable housing regulations.

SECTION IV: AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY
Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and programming is geared toward four target
income groups: extremely low, very low, lower and moderate (“target groups”). These terms are
benchmarked against the median income defined for each of the State’s 58 counties. The upper
limit of extremely low income is 30% of the area-wide median, very low income is 50% of the
area-wide median, lower income is at 80%, and moderate income is at 120%. Typically, market
rate housing is not affordable for target groups except for moderate income rentals and
condominiums; incomes are lowest among minorities and special needs population with the
scarcest housing; multifamily rentals require the least subsidization to produce affordable units;
and land economics dictate higher overall densities to produce affordable housing. Table H-6
provides the Buellton RHNA income requirements.
Table H-6: Buellton RHNA Income Breakdown

*Broken out as 50% each of the RHNA very low income allocation of 64 units
AHOZ Zoning (25 Units Per Acre)
As noted in Section III (Adequate Housing Sites), the City adopted an Affordable Housing
Overlay Zone (AHOZ) over eight sites with a minimum density of 25 units per acre. The AHOZ
also requires that at least 20% of the units be made affordable to moderate, low, and very low
income categories. The number of units in each income category is based on the percentage
breakdown from the current RHNA allocation. The City has the potential for 1,278 dwelling
units on these properties which accommodates the City’s total RHNA allocation of 275 units and
the requirement for 110 low, very low, and extremely low income units. The success of the
AHOZ program is demonstrated in Section III (Adequate Housing Sites).
Inclusionary Zoning
The City adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance in 2002 and all residential and residential
mixed use projects are subject to the ordinance with limited exceptions. The minimum
requirement is 15% of the units be made affordable or that an in-lieu fee be paid, or a
combination of both. City sponsored projects must provide 30% of the units as affordable. The
required breakdown of the very low, low, and moderate income units required as part of the
inclusionary ordinance is based on the RHNA income breakdown percentages. Since adoption of
the inclusionary housing program during the prior Housing Element cycle, the City has produced
the following housing units:
          75 total units (60 market rate, 7 very low, 6 low, 2 moderate)
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                          Page 20

The Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County (Housing Authority) is managing 13 affordable
housing apartment units (7 very low, 6 low) within the City which should ensure that these units
remain in the City’s housing inventory. The Housing Authority is actively seeking other
opportunities to partner with the City on additional affordable housing projects.
Summary
During the last Housing Element cycle, the AHOZ and inclusionary housing programs produced
the following number of housing units:
          11 total units (10 market rate, and 1 moderate)
Both the AHOZ and inclusionary housing programs will be maintained as part of this Housing
Element update.
Projects approved and built during the prior Housing Element cycle, but prior to the adoption of
the inclusionary housing and AHOZ programs, resulted in 325 market rate units and 27 moderate
income units. The large number of units was the result of large vacant tracts of land being
developed.
Goal: To provide a continuing supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of existing and
future Buellton residents in all income categories.
Policies:
H-4 The City shall continue to implement existing policies, programs and procedures to
facilitate attainment of its allocated share of new construction goals assigned through the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (“RHNA”) process, with particular emphasis placed on the
needs possessed by persons and families of extremely low, very low, and low income.
H-5 The City shall actively seek and formulate partnerships with for-profit and non-profit
developers to produce affordable housing, and provide reasonable assistance to support and
process project applications to achieve development objectives.
H-6 The City shall, on its own or in conjunction with for-profit and non-profit developers,
aggressively seek State and Federal funding to support the development of affordable housing
and shall explore local funding alternatives to compliment these efforts, including continued
participation in the HOME and CDBG Programs administered through the County of Santa
Barbara as part of the HOME Consortium and Urban County designation, respectively.
H-7 The City shall continue to support the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County in the
provision of Section 8 rental assistance and shall seek to broaden the program to compliment
other affordable housing initiatives (e.g., secondary dwelling production, project-based tenant
assistance, etc.).

2015 Housing Element                          Page 21

Programs and Actions:
4.        Inclusionary Housing and Density Bonus. The City shall continue to implement the
ordinance requiring a 15% inclusionary requirement for all residential projects (except for
AHOZ projects which have a 20% inclusionary requirement). The inclusionary requirement shall
be accomplished by on-site construction, payment of in-lieu fees, or equivalent actions
prescribed in the AHO. The distribution of inclusionary units among target income groups shall
be based on the apportionment of RHNA goals. The City shall also continue to implement its
ordinance required density bonus requirements that are consistent with State Law and shall
review and update its regulations as needed to reflect any State Law changes.
Responsible Agency/Department:                Planning Department
Timeframe:                                    Ongoing; 2016 for review/updates to density bonus

Funding:                                      General Fund
Expected Outcome:                             Provision of affordable housing units through
                                              inclusionary zoning and density bonuses
5.        Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ). The City shall maintain the minimum
20% inclusionary housing requirement in the AHOZ zones.

6.        Secondary Dwelling and Infill Inducements. As previously noted, the City anticipates
that eight to 16 secondary dwellings would be constructed during the planning period. These
units are affordable to moderate income and rents generally fall within the limits established in
connection with the Federal Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program (“HAPP”).
Secondary units are exempt by ordinance from inclusionary requirements in exchange for
agreement by property owners to affirmatively market secondary units to income qualifying
tenants under the Section 8 HAPP. In addition, the City shall seek grant funds and establish a
rehabilitation/construction loan program to help defray development costs and induce production
of secondary units. In exchange for rehabilitation/construction financing, owner/developers of
secondary units shall be obligated to affordability covenants for a minimum of 10 years.

Expected Outcome:                                Financial Assistance Programs
7.        Targeted Assistance. Past performance clearly evidence the need for deeper subsidies,
land use incentives, and layered funding to make development of affordable housing possible.
This is particularly true of very low income households and special needs populations (including
extremely low income, farmworkers, disabled and homeless) where the needs are most acute.
Local funds alone are insufficient to meet that need. Instead, the City will need to draw upon a
variety of existing and potential funding resources available from State, Federal and private
sources. Locally, the most significant and immediately available resources include: (i) City’s
Housing In-Lieu Fee Fund; (ii) HOME Investment Partnership Program; (iii) CDBG Program
funding; and (iv) County Housing Trust Funds.
          a.     Resource Development. To augment local funding sources, the City shall: (i)
actively pursue grant and loan funding to finance the various housing initiatives listed in the
Housing Element; (ii) work cooperatively with for-profit and non-profit housing sponsors to
leverage resources (e.g., State and Federal tax credits); (iii) continue participation in the HOME
Consortium and CDBG Urban County and actively pursue CDBG funding for projects; (iii)
assist with site identification and support applications for funding for farmworker housing such
as the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program; and (v) evaluate other local funding
options and implement if deemed feasible. In specific regard to other local funding sources, the
City shall expressly evaluate the following: (i) adoption of a non-residential linkage development
fee; (ii) imposition of a real estate transfer tax; (iii) dedication of transient occupancy taxes; (iv)
CDBG Program funding; and (v) County Housing Trust Funds.
          b.     Housing Trust Fund. The City shall amend its current AHO, requiring that
Housing Trust Funds expenditures be used to assist (as provided in the Ordinance) housing
affordable to target income households in the same proportion as the Net RHNA housing need
for each of income category represents of the total net RHNA need for extremely low, very low,
low and moderate income; provided, further, that no less than 50% of the Fund shall be used to
assist extremely low and very low income housing. The higher apportionment of funds relative
to the numeric needs possessed by these two income groups recognizes the deeper subsidies
required to make housing affordable to extremely low and very low income households (and
associated special needs population segments – farmworkers, disabled and homeless).
          c.     Program Targeting. To affirmatively further the needs of extremely low income
households, the City shall amend its current AHO to: (i) acknowledge this particular population
segment among the target income households served under the Ordinance; (ii) grant priority
occupancy preference to extremely low income households (second only to displaced and
disabled persons) in regard to placement in affordable housing developed under the Ordinance;
and (iii) provide additional concessions and incentives in regard to the granting of density
bonuses beyond those presently stipulated for very low income.

          d.     Large Lot Development. To facilitate the development of affordable housing on
sites in excess of six acres, the City shall: (i) encourage the use of a specific plan process, in
combination with land division, to create developable parcels supporting between 50 and 150
dwellings each; (ii) target the incentives identified in Program 9 for the development of such
sites and notify residential builders and non-profit housing sponsors of these opportunities; and
(iii) advertise the availability of such sites and development incentives in conjunction with the
public hearing and annual review process described in Program 21.

8.        Public-Private Partnerships. The development of affordable housing, particularly for
extremely low and very low income households, as well as populations with special needs,
generally requires collaboration among multiple parties (e.g., developers, non-profit housing
sponsors, local government, etc.). In this regard, the City’s contribution can take one of a number
of forms: (i) assisting in the review and preparation of concept drawings; (ii) analyzing
development proforma and identifying gap financing; (iii) fast tracking the environmental review
and entitlement permit process; (iv) utilizing the City’s police powers to provide necessary land
use and zoning; (v) supporting applications submitted to funding agencies; and (vi) providing
direct financial or development assistance. Recognizing the collaborative nature of affordable
housing development, the City shall undertake the following: (i) continue participation in the
County HOME Consortium and CDBG Urban County and similar collaborative efforts to
affirmatively further emergency shelter, transitional housing, single room occupancy units,
shared living arrangements, supportive services and congregate housing needs outlined in the
Consolidated Plan; (ii) conduct workshops and advise for-profit and non-profit sponsors of Key
Development Sites selected for application of an AHOZ, including dissemination of information
on City website; and (iii) avail itself and offer all reasonable assistance to facilitate the
development of affordable housing consistent with the General Plan and Housing Element, with
particular emphasis on the needs of extremely low and very low income households and
associated special needs population segments (e.g., farmworkers, disabled, etc.).

SECTION V: HOUSING IMPEDIMENTS
Permit Procedures
The City’s permit process is codified in Chapter 19.08 of the Buellton Municipal Code and
provides for three levels of approval: (i) ministerial; (ii) administrative; and (iii) discretionary.
Comparatively speaking, Buellton has a far less onerous system relative to duration of process in
comparison to other Santa Barbara jurisdictions while development standards are similar.
Section 19.02.110 of the Buellton Municipal Code lists uses allowed in the various residential
and non-residential zone districts and the permit process that is required.
Under the existing Municipal Code, all multi-family housing projects, except for AHOZ projects,
require the review and approval of a development plan by the Planning Commission. This adds
time and cost to processing of smaller infill residential projects.
Under the existing AHOZ, an AHOZ project, if it meets all of the design requirements of the
AHOZ program, is processed at a staff level by the Zoning Administrator thereby saving
processing time by not having public hearings. Any exceptions to the AHOZ regulations require
review by the Planning Commission and City Council at a public hearing. Of the three AHOZ
projects processed by the City (see Section III, Adequate Housing Sites), one was approved by
the Zoning Administrator and two were approved by the City Council.
Separate and apart from the Zoning Ordinance, the City is subject to the California Building
Code (“CBC”) that establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction.
Special Housing Needs
According to Santa Ynez Valley People Helping People (Dean Palius, Executive Director, July
2014), the special housing needs specific to the Santa Ynez Valley (including Buellton) are as
follows:
         Emergency Shelter Needs: 50-60 nights/year (residential motels serve as a common
          temporary source)
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 25

         Transitional Needs: 4-6 year round units, each client typically requiring a 90-120 day stay
          (clients primarily involve families, translating to a need for 4 two bedrooms; 2 three
          bedrooms)
         Developmentally Disabled: 6-10 units for developmentally disabled adults, including
          both assisted and independent living, evenly divided bedroom sizes.
         Foster Care Children: 6-8 beds for children in between placement at a home (the majority
          of the children are teenagers)
Table H-7 shows Buellton’s Municipal Code requirements for special needs housing:

The requirement for a conditional use permit for most types of special needs housing is an
impediment to production of those housing types, and pursuant to changes to State Law, some of
these types of housing are an allowed use in at least one zoning district. Since the adoption of the
previous Housing Element, changes to the City’s regulations were made to permit emergency
shelters in the General Commercial zone as an allowed use and permit transitional housing in the
Residential zones as an allowed use. As stated in Program 11A, the regulations will be updated
to allow transitional and supportive housing in all zones permitting residential uses.
Reasonable Accommodation
State law stipulates that all newly constructed residential buildings consisting of four or more
dwelling units must be designed and constructed in a manner that allows access to, and use by,
disabled persons. This requirement does not require that physical changes be made at the time of
construction; rather, only that the units are designed to accommodate adaptive retrofit at a later
date. The City adopted an adaptive retrofit permit process in 2006 (Section 19.08.160). Adaptive
retrofit permit requests are processed by the Zoning Administrator through a noticed public
hearing.
The City also adopted Universal Design standards (Section 19.04.190) for all residential projects
of five or more units. Developers must offer several universal design features to prospective
purchasers as part of the sale of the unit. Any features requested would be at the cost of the
purchaser.
Inclusionary Housing
In some instances, inclusionary housing requirements are considered an impediment to building
housing. Developers frequently feel that they cannot make the numbers work if they have to
subsidize affordable housing units. However, in the case of Buellton, this impediment appears
not to be present. In the time period prior to adoption of the inclusionary housing ordinance
(1993-2001), Buellton’s growth rate was 15%. After adoption of the ordinance (2002-2008),
Buellton’s growth rate was 20%. The housing numbers and growth rate show a steady
production of housing units both before and after the adoption of the inclusionary housing
ordinance. Buellton’s growth rate from 2008-2014 was less than 1%, however that was due to
the nationwide housing market crash that began in 2007.
Fees
Development impact fees include fees for water and sewer infrastructure, fees to fund traffic
improvements, and school fees. The City of Buellton’s development impact fees are less than the
median and average for the County of Santa Barbara for both single-family and multi-family
dwelling units. The City of Buellton also reduces the traffic fee for affordable and senior housing
units by more than one-half from those of a standard multi-family dwelling unit. Therefore,
development impact fees are not considered a significant impediment to housing since they are
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 27

one of the lowest in the County. School fees are about the same as other cities in the area.
Overall, fees for single family and multi-family development are significantly less in Buellton.
Goal: To remove impediments to the provision of affordable housing, group quarters, shared-
living, and emergency shelters, and to provide accommodations for persons with disabilities.
Policies:
H-8 The City shall accommodate the full spectrum of housing types in its land use regulations
including, but not limited to, mixed-use developments, high density projects, rental and co-op
housing, secondary dwellings, in-fill development, and special needs housing (i.e., SROs, group
homes, congregate living, and emergency shelters).
H-9 The City shall periodically evaluate and adjust its regulations, ordinances and development
fees to ensure that they do not unduly constrain housing production; new regulatory proposals
shall be evaluated for compliance with this policy in advance of adoption.
H-10 The City shall encourage the construction or conversion of emergency shelters, transitional
housing and single room occupancy units to meet the needs of the homeless population and shall
likewise facilitate development of group homes, congregate care and independent living units for
persons with disabilities. The zoning ordinance shall be amended to allow emergency shelters,
transitional housing, SRO units, and congregate care units by right in at least one zoning district.
H-11 The City shall facilitate development of farm employee housing for up to 12 persons on
agriculturally zoned land as a matter of right and as a conditional use elsewhere in the City.
H-12 The City shall maintain its adaptive retrofit permit and universal design programs. The
adaptive retrofit permit process shall be streamlined to allow ministerial review.
Programs and Actions:
9.        Multi-Family Infill. All residential projects, excluding AHOZ projects, shall require
review and recommendation by the Planning Commission and a final decision by the City
Council in order to ensure that the design is consistent with the City’s policies and ordinances.

10.       Special Needs Housing Programs. As a member of the Santa Barbara County HOME
Consortium, the City actively supports the County in administering a Continuum of Care
Homeless Assistance Program. In addition, the City provides financial assistance to Santa Ynez
Valley People Helping People in furnishing food and emergency services to Buellton residents.
Information regarding services to assist homeless persons is routinely provided by the City as
appropriate. Persons needing such services are typically referred to the County Sheriff (which
administers a fund for food, gas and emergency shelter) or to People Helping People (which
administers various social services). A substation of the County Sheriff is located adjacent to
City Hall and People Helping People operate in nearby Solvang. To address these needs, the City
shall: (i) continue its involvement and support of the Consortium of Care and People Helping
People Homeless Programs; (ii) continue to disseminate information on services and resources;
and (iii) evaluate amnesty provisions for using motels for limited residential purposes (see
Program 16).

                                                units
11.       Persons with Disabilities.       The Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits
discrimination in all aspects of housing (rental, lease, terms and conditions, etc.) because of a
person’s disability. Disability is defined as: (i) physical or mental impairment that limits one or
more of a person's major life activities; or (ii) a record of having, or being perceived as having, a
physical or mental impairment. It does not include current illegal use of, or addiction to, a
controlled substance (as defined by Section 102 of the Federal Controlled Substance Act, 21
U.S.C. Sec. 802). Persons with disabilities have the right to use the services of a guide, signal or
service dog or other such designated animal and to keep such animals in or around their
dwellings. At the request of a person with a disability (or by someone acting on behalf of such
person with his or her written consent), a housing provider must make reasonable
accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when these accommodations may be
necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A housing
provider must allow a person with a disability (at the tenant’s expense or at the expense of
someone acting on behalf of such person with his or her written consent) to reasonably modify
existing premises if the modifications are necessary to afford the disabled person full enjoyment
of the premises. In furtherance of these rights, the City has adopted Universal Design regulations
codified in Section 19.04.190 of the Municipal Code, adopted an adaptive retrofit permit process
codified in Section 19.08.160 of the Municipal Code, and incorporates Fair Employment and
Housing Act provisions into each Affordable Housing Agreement governed by the AHO. In
addition, the AHO gives priority to disabled persons (second only to displaced persons) in
occupying affordable units governed by the AHO. The City shall also: (i) disseminate
information on the rights of the disabled as part of the Information and Referral Program listed
under Equal Housing Opportunity; (ii) seek grant funds for the adaptive retrofit program to
underwrite the expense of modifying dwellings to accommodate the needs of persons with
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 29

disabilities; and (iii) modify the adaptive retrofit permit process. This will include modifications
to the findings and to allow a ministerial approval process by the Planning Director.

amend its existing use regulations (codified at Sections 19.02.110 and 19.02.210 of the
Municipal Code) to allow transitional and supportive housing in all zones allowing residential
uses. Transitional and supportive housing will not be subject to any restrictions not imposed on
similar dwellings in the same zone.

SECTION VI: CONSERVATION AND REHABILITATION
Target groups comprise approximately 54% of all households in Buellton. Of these households,
approximately 35% pay in excess of 30% of their income toward housing. This disparity
underscores the need to preserve existing affordable housing; in particular, mobile (and
manufactured) homes that account for 21% of the City’s total housing stock. This need is shared
equally between owners and renters, while persons living in overcrowded conditions are skewed
toward renters (i.e., approximately 6% for renters and 1% for owners). Field surveys reveal that
two dwelling units are in a state of moderate despair, and 14 dwelling units show signs of
deferred maintenance. As much as 32% of the City’s housing stock may contain lead-based paint
based on the most recent Census data. The data also suggests an imbalance in jobs and housing
(with the consequence of increased computing) as well as a mismatch in the size of dwellings
(relative to bedroom counts) and households (relative to number of persons).
Field surveys conducted in July 2014 suggest that the City’s overall housing rehabilitation needs
are modest. Only about 1% of the City’s housing was deemed substandard. Most of this housing
is occupied by renters, presumably by persons of low and moderate income. At present, the City
provides annual financial assistance to the Santa Ynez Valley Senior Citizens’ Foundation in
underwriting the expense of making emergency repairs to mobile homes within Buellton
(representing approximately 21% of the City’s total housing inventory). According to on-site
resident managers, approximately 50 manufactured homes are currently in need of major repair.
The City had a Housing Conservation Program (HCP) for low income owner-occupied single
family homes. Unfortunately the funding for this program was from redevelopment housing-set-
aside funds and the program had to be cancelled because the funds are no longer available.
Goal: To conserve and rehabilitate the City's current stock of affordable housing.
Policies:
H-13 The City shall promote the cooperative repair, rehabilitation and improvement of mobile
homes and residential structures that are substandard or in disrepair; blighted conditions and
unsafe structures shall be abated and tenants shall be afforded protections in the event of their
displacement.
H-14 The City shall require replacement of dwellings that are occupied by, and affordable to,
target income groups and removed from the housing inventory due to demolition or conversion;
exceptions shall be granted for owner-occupied dwellings, properties undergoing public nuisance
abatement and non-conforming uses.
H-15 The City shall allow dwellings to be rehabilitated that do not meet current lot size
requirements, building setbacks or other development standards, so long as the non-conformity is
not increased and there is no threat to public health or safety; the City may consider amnesty for
non-conforming uses in exchange for affordable housing.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 31

H-16 The City shall encourage energy efficient construction in all new and rehabilitated
dwelling units in compliance with the California Building Code; new land use patterns resulting
from annexation shall encourage energy efficiency; solar access for existing development shall
be protected and provided in new development, to the extent feasible.
Programs and Actions:
12.       Property Rehabilitation. In response to the need for property rehabilitation, the City

13.       Code Enforcement. There are an underdetermined number of motel rooms (concentrated
in the area of Avenue of Flags) that may be in violation of zoning regulations by virtue of their
long-term residential use. To protect tenants without compromising land use policies or vested
property owner rights, the City shall undertake the following action.
a.        Transient Occupancy. The City shall amend its Municipal Code to: (i) clarify the
definition of hotel and motel uses with respect to duration of occupancy; (ii) allow for a
reasonable number of long-term visitor stays; (iii) provide for a reasonable amortization of
existing non-conforming use; and (iv) make allowances for relocation payments in the event of
tenant displacement. As part of the Municipal Code amendment, the City shall: (i) undertake an
analysis of candidate properties; (ii) ascertain the breadth and magnitude of potential non-
conforming conditions; and (iii) evaluate the feasibility of an amnesty program whereby limited
residential use may be continued in exchange for affordable housing covenants.

SECTION VII: EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act: (i) prohibits discrimination and harassment in
all aspects of housing including sales and rentals, evictions, terms and conditions, mortgage
loans and insurance, and land use and zoning; (ii) requires housing providers to make reasonable
accommodation in rules and practices to permit persons with disabilities to use and enjoy a
dwelling and to allow persons with disabilities to make reasonable modifications of the premises;
and (iii) prohibits retaliation against any person who has filed a complaint with the State
Department of Fair Employment and Housing, participated in a Department investigation or
opposed any activity prohibited by the Act. According to data furnished by the State Department
of Fair Employment and Housing, no complaints were lodged during the previous five-year
Housing Element planning cycle. While the incidence of complaints is relatively small, the
scarcity of vacancies and general lack of affordable housing can lead to more widespread
discrimination. In this regard, incomes are lowest among minorities and special needs
population with the scarcest housing.
Goal: To affirmatively further fair housing and assure equal access to sound, affordable housing
for all persons regardless of race, creed, age or sex.
Policies:
H-17 The City declares that all persons regardless of race, creed, age, physical disability or sex
shall have equal access to sound and affordable housing pursuant to State and Federal laws.
H-18 The City will promote awareness of the California Fair Housing and Employment Act and
actively support enforcement of the policies of the State Fair Employment and Housing
Commission.
H-19 The City will encourage the participation of all citizens of Buellton in the development of
housing policies for the City.
Programs and Actions:
15.       Fair Housing Services. The Federal HOME (Investment Partnership Act) Program
provides access to grant funds targeted at low and very low income families. Eligible uses of
these funds include homeownership assistance, multifamily rental project assistance, homeowner
rehabilitation, and tenant based rental assistance. To enhance their prospects for Federal HOME
funding, the Cities of Buellton, Carpinteria, Goleta, Lompoc, Santa Maria and Solvang have
formed a consortium in cooperation with Santa Barbara County. As a member of the HOME
Consortium, the City of Buellton has access to a variety of fair housing services sponsored by the
County including the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force, fair housing publications and
website information. Due to limited funding, these services are typically restricted to residents
and property owners within unincorporated areas of the County. To expand access to these
programs and assure their continued availability to Buellton, the City shall enter into discussions
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 34
with the County and arrange a transfer or trade of HOME funds or Federal CDBG funds in
exchange for access to County-sponsored fair housing counseling, information dissemination and
referral services.

Expected Outcome:                               Local Access for Fair Housing Services
16.       Information and Referral. The City will continue to collect, maintain and disseminate
information from the County, Housing Authority and State Department of Equal Housing and
Employment regarding housing and tenant rights. This information will be maintained at City
Hall and relevant topics will be periodically featured in the City’s bi-monthly newsletter that is
distributed to all residents. The City will also: (i) post relevant information on its official
website; (ii) conduct a focused mailing of relevant materials to landlords and tenants; and (iii)
refer complaints directly to the State Department of Fair Employment and Housing. In addition,
the City in partnership with the County of Santa Barbara (acting by and through the HOME
Consortium and CDBG Program), and other public and non-profit agencies, will jointly sponsor
and avail its facilities to provide an educational seminar on tenant and property owner rights and
responsibilities under state and federal fair housing laws, including rights of the disabled for
equal access to housing.

17.       Public Participation and Monitoring. Prior to any public hearing where the City is
considering amending or updating the Housing Element, the City will post notices at significant
public locations and shall directly notify the entities listed in Table H-4. Notice shall also be
given in conjunction with annual review of Housing Element performance.
          a.     Annual Review.         In the time frame mandated by State Law, the City shall
prepare its General Plan Annual Report and present said report to the City Council. The report
shall then be filed with State HCD in the manner prescribed by law.
          b.     Program Promotion. As part of the annual review process, the City shall
continue to promote the availability of housing assistance programs. No less than once a year,
these programs will be advertised in the City’s bi-monthly newsletter that is distributed to all
residents and posted on the City’s official website.

SECTION VIII: PRESERVATION OF AT-RISK UNITS
At-risk units are those that are currently in a subsidized housing program and provide housing to
target income groups at an affordable housing cost but will soon revert to market-rate housing
due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions.
Potential candidates include all multifamily rental units assisted under Federal, State and/or local
programs including Federal and State grants, bond programs, redevelopment projects, local in-
lieu fees, housing trusts funds, inclusionary housing and density bonuses (“covered units”). As
of July 1, 2014, the following potential “at-risk” projects have been identified:
         Central Gardens I, a 12-unit very low income project developed by the Santa Barbara
          Community Housing Corporation under the California Tax Credit Program located at 590
          Central Avenue. The project was developed in 2000 and has a 55-year deed covenant.
         Vintage Walk, a low and very low income apartment component of a mixed use project
          operated by the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County with a total of six affordable
          apartments. The project was developed in 2003 and has a 55-year deed covenant.
         Valley Station, a low and very low income apartment component of a mixed use project,
          also operated by the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County, with a total of seven
          affordable apartments. The project was developed in 2005 and has a 55-year deed
          covenant.
         Juliette Walk, a 44 unit for-sale condominium project that includes six affordable for-sale
          condominiums. The City enters into an affordable housing agreement with a 45-year
          covenant with each individual owner as the affordable units are purchased. The first
          affordable units were sold in 2007.
Under Housing Element criteria, these properties are not deemed at risk of conversion.
Goal: Retention and continuation of affordability covenants on all covered units at risk of
conversion in Buellton.
Policies:
H-20 The City shall actively monitor covered units and use all reasonable efforts to preserve at
risk dwellings including, but not limited to, direct purchase, mortgage refinancing, non-profit
partnership acquisition, co-operative tenant conversion and similar preservation techniques.
H-21 At least two years written notice shall be required prior to the conversion of any covered
units; such notice shall be given to the City, California Department of Housing and Community
Development, and the residents of covered units.

Programs and Actions:
18.       Affordable Housing Monitoring. The City shall maintain, in coordination with the
Housing Authority, and all other non-profit housing sponsors, a list of all dwellings within the
City that are subsidized by government funding or low income housing developed through local
regulations or incentives. The list shall include, at a minimum, the number of units, the type of
government program, and the date at which the units may convert to market-rate dwellings. In
addition, the City shall document the status of all covered units as part of its year-end report
required pursuant to Government Code Section 65400. The City shall also notify the current
owner/manager of Central Gardens I of the two year notice requirement in Section
19.16.022(B)(8) of the Municipal Code and record a declaration to this effect upon the title.

            CITY OF BUELLTON – HOUSING ELEMENT
PART TWO: TECHNICAL APPENDIX
SECTION I: HOUSING AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
Population Profile: Population growth for the City of Buellton and surrounding jurisdictions is
presented in Table H-9. During the previous Housing Element cycle, from 2009 to 2014,
Buellton experienced a growth rate of 1.3%. Comparatively speaking, Buellton’s rate of growth
and actual numeric increase were among the lowest of all jurisdictions in Santa Barbara County.
Noteworthy is the fact that Buellton has the least amount of population in group facilities (i.e.,
congregate care) and is third highest in median age (Table H-10). This demographic is
accompanied by a dramatic increase in children in the 13 to 17-year age bracket, young adults in
the 18 to 29 year group and adults in the 50 to 59-year range (Table H-11). The Hispanic and
Latino population (Table H-12) now comprises 30% of the City’s total, up from 26% during the
previous Housing Element cycle.

 Notes:
      (a) The City of Buellton was incorporated in 1992. Census data for 1990 includes unincorporated areas of the
           County that generally reflect but do not exactly coincide with the City's actual municipal boundaries. As
           such, data comparisons between 1990 and 2000 are approximate.
      (b) Between the 2000 and 2010 Census, the U.S. Dept. of Commerce change the manner in which
           Hispanic/Latino ethnicities are reported. In 2010, population counts for Hispanic/Latino “origin” are
           reported as a separate category, whereas in 2000, the Hispanic/Latino population was reported within the
           “race” category.
Household Profile: While the majority of Buellton’s population resides in family settings (71%
of all persons per Table H-10), persons living alone or with unrelated individuals comprise 29%
of all households; Table H-13 summarizes the actual number of persons that reside in family and
non-family arrangements. The average number of persons per family household is 3.23, while
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                                Page 44

that average household size city-wide 2.74 persons (Tables H-14 and H-15). It is noteworthy that
household size and occupancy are positively correlated; that is, as household size increases so
too does the proportion of renter-occupied households. Conversely, the proportion of owner
occupancy decreases with reductions in household size.                           As shown in Table H-15,
Hispanics/Latinos and Multiple Races have the largest household size of all ethnic groups.
Finally, Table H-16 evidences the dramatic increase of householders in the 45 to 64-year age
bracket; together with householders 65 years or older, total householders over the age of 45
years represent 67% of all households in the City.

 Note: The City of Buellton was incorporated in 1992. Census data for 1990 includes unincorporated areas of the
 County that generally reflect but do not exactly coincide with the City's actual municipal boundaries. As such, data
 comparisons between 1990 and 2000 are approximate.
Housing Profile: Housing growth for the City of Buellton and surrounding jurisdictions is
presented in Table H-17. Paralleling population trends, Buellton experienced very little growth in
dwelling units from 2010 to 2014. This limited growth rate was comparable among all County
jurisdictions. In terms of housing type and occupancy, Buellton has the highest percentage of
owner-occupied housing of any jurisdiction and the lowest percentage of multiple family
dwellings (Table H-18). Buellton also has the highest percentage of mobile homes that, due to a
predominance of older householders, contributes to the City’s relatively high median age. The
overall vacancy rate of 4.6% falls close to the ideal benchmark of 5%. Buellton’s housing
growth occurred in single-family dwellings, with an increase of 1 detached and 10 attached units
(Table H-19). As a consequence of the relatively low number of multi-family dwellings, the
principal source of rental housing is single family homes that typically rent at rates higher than
for apartments.

Economic Profile: Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and programming is geared
toward four target income groups: extremely low, very low, lower and moderate. These terms are
benchmarked against the median income defined for each of the State’s 58 counties. The upper
limit of extremely low income is 30% of the area-wide median, very low income is 50%, lower
income is 80%, and moderate income is 120%. The current income limits for Santa Barbara
County are displayed in Table H-20. The number of households in each category for Buellton is
provided in table H-21. Based on 2010 Census data and income distributions provided by
SBCAG Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) Plan 2014-22, target income groups
comprise 54% of all households in Buellton (Table H-21) with the largest group being very low
income at 25%. Buellton’s RHNA breakdown for each income category is shown in Table H-22.
On closer examination in Table H-23, ethnic groups which possess the least income are
Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native and Multiple Races, with Black
households being the most susceptible to living in poverty. Employment Rates, Job Profiles, and
Wage Profiles are provided as tables H-24, H-25, and H-26, respectively.

SECTION II: HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
Housing Cost Profile: For sale housing costs for the City of Buellton and surrounding
jurisdictions are presented in Table H-27. Rental rates for the City of Buellton are provided in
Tables H-28 and H-29. Buellton remains one of the more affordable communities in Santa
Barbara County. While median home prices have generally been declining since 2005, data for
2013 shows a slight increase.
Based on available data, Buellton’s median rental rates are lower than the closest neighboring
jurisdiction of Solvang, and significantly lower than the south coast area of Santa Barbara
County. However, the rate is higher than those of the other north Santa Barbara County
jurisdictions. A rental survey conducted in Buellton and the surrounding communities showed
that the rental rates for studio and 1-bedroom apartments are less than the HUD Fair Market
Rate while the rents for 2, and 3-bedroom rentals exceed the HUD standard. It is important to
note that during the survey period of June – July 2014, there were relatively few rentals available
in the City of Buellton

 Note: The rental survey, conducted June and July 2014, was based on Buellton and surrounding communities
 (Solvang, Lompoc, Santa Maria):
 - 3 listings for studios (one from Buellton),
 - 5 listings for one bedrooms (none in Buellton),
 - 11 listings for two bedrooms (one from Buellton),
 - 6 listings for three bedrooms (four from Buellton).
Affordability Gap: Affordability is a function of household income and housing costs, with
adjustments for family size and bedroom count. Affordability gap constitutes the difference
between the financial capacity of target income groups and the actual cost of market rate
housing.
Table H-30 sets forth affordable rents and maximum purchase prices for target income groups,
based on the HCD income limits for Santa Barbara County. As shown in Table H-30, the
maximum affordable rent for a very-low income four-person household is $995 monthly. As
shown in Table H-29, only studio apartments were renting at a rate affordable to very-low
income households. Rental rates for the larger units, which would be needed for a family of
four, are beyond the hypothetical means of very-low income households. Low income
households, with a maximum monthly rent of $1,593, would be able to afford one- and two-

bedroom apartments, while moderate income households, with a maximum monthy rent of
$2,199, would be able to afford a three-bedroom apartment.
As set forth in Table H-27, the median sales price in 2013 for a single-family home in Buellton is
$412,727, reflecting a slight increase over 2012 (which was the lowest sales price year since the
height of the market in 2005.) Table H-30 shows that for-sale housing in Buellton is out of the
financial reach of all target income categories without subsidies or other assistance programs.

 Notes:
 (a) Affordable housing cost for renter-occupied households assumes 30% of gross household income, not including
 utility costs.
 (b) Affordable housing sales prices are based on the following assumed variables: approx. 10% down payment plus
 3% closing costs, 30-year fixed rate mortgage, 4% annual interest rate, 30% housing expense-to-income ratio.

SECTION III: NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Needs Summary: Housing needs, for Housing Element purposes, are driven by five basic
factors: (i) expansion to accommodate increased population; (ii) replacement and rehabilitation
due to deterioration or removal; (iii) housing relief for overcrowded conditions and persons
paying more than they can afford; (iv) accommodation of persons with special housing needs;
and (v) preservation of assisted units at risk of conversion. The requirement for accommodating
future growth is covered in Part Two, Section V, while the needs of the existing population are
discussed below. As shown in Table H-31, persons paying in excess of 30% of their income for
housing represents the single biggest obstacle for Buellton residents, particularly for renters..
Similarly, the need for persons living in overcrowded conditions is skewed more toward renters.
Due to data limitations, the percentages of persons in need are not additive; that is, some of the
persons living in overcrowded conditions may also be overpaying for housing. However, in
relative terms, the needs of renters overshadow those of owners.
Table H-31: Indicators of Need
                                               Overpaying                              Overcrowding

 Estimates: Overpaying - Table B25106, Overcrowding - Table B25014.
 Notes:
 1. Definitions: (i) Overpaying - more than 30% of income is expended on housing costs; and (ii) Overcrowding -
 more than one person occupies each room.
 2. Due to the size of Buellton, confidentiality laws preclude the City from obtaining detailed cross tabulations of
 income and household characteristics (Andrew Ruppenstein, Research Program Specialist, Demographic Research
 Unit, State Census Data Center, California Department of Finance). Consequently, the numeric tabulation in Table
 33 may actually overstate needs due to double counting of population segments and including persons with
 incomes that exceed target group thresholds.
Housing Conditions: Independent field surveys were conducted during July 2014 to better
assess the condition of housing in Buellton. Survey data was collected by Planning staff. The
results are depicted in Table H-32 with a comparison to 2008 data from the 2009 Housing
Element. The data suggests similar overall need in 2014. The survey data also suggests that
approximately 42% of the total are candidates for rehabilitation (deferred maintenance and
moderate despair) and the balance are candidates for removal and redevelopment (functionally
obsolete).

Lead Based Paint: Prior to 1978, lead-based paint was used almost universally in homes and
apartment units until it was found to have detrimental impacts on human health, especially in
children. In children, lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage, impair mental
functioning, retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span. In adults, it can
cause irritability, poor muscle coordination, nerve damage, decreased sperm count and fetal
impairment. Young children, fetuses, infants, and adults with high blood pressure are the most
vulnerable to the effects of lead. The incidence of lead based paint (and potential hazard it
creates through deterioration of paint surfaces) correlates most directly to the age of a given
structure. The extent of the potential hazard, as it applies to Buellton, is summarized in Table H-
33. As is true for other identified housing needs, the potential hazard of lead based paint affects a
higher percentage of renter-occupied dwellings than those that are owner-occupied.

Jobs – Housing Balance: Achieving an ideal geographic relationship between the provision of
jobs and housing can produce a myriad of measurable and perceived benefits including reduced
congestion, improved air quality, more efficient utilization of resources and enhanced quality of
life. Achieving such a balance requires a match not only in quantity of jobs and housing but also
in quality (relative to income and cost). Available data does not allow for an in-depth analysis
but does lend insight into the subject. Table H-34 provides the input factors utilized as part of
the RHNA methodology in allocating regional housing needs to local jurisdictions. Only modest
growth is anticipated through this housing cycle. As also shown in Table H-34, jobs held by
Buellton residents are expected to average 1.20 per household in 2012, down from 1.65 in the
prior Housing Element cycle. Comparatively speaking, this ratio is comparable to the
Countywide average and is favorably positioned amongst other jurisdictions in the North County
region. Similarly, the percentage of Buellton residents commuting to jobs outside the City is
evenly positioned between other jurisdictions in the region. However, as shown in Table H-35,
Buellton residents are third after Solvang and Lompoc in average travel time. It is unclear
whether this is due to imbalances in the local employment base or the lack of affordable housing.

Housing Inventory Match: As noted in Table H-31, overcrowding affects 21% of all renter-
occupied households in Buellton. The problem is less acute for owner-occupants at 1.5% of the
total. Greater insight into this problem is provided by comparing the inventory of total housing,
irrespective of actual occupancy, against total households. How well the City’s housing
inventory matches household needs is accomplished by aligning bedroom counts with household
sizes (using State occupancy criteria). The resulting analysis appears in Table H-39. In short,
there is a far greater supply of owner-occupied units in the 2 to 4-bedroom range than are
necessary to satisfy needs. The imbalance suggests a need for more smaller-sized units (e.g., for
sale condominiums, for instance). For renters, there is a similar need for smaller-sized units as
well as units with 5+ bedrooms.

 Note: Number of persons and bedrooms are matched according to criteria specified in Section 50052(c) of the
 California Health and Safety Code.
At Risk Units: As part of the Housing Element update, jurisdictions must evaluate the potential
for deed-restricted low income housing units to covert from affordable to market rate status. The
inventory includes all multi-family rental units assisted under federal, state and/or local programs
including federal and state grants, bond programs, redevelopment projects, local in-lieu fees,
housing trusts funds, inclusionary housing and density bonuses. The inventory covers all units
that are eligible for conversion to market rate housing due to termination of subsidy contracts,
mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions. This inventory was compiled by City staff.
The following projects were identified:
         Central Gardens I, a 12-unit very low income project developed by the Santa Barbara
          Community Housing Corporation under the California Tax Credit Program located at 590
          Central Avenue. The project was developed in 2000 and has a 55-year deed covenant.
         Vintage Walk, a low and very low income apartment component of a mixed use project
          operated by the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County with a total of six affordable
          apartments. The project was developed in 2003 and has a 55-year deed covenant.
         Valley Station, a low and very low income apartment component of a mixed use project,
          also operated by the Housing Authority of Santa Barbara County, with a total of seven
          affordable apartments. The project was developed in 2005 and has a 55-year deed
          covenant.
         Juliette Walk, a 44 unit for-sale condominium project that includes six affordable for-sale
          condominiums. The City enters into an affordable housing agreement with a 45-year
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                          Page 62

          covenant with each individual owner as the affordable units are purchased. The first
          affordable units were sold in 2008.
Under Housing Element criteria, units are considered at risk if they have the potential to convert
from affordable to market rate status within 10 years. The properties listed above are not deemed
at risk of conversion during this Housing Element cycle.
Special Needs Population: Certain segments of the population have a more difficult time
finding decent and affordable housing due to special circumstances particular to these groups.
Those segments possessing special needs, as defined in California Government Code Section
65583(a)(6), consist of “the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers,
families with female heads of households, and families and persons in need of emergency
shelter.” Table H-37 provides a quantitative summary of these various population segments. In
sum total, disabled (non-elderly), homeless and seasonal farmworkers together represent 6% of
the City’s total population while elderly (non-female headed), large families and female-headed
(with children) households comprise 39% of all households. Due to the size of Buellton,
confidentiality laws preclude the City from obtaining detailed cross tabulations of income and
household characteristics (Andrew Ruppenstein, Research Program Specialist, Demographic
Research Unit, State Census Data Center, California Department of Finance). Consequently, the
numeric tabulation in Table H-37 may actually overstate needs due to double counting of
population segments and including persons with incomes that exceed target group thresholds.
Furthermore, estimates of farmworkers and homeless are based on proportional assignments of
regional data insofar as counts specific to Buellton are not indicative of total needs.

 Notes:
 1. Gross figures represent the total number of persons and households in each category. Adjusted figures deduct
 persons and households that appear in more than one category. To avoid double counting, the figures denoted in
 gray are used in computing the percentage each particular population segment represents relative to the City's total
 number of persons and households.
 2. Migrant/Seasonal Farmworkers is an estimate based on a proportional assignment of total estimated number of
 farmworkers Countywide. The proportional assignment is based on employment in Farming, Fishing, and Forestry
 Occupations as reported in the U.S. Census Bureau 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates,
 Economic Characteristics Fi le DP03. Buellton's proportionate share is 0.36% of total County-wide workers in the
 "Agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and mining" industry; this percentage was applied to County-wide seasonal
 farm-workers to estimate number of workers for Buellton. This computation is made for planning purposes only
 and does not presuppose that this population segment either resides in Buellton or have unmet needs.
 3. Homeless is an estimate based on a proportional assignment of total estimated number of homeless Countywide
 with unmet needs (as defined by Continuum of Care for Santa Barbara County. The proportional assignment is
 based on total population as of 2010 US Census. Buellton's proportionate share is 1.14% of total County-wide
 population; this percentage was applied to County-wide homeless number to estimate number of homeless for
 Buellton. This computation is made for planning purposes only and does not presuppose that this population
 segment resides in Buellton or requires housing services.
          a.      Elderly. The special needs of elderly result primarily from their lower, fixed
incomes, physical disabilities, dependent care and transit-dependent needs. According to the US
Census, 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 455 households (26%)
within the City are headed by elderly persons, , including 337 households (19%) headed by
males. The disabled elderly population is estimated at 205 persons, roughly 4% of the total city
population; disability characteristics of the population are shown in Table H-38. Typically, the
housing needs of the elderly are addressed through the provision of congregate housing,
secondary units, shared living arrangements and government-assisted housing. However, a
characteristic peculiar to Buellton is the large percentage that mobile homes comprise of the
City’s total housing stock. Mobile homes represent an important source of affordable housing.
Comparing the needs of current home buyers to those already living in the community (Table H-
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                               Page 64

30), the affordability gap is significant. As noted in Table H-18, of all the jurisdictions in Santa
Barbara County, Buellton has the highest percentage of mobile homes, which comprise 21% of
the housing stock; its close rival is the City of Carpinteria where mobile homes comprise 15% of
the community’s housing shock, while the percentage within all other Santa Barbara jurisdiction
is less than 10%. The City’s two largest mobile home parks both have age restrictions, resulting
in a large concentration of the elderly population segment in these neighborhoods.
          b.     Disabled Persons. The special needs of the disabled result primarily from their
lower, fixed incomes, mental and physical impairments, health and dependent care needs and
transit-dependency. According to the US Census, 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-
Year Estimates, 433 persons in Buellton possess one or more disabilities, the equivalent 9% of
the population. Approximately one-half of these individuals are also elderly. Disability
characteristics by age group are set forth in Table H-38. Data obtained from KidsData.org
indicate that there are 73 school-aged Buellton residents enrolled in special education programs
within the Buellton Union School District. Of this total, 10 students have either cognitive or self-
care difficulties, as shown in Table H-38. The general housing needs of the disabled are not
dissimilar to those possessed by the elderly; that is, the provision of congregate housing,
secondary units, shared living arrangements and government-assisted housing. However, the
special needs particular to disabled persons include accessibility for wheelchairs, railings, ramps
and adaptive retrofit of interior living spaces. Furthermore, care educators and care providers
emphasize the need for community assimilation, socialization and accommodations for shared,
assisted and independent living arrangements.

          c.     Large Households. The special needs of large families result primarily from the
limited availability of adequately sized, affordable dwellings. Large families are often of lower
income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwellings. According to the US
Census, 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 245 households within the
City qualify as large families, the equivalent of 14% of all households. As further noted in Table
H-15, Hispanic and Latino households together with multiple race households have the highest
household size of any ethnic group. Furthermore, a higher percentage of Hispanic and Latino
households are renters as compared to the City’s population at large (51% as compared to 30%).
As noted in Table H-31, overcrowding is far more common in rental units. This finding, coupled
with the housing imbalance discussed above (Table H-36), suggests that: (i) the needs of large
families are particularly acute for Hispanic and Latino households; and (ii) an overall need for
larger units in the 4+ bedroom range.
          d.     Farmworkers. The special needs of farmworkers result primarily from their
extremely low incomes and seasonal occupation. As noted in Table H-37, only 62 farmworkers
were believed to reside in Buellton according to the US Census, 2008-2012 American
Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. Insofar as the City neither has land designated for
agricultural use nor housing specifically constructed for agricultural employees, the Census
understates the City’s proportionate share of Countywide needs. For planning purposes, the
“adjusted” total in Table H-37 reflects a proportional assignment of seasonal farmworkers
Countywide. This computation is made for planning purposes only and does not presuppose that
this population segment either resides in Buellton or have unmet needs. In total, the proportional
assignment of 41 seasonal farmworkers represents less than 1% of the City’s overall population.
The needs of farmworkers generally fall within one of two categories: (i) seasonal workers
whose jobs are temporary, but stationary and recurring each year; and (ii) migrant workers
whose temporary assignments are accompanied with changes in geographic location. Migrant
farmworkers needs are complex; they need housing in multiple locations, often for short periods
of time. The situations of seasonal farmworkers, on the other hand, are similar to those of other
very low income persons. These findings underscore the need for more a more plentiful supply
of affordable housing together with non-traditional living arrangements such as dormitory-style
housing.
          e.     Female-Headed Households. The special needs of female-headed households
result primarily from lower incomes and the need for accessible child care, health care and
supportive services. Child care, in particular, is both scarce and costly. According to data
compiled by KidsData.org for Santa Barbara County, the cost of child care has risen 11% from
2009 to 2012. Moreover, the current supply of licensed care meets only 30% of the estimated
need for all ages. In Buellton, there are 2 accredited child care facilities for children ages 2 - 5.
According to the US Census, 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 96
households with children in the City are headed by females, the equivalent of 5% of all
households. A comparable number, 109 households, are headed by females but without the
presence of children, while 118 elderly households are female-headed. This latter population
segment may have other dependency needs such as in the areas of home maintenance, household
finance and other routine activities. In summary, the housing needs of female-headed households
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 66

are addressed through the provision of affordable housing in combination with supporting
services.
          f.     Developmentally Disabled. According to State law (Section 4512 of Welfare and
Institutions Code), a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an
individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral
palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be closely
related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with
mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions solely physical in nature.
          Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living
environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require
an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
          The U.S. Census does not record developmental disabilities. As of June 2012, the State
Department of Developmental Services (DDS) provides community-based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a
statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
facilities. Buellton is served by the Tri-Counties Regional Center 3 (TCRC) which is based in
Santa Barbara, and has a field office in Santa Maria. TCRC serves approximately 11,500 clients
and has 280 staff persons, with 29 clients living in Buellton. Any resident who has a
developmental disability that originated before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are
offered to people with developmental disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may
include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior management
programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant development programs;
information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care;
physical and occupational therapy; transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and
vocational training. TCRC also coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program which
provides services for children under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a
developmental disability.
          According to DDS data received from HCD as part of the 5th cycle Housing Element
update, of the 29 developmentally disabled persons living in Buellton, 25 live in their own home
while 4 are in independent/supported living facilities. The age breakdown is reflected below:
   00-14 yrs         15-22 yrs        23-54 yrs        23-54 yrs        65+ yrs          Total

          Housing opportunities for people with disabilities can be maximized through housing
assistance programs and providing universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps,
lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. Buellton residents with
disabilities benefit from:
               ・ universal design provisions and reasonable accommodation requirements (per
                 State and Federal law) as set forth in the City’s Municipal Code
               ・ priority in occupying affordable units governed by the AHO
               ・ information and referral program regarding housing programs and rights of the
                 disabled for equal access to housing.
Homeless: Homelessness is a County-wide concern and arises from the lack of affordable
housing, increasing numbers of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions
in public subsidies to the poor and de-institutionalization of the mentally ill. As with the estimate
of farmworker needs, the number of homeless in Buellton appearing in Table H-37 (i.e., 27
persons) is an estimate based on a proportional assignment of the total estimated number of
homeless Countywide with unmet needs. This computation is made for planning purposes only
and does not presuppose that this population segment resides in Buellton or requires housing
services. As a member of the Santa Barbara County HOME Consortium, the City actively
supports the County in administering a Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Program. In
addition, the City provides financial assistance to Santa Ynez Valley People Helping People in
furnishing food and emergency services to Buellton residents. According to People Helping
People, the needs specific to the Santa Ynez Valley include: (i) Emergency Shelter Needs – 50 to
60 nights/year (residential motels serve as a common temporary source); (ii) Transitional Needs
– 4 to 6 year round units, each client typically requiring a 90-120 day (clients primarily involve
families, translating to a need for four 2-bedroom two 3-bedroom units); (iii) Developmentally
Disabled -- 6 to 10 units for developmentally disabled adults, including both assisted and
independent living, evenly divided between 2 and 3-bedroom units; and (iv) Foster Care
Children: 6-8 beds for children in between placement at a home (the majority of the children are
teenagers)

Extremely Low Income: AB 2634, passed during the 2006-07 California Legislative Session
and effective January 1, 2007, requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs of extremely low-income households (defined as 30 percent of area median and
below). The needs of extremely low income are not dissimilar to those discussed for other
special population groups resulting primarily from their limited financial capacity to acquire
affordable housing. This is proven out by statistics garnered from census data used by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development in connection with its Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (“CHAS”) process. As shown Table H-39, 87% of all extremely low
income households, both owners and renters are currently paying in excess of 30% of income
toward housing. While the number of such households is the least of all income groups (11%),
the overall needs possessed by this target group is by far the most acute (over twice the need
possessed by the population at large: 87% vs. 35%). And while the needs of extremely low
income renters is greater than those possessed owner-occupants, the needs are equally profound
(96% or renters are in need compared to 68% of owners). As discussed in connection with the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation process (Tables H-2, H-3, H-48), the needs of 33 extremely
low income households have been added to the current population baseline for purposes of the
Housing Element planning period of February 15, 2015 to February 15, 2023. In summary, the
housing needs of extremely low income households are addressed through the provision of non-
traditional and affordable housing (e.g., shared living arrangements, single room occupancy and
government-assisted housing), requiring deeper subsidies in combination with supportive
services.

SECTION IV: OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
Market Constraints: The main constraint to providing affordable housing in Buellton is the
ability for a developer or a potential owner of an affordable home to obtain financing. With the
changes in the lending services, more money has to be placed as a down payment and/or the
borrower’s credit rating must be much higher than was required in the past.
Government Constraints: Several sources, including the 2009 Housing Element, the State of
California, and the local Home Builders Association of the Central Coast, have identified various
governmental constraints to producing affordable housing. These constraints include: (i) cost
inefficient and unpredictable permit processes; (ii) counterproductive and inflexible development
standards; (iii) burdensome fees and untimely collection; and (iv) under-zoned properties and
inadequate densities.
          a.     Existing Permit Process. The City’s permit process is codified in Chapter 19.08
of the Buellton Municipal Code and provides for three levels of approval, listed in order of
processing time and complexity (from least to most with approximate time frames): (i) approvals
by the Zoning Administrator (i.e., Planning Director) for Zoning Clearances, Minor Use Permits
and Development Plans (one to six months); (ii) approvals by the Planning Commission for
Development Plans and Conditional Use Permits (three to twelve months); and (iii) approvals by
the City Council when projects entail tentative maps, zone changes or other legislative acts (six
to 18 months). Noticed public hearings are required for all land use approvals except Zoning
Clearances. Permit requirements for different residential uses are listed in Table H-40. If more
than one type of permit is required for a project, the permits will be processed concurrently.
Many of the residential uses require a Development Plan, which is reviewed by the Planning
Commission. The findings required for a Development Plan, Minor Use Permit, or Conditional
Use Permit include that the site is adequate in size, shape, location, and physical characteristics
to accommodate the density and intensity of development proposed, adverse impacts are
mitigated, streets are adequately designed, public services are adequate, project conforms with
the general plan and community design guidelines, the project will not conflict with any
easements and will not be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general
welfare of the neighborhood. AHOZ projects that conform to the following criteria are allowed
by Zoning Clearance under the jurisdiction of the Planning Director: (i) the Residential Project
consists of no more than twenty-five (25) units per acre (inclusive of density bonus units) on
sites with an underlying zone district of general commercial (CR) or residential multifamily
(RM); and (ii) the physical attributes of design conform to the development standards of the
underlying zone district (i.e. building height, lot coverage, setbacks, etc.) and adopted
community design guidelines of the city.
          Table H-40 displays the typical processing time frame for discretionary projects for
residential projects processed since 2009. It is not uncommon for projects to take three years or
longer to obtain entitlements in Santa Barbara County. Comparatively speaking, Buellton has a
far less onerous system relative to duration of process. As shown in Table H-40, the time
required to process discretionary land use applications ranges from nine to 21 months, with an
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                      Page 70

average of 15 months. However, there were no single family subdivisions or condominium
projects processed during this time. In fact, only two residential projects were processed since
the last Housing Element was approved.

           Note: Discretionary Approval includes, as applicable, Tentative Tract Map, Development
           Plan, Conditional Use Permit or equivalent. The types of discretionary approvals vary from
           project to project but are typically processed concurrently.
           *The Meritage Senior Living Project consisted of assisted living, a skilled nursing building, a
           memory building, and independent senior apartments.
          b.       Fees and Improvements. Various fees and off-site improvement requirements
are levied by the City (as well as other agencies) to cover processing costs, provide services and
construct facilities such as utilities, schools and supporting infrastructure. These fees and public
improvements are assessed through a pro rate share system based on the magnitude of the
project’s impact or the extent of benefit that will be derived. Table H-42 provides a comparative
analysis of fees charged for hypothetical single and multiple family projects. Comparatively
speaking, the fees charged by the City of Buellton are some of the lowest charged for single
family and multi-family development elsewhere in the County. The City has not increased fees
since the last Housing Element was adopted. The fees shown in Table H-42 include building
department fees. The City of Buellton contracts with the County of Santa Barbara for building
department services. The increase in Buellton fees is due to an increase in the County’s building
department fees. Differing rates between communities can be explained by a number of possible
factors including capital cost recovery for newly constructed infrastructure, scales of economy in
larger jurisdictions, different fees for development impacts, etc. Buellton’s development impact
fees seem to be significantly less than in other areas. The City’s traffic fee is significantly lower
for senior or affordable units. The City’s park fees are not required for residential projects that do
not have a Tentative Map. This doesn’t include school fees, which are similar in all areas. The
City’s on and off-site improvement requirements generally follow Public Works Standards
utilized by the County of Santa Barbara (i.e., street widths, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, etc.).
Improvement costs are not extraordinary. The right-of-way for residential streets is required to be
at least 56-60 feet wide. Landscape standards are also comparable to other cities in the County.
Multi-family residential zones are required to have at least 40% open space and single family
residential sites are required to have 50% of the front yard area be landscaped. The landscape
requirement for mixed use projects in general commercial zones is much less at 5%. Insofar as
City of Buellton

the inventory of land potentially available for residential development is located within an
existing urbanized area, improvements costs will likely be less than those incurred in rural and
suburban-fringe locations.

Note: Fees are generally a deposit. Any further costs incurred during processing are required to be paid.
*This is a one time fixed fee, not a deposit.
**There is a lower fee for residential units that are senior or affordable units. The other development impact fees do not have a
specific fee for senior/affordable units.
***Park fees are only required for residential projects that have an approved tentative map. If multi-family residential projects do not
have a tentative map, they would not pay a park fee.
            c.          Development and Building Standards. As is typical for most California
jurisdictions, Buellton has adopted a variety of development standards for all of its zone districts.
These standards are codified in Title 19 of the Buellton Municipal Code and include
requirements for lot area, off-street parking, lot coverage, density, building height and setbacks.
These requirements are shown in Table H-43. With the exception of density (discussed below),
the City’s development standards are not dissimilar to those imposed in other Santa Barbara
County jurisdictions. Of the eight zone districts that allow residential construction, two of the
non-residential zones (CR and CN) provide the most flexibility as far as setbacks and parking
reductions. Separate and apart from the Zoning Ordinance, the City is subject to the California
Building Code (“CBC”) that establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction. By
law, the City is required to adopt the CBC. By operation of the Municipal Code, the City adopts
the CBC concurrent with its adoption by the County of Santa Barbara. Since its incorporation in
1992, the City has not initiated changes to the CBC on its own. Such changes, if any have been
made, are wholly the result of the County.

          d.       Density. As shown in Table H-44, the City’s Zoning Ordinance provides for
maximum residential densities ranging from six dwellings per acre for single family zones to 25
dwellings per acre on sites with an Affordable Housing Overlay (AHOZ). As shown in Table H-
45, almost all residentially zoned properties have been developed to approximately 75% of their
allowed density. The exceptions have been the two AHOZ projects as noted in Table H-45.
Moreover, the as-built density of single residential neighborhoods totals less than five dwellings
units per acre. This particular statistic magnifies the disparity between land use designations (and
emphasis placed on low density single family) as provided in the City’s General Plan. This
disparity is further reflected in comparative data that shows Buellton (along with Solvang) as
having the least residential density of all Santa Barbara communities (Table H-46). The City’s
land use policies allow density of up to a minimum of 25 units per acre on the AHOZ sites. The
more recent residential developments do have higher densities. The highest densities occur in the
Juliette Walk project and Buellton Apartments, on AHOZ sites, and the Vintage Walk project, a
mixed use development on the Avenue of Flags.

 2. Notes:
      1. Capacity defines the percent to which property has been developed according to its underlying
           zone classification and is computed as follows: Actual Units Developed/Total Allowed Units.
      2. Density defines the number of dwellings units developed per acre of gross land, except for
           AHOZ projects.. Section 19.16.013(B)(1) of the Buellton Municipal Code states that the density
           for AHOZ projects is based on net buildable area.

       e.         Affordable Housing Ordinance.                    A comprehensive Affordable Housing
Ordinance (“AHO”) was adopted by the City Council on September 12, 2002. The Ordinance
broadened density bonus, inclusionary housing and replacement housing provisions beyond the
minimum prescribed by State law. The single most important feature of the Ordinance is the
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                               Page 77

requirement that at least 15% of all new residential units constructed within the City be
comprised of affordable housing for persons and families of low and moderate income. While
this inclusionary requirement could potentially serve as a constraint to new construction, it is
offset by the open-ended structure of density bonuses embodied in the AHO that enables projects
within the City to be built at whatever threshold the City Council, at its discretion, deems
appropriate to accomplish affordable housing and revitalization objectives. This innovation was
immediately applied in the Council’s subsequent approval of Vintage Walk two weeks following
the Ordinance’s adoption. In approving Vintage Walk, the Council granted a density bonus in
excess of 100%, allowing a mixed-use project at a density of 21 units per acre, well above the
zone district limit of 10 units per acre. In exchange, six of the 17 total units were dedicated as
affordable housing equal to 35% of the total. Another project which provided inclusionary
housing units, but did not take advantage of any of the other incentives, is the Valley Station
project. This project consists of 36 single family units and 7 affordable multi-family units. In
addition, since adoption of the inclusionary housing program during the prior Housing Element
cycle, the City has produced the following housing units under this program (does not include
any AHOZ projects):
           75 total units (60 market rate, 7 very low, 6 low, 2 moderate)
In the time period prior to adoption of the inclusionary housing ordinance (1993-2001),
Buellton’s growth rate was 15%. After adoption of the ordinance (2002-2008), Buellton’s growth
rate was 20%. Buellton’s growth rate from 2008-2014 was less than 1%. Other cities have
experienced similar low growth rates in recent years. The housing numbers and growth rate show
a steady production of housing units both before and after the adoption of the inclusionary
housing ordinance.
          f.      Affordable Housing Overlay Zone. An Ordinance establishing an Affordable
Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) on nine sites in Buellton was approved in October 2005. The
sites have an underlying zoning designation of commercial or industrial. The AHOZ allows a
residential project to be developed on the property. The project must have at least 25 units per
acre and 20% of the units must be designated for households with low, very low, or moderate
incomes. One of the sites was approved and constructed. Juliette Walk is a for sale condominium
project that consists of 44 condominiums. Four of the condominiums are for households with
very low incomes and three of the condominiums are for households with low incomes. Another
site was approved, but has subsequently expired prior to construction. Polo Village is a 53 unit
rental apartment project. The units will consist of one and two bedroom units. Five of the units
will be for households with very low incomes, three units will be for households with low
incomes, and three will be for households with moderate incomes. This project was approved in
April 2008 and expired before it was constructed. A third site was approved. Buellton
Apartments is a 62 unit rental apartment project. The units will consist of one, two, and three
bedroom units. Five of the units will be for households with very low incomes, four units will be
for households with low incomes, and the remainder since they are apartments, would qualify as
moderate income units.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                           Page 78

AHOZ Sites I and II are the two largest sites in the AHOZ. They are 17.10 and 15 acres and have
the capacity for 428 and 375 units respectively. This could be a deterrent to the development of
affordable housing for extremely low and low income households. This is because most assisted
housing developments utilizing State or federal financial resources include 50 to 150 units.
However, these sites could be subdivided or a specific plan could be approved for the sites.
These tools would allow the sites to be configured for smaller projects if a developer felt that
was appropriate. As provided in Program 1, the City will encourage and give favorable
consideration to such land divisions in the interest of facilitating the development of affordable
housing.
In the period since the AHOZ ordinance was adopted (January 2005 through July 2014), more
housing units have been entitled under the AHOZ program than the City’s inclusionary housing
program (Source: City of Buellton General Plan Annual Reports to State HCD). Although, 53 of
these units are part of the Polo Village project, which expired in April 2014.
          AHOZ Program: 159 total units (37 market rate, 14 very low, 10 low, and 98 moderate)
          Inclusionary Program: 75 total units (60 market rate, 7 very low, 6 low, and 2 moderate)
       g.        Design Review. Community Design Guidelines were adopted by the City of
Buellton in November 2005 and apply to all new development in the City. These Guidelines set
forth clearly defined standards for site design, architecture, parking and driveways, landscaping,
lighting, signs and utilities. They also provide four different architectural styles that are
permitted in the City. The Guidelines prescribe the process by which the standards are invoked,
contain generous graphics to illustrate intended outcomes and reserve onto the Planning
Commission and City Council the right to waive the standards when warranted. Unlike other
County jurisdictions which defer design review to separately appointed decision making bodies,
Buellton’s Guidelines are melded into the overall permit process; that is, projects are evaluated
for consistency with the Community Design Guidelines in connection with the permits and
approvals otherwise required for a particular project. In short, the Guidelines provide definitive
standards to guide applicants, do not compound or protract entitlements by adding a separate
review requirement and grant flexibility to decision makers in determining how and when they
are applied.
Development Capacity: Development capacity is a function of land availability, use
designations and environmental thresholds. As discussed in Part Two, Section V, the City has a
land inventory sufficient to yield a total of 1,692 units under zoning. This includes units on
residential zoned land (vacant and underdeveloped land), AHOZ sites, and non-residentially
zoned land (as part of a mixed use project). From an environmental vantage point, the City’s
General Plan EIR anticipated build-out at a total of 3,575 units. Deducting for units already built
(1,856), units under construction (0) and projects with entitlements (62), the City’s residual land
use capacity is 1,657 units. In December 2008 the City Council expanded the mixed use
regulations to CN, CS, and M zoned land. This removed some limitation on the development of
future mixed use projects.

Public Infrastructure. As noted in Part Two, Section V, the City’s RHNA allocation is 275
housing units. Based on the Buellton General Plan 2025, the City has adequate water and sewer
capacity to meet expected build-out in 2025 (an approximate population of 6,100). This
population increase equals an additional 431 dwelling units (2.8 persons per dwelling unit).
Therefore, the City has the infrastructure and capacity to serve the 275 unit RHNA allocation.
Dry utilities, such as power and gas, are available to all designated sites.
         The entire City was analyzed in the Final EIR for the General Plan Update-Land Use and
Circulation Elements (August 4, 2005). Impacts of a general nature were identified City-wide
and standard mitigation measures for all projects were adopted. Each particular parcel is required
to undergo specific environmental review pursuant to CEQA in order to address site specific
impacts and mitigation. However, major site constraints, such as flood areas and habitat areas,
are included with the 2005 Final EIR. All utility infrastructure and capacity are available to the
identified parcels.
The following provides a brief analysis of public infrastructure and its relationship to the
Housing Element.
          a.       Public Services. Police protection in the City of Buellton is furnished under
contract through the County of Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department. A Sheriff substation is
located within the Buellton Civic Center complex at 140 W. Hwy 246. The present level of
service entails a full time deputy with backup support on an “as needed” basis. Additional police
protection is available through all Santa Barbara County law enforcement agencies by virtue of
City membership in the State of California County Law Enforcement Region 1-A Mutual Aid
Agreement. Fire protection is furnished by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department and is
funded through a special countywide district. Station 31, also located in the Buellton Civic
Center complex, serves the area. The station is equipped with two fire engines, a brush truck and
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                            Page 80

hazardous material tractor/trailer vehicle. The station employs twelve full-time staff with four
on-duty at all times (including one paramedic/fire fighter). Future residential development would
increase the need for additional public safety protection and may require improvements to
existing facilities or increases in staffing and equipment. However, no major constraints are
known to exist that would impede a required expansion of services.
          b.     Traffic and Transportation. The City’s Circulation Element establishes a
standard for a Level of Service (LOS) LOS C or better for all intersections but accepts lower
LOS during peak traffic times. At present, all intersections operate within established guidelines,
however several intersections are forecasted to operate at an unacceptable LOS D or worse at
City buildout in 2025. Santa Barbara County’s Congestion Management Plan (CMP) sets
standards for environmental review of projects that generate a total trip increase of 50 peak hour
or 500 daily trips. Through the City’s development review process, future residential
development projects will be required to maintain consistency with General Plan Circulation
Element policies and all other applicable guidelines and regulations related to alternative
transportation. Furthermore, proposed projects would be required to conform to site-specific
traffic and safety regulations that specify adequate emergency access measures. Transportation
deficiencies, if any were found to exist, would be offset through a combination of development
fees, project design and off-site improvements.
Utilities and Service Systems. The City's water is obtained from two primary sources: (i)
Groundwater - four wells that draw from the Santa Ynez River Underflow and one that draws
from the Buellton Upland Groundwater Basin; and (ii) State Water - entitlement to 578 acre-feet
per year (“AFY”) of water from the State Water Project. The City had an average delivery of
approximately 1,220 acre-feet over the last four years (2010-2013). Over the next five years, the
City has the supply necessary to deliver 2,900 acre-feet of water annually during the normal
weather years through a combination of City-owned wells (via groundwater supply - Santa Ynez
River Underflow/Buellton Uplands) and State Water Project entitlements, compared to 1,371
acre-feet delivered in 2008. Over the next five years, during single dry years, total projected City
water supplies are 2,300 acre feet and during multiple dry years, 1,840 acre-feet (based on a 20%
reduction). In summary, water demand (1,737 acre-feet per the 2005 General Plan Update EIR)
from General Plan build-out is roughly 100 acre-feet below the estimated supply from all sources
during multiple year drought conditions. Overall capacity of the City’s existing wastewater
treatment facility is 650,000 gallons per day (“gpd”). The city currently treats an average of
500,000 gpd of wastewater. The City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant Facilities Evaluation
(Wallace Group in conjunction with Kennedy/Jenks Consultants, September 2007) states that the
City’s treatment plant facilities are adequate to meet existing wastewater flows and projected
wastewater flows for the year 2027, however plans for expansion will need to be considered once
the wastewater treatment plant capacity reaches 75%. The protection of water quality in the
region is under the jurisdiction of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast
Region (RWQCB) that sets standards for water contaminant levels by way of adopted Basin
Plans. Through the City’s development review process, future development projects are required
to maintain consistency with the Basin Plan as well as City standards. In summary, the city is at
a transition point where existing facilities are nearing their capacities in water, sewer or storm

drain systems and require further evaluation. Facility improvement fees and associated
mitigation measures would be required on a project-specific basis to offset associated impacts.
Pursuant to California Government Code 65589.7 and as stated in Program No. 5 of the city’s
Public Facilities and Services Element, a priority is granted for the provision of water and sewer
services to proposed developments that include housing affordable to lower income households.
          c.     Solid Waste Disposal. Solid waste disposal and material recycling for the City is
provided by Marborg Industries of Santa Barbara. Waste is ultimately disposed at Tajiguas
Sanitary Landfill, located approximately 15 miles southeast of the City of Goleta. The landfill
serves waste disposal needs for the unincorporated areas of the south coast of Santa Barbara
County, the City of Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez Valley and the Cuyama Valley. The landfill has a
permitted peak throughput of 1,500 tons per day. On August 13, 2002, the Santa Barbara County
Board of Supervisors approved an expansion of the Tajiguas Landfill in order to extend its waste
disposal capacity. The expansion allows for approximately 8.2 million cubic yards of additional
capacity. Because of increased recycling and reduced trash disposal, the landfill currently has
waste disposal capacity for at least 12 years. In addition, the County is currently reviewing a
Resource Recovery Project for the landfill. If approved, this facility would extend the capacity of
the landfill. New residential development will produce solid waste at a rate of approximately 2.2
pounds per resident per day. However, this growth factor (and the corresponding eight-year time
horizon of the current Housing Element planning cycle) is well within the 12-year capacity at
Tajiguas.
          d.     Schools. The City’s school-aged population is served by the Buellton Union
School District and Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District. The Buellton Union School
District operates Jonata Middle School and Oak Valley Elementary School, both located in the
City of Buellton, with current enrollment capacities of 192 and 447 students, respectively. The
Santa Ynez District operates Santa Ynez High School located near the neighboring community
of Solvang with a design capacity of 959. Both Districts are at or near their designed capacity
and rely upon portable classroom facilities to accommodate expanded enrollment. All developers
are required to pay school impact fees to offset the need for new facilities. Under Section
65995(3)(h) of the California Government Code (Senate Bill 50, chaptered August 27, 1998), the
payment of statutory fees “…is deemed to be full and complete mitigation of the impacts of any
legislative or adjudicative act, or both, involving, but not limited to, the planning, use, or
development of real property, or any change in governmental organization or reorganization.”
Transient Occupancy: The City’s inventory of hotel and motel properties totals 591 rooms. Of
this total, 178 rooms are located along Avenue of Flags. Approximately one-half of these rooms
are believed to be occupied as primary residences; most by target income groups and many by
farmworker households. While these rooms may serve as a source of affordable housing, their
use is contrary to underlying zoning and could potentially impede revitalization efforts on the
Avenue of Flags. On the other hand, aggressive enforcement under the City’s land use police
powers may have the unintended consequence of displacing persons with limited means of
finding replacement housing. One approach toward solving this dilemma is to amend the City’s
Zoning Ordinance by: (i) establishing the limit of what constitutes transient occupancy; (ii)
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                      Page 82

establishing an amortization schedule for converting non-conforming uses, linked to change of
occupancy by current resident occupants; (iii) instituting relocation assistance payments for
resident occupants displaced by actions of the owner; and (iv) instituting an amnesty program,
allowing a limited number of motels rooms to be used for limited residential purposes in
furtherance of Housing Element goals.
Energy Conservation: Energy efficiency is important not only for conserving natural
resources, it has the added benefit of keeping incidental housing costs in check. It also has public
policy ramifications relative to underwriting the cost of providing affordable housing. As noted
in Part Two, Section II, and codified in Title 25, Section 6920 of the California Code of
Regulations, utility expenses are part of the formula used in computing of maximum rents and
sales prices that may be charged for housing that is made available to target income groups. High
utility costs translate to lower the rent and price thresholds, which in turn result in larger
financial gaps between market rate and affordable housing. Simply put, as residential energy
costs rise, housing affordability declines. As such, it is in the shared interest of the consumer and
City to promote energy conservation. In this regard, there are three principal means by which to
promote efficient use of energy resources: (i) by building regulation; (ii) by land use practice;
and (iii) by education and inducement.
          a.     Building Regulation. As earlier noted, the City is subject to the California
Building Code (“CBC”) that establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction. A
component of the California Building Code is Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that
prescribes minimum energy conservation features and requires the adoption of energy budgets
for all new development. Beyond the requirements of the CBC (particularly in regard to existing
homes), the City has the opportunity to promote energy conservation as a condition of receiving
financial assistance for housing rehabilitation programs it may choose to underwrite. One such
approach would be to employ the standards prescribed in the Code of Federal Regulations (24
CFR 39.7). Property improvements undertaken pursuant to 24 CFR 39.7 encompass: (i) exterior
weatherization consisting of weather-stripping, caulking and water heater insulation blankets; (ii)
interior weatherization consisting of attic insulation, duct wrap and flow restrictors for
showerheads and sink aerators; (iii) energy-efficient retrofit consisting of water saver toilets,
wall insulation, floor insulation, space conditioning equipment, set back thermostats, pipe
insulation, electronic ignition of forced air furnaces and gas cooking appliances; and (iv) energy-
efficient lighting.
          b.     Land Use Practices.          The goal of promoting compact development has
continued relevance in the Housing Element update, in particular, mixed use development
policies that foster smart growth principles by: (i) creating affordable housing near employment,
thereby reducing automobile dependency; and (ii) concentrating growth in existing urbanized
areas, thereby maximizing existing infrastructure.
          c.     Education and Inducement. According to Pacific Gas and Electric Company,
44% of residential energy costs is attributed to heating and cooling systems, 33% is attributed to
lighting and appliances, 14% is attributed to water heaters and 9% is attributed to refrigerators.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 83

PG&E further notes that residential consumers can realize significant savings by a variety of
relatively simple practices including insulating water pipes, weather stripping, cleaning
refrigerator coils, using compact fluorescent light bulbs, repairing leaky faucets, sealing heating
and cooling ducts, servicing furnace filters and installing programmable thermostats. To both
assist and incentivize consumers to conserve, PG&E offers a variety of programs; most notable,
energy audits, performance incentives, equipment rebates, design and construction assistance,
and technical advice. The City routinely distributes information available through PG&E;
however, City has not, however, actively promoted energy awareness programs either on its own
or in concert with utility companies. The City can better leverage its own resources by including
PG&E incentives in housing rehabilitation programs it may choose to underwrite.
Persons with Disabilities: The Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits discrimination in
all aspects of housing (rental, lease, terms and conditions, etc.) because of a person’s disability.
Disability is defined as: (i) physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of a person's
major life activities; or (ii) a record of having, or being perceived as having, a physical or mental
impairment. It does not include current illegal use of, or addiction to, a controlled substance (as
defined by Section 102 of the Federal Controlled Substance Act, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 802). As noted
in Part Two, Section III, the special needs of the disabled result primarily from their lower, fixed
incomes, mental and physical impairments, health and dependent care needs and transit-
dependency. The general housing needs of the disabled are not dissimilar to those possessed by
the elderly; that is, the provision of congregate housing, secondary units, shared living
arrangements and government-assisted housing. However, the special needs particular to
disabled persons include accessibility for wheelchairs, railings, ramps and adaptive retrofit of
interior living spaces. As also noted in Part Two, Section III, care educators and care providers
emphasize the need for community assimilation, socialization and accommodations for shared,
assisted and independent living arrangements.
          a.     Code Adaptations. As earlier noted, the City is subject to the California
Building Code (“CBC”) that establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction. A
component of the CBC are regulations that implement the provisions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (“ADA”). In general, these regulations apply to all multifamily apartment and
condominium buildings that contain three or more dwellings, along with special occupancy types
such as lodging houses, congregate residences, homeless shelters, dormitories and time share
dwellings. For these “covered” projects, a variety of accessibility routes and adaptable design
features must be incorporated into all new construction. Examples of adaptable design features
include backing for grab installation and removal base cabinets at the kitchen sink. Such features
need not be installed until requested by an occupant. These requirements, along with all other
CBC provisions, are aggressively enforced as part of the plan check and inspection process.
          b.     Reasonable Accommodations. At the request of a person with a disability, a
housing provider must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services
when these accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to
use and enjoy a dwelling. A housing provider must allow a person with a disability (at the
tenant’s expense) to reasonably modify existing premises if the modifications are necessary to
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                          Page 84

afford the disabled person full enjoyment of the premises. Section 19.08.160 of the City’s
Zoning Ordinance allows for an adaptive retrofit permit when modifications require an exception
in development standards of the underlying zone district. The Zoning Administrator has
jurisdiction over adaptive retrofit permits, except in the case where another part of the
application requires Planning Commission or City Council review. In that case, the Planning
Commission or City Council would have jurisdiction. A public hearing is currently required. It is
recommended that the adaptive retrofit permit process be modified to allow a ministerial
approval process by the Planning Director. In addition, in 2007, Section 19.04.190 was added to
the Municipal Code. It requires developers of for sale single family and multifamily
developments with five or more units to offer universal design features to prospective buyers.
          c.     Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations. There are other ways in which the
City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities through its regulatory and permitting
processes. The city allows some variation from the application of its parking standards. Section
19.04.140(F)(3) of the Zoning Ordinance titled “Uses Not Listed” would allow, for example, the
reduction of parking spaces for a unique use such as a senior housing project or other special
needs. In addition, Section 19.04.140(G) allows modifications to the parking requirements. All
of the residential zones allow shared living arrangements with a zoning clearance. Shared living
arrangements include supported living (e.g., in-home supportive services) and licensed
community care facilities, which may be occupied without regard to familial status, disability or
other population segment stipulated in fair housing statutes. The City does not restrict occupancy
of unrelated individuals in group homes and a family is defined as “one or more persons
occupying premises and living as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit”. The Land Use Element
of the General Plan does not restrict the siting of special need housing.
          d.     Occupancy Standards. The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not distinguish
between related and unrelated members of families and households, nor does it contain numeric
limits on occupancy. Section 19.12.020 defines “family” as meaning: “…one or more persons
occupying premises and living as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a
group occupying a boarding or lodging house, hotel, club, or similar dwelling for group use. A
family shall not include a fraternal, religious, social or business group. A family shall be deemed
to include domestic servants employed by the family.” Amendments to the Municipal Code were
adopted in August 2006 that implemented many of the programs described in the previous
Housing Element. These changes embodied changes to the inclusionary zoning requirements,
replacement housing and density bonuses provisions to induce the production and promote the
preservation of affordable housing. The AHO expressly provides the City with the right of first
refusal to occupy deed-restricted units with income-qualified tenants and that preference be
given in the order listed: (i) Displaced Persons whose dislocation involves a Residential Project
within the city; (ii) Disabled Persons; (iii) population groups with special needs as identified in
the city’s Housing Element (e.g., handicapped, elderly, farm workers, and single family
Households); and (iv) all other Very Low, Lower and Moderate Income Households. Within
these categories, preference is also given to current residents of the City and priority will be
assigned based on date of application.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                         Page 85

Group Homes. Residential care facilities with six or fewer clients are allowed by simple zone
clearance in all residential zones within the City. Facilities serving more than six clients are
allowed by discretionary authority of the Planning Director through either a Minor Use Permit or
Development Plan. As defined in Section 19.12.020 of the Buellton Municipal Code, the term
“residential care home” means: “…facilities providing residential, social and personal care for
children, the elderly, and people with some limits on their ability for self-care, but where medical
care is not a major element.” Residential care homes expressly include: “…children’s homes,
halfway houses, orphanages, rehabilitation centers and self-help group homes.” In September
2006 a definition for “special needs housing” was added to Section 19.16.012 of the Municipal
Code. “Special needs housing” means emergency shelters, transitional housing, single room
occupancy units, farmworker housing, congregate care facilities and similar types of special
living arrangements for persons and families who possess extraordinary housing needs by reason
of economic, social, mental or physical disability.” Special needs housing are allowed by
conditional use permit in all zone districts. The development standards for projects requiring a
conditional use permit shall be those that are specified for the underlying zone district where the
project is located, provided, however, that such development standards may be modified or
waived by development plan (as provided in Section 19.08.120.G.1).

    SECTION V: DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
    RHNA Allocation: The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (“RHNA”) process is part of a
    statewide mandate to address housing issues related to future growth in the State. The needs
    assessment process sets numeric targets with the overriding goal of assuring an equitable
    geographic distribution of needs and responsibilities. The numbers are first generated by HCD
    and then refined by regional planning agencies in cooperation with local government. While the
    methodology takes into account land use and zoning, the numbers are not necessarily constrained
    by institutional limits. Consequently, it is not inconceivable that housing numbers assigned to a
    particular jurisdiction exceed its theoretical carrying capacity. The number assigned to the City
    of Buellton for 2014-2022 is 275, of which roughly 55% is assigned to target income groups
    (Table H-48). These numbers are about the same amount assigned for the planning period from
    2007 to 2014. Table H-49 shows the units completed and currently entitled.

Land Inventory: A detailed assessment of parcel data, coupled with field surveys, reveals a
build-out potential of 1,692 dwellings on properties presently zoned for residential and mixed-
use (Table H-52). This inventory includes: (i) AHOZ sites; (ii) vacant residential and non-
residential (mixed use) sites; and (iii) under developed residential and non-residential sites. Some
of the acreage is constrained by one or more land use or environmental factors including
flooding, noise, slopes, access, land use compatibility and competing projects, but these have
been factored into the analysis. Please refer to Part One, Section III (Adequate Sites) for a
complete discussion. A map of these sites is provided in Figure H-2.

Secondary Dwellings: Apart from vacant and underdeveloped properties, the City also has the
capacity to accommodate over 700 secondary dwellings on properties zoned for single family
residential uses. However, historically only one to two secondary dwelling units have been
constructed per year. In May 2006 the City’s Municipal Code was revised to allow secondary
dwelling units on lots that are at least 6,500 square feet. Previously, lots had to be at least 7,000
square feet in order for an attached secondary dwelling unit to be permitted and at least 10,000
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                                    Page 88

square feet for a detached secondary dwelling unit to be permitted. The City considers secondary
units towards meeting its moderate income goals.
Special Needs Allocation: In May 2006, the Municipal Code was updated to include special
needs housing as an expressly authorized land use (see Table 41) with the issuance of a CUP.
Special needs housing includes emergency shelters, transitional housing, single room occupancy
units, farmworker housing, congregate care facilities and similar types of special living
arrangements for persons and families who possess extraordinary housing needs by reason of
economic, social, mental or physical disability. According to Santa Ynez Valley People Helping
People, there is a need for approximately 50-60 nights per year of emergency shelter needs for
the Santa Ynez Valley. There are currently no emergency shelters in Buellton, however the
residential motels serve as a common temporary source. In July 2010, the Municipal Code was
updated to permit emergency shelters in the CR zone as an allowed use, transitional housing in
the RM and RS zones as an allowed use. The update also included allowing emergency shelters
to be permitted in the RM zone with a CUP and transitional housing to be permitted in the CR
and CS zones with a CUP.
SB2 also requires that supportive housing be treated as a residential use and only subject to those
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Section
19.02.140(B) of the Buellton Municipal Code states that “Shared living arrangements, including
supported living (e.g., in-home supportive services) and licensed community care facilities, may
be occupied without regard to familial status, disability or other population segment stipulated in
fair housing statutes (e.g.. individuals with Alzheimer’s. AIDS/HIV, and homeless)”. As shown
in Table H-41, single family dwellings, as well as shared living arrangements are permitted with
a Zoning Clearance. The regulations will be updated to allow transitional and supportive housing
in all zones where residential uses are permitted.

SECTION VI: PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
Past Performance: As part of the update process, communities are required to assess the
achievements realized under their current adopted Housing Element. The analysis is both
quantitative and qualitative relative to specific numeric goals and defined actions set forth in the
Element. Significant deviations between policy objectives and actual results lend insight into
crafting policies and programs for the future. For Buellton, the existing adopted Housing
Element contains both qualitative and quantitative measures; relevant programs are summarized
below while housing production goals appear in Tables 53 and 54. Shortfalls in goal
achievement along with programmatic ramifications are summarized below.
                               Programs – Adequate Housing Sites
Goal: Maintain adequate sites with appropriate zoning, development standards and public
infrastructure to facilitate development of the broadest range of housing for all income levels
and population segments sufficient to attain compliance with the City’s fair share allocation of
regional housing needs. This includes the 25 unit per acre AHOZ properties as shown in Table
A-1.
Program 1 - Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ). The City will consider removing
certain properties from its AHOZ program in accordance with the reduced housing goals of the
2007 RHNA allocation. The remaining AHOZ sites shall be able to accommodate a total of 785
residential units. The AHOZ sites shall continue to have a minimum density of 25 units per acre
to ensure affordability. If any of those properties is developed with a non-residential project or
any development that does not meet the requirements of the AHOZ, a comparable acreage shall
be rezoned to the AHOZ designation to offset the loss. In addition, for AHOZ sites in excess of
two acres, the City will encourage and give favorable consideration to land divisions and
specific plans resulting in parcel sizes that facilitate the development of affordable housing
projects in light of state and federal funding programs that typical favor projects of between 50
and 150 units. The City will facilitate the development of these sites for low income housing
using the methods described in Programs 8 and 9 (Targeted Assistance and Public-Private
Partnerships).
The identification of the AHOZ sites to be removed will be determined as part of a
comprehensive review and update of the City’s zoning ordinance in 2016. At this time, it appears
that the following three AHOZ sites are candidates for removal from this program (as identified
in Table A-1):
          1.     AHOZ Site III, 3.20 acres, 80 units (adjoins Highway 101)
          2.     AHOZ Site VII, 1.15 acres, 29 units (small, fragmented sites)
          3.     AHOZ Site XI, 4.04 acres, 101 units (100-year flood plain)
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 90

Removal of these three sites would result in a capacity of 1,068 residential units which is above
the minimum RHNA requirement of 785 residential units. The actual sites to be removed will be
determined by the City Council in 2016 and the Housing Element will be amended concurrently
with the zoning ordinance amendment to fully identify the adequate sites requirement of State
Law.
Status: Objective not accomplished. The City has approved development on several of the
existing AHOZ sites. Staff decided not to implement this program because if the development is
built then sites would have to be added to the AHOZ.
Recommendation: Eliminate program from the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 2 - Mixed Use Development. The City Council shall review the mixed use concept, re-
evaluate the density and establish a 100 unit limit for mixed use projects. Implement the updated
mixed use regulations. Mixed use projects have the potential to provide 100 dwelling units
(Tables A-3 and A-5). Fostering mixed-use development serves multiple objectives including: (i)
implementation of the land use strategy set forth in the Avenue of Flags Urban Design Plan; (ii)
recycling blighted and underutilized property; (iii) producing affordable housing; and (iv)
promoting smart growth and new urbanism principles. If a limit for mixed-use residential units is
established, the Housing Element will be amended to analyze the limit as a potential constraint
on affordable housing, and if necessary, include programs to address the constraint. The limit
will not become effective until or unless concurrent amendment of the Housing Element has been
completed.
Status: Objective accomplished. Chapter 19.18 of the City’s Municipal Code was amended. A
100 unit limit for mixed use projects was not established.
Recommendation: Eliminate Program from the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 3 - Secondary Units and Underdeveloped Multifamily Infill. The City has the
capacity to accommodate secondary dwellings on the majority of single family zoned lots. In
addition, 33 multifamily units could be developed on existing under developed multi-family
zoned parcels. Intensifying the development of under-built properties would provide for more
efficient use of a limited land resource while dispersing affordable housing over a larger
geographic area. The City shall: (i) maintain the current secondary unit regulations that allow
secondary units on smaller lot sizes and exempts them from the inclusionary housing
requirements; (ii) continue to provide a 2:1 density bonus for infill multifamily units up to a
maximum increase of 50% above the base density; and (iii) continue to allow a reduction in
development standards for infill multifamily units by discretionary review as an additional
density bonus incentive under the current affordable housing regulations.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 91

Status: Ongoing. The City has maintained the secondary dwelling unit regulations and provides
a density bonus and development standard reductions for multi-family development.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 4 -      RHNA Allocation. The City shall update its Affordable Housing Ordinance (AHO) to
reflect the 2007-2014 RHNA allocation.   
Status: Objective not accomplished.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Revise it
to reflect the 2015-2023 RHNA allocation.
                             Programs – Affordable Housing Supply
Goal: To provide a continuing supply of affordable housing to meet the needs of existing and
future residents in all income categories.
Program 5 - Inclusionary Housing and Density Bonus. The City shall continue to implement
the ordinance requiring a 15% inclusionary requirement for all residential projects (except for
AHOZ projects which have a 20% inclusionary requirement). The inclusionary requirement shall
be accomplished by on-site construction, payment of in-lieu fees, or equivalent actions
prescribed in the AHO. The distribution of inclusionary units among target income groups shall
be based on the apportionment of RHNA goals. The City shall also continue to implement its
ordinance required density bonus requirements that are consistent with State Law and shall
update the regulations as State Law changes.
Status: Ongoing.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 6 – Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ). The City shall modify its AHOZ zones
in accordance with Housing Element Program 1 and maintain the minimum 20% inclusionary
housing requirement.
Status: Objective not accomplished.
Recommendation: Eliminate the portion of the program that modifies the AHOZ zones. Restate
and continue the portion of the program that maintains the 20% inclusionary requirement in the
2015-2023 Housing Element.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 92

Program 7 - Secondary Dwelling and Infill Inducements. As previously noted, the City
anticipates that seven to 14 secondary dwellings would be constructed during the planning
period. These units are affordable to moderate income and rents generally fall within the limits
established in connection with the Federal Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program
(“HAPP”). Secondary units are exempt by ordinance from inclusionary requirements in
exchange for agreement by property owners to affirmatively market secondary units to income
qualifying tenants under the Section 8 HAPP. In addition, the City shall seek grant funds and
establish a rehabilitation/construction loan program to help defray development costs and
induce production of secondary units. In exchange for rehabilitation/construction financing,
owner/developers of secondary units shall be obligated to affordability covenants for a minimum
of 10 years. In specific regard to multifamily infill projects, the City shall develop and
implement a financial assistance program, subsidizing multifamily infill projects within the
Buellton Improvement Project Redevelopment Area by refunding all tax increment derived from
construction of affordable units, less pass through payments to other tax agencies.
Status: Objective not accomplished. The City has not established a rehabilitation/construction
loan program to help defray development costs and induce production of secondary units.
Recommendation: Restate the part of the program that relates to the rehabilitation/construction
loan program for secondary units. Eliminate the part of the program that refers to projects in the
Buellton Improvement Project Redevelopment Area because this no longer exists.
Program 8 - Targeted Assistance. Past performance clearly evidence the need for deeper
subsidies, land use incentives and layered funding to make development of affordable housing
possible. This is particularly true of very low income and special needs populations (including
extremely low income, farmworkers, disabled and homeless) where the needs are most acute.
Local funds alone are insufficient to meet that need. Instead, the City will need to draw upon a
variety of existing and potential funding resources available from State, Federal and private
sources. Locally, the most significant and immediately available resources include: (i)
Redevelopment Housing Set Aside; (ii) City’s Housing In-Lieu Fee Fund; (iii) HOME Investment
Partnership Program; (iv) CDBG Program funding; and (v) County Housing Trust Funds.
          a.     Resource Development. To augment local funding sources, the City shall: (i)
actively pursue grant and loan funding to finance the various housing initiatives listed in the
Housing Element; (ii) work cooperatively with for-profit and non-profit housing sponsors to
leverage resources (e.g., State and Federal tax credits); (iii) continue participation in the HOME
Consortium, and CDBG Urban County and actively pursue CDBG funding for projects; (iv)
assist with site identification and support applications for funding for farmworker housing such
as the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program; and (v) evaluate other local funding
options and implement if deemed feasible. In specific regard to other local funding sources, the
City shall expressly evaluate the following: (i) adoption of a non-residential linkage development
fee; (ii) imposition of a real estate transfer tax; and (iii) dedication of transient occupancy taxes;
(iv) CDBG Program funding; and (v) County Housing Trust Funds.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                         Page 93

          b.     Redevelopment Agency. As a complimentary action to updating the Housing
Element, the City shall amend the Redevelopment Plan and update the 5-Year Implementation
Plan for the Buellton Improvement Project.
          c.     Housing Trust Fund. To align Redevelopment Plan and Housing Element
policies, the City shall amend its current AHO, requiring that Housing Trust Funds expenditures
be used to assist (as provided in the Ordinance) housing affordable to target income households
in the same proportion as the Net RHNA housing need for each of income category represents of
the total net RHNA need for extremely low, very low, low and moderate income; provided,
further, that no less than 50% of the Fund shall be used to assist extremely low and very low
income housing over the current ten year implementation period for the Buellton Improvement
Project redevelopment area established and required pursuant to Health and Safety Code
§33413.the higher apportionment of funds relative to the numeric needs possessed by these two
income groups recognizes the deeper subsidies required to make housing affordable to extremely
low and very low income households (and associated special needs population segments –
farmworkers, disabled and homeless).
          d,     Program Targeting. To affirmatively further the needs of extremely low income
households, the City shall amend its current AHO to: (i) acknowledge this particular population
segment among the target income households served under the Ordinance; (ii) grant priority
occupancy preference to extremely low income households (second only to displaced and
disabled persons) in regard to placement in affordable housing developed under the Ordinance;
and (iii) provide additional concessions and incentives in regard to the granting of density
bonuses beyond those presently stipulated for very low income.
          e.     Large Lot Development. To facilitate the development of affordable housing on
sites in excess of six acres, the City shall: (i) encourage the use of a specific plan process, in
combination with land division, to create developable parcels supporting between 50 and 150
dwellings each; (ii) target the incentives identified in Program 9 for the development of such
sites and notify residential builders and non-profit housing sponsors of these opportunities; and
(iii) advertise the availability of such sites and development incentives in conjunction with the
public hearing and annual review process described in Program 21.
Status: Ongoing and objective not accomplished. The actions in item a and e are ongoing. The
remaining items have not been completed.
Recommendation: Restate item a, eliminate everything in item b, and restate items c, d and e in
the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Eliminate the Redevelopment Housing Set Aside funds as an
available resource. Eliminate the references to the Redevelopment Plan and Buellton
Improvement Project redevelopment area in item c.

Program 9 - Public-Private Partnerships. The development of affordable housing, particularly
for extremely low and very low income households, as well as populations with special needs,
generally requires collaboration among multiple parties (e.g., developers, non-profit housing
sponsors, local government, etc.). In this regard, the City’s contribution can take one of a
number of forms: (i) assisting in the review and preparation of concept drawings; (ii) analyzing
development proforma and identifying gap financing; (iii) fast tracking the environmental review
and entitlement permit process; (iv) utilizing the City’s police powers to provide necessary land
use and zoning; (v) supporting applications submitted to funding agencies; (vi) providing direct
financial or development assistance; and (vii) employing the Redevelopment Agency to assemble
land for development. Recognizing the collaborative nature of affordable housing development,
the City shall undertake the following: (i) continue participation in the County HOME
Consortium and CDBG Urban County and similar collaborative efforts to affirmatively further
emergency shelter, transitional housing, single room occupancy units, shared living
arrangements, supportive services and congregate housing needs outlined in the Consolidated
Plan; (ii) conduct workshops and advise for-profit and non-profit sponsors of Key Development
Sites selected for application of an AHOZ; and (iii) avail itself and offer all reasonable
assistance to facilitate the development of affordable housing consistent with the General Plan
and updated Housing Element, with particular emphasis on the needs of extremely low and very
low income households and associated special needs population segments (e.g., farmworkers,
disabled, etc.).
Status: Ongoing. The City continues to confer with developers and non-profit housing sponsors
on affordable housing opportunities.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Remove
the reference to the Redevelopment Agency.
                                Programs – Housing Impediments
Goal: To remove impediments to the provision of affordable housing, group quarters, shared-
living, and emergency shelters, and to provide accommodations for persons with disabilities.
Program 10 - Land Use Modifications. The City shall amend its existing use regulations
(codified at Sections 19.02.110 and 19.02.210 of the Municipal Code) to: (i) allow emergency
shelters as an allowed use, which only requires a Zoning Clearance, in the CR zoning district
and as a conditional use in the RM, CS, and M zoning districts; (ii) allow SRO and congregate
units as an allowed use in the RM and CR zoning districts; (iii) allow transitional housing as an
allowed use in the RS and RM zoning district and as a conditional use in the CR and CS zoning
districts; and (iv) Allow farm employee housing as an allowed use with up to 36 beds in a group
quarters or 12 units or spaces in the OS zone and a conditional use in all other zones.
Emergency shelters shall be subject to the same development and management standards that
apply to all other uses allowed within the CR zone. Transitional housing shall only be subject to
restrictions that apply to other residential uses allowed within the RS and RM zones.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 95

 Objective accomplished. Sections 19.02.110, 19.02.210, 19.02.310, 19.04.142, and 19.16.012
of the City’s Municipal Code have been updated to include these provisions. Also, section
19.06.260 was added to the Municipal Code.
Recommendations: Eliminate Program from 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 11 – Multi-Family Infill. All residential projects, excluding AHOZ projects, shall
require review and recommendation by the Planning Commission and a final decision by the
City Council in order to ensure that the design is consistent with the City’s policies and
ordinances.
Status: Objective not accomplished.
Recommendations: Restate and continue program in the 2015 – 2023 Housing Element.
Program 12 - Development Constraints. The sites identified for potential residential
development and shown in Figure H-2 fall within one of three land use designations: (i)
Residential Multifamily; (ii) General Commercial; and (iii) AHOZ. As proposed, development
standards within the AHOZ are open-ended and provide the most flexibility. Of the zone districts
that presently exist, the CR General Commercial district is the least restrictive. Within
Residential Multifamily Zones, development standards are more traditional and may require
modification in order to achieve infill affordable housing objectives. The City, in consultation
with the Home Builders Association of the Central Coast, shall undertake a study of the
multifamily zone district with the specific objective of determining the necessity and
appropriateness of modifying relevant development standards (including Community Design
Guidelines) to maximize the build-out of multifamily properties at base densities with allowance
for bonus units. The identification of constraints will be included in the City’s upcoming Public
Visioning process that will occur in 2010. To the extent that constraints are identified,
corresponding revisions shall be made to the City’s land use regulations (i.e., subdivision and
zoning ordinances) as a result of this process. The expected date for any ordinance amendments
is late 2010 or early 2011. An exact date cannot be set as the actual time frame for the Public
Visioning process can vary depending on the comments received and the changes required to the
land use documents of the City.
Status: Not completed. Constraints were not identified in the Public Visioning process.
Recommendations: Eliminate Program from the 2015 - 2023 Housing Element
Program 13 - Special Needs Housing. As a member of the Santa Barbara County HOME
Consortium, the City actively supports the County in administering a Continuum of Care
Homeless Assistance Program. In addition, the City provides financial assistance to Santa Ynez
Valley People Helping People in furnishing food and emergency services to Buellton residents.
Information regarding services to assist homeless persons is routinely provided by the City as
appropriate. Persons needing such services are typically referred to the County Sheriff (which
administers a fund for food, gas and emergency shelter) or to People Helping People (which
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 96

administers various social services). A substation of the County Sheriff is located adjacent to
City Hall and People Helping People operate in nearby Solvang. To address these needs, the
City shall: (i) continue its involvement and support of the Consortium of Care and People
Helping People Homeless Programs; (ii) continue to disseminate information on services and
resources; (iii) evaluate amnesty provisions for utilizing motels for limited residential purposes
(see Program 16).
Status: Objective partially accomplished. Items i and ii are ongoing. Item iii was not completed.
Recommendations: Restate and continue items i and ii. Restate item iii.
Program 14 - Persons with Disabilities. The Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits
discrimination in all aspects of housing (rental, lease, terms and conditions, etc.) because of a
person’s disability. Disability is defined as: (i) physical or mental impairment that limits one or
more of a person's major life activities; or (ii) a record of having, or being perceived as having,
a physical or mental impairment. It does not include current illegal use of, or addiction to, a
controlled substance (as defined by Section 102 of the Federal Controlled Substance Act, 21
U.S.C. Sec. 802). Persons with disabilities have the right to use the services of a guide, signal or
service dog or other such designated animal and to keep such animals in or around their
dwellings. At the request of a person with a disability (or by someone acting on behalf of such
person with his or her written consent), a housing provider must make reasonable
accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services when these accommodations may be
necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A housing
provider must allow a person with a disability (at the tenant’s expense or at the expense of
someone acting on behalf of such person with his or her written consent) to reasonably modify
existing premises if the modifications are necessary to afford the disabled person full enjoyment
of the premises. In furtherance of these rights, the City has adopted Universal Design
regulations codified in Section 19.04.190 of the Municipal Code, adopted an adaptive retrofit
permit process codified in Section 19.08.160 of the Municipal Code, and incorporates Fair
Employment and Housing Act provisions into each Affordable Housing Agreement governed by
the AHO. In addition, the AHO gives priority to disabled persons (second only to displaced
persons) in occupying affordable units governed by the AHO. The City shall also: (i) disseminate
information on the rights of the disabled as part of the Information and Referral Program listed
under Equal Housing Opportunity; (ii) seek grant funds for the adaptive retrofit program to
underwrite the expense of modifying dwellings to accommodate the needs of persons with
disabilities; and (iii) modify the adaptive retrofit permit process to allow a ministerial approval
process by the Planning Director.
Status: Objective partially accomplished. The adaptive retrofit permit process has not been
modified to allow a ministerial approval process. The other items are ongoing.
Recommendations: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.

                           Programs – Conservation and Rehabilitation
Goal: To conserve and rehabilitate the City's current stock of affordable housing.
Program 15 - Property Rehabilitation. In response to the need for property rehabilitation, the
City shall: (i) continue its financial support of the mobile home repair program; (ii) continue its
financial support of the low income single family home repair program (the Housing
Conservation Program); (iii) evaluate expansion of emergency repair assistance to encompass
adaptive retrofit needs of disabled persons and inclusion of energy conservation features; (iv)
conduct a focused outreach to owners of substandard rental property to identify
interest/willingness to engage in cooperative rehabilitation; (v) establish a budget and seek
grant funds to underwrite these endeavors; and (vi) prioritize funds according to the severity of
need and link affordable housing covenants to the amount of funds required.
Status: Ongoing and partially accomplished. The City supported its Housing Conservation
Program until it had to cancel it because it was funded by Redevelopment money. The City shall
seek funding to re-establish this program. The City has not expanded the emergency repair
assistance program. The City has not conducted outreach to owners of substandard rental
property. Outreach was last done in 2007 and there was not much response from owners.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Remove
item ii.
Program 16 - Code Enforcement. There are an underdetermined number of motel rooms
(concentrated in the area of Avenue of Flags) that may be in violation of zoning regulations by
virtue of their long-term residential use. To protect tenants without compromising land use
policies or vested property owner rights, the City shall undertake the following action.
                 a.            Transient Occupancy. The City shall amend its Municipal Code to:
(i) clarify the definition of hotel and motel uses with respect to duration of occupancy; (ii) allow
for a reasonable number of long-term visitor stays; (iii) provide for a reasonable amortization of
existing non-conforming use; and (iv) make allowances for relocation payments in the event of
tenant displacement. As part of the Municipal Code amendment, the City shall: (i) undertake an
analysis of candidate properties; (ii) ascertain the breadth and magnitude of potential non-
conforming conditions; and (iii) evaluate the feasibility of an amnesty program whereby limited
residential use may be continued in exchange for affordable housing covenants.
Status: Objective not accomplished.
Recommendation: Restate program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 17 - Energy Conservation. The City will continue to collect, maintain and disseminate
information from Pacific Gas and Electric (“PG&E”) to encourage existing residents to
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 98

participate in energy efficiency retrofit and rebate programs. This information will be
maintained at City Hall and relevant topics will be periodically featured in the City’s semi-
annual newsletter that is distributed to all residents. In addition, the City will: (i) post relevant
information on its official website; (ii) integrate energy retrofit improvements into its emergency
repair and housing rehabilitation programs; and (iii) sponsor an energy awareness program, in
conjunction with PG&E, to educate residents about the benefits of various retrofit and rebate
programs.
Status: Ongoing.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
                            Programs – Equal Housing Opportunities
Goal: To affirmatively further fair housing and assure equal access to sound, affordable housing
for all persons regardless of race, creed, age or sex.
Program 18 - Fair Housing Services. The Federal HOME (Investment Partnership Act)
Program provides access to grant funds targeted at low and very low income families. Eligible
uses of these funds include homeownership assistance, multifamily rental project assistance,
homeowner rehabilitation, and tenant based rental assistance. To enhance their prospects for
Federal HOME funding, the Cities of Buellton, Carpinteria, Goleta, Lompoc, Santa Maria and
Solvang have formed a consortium in cooperation with Santa Barbara County. As a member of
the HOME Consortium, the City of Buellton has access to a variety of fair housing services
sponsored by the County including the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force, fair housing
publications and website information. Due to limited funding, these services are typically
restricted to residents and property owners within unincorporated areas of the County. To
expand access to these programs and assure their continued availability to Buellton, the City
shall enter into discussions with the County and arrange a transfer or trade of HOME funds or
Federal CDBG funds in exchange for access to County-sponsored fair housing counseling,
information dissemination and referral services.
Status: Ongoing. The City has not transferred or traded funds with the County, but because the
City is a member of the HOME Consortium its residents have access to fair housing services.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 19 - Information and Referral. The City will continue to collect, maintain and
disseminate information from the County, Housing Authority and State Department of Equal
Housing and Employment regarding housing and tenant rights. This information will be
maintained at City Hall and relevant topics will be periodically featured in the City’s semi-
annual newsletter that is distributed to all residents. The City will also: (i) post relevant
information on its official website; (ii) conduct a focused mailing of relevant materials to
landlords and tenants; and (iii) refer complaints directly to the State Department of Fair
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                         Page 99

Employment and Housing. In addition, the City in partnership with the County of Santa
Barbara (acting by and through the HOME Consortium and CDBG Program) and other public
and non-profit agencies, will jointly sponsor and avail its facilities to provide an educational
seminar on tenant and property owner rights and responsibilities under state and federal fair
housing laws.
Status: Ongoing.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Program 20 - Public Participation and Monitoring. Prior to any public hearing where the City
is considering amending or updating the Housing Element, the City will post notices at
significant public locations and shall directly notify the entities listed in Table H-4. Notice shall
also be given in conjunction with annual review of Housing Element performance. In addition,
the City, acting by and through its Redevelopment Agency, shall amend the 5-Year
Implementation Plan to fully integrate and incorporate of the affordable housing policies and
programs set forth in the Housing Element.
          a.     Annual Review.       In the time frame mandated by State Law, the City shall
prepare its General Plan Annual Report and present said report to the City Council. The report
shall then be filed with State HCD in the manner prescribed by law.
          b.     Program Promotion. As part of the annual review process, the City shall
promote the availability of housing assistance programs. No less than once a year, these
programs will be advertised in the City’s semi-annual newsletter that is distributed to all
residents and posted on the City’s official website.
Status: Ongoing. The City continues to post and provide notices as described when amending or
updating the Housing Element. The City has conducted annual reviews to access housing
performance. The promotion of the programs in the Housing Element is ongoing. Information is
provided to the public and developers as requested and articles have been published in the City’s
newsletter.
Recommendation: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Eliminate
the part of the program that requires that the Buellton Improvement Project Redevelopment Plan
be updated.
                            Programs – Preservation of At-Risk Units
Goal: Retention and continuation of affordability covenants on all covered units at risk of
conversion in Buellton.
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 100

Program 21 - Affordable Housing Monitoring. The City shall maintain, in coordination with
the Housing Authority, and all other non-profit housing sponsors, a list of all dwellings within
the City that are subsidized by government funding or low income housing developed through
local regulations or incentives. The list shall include, at a minimum, the number of units, the type
of government program, and the date at which the units may convert to market-rate dwellings.
In addition, the City shall document the status of all covered units as part of its year-end report
required pursuant to Government Code Section 65400. The City shall notify the current
owner/manager of Central Gardens I of the two year notice requirement in Section
19.16.022(B)(8) of the Municipal Code and record a declaration to this effect upon the title.
Status: Ongoing and objective partially accomplished. A list of all affordable dwellings is posted
on the City’s web site. Central Gardens was not notified of the noticing requirement. The status
of all covered units has been and will continue to be a part of the year-end report.
Recommendations: Restate and continue program in the 2015-2023 Housing Element.
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone and Inclusionary Housing: An Ordinance establishing an
Affordable Housing Overlay Zone (AHOZ) on nine sites in Buellton was approved in October
2005. The sites have an underlying zoning designation of commercial or industrial. The AHOZ
allows a residential project to be developed on the property. The project must have at least 25
units per acre and 20% of the units must be designated for households with low, very low, or
moderate incomes. Projects have been approved on three of the AHOZ sites. Juliette Walk is a
for sale condominium project that consists of 44 condominiums. Four of the condominiums are
very low income units and three of the condominiums are low income units. This project was
constructed and is fully occupied. In addition, an affordable housing in-lieu fee of $85,635 was
required for Juliette Walk for the fractions of affordable units that were not built. Polo Village is
a 53 unit rental apartment project. The units consist of one and two bedroom units. Five of the
units are for households with very low incomes, three units will be for households with low
incomes, and three will be for households with moderate incomes. This project was approved in
April 2008and subsequently expired in April 2014. Buellton Apartments is a 62 unit rental
apartment project. The units consist of one, two, and three bedroom units. Five of the units are
for households with very low incomes, four are for households with low incomes, and the
remainder, since they are apartments, would qualify as moderate units.
An Ordinance which updated the City’s inclusionary housing requirements was approved in
September 2006. Some of the revisions included allowing residential projects that met specific
requirements to be approved by the Planning Director with a Zoning Clearance, requiring at least
15% of the units in new residential projects to be designated for households with very low, low,
or moderate incomes, and instituting a density bonus and other incentives for developers of
residential projects. Several projects have been approved and constructed that met these
requirements. The Vintage Walk project is a mixed use project that includes 17 residential units
and 10 commercial units. Four of the residential units are for very low income households and
two of the units are for low income households. The affordable units are rental apartments that
are managed by the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara. The Valley Station
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 101

project consists of 36 single family homes, a commercial building, and a mixed use building. The
mixed use building includes commercial space and affordable rental apartments. The affordable
apartments consist of three very low income units and four low income units, including one that
meets the accessibility requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act. These apartments
are also managed by the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Barbara. In addition, the
Golden Meadows project is a condominium project that includes 20 units. An affordable housing
in-lieu fee of $35,000 was required for this project.
Goal Attainment: Between 2010 and 2014, a total of 11 dwellings were added to the City’s
inventory of housing. An additional 398 units are presently approved but not yet started
construction. According to City records, 10 of the units built since 2001 were condominiums and
1 of the units was a secondary dwelling unit. The secondary dwelling unit qualifies as a moderate
income unit. The balance of the units that were constructed, 10 in total, was constructed as
market rate housing. The match between Housing Element goals and actual production appear in
Tables 53 and 54. In summary, steady progress has been made in the areas of assisted housing
and market rate housing; less so in the areas of secondary units, density bonus, mixed use,
mobile homes, redevelopment and rehabilitation. The match between types of housing is
generally consistent with established goals, while tenure changes are undeterminable.

Buellton, Planning Department, General Plan Annual Reports, Reporting Period - January 1, 2009 to
December 31, 2013
Program Ramifications: A qualitative assessment of existing housing programs along with
recommended actions for the future has been completed. In summary, almost two thirds of the
stated objectives within the previous Housing Element have been achieved and need not be
continued or have continued relevance and should be retained; and about one third were either
not been achieved, were partially achieved or require retooling. Tables 51 and 52 provide a
quantitative assessment of numeric goals. The City realized approximately 0.6% of its new
construction goals for moderate, low and very low income households. There is a clear and
convincing need for deeper subsidies, land use incentives and layered funding to make
development of affordable housing possible.
Resource Inventory: The City realized less than 1% of its new construction goals for moderate,
low and very low income households in the past Housing Element cycle. To reiterate an earlier
statement, there is a clear and convincing need for deeper subsidies, land use incentives and
layered funding to make development of affordable housing possible. This is particularly true of
very low income where the needs are the greatest and the numeric RHNA goals the highest.
Local funds alone are insufficient to meet that need. Instead, the City will need to draw upon a
variety of existing and potential funding resources available from state, federal and private
sources. A partial listing of funding sources appears in Table H-53. Locally, the most significant
and immediately available resources are summarized below:
          a.     HOME Investment Partnership Program. Federal HOME can be used for a
variety of activities that promote affordable rental housing and homeownership for low and very
low income households. Funds may be used for building acquisition, new construction,
reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, and
tenant-based assistance. Grant recipients must provide a local match ranging between 25 and
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                        Page 103
50% depending on program activity. To enhance their prospects for funding, the Cities of
Buellton, Carpinteria, Goleta, Lompoc, Santa Maria and Solvang have formed a consortium
formed in cooperation with Santa Barbara County. Since forming this alliance, the HOME
Consortium has succeeded in securing funds in each of the annual application cycles dating back
to 1999. Buellton’s proportionate share of funds totals approximately $187,000. Rather than
spend small amounts incrementally, the City has opted to accrue its allocation until a single
project warrants their expenditure. Based on the Consortium’s track record in the past, the City
anticipates receiving an additional $91,000 in HOME funds for Buellton during the remaining
Housing Element planning period, bringing the total available to $278,000.
          b.     Community Development Block Grant Program. The City of Buellton is
eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant funding annually through the Urban
County Program. Santa Barbara County was deemed an urban county in 2007. Under the Urban
County Program, member jurisdictions are entitled to annual CDBG allotments directly through
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The program is administered for the
City by the County of Santa Barbara. A portion of these proceeds are available for affordable
housing projects and public facilities serving low income residents, including new housing
construction, ownership and rental rehabilitation, infrastructure improvements and the provision
of public facilities and services for low income residents. The balance of this funding can be
utilized for economic development and planning activities. This is a competitive program,
requiring the preparation of an annual application to the State in response to a Request for
Proposals. The first year that the City received a CDBG allotment was 2007, however it did not
distribute funds until the following year. The City has not distributed funds every year. In 2008 a
total of $9,134.00 in Human Services Funding was distributed to People Helping People and the
Legal Aid Foundation. In 2009 a total of $4,480 in Human Services Funding was distributed to
People Helping People and the Legal Aid Foundation. In 2011 a total of $12,252 in Human
Services Funding was distributed to People Helping People and the Bethania Preschool & After
School Program. In 2013 a total of $4,500 in Human Services Funding was distributed to People
Helping People. The City has approximately $100,000 available for capital projects funding,
however none has been distributed.
          c.     County Housing Trust Funds. Santa Barbara County receives fees assessed on
developers and project owners to support the production and maintenance of affordable housing.
These funds are disbursed to private and non-profit developers and public agencies for the
provision of the range of housing alternatives, including moderate, low and very low income
ownership and rental housing, special needs and farmworker housing, and transitional housing.
These funds are most often used to supplement projects already receiving federal, state or other
local funding support. At present, there is an unencumbered balance of approximately $216,000
specifically earmarked for the Santa Ynez Valley planning area. These funds are available on an
on-going basis. The County also has the ability to supplement this geographic reservation
through an annual application process. In each case, funds are awarded on a case-by-case basis.
          d.     Non-Profit Housing Organizations. In addition to direct funding, Buellton has
access to indirect resources through alliances with local non-profit housing organizations. The
City of Buellton
2015 Housing Element                       Page 104

organizations most active in Santa Barbara County include: (i) Housing Authority of Santa
Barbara County, a political subdivision of the State responsible for providing affordable housing
through rent subsidy programs or by occupancy in one of its housing developments; (ii) Peoples’
Self-Help Housing Corporation (PSHHC), a non-profit housing developer providing design,
implementation, technical assistance and property management of low income ownership and
rental housing; (iii) Santa Barbara Community Housing Corporation, specializing in housing
finance and providing information, education, property management and technical assistance to
persons and organizations who want to develop low income housing; (iv) Cabrillo Economic
Development Corporation (CEDC), offering construction, property management,
homeownership, counseling and community building services; and (v) Habitat for Humanity, a
non-profit which administers the City of Buellton’s Housing Conservation Program which
provides financial assistance to owner-occupants of single family homes to undertake needed
repairs and improvements.

Noise Element
                                       Noise Element
Introduction
Noise is of special concern to the State with respect to General Plans. It is one of the seven
topics required to be addressed in a specific Element under state planning law. The State Office
of Planning and Research Noise Element Guidelines require that major noise sources be
identified and quantified through the preparation of generalized noise contours for current and
projected conditions. The major noise source in the Buellton area is traffic, especially along
Highway 101 and Highway 246. Industrial operations are an additional, but less intrusive,
noise source in Buellton.
Overview of Noise & Sound Measurement
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted sound
pressure level (dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound power levels
to be consistent with that of human hearing response, which is most sensitive to frequencies
around 4,000 Hertz (about the highest note on a piano) and less sensitive to low frequencies
(below 100 Hertz). In addition to the actual instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the
duration of sound is important since sounds that occur over a long period of time are more
likely to be an annoyance or cause direct physical damage or environmental stress. One of the
most frequently used noise metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the
equivalent noise level (Leq). The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level that is
equivalent to the same amount of energy as that contained in the actual fluctuating levels over a
period of time. Typically, Leq is summed over a one-hour period.
The sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB level based on the
lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not
zero sound pressure level). Decibels cannot be added arithmetically, but rather are added on a
logarithmic basis. Based on the logarithmic scale, a doubling of sound energy is equivalent to
an increase of 3 dB. Because of the nature of the human ear, a sound must be about 10 dB
greater than the reference sound to be judged as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dB change in
community noise levels is noticeable, while 1-2 dB changes generally are not perceived. Quiet
suburban areas typically have noise levels in the range of 40-50 dBA, while those along arterial
streets are in the 50-60+ dBA range. Normal conversational levels are in the 60-65 dBA range,
and ambient noise levels greater than that can interrupt conversations.
Noise levels typically attenuate at a rate of 6 dBA per doubling of distance from point sources
such as industrial machinery. For example, a person standing 25 feet from an industrial
machine may experience noise levels of 75 dBA, while a person standing 50 feet from the same
noise source would experience noise levels of 69 dBA, and a person standing 100 feet from the
source would experience noise levels of 63 dBA. Noise from lightly traveled roads typically
attenuates at a rate of about 4.5 dBA per doubling of distance. Noise from heavily traveled
roads typically attenuates at about 3 dBA per doubling of distance.
                                                                                       City of Buellton

Noise Element
The actual time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night
tends to be more disturbing than that which occurs during the daytime. The Day-Night average
level (Ldn) recognizes this characteristic by weighting the hourly Leqs over a 24-hour period.
The weighting involves the addition of 10 dBA to actual nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) noise levels,
accounting for the greater amount of disturbance associated with noise during that time period.
Figure N-1 presents the California Department of Health, Office of Noise Control, noise
compatibility guidelines for various land uses. The compatibility table illustrates the ranges of
community noise exposure in terms of what is “normally acceptable,” “conditionally
acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,” and “clearly unacceptable.” For the most sensitive uses
such as single family residential, 60 dBA Ldn is the maximum normally acceptable exterior
level.
The City maintains an exterior noise standard of 60 dBA Ldn and an interior standard of 45
dBA Ldn for residential uses (both single-family and multi-family) and an exterior standard of
65 dBA Ldn for hospital and nursing home, church, school, and library uses.
The City’s noise standards have been refined to address differences in noise perception due to
small and large changes to ambient noise conditions. Accordingly, and as shown in Table N-1,
smaller changes in ambient noise levels result in normally unacceptable conditions at higher
existing noise levels.

            CLEARLY ACCEPTABLE – Specified land use is satisfactory, based on the assumption that any buildings involved are
            of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation requirements
            NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE – New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of
            the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional
            construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems of air conditioning will normally suffice.
            NORMALLY UNACCEPTABLE – New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new
            construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and
            needed noise insulation features included in the design.

   Sensitive Receptors
   Noise exposure goals for various types of land uses reflect the varying noise sensitivities
   associated with those uses. Residences, hospitals, schools, guest lodging, libraries, and parks
   are most sensitive to noise intrusion and therefore have more stringent noise exposure targets
   than manufacturing or agricultural uses that are not subject to impacts such as sleep
   disturbance. Noise sensitive residential areas are located throughout the community.
   Sources of Noise in the City
            Roadway Noise
            Roadway traffic is the primary source of noise in the City. Highways 101 and 246 carry by
            far the most traffic through the area, and are consequently the major noise contributors.
            The existing 60 dBA Ldn contour from Highway 101 ranges from 1,212 to 1,231 feet from
            centerline, while the existing 60 dBA Ldn contour from Highway 246 ranges from 209 to
            294 feet from centerline. However, these distances are likely less than modeled, because of
            topographic attenuation and intervening buildings. Existing noise contours are described
            in Table N-3, and expressed graphically in Figure N-2. Projected future noise contours
            are described in Table N-4, and expressed graphically in Figure N-3.
            The Avenue of Flags is the only other roadway in the City that currently carries sufficient
            traffic to produce audible noise at a substantial distance. The existing 60 dBA Ldn contour
            for the avenue is approximately 57 feet from the centerline and less where there are
            intervening structures. Other roads in the City carry low to moderate traffic (500-2,500
            ADT), but not sufficient to produce far-reaching noise contours. The noise model predicts
            that the 60 dBA Ldn contour would be less than 50 feet from the center of those roadways
            under existing and future conditions. Table N-3 provides more detailed roadway noise
            information.

         Commercial and Industrial Operations
         Industrial and commercial operations can be substantial sources of noise, depending on the
         type and hours of operation. Stationary noise sources of concern typically include
         generators, pumps, air compressors, outdoor speakers, motors, heavy equipment and
         similar machinery. These are usually often associated with trucking companies, tire shops,

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Noise Element
         Existing or planned commercial/industrial operations may result in noise impacts when
         they are adjacent to noise sensitive land uses. Noise generation within an industrial or
         commercial facility or in close proximity to many types of agricultural equipment is
         controlled indirectly by Federal and State employee health and safety regulations (e.g.,
         OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior noise emissions from such operations have the
         potential to exceed locally acceptable standards and nearby noise-sensitive land uses.
         Typical commercial and industrial noise sources include loading dock operations,
         parking lot activity, on-site equipment (including heating and air conditioning), and
         heavy truck idling.
         As the industrial and service commercial land uses continue to develop, the potential for
         land use compatibility problems associated with noise also increase. The sand, gravel,
         and rock extraction facilities in the Santa Ynez River bed near Buellton (Granite
         Construction and the Buellflat Rock Company) also produce substantial operational
         noise. However, no sensitive noise receptors in the City are located in the immediate
         vicinity of these operations.
         Commercial uses also generate operational noise, including noise generated by vehicles
         using commercial facilities. Operation of the commercial and retail uses often generate
         noise associated with mechanical equipment (such as generator, heating, ventilation and
         air conditioning (HVAC) units), deliveries, trash hauling activities, and customer and
         employee use of the facilities. The highest concentrations of commercial uses in the City
         are located along Highway 246 and the Avenue of Flags. In some areas, residential uses
         are located immediately adjacent to commercial uses.
         Municipal Code Section 19.02.220(E)(3) requires that for commercial and industrial
         operations, the volume of sound measured outside during calm air conditions,
         generated by any use on the property shall not exceed 75 dB at or beyond any point
         along the property boundary upon which such use is located. However, in no case shall
         the volume of sound exceed 65 dB at the location of any nearby noise sensitive uses.
         Agricultural Operations
         Assorted agricultural operations are located outside the City Limits. Agricultural
         operations produce noise associated with the following equipment: wind machines,
         diesel engines, aerial application aircrafts (crop dusters), and tractors. In some
         locations, agricultural operations are located immediately adjacent to residential uses
         within the City Limits. Santa Barbara County has a Right-to-Farm Ordinance (Chapter 3,
         Article V, Section 3-23) the purpose of which is to protect agricultural lands from
         conflicts with nonagricultural land uses that may result in financial hardships to
         agricultural operations or the termination of their operation. The County’s Right-to-
         Farm Ordinance states that no agricultural activity, operation, or facility shall be deemed
         or become a nuisance due to any changed condition in the locality, after the agricultural
         use has been in operation for at least three years.
                                                                                        City of Buellton

Noise Element
         Construction Noise
         In general, the grading phase of development project construction tends to create the
         highest noise levels because of the operation of heavy equipment. Noise levels
         associated with heavy equipment typically range between 75–95 dBA at 50 feet from the
         source (EPA, 1971). Continuous operation of this equipment during a nine-hour
         workday can cause high noise levels above the present ambient levels. Municipal Code
         Section 12.04.410 requires that during the hours of seven p.m. to seven a.m. weekdays,
         and during Saturdays or Sundays, tools, appliances or equipment producing noise of
         sufficient volume to disturb the sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property
         shall not be used, except with the express written permission of the Planning Director, or
         in case of an emergency.
                                                                                     City of Buellton

1.       Maintain acceptable noise levels for sensitive and non-sensitive land uses consistent
         with City standards (refer to Figure N-1).
2.       Protect noise sensitive uses from areas with high ambient noise levels.
3.       Integrate noise considerations into the community planning process to prevent
         noise/land use conflicts.
4.       Regulate construction-related noise to reduce impacts on adjacent land uses.
                                                        Policies
N-1      Noise/land use compatibility shall be as determined by Figure N-1. In general, areas
         within Buellton shall be considered impacted by noise if exposed to noise levels on the
         exterior of a building that exceeds 65 dB, and on the interior of a building exceeding 45
         dBA. New development producing stationary noise levels that exceed 65 dB will not be
         permitted in areas containing residential or other noise sensitive land uses.
N-2      New residential development should maintain appropriate setbacks from Highways 246
         and 101 that include landscaping, berms and sound mitigation walls, as generally
         illustrated by Photo 1, as needed to reduce noise levels to acceptable levels, as
         determined by a qualified consultant.
           Photo 1: Appropriate Noise Abatement in the City, Employing a Combination of Roadway Setbacks,
           Vegetative Screening, Berms, and Sound Walls
N-3      New residential development shall comply with the State Noise Insulation Standards.
N-4      New commercial and industrial development should incorporate design elements to
         minimize the noise impact on surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                                                                                                       City of Buellton

N-5      New mixed-use developments should be designed to prevent transfer of noise and
         vibration from the commercial or industrial use to the residential use.
N-6      New mixed-use developments should locate balconies of residential units away from the
         primary street and commercial or industrial noise sources.
N-7      Noise generated by construction activities should be limited to daytime hours to reduce
         nuisances at nearby noise receptors in accordance with the hours and days set in the
         adopted Standard Conditions of Approval.

Parks and Recreation Element
                               Parks and Recreation Element
Introduction
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional element that assesses community parks and
recreation needs and resources. By defining existing needs and resources and forecasting future
needs and resources, the City can develop and implement realistic policies for the long-term
provision of park facilities. This element thus provides a framework for Buellton to measure the
effectiveness of current and future parks and recreation programs, and establish a balanced
supply of parks and recreation facilities that satisfy the needs of all residents.
Parks and Recreation Resources
Parks and recreational resources are important to identify and evaluate because they provide an
important measure of the physical quality of life in a community. Such resources enhance the
City’s aesthetic qualities, the health of the City’s environment, and residents' perceptions and
enjoyment of the City. Community parks are both recreation and open space resources, which
can provide opportunities for both active and passive recreation, and can also include natural
preserve areas.
Two fully developed parks currently exist in the City of Buellton. Oak Park, is located at the
northwest corner of Sycamore Drive and Second Street. Oak Park consists of 1.75 acres of
gently sloping lawn with several picnic tables, individual barbecue grills, play structure and tot
lot, restroom, trees, and light landscaping. River View Park, located at 151 Sycamore Drive,
consists of approximately 11 usable acres with extensive landscaping. Amenities include a
ceremonial pavilion, walking pathways, individual and group picnic areas, a large play
structure, a smaller tot lot, two basketball courts, a grass volleyball court, horseshoe pits, two
restrooms, and a large grassy playing field. At the western edge of the park, an approximately
2 acre area is planned to be developed into a native botanic garden in conjunction with a local
non-profit foundation.
The Avenue of Flags medians are also used as landscaped open space. Facilities include a
pedestrian walkway, exhibit areas for sculpture and art, extensive landscaping, community
gathering areas and kiosk, and space for community events such as car shows and farmers
markets.
Sharon Place Park, a 3.3-acre area located north of Sharon Place, was originally planned as a
park site by Santa Barbara County prior to Buellton’s incorporation. The range of recreation
activities that could be provided on this site is limited by the size, shape, and topography of the
property. A plan for a passive use Sharon Place Park with pedestrian pathway, several benches,
and landscaping has been prepared.
In addition, Buellton residents have access to several County park facilities nearby. Nojoqui
Falls County Park and Santa Rosa Park provide hiking and picnicking opportunities. The Zaca
Creek Golf Course is part of the Rancho de Maria residential development. The course is open
to the public. The Rancho de Maria subdivision homeowners' association also owns and
                                                                                        City of Buellton

       maintains an approximately 6.35 acre park on Shadow Mountain Drive adjacent to the Zaca
       Creek Golf Course. The park amenities include play equipment and picnic areas; however,
       Rancho de Maria Park is a privately owned park administered by the homeowner's association
       and intended for the use of its residents (Kyle Abello, Buellton Recreation Coordinator, City of
       Buellton, Written Communication, April, 2004).
       Jonata School has children’s play equipment, sports fields, and tennis and basketball courts.
       These fields are actively used for organized sports throughout the year. The school yard is
       generally open to the public all day during weekends, holidays and summer vacation; and
       during school days from approximately 3:00 pm to dusk. Construction of a Joint Use
       Gymnasium at Jonata School is currently underway.
       Oak Valley Elementary School also has a play structure, basketball courts, and a large playing
       field with soccer goals and a backstop. This playing field, known as Oak Valley Field, operates
       under a joint use agreement between the Buellton Union School District and the City whereby the
       City retains priority use of the field for the public outside of school hours. The field is used
       extensively for organized sports throughout the year.
       Recreation programs in the City of Buellton are provided through a cooperative agreement with
       the City of Solvang. Recreation programs include a youth day camp, sports leagues, after-school
       programs, trips to museums and concerts, and several large community events.

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Parks and Recreation Element
The City’s standard for park provision is five acres of park area per 1,000 residents. The current
population of Buellton is 4,548 (Department of Finance, January 2006). The current useable
parkland in the City is 13.25 acres. Therefore, the City currently provides approximately 2.91
acres of park area per 1,000 population, which is below the City’s standard, and current (year
2006) developed parkland need of approximately 23 acres.
         Linear Park
         A linear park is often developed along natural or human-made
         corridors, such as creeks, rivers, drainage facilities or roads. The
         size of a linear park may vary, but should be of sufficient width
         to protect sensitive resources and to accommodate a trail.
         Facilities provided with linear parks are usually limited to
         seating, picnic tables and in some instances, a tot-lot. The
         Avenue of Flags median would be considered a linear park.
         Pocket Park or Mini Park                                                Avenue of Flags Median
         A pocket park is a small facility designed to serve a limited population or group (such as
         seniors or small children) within about a one-quarter mile radius. Such parks are
         typically between 0.25 to 2 acres in size, and provide limited amenities that may include
         play equipment, seating, picnic areas and landscaping. There are currently no pocket
         parks in Buellton.
         Neighborhood Park
         Neighborhood parks serve primarily one
         neighborhood and provide active and passive
         facilities for all age groups. Such parks may range
         in size of 2 to 15 acres and provide open turf areas,
         picnic areas, play equipment, multi-use game
         courts, drinking fountains, restrooms, parking and
         landscaping. Neighborhood parks serve an area
         within one-quarter to one-half mile of the site. Oak
         Park would be considered a neighborhood park.
                                                                   Oak Park
         Community Park
         A community park serves multiple neighborhoods or an entire community. These parks
         are usually developed on large sites (15 to 30 acres) and provide a wide range of facilities
         and activities such as larger play areas for children, picnic areas, play fields and courts
         (tennis, basketball, baseball, etc.), and open turf areas, as well as parking, lighting,

          Regional Park
          Regional parks serve multiple communities and provide larger facilities and amenities non
          sites ranging in size from 100 to 200 acres. Regional parks may provide large open areas,
          group picnic facilities, trails, campgrounds, sports fields, a golf course, courts for tennis
          and volleyball, and other amenities such as parking, landscaping and restrooms. The
          communities served by a regional park should be within one hour driving distance, and
          may be subject to user fees. Buellton does not currently have a regional park.
Trails and Bikeways
Trails provide an accessible place to walk, jog, or ride a bicycle in a location that is free of the
safety concerns, noise, and air contaminants associated with roadways. Trails may also help
reinforce Buellton’s rural character by providing places from which to view the surrounding
hills and valleys. Trails also reduce dependence on motor vehicles for access within the
community.
Currently, no trails are located within the City. Informal trails have been established in open
space areas, such as along the Santa Ynez River and portions of Zaca Creek. Trails are planned
along the Santa Ynez River and around the periphery of the City that connect to Jonata School
and other open space areas. In addition, Santa Barbara County has adopted a plan for a
regional trail system to connect Santa Ynez Valley communities with regional parks and
recreation facilities, as well as the Los Padres National Forest.
It should be noted that Land Use Element Policy L-37 encourages “a redesignation of land use
for the 24-acre parcel located east of Industrial Way and south and east of Zaca Creek (south
half of APN 099-690-32) to commercial recreational use subject to the following: (i) the
redesignation must be accompanied with, and be tied to, a specific Development Plan for the
site; (ii) issues of access and integration with adjacent parcels must be addressed and resolved
to the City's satisfaction; (iii) resource values and environmental impacts must be evaluated and
appropriately mitigated; and (iv) provision must be made for future development of a linear
park along the Santa Ynez River, in fee or by easement. The land use redesignation will not
occur until all policy parameters are satisfied.”
          Bikeways
          The Parks and Recreation Commission
          recommended approval of an update to the
          Parks and Recreation Master Plan, which
          incorporates a bikeway plan in 2006. This plan
          illustrates a number of proposed bike trails
          including the “Buellton Loop Trail” which
          would run along State Route 246 and link
          Second Street, Central Avenue, McMurray Road,
          and Freear Drive. The McMurray Road section
          has been constructed. The City categorizes           State Route 246 Bikeway
          bikeways into the following distinct classes:
                                                                                            City of Buellton

Parks and Recreation Master Plan
The Buellton Parks and Recreation Master Plan, which was adopted in 1995, provides goals,
policies and programs for the acquisition and development of parks and recreation facilities
through General Plan buildout. The Parks and Recreation Commission recommended approval
of an update to the Parks and Recreation Master Plan in 2006. The purpose of the Master Plan is
to provide new parkland in the Buellton area, including neighborhood and community parks,
maximize the use of existing facilities through joint use agreements with public and private
agencies, consider providing neighborhood and community recreation, sustain the
community’s involvement in park and recreation projects and activities, and provide adequate
funding for a viable park and recreation system. The Master Plan also discusses programs and
facilities that may be provided in conjunction with other communities in the Santa Ynez Valley.

Public Facilities and Services Elemen

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Public Facilities and Services Element
                        Public Facilities and Services Element
Introduction
Government Code Section 65302(b) requires the general plan to contain a description of the
general location and extent of existing and proposed “local public utilities and facilities, all
correlated with the land use element of the plan.” Although these issues are frequently included
in a circulation element, this 2025 General Plan treats them separately in this Public Facilities
and Services Element.
Summary of Services
Some public services and facilities in the City, such as parks and recreation, water supply,
wastewater treatment, and storm water drainage, are provided directly by the City. Other
public services in the City are provided on a contract basis with other jurisdictions, such as the
City of Buellton Police Department, which is provided by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s
Department, and fire protection services, which are contracted from the Santa Barbara County
Fire Department.
Water Supply
The City of Buellton Public Works Department provides water to a population of 4,213
customers through 1402 active service connections (Albrecht; September 2005). The City is the
sole provider of water service within the city limits; there is only one residence that receives
domestic water from a private well rather than the City. The City does not provide water
service for agricultural uses, and there are some private agricultural wells within the city
boundaries.
Water furnished by the City is supplied from the Buellton Uplands Groundwater Basin, the
Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin, and State Water Project. The filtered water is pumped to three
reservoirs located in the hills northwest of the City. The three reservoirs have capacities of
100,000 gallons, 300,000 gallons, and 850,000 gallons, with an overall storage capacity of 1.25
million gallons. The City has the supply necessary to deliver 2,300 acre-feet of water annually
compared to 1,146 acre-feet delivered in 2003 (Albrecht; September 2005). The City had an
average delivery of approximately 1,150 acre-feet over the last five years. Figure PF-1 shows the
water facility features within the City
California Senate Bill (SB) 1087 (California Government Code 65589.7), adopted in October 2005,
requires that public agencies adopt written policies and procedures with specific objective
standards for provision of water and sewer services such that provider of water or sewer
services may not deny or condition the approval of an application for services, or reduce the
amount of the services applied for, if the proposed development includes housing affordable to
lower income households, except upon making specified findings. Refer to Public Facilities and
Services Element Program 4-5.

Since 1993, the City has implemented the following improvements to the water system:
     •   With the availability of State Water, the City constructed a new turnout to take the
         supply from the Central Coast Water Authority pipeline.
     •   The City added enhancements to the booster pump station on McMurray Road. The
         project created a better supply for the high pressure zone and supports the water level in
         Reservoir #3.
         System Deficiencies and Planned Improvements
         According to the City of Buellton Public Works Department, the entire water system was
         recently modeled using currently available water system software. While certain areas of
         the system are now about 50 years old, the majority of the pipe network is relatively
         young. Fire flows are adequate and, other than routine maintenance, the system does
         not need any foreseeable upgrades.
Wastewater Treatment
The City of Buellton operates a wastewater treatment plant that serves the City. The City of
Buellton Public Works Department maintains the sewage delivery and treatment facilities for
about 1,525 connections and collects, treats, and disposes an average of 400,000 gallons of
wastewater per day (Albrecht, December 2006). The overall capacity of the City’s existing
wastewater treatment facility is 650,000 gallons per day (gpd) (Albrecht; December 2006). The
City maintains one lift station and approximately 20 miles of collection sewers. All of the water
is treated to secondary treatment levels and discharged to percolation basins located on the
westerly side of the facility. Figure PF-2 shows the collection system and wastewater treatment
facilitates within the City.
The wastewater treatment plant currently meets or exceeds all permit requirements. The City
conducts routine flushing of the collection system every two years and preventative
maintenance on a regular basis for older portions of the system. Identified trouble spots are
then scheduled for repair. At this time, the City has only a few minor industrial discharges and
does maintain a set of requirements for pretreatment for these facilities (City of Buellton, Storm
Water Management Program, October 24, 2003).
Since 1993, the City has implemented the following improvements to the wastewater system:
     •   An additional aerator was placed in the Flow Equalization Basin to improve the level of
         oxygen available for the influent BOD.
     •   An additional clarifier has also been implemented. The new clarifier increased available
         detention times and provided for operational flexibility.
         System Deficiencies and Planned Improvements
         According to the City of Buellton Public Works Department, the wastewater collection
         system has been modeled using SewerCAD networking software. However, the City
         will replace or rehabilitate some of the old brick manholes in the system, as needed.

         Over time, the BOD levels in the typical sewage flowing into the plant have risen. This
         can be attributed to additional restaurants and food processing businesses as well as
         changes in the residential flow characteristics in the City. The City has recently enacted
         a new industrial discharge ordinance that restricts levels of contaminants in the sewage
         to manageable levels. A permit system was adopted and is being implemented to
         regulate the businesses that produce sewage with undesirable characteristics. It is
         anticipated that another aeration tank may be added or that the aeration stage of the
         treatment process will be otherwise improved.
         The City will be conducting further evaluation of the wastewater treatment plant and
         each treatment process to determine specific immediate and future needs. In addition,
         the wastewater treatment plant is anticipated to require additional future improvements
         to meet tertiary treatment permitting standards from the Regional Water Quality
         Control Board (RWQCB). Such improvements could potentially necessitate the
         acquisition of land for future treatment facilities adjacent to the existing facilities. These
         improvements would create an additional water source of reclaimed water for the City.
         In addition, tertiary treatment improvements would reduce reliance on imported State
         Water and existing groundwater wells, and would allow for direct discharge of treated
         water to the Santa Ynez River.
Storm Drainage
The City of Buellton has developed a Storm Water Management Program (SWMP) prepared in
response to State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Draft Order for National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II. The goal of the SWMP is to protect
the health of the recreational areas and the natural environment, meet Clean Water Act
mandates through compliance with Phase II NPDES Permit requirements and applicable
regulations, and encourage public involvement and awareness.
Under state planning law and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City is
responsible for evaluating new development and redevelopment projects and, therefore, has a
key role in implementing the NPDES Phase II construction runoff control measures. As part of
the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District, the approved projects in the City of Buellton,
must meet guidelines regarding flood control as detailed in the Standard Conditions of Project
Plan Approval.
Although none of the streams in the City have been identified as “impaired,” Zaca Creek and
Thumbelina Creek flow into the Santa Ynez River, which is listed as “impaired” by the State of
California for nutrients, salinity (TDS, chlorides) and sedimentation /siltation. The City’s storm
water quality program has been derived from ongoing City activities and the County of Santa
Barbara’s non-point source control program (Project Clean Water, “PCW”) (City of Buellton,
Storm Water Management Program, October 24, 2003).
Storm drains typically flow into creeks that have already passed through a variety of land uses,
including natural, agricultural, urban and industrial, and often through more than one permit
jurisdiction. The City is faced with the challenge of requiring and implementing controls to
reduce the discharge of pollutants in storm water runoff to the technology-based standard of
                                                                                         City of Buellton

The City of Buellton is in the
process of developing a
Master Drainage Plan. This
plan may be an opportunity
to include new development
strategies to protect water
quality. The City currently
has an atlas of its
underground storm drains
that shows major pipes and
outfall locations of the City’s
storm drain system;                Storm Drain and Swale
however, additional
research is necessary to
confirm the completeness of the storm drain system map, in particular storm drain inlet
locations, particularly in most recently developed areas (City of Buellton, Storm Water
Management Program, October 24, 2003).
Currently, the storm drain system, including pipelines, catch-basins, and drop inlets, is cleaned
as needed to maintain capacity. Minor maintenance is conducted by hand, prior to the rain
season each year, to remove fallen leaves and other debris collected in the system. Overall, the
storm drain system operates without blockages and therefore maintenance is on an as-needed
basis (City of Buellton, Storm Water Management Program, October 24, 2003).
The City has an agreement with the Santa Barbara County Flood Control District (SBCFCD) to
provide ongoing support when reviewing proposed development projects. SBCFCD also
maintains two detention basins located north of La Pita Place that intercept runoff from the
farming operation on the mesa above the City. In addition, SBCFCD provides for maintenance
and emergency support in Zaca Creek and Santa Ynez River watersheds.
Since 1993, the City has implemented the following improvements to the drainage system:
     •   An additional pipe was installed along Second Street, east of Avenue of Flags.
     •   New piping was extended up Second Street from Avenue of Flags to Central Avenue.
     •   Individual catch basins throughout the City were modified as needed to improve flow.
     •   With the developments on the west end of the City an entire network of drainage piping
         was installed to manage storm flows in that area.
     •   Caltrans replaced the box culvert that crosses Highway 246 at Thumbelina Creek and
         the City installed new piping along the highway to allow for widening of the road.
                                                                                    City of Buellton

     •   A detention basin and piping system were installed at the east end of the City with the
         residential tract that was developed along Ballard Canyon Road.
         System Deficiencies and Planned Improvements
         With the upcoming Drainage Master Plan, any drainage system deficiencies will be
         identified. One location that is known to need additional capacity is the intersection of
         Avenue of Flags with Second Street. Previous projects set up the system to be improved,
         however the portion of the system across Avenue of Flags was postponed until the
         master planning of the Avenue of Flags streetscape could be completed. Other system
         upgrades to improve the quality of the runoff discharged will be identified in the
         upcoming master plan study.
Solid Waste Disposal
Weekly garbage collection and disposal for the City is currently provided by Health Sanitation
Services of Santa Maria, a division of Waste Management. Recyclable materials (including
aluminum, cardboard, rigid plastics, household glass, tin, newspaper, used latex paints, motor
oil, used batteries, and used oil filters) collection services are also provided by Health Sanitation
Services. Commercial and residential waste from the City of Buellton is initially taken to the
Santa Ynez Valley Recycling and Transfer Station. The transfer station is a County operated
facility located on 4004 Foxen Canyon Road in Los Olivos, California and has a permitted
maximum daily tonnage of 212 tons per day. Unrecyclable solid waste from the City of
Buellton is transferred to the Tajiguas Sanitary Landfill, located in unincorporated Santa
Barbara County, approximately 15 miles south of the City of Buellton. The Tajiguas landfill is a
Class III facility owned and operated by the County of Santa Barbara Public Works Department.
The landfill is approximately 357 acres with 118 acres of disposal area.
The landfill has a permitted design capacity of 23,300,000 cubic yards, with a remaining
capacity of 8,462,335 cubic yards, as of May 1, 2005. An average of approximately 720 tons of
waste is landfilled daily, with a permitted maximum daily tonnage of 1,500 tons per day. The
facility is estimated to close on January 1, 2020 (California Integrated Waste Management
Board, SWIS Database, July 27, 2006). During the fiscal year 2005-06 (July 1, 2005 to June 30,
2006), approximately 236,152 tons of waste was disposed of at the landfill (Colleen Hankins,
Accounting, County of Santa Barbara Public Works Department, August 2006).
The California Integrated Waste Management Board and the City of Buellton indicate that
average waste generation in the region is 15.32 pounds per person per day. Approximately 28%
of waste is generated from residential uses and 72% of waste is generated from
commercial/industrial uses. The City’s base year waste diversion rate is 44%.
While the demographics of the City have remained relatively stable, the growth of the wine and
hotel industries has substantially increased the amount of waste material generated by the City.
With approximately 4,200residents and 72% of waste generated by the non-residential sector,
the waste created by out-of-town guests at the nearly 800 hotel rooms and 5 winery crushing
facilities in the City increases the pounds per day average waste generation. With a

business to divert waste through composting (wineries) and recycling (hotels) .
The City has recently adopted a Construction and Demolition Materials Recycling Ordinance
that requires the diversion or recycling of at least 50% of construction debris.
Police Services
The City is presently served by the City of Buellton Police Department, which is provided by
the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department. The Buellton police substation is located at 140
West Highway 246. The City contracts with the County to have a deputy on duty at all times.
Backup support is available on a regular basis from other sheriff deputies that patrol the
County. The Buellton Police Department staffs (1) Lieutenant, (1) Deputy (per 12 hour shift), (1)
Community Resource Deputy, and (1) Detective (approximately 13 hours/week each). The City
of Buellton Police Department maintains a minimum standard of one officer for approximately
every 1,200 residents. In addition to traffic enforcement, approximately 3,827 calls were taken
last year. The most common calls involve drugs, burglaries, and domestic problems. Via the

School Services
Elementary and Middle Schools
The Buellton Union School District (BUSD) serves grades K-8, and is the only public school
system that serves the City. Jonata Middle School provides public education for sixth through
eighth grade students from a large geographic area, accepting inter-district students from Los
Olivos, Solvang, Lompoc, and Gaviota. The BUSD also includes Oak Valley Elementary School,
located near Jonata Middle School on Second Street in the City of Buellton, which serves grades
K-5 (Tom Cooper, Superintendent, BUSD, Oral Communications, February 8, 2006). The
locations of BUSD elementary school facilities are shown in Table PF-1. The facilities and
enrollments within the district are described below.

  Oak Valley Elementary School
Elementary School Expansion
In March 2006, the BUSD completed a Phase 2 expansion of Oak Valley Elementary School to
relieve enrollment pressure on the Elementary School. The expansion included the construction
of ten additional classrooms at the existing Oak Valley Elementary School site and increased
capacity from 240 to 500 students.
Santa Ynez Valley Union High School
BUSD does not contain a high school. Santa Ynez Valley High School in the Santa Ynez Valley
Union High School District serves the City of Buellton and is located six miles east of the city.
Current enrollment at Santa Ynez Valley High School is 1,211 students. The school is over
capacity, however the size of the facility provides room for portable classrooms as needed to
accommodate additional students.
The County Education Office operates a school for developmentally-challenged students at the
Zaca Center in Rancho de Maria on Six Flags Circle.
Current Enrollment
Student enrollment in the BUSD, which includes Jonata and Oak Valley Elementary schools,
and enrollment at Santa Ynez High School, is reported to the State Department of Education
each fall. The following 2005-06 student enrollment data is cited from the annual California
Department of Educational Demographics Unit :
                  K-5      Enrollment = 417 students
                  6-8      Enrollment = 245 students
                  9-12 Enrollment = 1,171 students
                  Total Enrollment = 1,833 students

Facilities Funding
Revenue for facilities construction comes from both state and local sources, including developer
fees. Some local funding alternatives include community approval of a general obligation bond
for school construction. The General Obligation (GEO) Bond election process requires two-
thirds voter approval. From 1986 to June 2000, only 55% of the school districts that held GEO
Bond elections successfully earned the two-thirds voter approval for school facility funding.
Measure U, passed in March 2004, has created a $6.5 million GEO bond and has made the
District eligible for $3.7 million in State grants. The funding provided for the construction of ten
additional classrooms at Oak Valley Elementary School, completed March 2006. In addition,
some of the funding will be used to remodel or “modernize” portions of Jonata Middle School
(Cooper, February 8, 2006).
The BUSD participates in school construction programs, whereby new development contributes
a portion of the cost of new facilities, while the remainder is supplied by state and local resident
taxes. A statutory fee that also contributes to funding facilities is the Stirling fee. This fee,
currently $1.93 per square foot, is based on the amount of building construction proposed and is
adjusted annually.
Private Schools
There are several private schools in the area. The private schools include four pre-schools, two
private elementary schools (Midland and the Family School), and two private high schools
(Dunn Boarding School and the Santa Ynez Valley Christian Academy). Dunn also teaches local
middle school students. The Santa Ynez Valley Christian Academy instructs students from
kindergarten through eighth grade. Day care/pre-school services are provided by Bethania
Child Care, Head Start, Homebase, the YMCA, Santa Ynez Valley Presbyterian School, and
Family School.

Safety Element
                                       Safety Element
Introduction
The purpose of the Safety Element is to reduce deaths, injuries, property damage, and economic
and social dislocation resulting from natural hazards including flooding, mud slides and soil
creep, tsunamis and seiches, land subsidence, earthquakes, avalanches, other geologic
phenomena, levee or dam failure, certain types of urban and wildland fires, and building
collapse. It is the primary vehicle for identifying the hazards that municipalities must consider
when making land use decisions.
Natural Hazards
Buellton is located on an alluvial terrace of the Santa Ynez River making it susceptible to
flooding; and, as with most communities in California, it is subject to seismic activity.
Flood Hazards
Buellton is located on an alluvial terrace of the Santa Ynez River making it susceptible to
flooding. Zaca Creek, Thumbelina Creek and Petersen Creek all flow through Buellton to the
Santa Ynez River which borders the City to the south. The Santa Ynez River, Zaca Creek, and
Thumbelina Creek all produce flooding during a 100-year storm (a storm with a statistical
probability of occurring once during a 100-year period). The City of Buellton sustained flood
damage in February 1993 and February 1998 following heavy rainstorms.
A Local Emergency was declared on February 5, 1998, following substantial storm flooding.
Following the 1998 storm, Buellton had significant flooding on La Pita Place, Irelan Drive and
Second Street due to an overflowing flood control basin in the area. Thumbelina Creek
overflowed its banks onto Kendale Road and there was substantial foothill flooding on Via
Corona Drive and Calor Drive with two feet of mud in this residential area.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM;
September 30, 2005) indicate there is substantial flooding potential from the Santa Ynez River
and Zaca Creek, and to a lesser extent from Thumbelina Creek. The extent of potential flooding
as established by FEMA for the downtown area is so widespread that no specific floodway has
been determined for that area. The primary flooding problem in the central portion of the City
is from Zaca Creek. During a 100-year storm, the creek overflows its channel and floodwaters
flow down Highway 101 and through the Avenue of Flags/Highway 246 area. The culverts
under Highway 101 and Highway 246 through the Avenue of Flags and Pea Soup Andersen
property are currently restricted in handling the 100-year flow. Figure S-1 shows the FEMA
mapped flood hazard areas.
Dam Inundation
Buellton could also be affected by flooding as a result of a failure of the Bradbury Dam (Lake
Cachuma) located about twelve miles to the east. If the dam were to fail, the inundated area
                                                                                      City of Buellton

Safety Element
would extend over a large portion of the City. Areas of Buellton that could be affected would be
the Thumbelina neighborhood, and the areas south of Highway 246 (refer to Figure S-2).
Seismic and Geological Hazards
Two potentially active faults that could cause groundshaking in Buellton are the San Andreas,
located about 50 miles to the northwest, and the Santa Ynez Fault, located about six miles to the
south. The San Andreas would generate a very large earthquake which would cause some
groundshaking in Buellton. However, the damage resulting from such an earthquake is not
expected to be severe. The likelihood of an earthquake on the Santa Ynez Fault is low by
comparison. The Santa Ynez Fault is active, but its history is relatively unknown. Some
estimates place the likelihood of a major earthquake on this fault at once in several hundred
years to perhaps a thousand years.
The largest upper level earthquake (ULE) in Buellton would be an approximate 7.8 magnitude
earthquake on the San Andreas Fault. Such an event could produce peak horizontal ground
acceleration on the order of 0.16g1.
Due to the relative location of the Los Alamos-Baseline (approximately 8 kilometers south),
Santa Ynez (approximately 9 kilometers northeast), and North Channel Slope (approximately 24
kilometers east) faults, higher ULE accelerations may be expected from these faults. Although
higher accelerations may be experienced on the site from these faults, compared to events on
the San Andreas Fault, the recurrence interval for such events is much longer than for an event
on the active San Andreas Fault Zone.
The nearest fault, the Santa Ynez Fault, is located approximately six miles south of the City
limits. The west segment of this fault has left lateral strike-slip motion. This fault is considered
active but its earthquake history is relatively unknown, although displacement along the Santa
Ynez Fault occurred in Holocene time (within the last 11,000 years). Offset relationships along
the South Branch of the Santa Ynez Fault suggest the recurrence of movements adequate to
generate a major earthquake (Richter magnitude +/-7) is once in several hundred years to,
perhaps, a thousand years. Therefore, while groundshaking would probably be severe during a
major earthquake on this fault, the likelihood of occurrence is low in comparison to potential
major earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault which is considered likely within the next 30
years. Figure S-3 shows the regional faults in the area.
           Groundshaking
           The most serious direct earthquake hazard is the damage or collapse of buildings caused
           by groundshaking, which, in addition to property damage, can cause injury or death.
           Groundshaking is the vibration that radiates from the epicenter of an earthquake. The
           severity of groundshaking and its potential to cause damage to buildings is determined
           by several factors, including: the nature of the underlying soil and geology, the location
1 The force on a building during an earthquake is proportional to ground acceleration. Such forces are prescribed by the UBC.
During an earthquake the ground acceleration varies with time. "g" is a common value of acceleration equal to 9.8 m/sec/sec (the
acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth). 30% of g is the acceleration one would experience in a car that takes 9 seconds
to brake from 60 miles per hour to a complete stop.

         of the epicenter of the earthquake, the duration and character of the ground motion, the
         structural characteristics of a building, and the quality of workmanship and materials
         used in buildings.
         Groundshaking is the primary seismic concern for Buellton. Portions of Buellton,
         especially those areas within or immediately adjacent to the Santa Ynez River
         floodplains, are located on alluvial deposits, which can increase the potential for
         groundshaking damage. As earthquake waves pass from more dense rock to less dense
         alluvial material, they tend to reduce velocity, but increase in amplitude. Ground
         motion lasts longer on loose, water-saturated materials than on solid rock. As a result,
         structures located on these types of materials may suffer greater damage. “Poor
         ground” can be a greater hazard for structures than close proximity to the fault or the
         earthquake’s epicenter.
         In a strong earthquake, any type of structure may experience some level of damage
         resulting from ground shaking. Certain types of construction materials generally
         perform better in earthquakes than others, and almost any material can be designed in
         such a manner so as to be safe during an earthquake. For example, modern structures
         made with wooden and steel frames, or reinforced concrete blocks, will typically
         withstand moderate to strong earthquake ground shaking with little threat of building
         failure or major damage. Buildings made of unreinforced masonry, however, typically
         provide little earthquake resistance. The City of Buellton does not contain any
         unreinforced masonry buildings (Seismic Safety Commission, “Status of the
         Unreinforced Masonry Building Law”, June 9, 2005). Many of Buellton’s buildings are
         one or two stories high, and of wood frame construction, which is considered relatively
         resistant to earthquake damage.
         Ground Failure
         In addition to structural damage caused by groundshaking, there are other ground
         effects caused by such shaking. These ground failure effects include liquefaction,
         subsidence, lurch cracking, and lateral spreading. The potential for these hazards to
         occur in Buellton is discussed below. No areas of abnormally high risk due to secondary
         seismic/geologic hazards have been identified within the City.
         Liquefaction
         Liquefaction in soils and sediments can occur during earthquake events, when material
         is temporarily transformed from a solid to a liquid (gelatinous) by increases in pressure.
         Earthquake-induced liquefaction most often occurs in low-lying areas with soils
         composed of unconsolidated, saturated, clay-free sands and silts, but can also occur in
         dry, granular soils or saturated soils with some clay content. Liquefaction also occurs in
         areas overlain by unconsolidated fill, particularly artificial fill.
         Liquefaction during a major earthquake could occur in Buellton. Liquefaction occurs
         during an earthquake when groundwater migrates upward into sandy soils, which then
         become liquefied and lose their cohesiveness and their ability to support structures. The
                                                                                      City of Buellton

City of Buellton General Plan 2025
Safety Element
         potential for liquefaction is highest in areas with sandy, alluvial soil and shallow
         groundwater, such as areas of the City nearest the Santa Ynez River and Zaca Creek.
         The terrace deposits on which the major portion of the City is located can be considered
         as having a low to moderate liquefaction potential in the presence of shallow
         groundwater (less than 30 feet). Consolidated rock areas of the City are characterized by
         low to non-existent liquefaction potential. Liquefaction hazards can be avoided with
         proper foundation engineering based on an analysis of the soils on a given building site.
         Subsidence
         Subsidence is the compaction of soils and alluvium caused by groundshaking. It occurs
         irregularly and is largely a function of the underlying soils. Depending on the event, the
         amount of compaction can vary from a few inches to several feet. In Buellton, the
         potential for subsidence is greatest in areas underlain by alluvium or other soft water-
         saturated soils. However, no substantial subsidence problems have been identified in
         the City.
         Lurch Cracking and Lateral Spreading
         Lurch cracking refers to fractures, cracks and fissures produced by groundshaking, and
         may occur far from an earthquake’s epicenter. Lateral spreading is the horizontal
         movement of soil toward an open face of a stream bank or the side of a levee. Steep-
         sided artificial fill embankments are most susceptible to damage. The potential for these
         hazards is greatest on steep-sided alluvial soils where the groundwater table is high. In
         the City, this would include areas adjacent to the Santa Ynez River.
         Landslides
         Geologic, topographic, and climatic factors generally determine the occurrence of
         landslides. Landslides can be traced to the nature of the parent rock and the natural
         processes affecting it. Landslides can occur in formations with the following structural
         characteristics: brecciated rock (sedimentary rocks that are made up of largely angular
         fragments) in fault zones; weak bedding or bed joints and cleavage plains; massive beds
         overlying weak materials and alterations; and permeable beds, such as sandstones.
         Erosion is a composite of all processes by which earth or rock materials are loosened or
         dissolved and moved from place to place. Natural erosion activity depends on the
         steepness of slopes, amount and intensity of rainfall and soil types. Only about 30% of
         all erosion is due to natural causes. The remaining 70% is the result of human activity.
         Erosion prevention measures are covered in grading plans and include recommended
         slope drainage provisions, slope protection and planting. Slopes along the bank of the
         Santa Ynez River pose a threat of landslide hazard if structures are built to close to the
         edge. The City of Buellton currently requires all development to be at least 200 feet from
         the bank of the Santa Ynez River. Other slopes in the City are geologically stable and are
         not subject to major landslides.

         Erosion
         Soil erosion can be caused by natural occurrences such as wildfires, landslides, and
         stormwater runoff. In addition, vegetation removal, grading for construction, improper
         agricultural or grazing practices, and off-road vehicle traffic area major sources of
         erosion. Soils in Buellton are classified as having slight to high susceptibility to erosion
         (Natural Resource Conservation Service, Soil Survey of Northern Santa Barbara Area,
         California, July 1972). In the low-lying areas surrounding the Santa Ynez River,
         erodability is attributed to river scouring and potential flooding. In the steeper upland
         areas of the City, soils are subject to erosion from wind, rain, grazing, and human
         disturbance or soil and vegetation. The effects of erosion range from nuisance
         problems, such as increased siltation in storm drains, to extreme cases where
         watercourses are downcut and gullies develop that can eventually undermine adjacent
         structures or vegetation.
         Soils with high shrink-swell potential, rapid runoff rates, and high erosion hazard are
         generally located in the hills to the northeast of Buellton while those with those with
         rapid permeability are located in lower lying areas in the center of Buellton and
         associated with drainage features near the eastern edge of the City (refer to Figure
         C/OS-2 [Soils Map] in the Conservation and Open Space Element).
Wildland and Urban Fire Hazards
The City of Buellton faces two types of fire hazards that threaten lives and property: urban and
wildland fires. Wildland fires may also result in the loss of natural vegetation, loss of
agricultural crops, and soil erosion. The threat posed by each type of fire hazard is described
below.
         Wildland Fires
         The outbreak and spread of wildland fires outside the City is a potential danger,
         particularly during the dry summer and fall months. The buildup of understory brush,
         which under natural conditions would be periodically burned off, provides fuel to result
         in larger more intensive fires.
         Various factors contribute to the intensity and spread of wildland fires: humidity, wind
         speed and direction, vegetation type, the amount of vegetation (fuel), and topography.
         Most wildland fires are the result of arson or simple carelessness.
         The topography, climate, and vegetation outside of the City are conducive to the spread
         of wildland fires. It contains grasslands and oak woodlands in rolling terrain. The area
         is subject to hot, dry summers. Figure S-4 shows the high fire hazard areas around the
         City.

         Urban Fires
         Urban fires are primarily those associated with structures and the activities in and
         around them. Most urban fires are caused by human activity. Over the years,
         development standards have become more stringent to reduce the frequency and
         severity of such events. Building codes now require fire walls for adjacent structures.
         Local ordinances often prohibit the use of fire-prone materials, such as shake-shingle
         roofs. Electrical standards have also changed to reduce fire risk inside structures.
         Smoke detectors are now commonly required.
         Urban fire hazards are greatest in areas containing older buildings that do not meet
         current building codes. Buellton contains many such structures, even though the City
         requires that such buildings be brought up to code when made aware of such buildings.
         Utility facilities also present a potential urban fire hazard. Earthquakes or floods may
         rupture buried gas lines, while high winds or accidents could cause overhead electric
         lines to break. Either condition could result in a fire. Catastrophic earthquakes could
         cause widespread urban fires, as multiple gas and electrical lines could be broken or
         disrupted.
         Once an urban fire starts, fast emergency response is critical to ensure that the fire does
         not spread. Urban fires by their nature occur in areas with a high density of human
         occupation and property. The threat to life and property is high. While Buellton has
         had urban fires, most have been relatively small and easily contained. No catastrophic
         fires have been recorded in recent history, particularly since emergency response and
         building codes have been improved.
Hazardous Materials and Risk of Upset
Hazardous materials are defined as those that are a potential threat to human health, having the
capacity to cause serious illness or death. This section discusses the types of hazardous
materials typically found in the City.
         Household Products
         By far the most common hazardous materials are those found or used in the home.
         Waste oil is a common hazardous material that is often improperly disposed of and can
         contaminate surface water through runoff. Other household hazardous wastes (used
         paint, pesticides, cleaning products and other chemicals) are common and often
         improperly stored in garages and homes throughout the community. Because of their
         prevalence and proximity to residents, household products constitute the most
         pervasive health hazard facing residents of the community. The City participates in a
         semi-annual Household Hazardous Waste and Electronics Collection and Recycling
         Day, when such materials are accepted free of charge at the Santa Ynez Valley Recycling
         and Transfer Station, located at 4004 Foxen Canyon Road in Los Olivos.

Safety Element
         Asbestos
         Asbestos is a highly crumbly material often found in older buildings, typically used as
         insulation in walls or ceilings. It was formerly popular as an insulating material because
         it had the desirable characteristic of being fire resistant. However, it can pose a health
         risk when very small particles become airborne. These dust-like particles can be easily
         inhaled, where their microscopically sharp structures can puncture tiny air sacs in the
         lungs, resulting in long-term health problems.
         Buellton contains many older structures with the potential to contain asbestos. Pre-1979
         construction often included asbestos and it should be assumed that the demolition of
         older structures in the City might present this hazard. Proper asbestos abatement and
         disposal procedures are required to be undertaken whenever the demolition of older
         structures is considered.
         The Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) has identified
         serpentine rock as a source of naturally-occurring asbestos. Asbestos is a known
         carcinogen and inhalation of asbestos may result in the development of lung cancer or
         mesothelioma. Serpentine rock is not known to occur in the City of Buellton (Dibblee,
         1988).
         Lead-Based Paint (LBP)
         Prior to the enactment of federal regulations limiting their use in the late 1970s, LBP was
         often used in residential construction. Lead is a highly toxic metal that was used for
         many years in products found in and around homes. Lead may cause a range of health
         effects, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities, to seizures and death. The
         primary source of lead exposure in residences is deteriorating LBP. Lead dust can form
         when LBP is dry scraped, dry sanded, or heated. Dust also forms when painted surfaces
         bump or rub together. Lead-based paint that is in good condition is usually not a
         hazard.
         Aerially-Deposited Lead (ADL)
         ADL is lead deposited by vehicle emissions of leaded gasoline on roadways with
         historically high volumes of traffic (i.e., before 1975), within unpaved areas or formerly
         unpaved areas. Aerially deposited lead is typically found within the top 0.6-m of
         material in unpaved areas within the highway right of way. Lead may cause a range of
         health effects, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities, to seizures and death.
         ADL could potentially occur along Highway 101.
Hazardous Waste Management Plan
Counties are required by state law to prepare hazardous waste management plans. Santa
Barbara County’s Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP), which was incorporated into
the County’s Comprehensive Plan as the Hazardous Waste Element, addresses the treatment,
storage, and disposal of such materials. Review of the HWMP indicates that in 1986, 6118.32
                                                                                        City of Buellton

tons of hazardous wastes were generated in the County. Nearly all of this was transported
outside of the County for treatment or disposal since the County’s one permitted hazardous
waste treatment, storage or disposal facility, the cold Canyon Landfill, accepts only asbestos-
containing hazardous waste. The 1990 HWMP projected that up to 10,910 tons of hazardous
waste could be generated in the County by the year 2000.
Hazardous Materials Releases
The City currently contains six leaking underground storage tank (LUST) sites, five sites
identified on the Cortese list of hazardous releases, and one site identified on the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRIS) database (Environmental Data
Resources, Inc, 2006). The majority of these sites are commercial uses located along Highway
246. These sites could potentially contain contaminants associated with undocumented on- or
off-site hazardous materials releases in soil and/or groundwater. Improper handling and
disposal of contaminated soils or groundwater would result in a health risk to people.
Highway Accidents
Highway 101 and Highway 246 are major transportation routes that pass through the City.
Trucks commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including gasoline and various crude
oil derivatives, and other chemicals known to cause human health problems. When properly
contained, these materials present no hazard to the community. But in the event of an accident,
such materials may be released, either in liquid or gas form. In the case of some chemicals (such
as chlorine), highly toxic fumes may be carried far from the accident site.
Traffic accidents involving large trucks hauling hazardous materials on the highways passing
through the City of Buellton could result in a public safety hazard. In addition to traffic related
incidents, hazardous materials spills could be caused by ground shaking associated with a large
earthquake or other soil related hazards. Hazardous material containers not properly secured
could be tipped over and/or ruptured. Improperly segregated materials could result in toxic or
explosive reactions. Although standard accident and hazardous materials recovery procedures
are enforced by the state and followed by private transportation companies, the City of Buellton
is at relatively high risk because of its location along highway corridors.
Radon Hazards
Radon is an extremely toxic, colorless gas that can be condensed to a transparent liquid or an
opaque, glowing solid. Radon is derived from the radioactive decay of radium and is a
naturally occurring gas produced by the breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water.
Sources of radon include earth and rock beneath homes, well water, and building materials.
Accumulations of this gas inside structures can become a serious health hazard.
The U.S. EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey have evaluated the radon potential in the U.S. and
have developed a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources
and to assist building code officials in deciding whether radon-resistant features are applicable
in new construction. The map assigns each of the counties in the U.S. to one of three zones
based on radon potential. Each zone designation reflects the average short-term radon
                                                                                      City of Buellton

measurement that can be measured in a building without the implementation of radon control
methods. The county of Santa Barbara is designated within Zone 1 which has the highest
potential of radon and is of the highest priority (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).
However, the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology has
conducted research on geology and radon in Santa Barbara County and found that the Buellton
area has low potential for radon levels above 4.0 pCi/L per liter, the standard threshold
recognized by federal and state agencies (California Department of Conservation, December
1997).
Chemical Release Hazards
The City of Buellton’s Water Treatment Facilities, located at the southern terminus of McMurray
Road and at 140 West Highway 246 use both chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the water treatment
system. An Offsite Consequences Analysis (OCA; May 2006) and Prevention Program Manual
(July 2006) were prepared for the water treatment facilities to satisfy the requirements of the
California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) Program. The OCA followed the overall
guidance provided by EPA in the Model RMP for Water Treatment Facilities (EPA, 1999), and
the RMP OCA Guidance (EPA, 1996). The OCA developed a worst case scenario and an
alternative case scenario for chemical releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from the facilities.
The worst case scenario is considered a low frequency event that would involve the total release
of the system contents over a short period of time. The alternative case is a smaller release over
a longer period of time and would be anticipated to occur at a higher frequency.
Distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide
are 0.4 and 0.3 miles, respectively, with the potential to expose a total population of up to 745
people from a release of chlorine at the West Highway 246 water treatment facility and up to
246 people from a release of chlorine at the McMurray Road facility. The alternative case
scenario would expose up to 24 people from a release of chlorine at the West Highway 246
water treatment facility and up to 8 people from a release of chlorine at the McMurray Road
facility. The actual number of people exposed to gas release is a function of the wind direction
and is expected to be less than modeled.
The results of the OCA indicate that the worst case release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide for the
City of Buellton water treatment facilities could extend offsite and into the local community.
However, it is important to emphasize that a worst case release is extremely unlikely to occur,
and it takes no account for safety features inherent in the design and operation of the system
that prevent such releases from happening. The alternative release scenarios are based on more
credible assumptions, but if they were to occur, the affected area would be substantially less
than for the worst case release scenario. However, there are still residential and business
receptors located within the alternative case scenario.
Implementation of the CalARP Prevention Program is an important consideration that helps to
prevent a release or to minimize the impacts of a release that may occur. The Prevention
Program includes risk management measures, operating procedures, training requirements,

This plan is coordinated with the local response agencies.
National Incident Management System
In 1993, California was the first state to adopt a statewide Standardization Emergency
Management System (SEMS) for use by every emergency response organization. More recently,
at the direction of the President, the Department of Homeland Security developed the National
Incident Management System (NIMS) to provide a consistent nationwide approach for federal,
state, local, and tribal governments to work together more effectively and efficiently to prevent,
prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, regardless of the cause, size or complexity.
The California SEMS program meets the objectives of the NIMS program. Therefore, the
Governor of the State of California had directed the Office of Emergency Services and Office of
Homeland Security in cooperation with the Standardized Emergency Management System
Advisory Board to develop a program to integrate the National Incident Management System
unto the state’s emergency management system.
Passage of a local government Resolution related to NIMS integration is one of the requirements
for compliance in Federal Fiscal Year 2006 (FFY 2006).
The City has complied with the requirements of SEMS and in doing so, had submitted and
received approval of its SEMS Multi-Hazard Functional Plan and its Multi-Jurisdictional
Hazard Mitigation Plan. The City adopted Resolution No. 06-25 –“A Resolution of the City
Council of the City of Buellton, California, Integrating the National Incident Management
Systems (NIMS) into the Emergency Management System.” All City employees have taken the
required NIMS courses.

Flood Hazards
S-1      New development (habitable structures including commercial and industrial buildings)
         shall be set back at least 200 feet from the bank of the Santa Ynez River. A lesser setback
         may be allowed if a hydro-geologic study by a qualified professional can certify that a
         lesser setback will provide an adequate margin of safety from erosion and flooding due
         to the composition of the underlying geologic unit, to the satisfaction of the County
         Flood Control District, and a lesser setback will not adversely impact sensitive riparian
         corridors or associated plant and animal habitats, as determined by a qualified biologist,
         or planned trail corridors. Passive use trails may be allowed within setback areas.
S-2      All direct disturbance from new development, including grading and structures shall be
         set back at least 50 feet from the top of bank of creeks, including Zaca Creek and
                                                                                       City of Buellton

         Thumbelina Creek, except where culverted. Passive use trails may be allowed within
         setback areas.
S-3      New development in mapped flood prone areas shall be subject to the requirements of
         the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
S-4      As a condition of approval, continue to require any new development to minimize
         flooding problems identified by the National Flood Insurance Rate Program.
S-5      Recognize the risk of dam inundation and have evacuation plans in place.
Seismic and Geological Hazards
S-7      All new development shall satisfy the requirements of the California Building Code
         regarding seismic safety.
S-8      Restrict development of critical facilities, such as hospitals, fire stations, emergency
         management headquarters, and utility lifelines, including sewage treatment plants, and
         places of large congregations, in areas determined as high risk geologic hazard zones, as
         feasible.
S-9      Geologic studies shall be required as a condition of project approval for new
         development on sites with slopes greater than 10%, and in areas mapped by the Natural
         Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) as having moderate or high risk of liquefaction,
         subsidence and/or expansive soils.
S-10     Require that adequate soils, geologic and structural evaluation reports be prepared by
         registered soils engineers, engineering geologists, and/or structural engineers, as
         appropriate, for all new development proposals for subdivisions or structures for
         human occupancy.
S-11     Maintain and enforce applicable codes and other regulations to minimize the loss of life
         and damage to structures during an earthquake or other geologic disaster.
S-12     New development should minimize erosion hazards by incorporating features into site
         drainage plans that would reduce impermeable surface area, increase surface water
         infiltration, and/or minimize surface water runoff during storm events. Such features
         may include:
                  o   Additional landscape areas,
                  o   Parking lots with bio-infiltration systems,
