3.1      INTRODUCTION
Meeting the housing needs of Arcata residents as well as the City’s share of regional housing needs
remains an important goal for the City of Arcata. As the population of the state continues to grow
and pressure on resources increases, Arcata is concerned with providing adequate housing
opportunities while maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the community.
Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing, the State of California has mandated a
Housing Element within every General Plan since 1969. This Housing Element (2014-2019) was
created in compliance with State General Plan law pertaining to Housing Elements and was
certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) on August
21, 2014.
Purpose. The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
California family is a priority of the highest order.” In addition, the government should assist the
private sector in developing the greatest diversity of housing opportunities feasible for all and
accommodate regional housing needs through cooperative efforts, while maintaining a
responsibility toward economic, environmental and fiscal factors, and community goals as outlined
in the general plan.
Further, State Housing Element law requires “an assessment of housing needs and an inventory of
resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” The law requires:
      an analysis of population and employment trends,
      an analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs,
      an analysis of household characteristics,
      an inventory of land suitable for residential development,
      an analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement,
         maintenance, and development of housing,
      an analysis of special housing needs,
      an analysis of opportunities for energy conservation, and
      an analysis of publicly assisted housing developments that may convert to non-assisted
         housing developments.
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected
housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and schedules promoting the

Arcata General Plan                                                                             Page 3
preservation, improvement, and development of diverse housing types in Arcata that are available
at a range of costs.
3.2      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS (GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY)
State law requires that “the general plan, its elements and parts thereof comprise an integrated,
internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies.” The purpose of requiring internal
consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing within the City. The update to the Housing Element
has been reviewed for consistency with all elements of the Arcata General Plan; and amendments
have been made as necessary to ensure General Plan consistency.
3.3      SUMMARY OF FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
The City’s future housing needs are projected based on demographic trends, housing stock
characteristics, housing market trends, and the availability of appropriately zoned land to
accommodate projected need. The following summarize the detailed analysis of housing needs
included in Appendix A.
     •   Arcata’s population is growing slowly and is trending to peak at less than 20,000 by
         2020. Though modest overall, growth was greatest in the 55-64 age group, which
         doubled since the 2000 census. Young adults in the 15-24 and 25-34 age groups
         comprise the majority of the City’s population (32% and 20%, respectively).
             o On- and off-campus housing is needed. The demographic trends may reflect the
                  student population housed in Arcata, the off-campus population of which is
                  estimated to be 3,600 individuals.
             o Senior Housing is needed to accommodate that growing population.
     •   The majority of households are 1-, 2-, and 3-person households; there are very few
         households comprised of five or more persons (<5% of total population); and average
         household size is 2.09.
             o Though large households represent a small proportion of Arcata’s population,
                  providing opportunities for large-family and student housing is important.
     •   There are 1.7 times fewer family households than non-family households, and a
         majority of non-family households are single member households.
             o Efficiency or Single Room Occupancy housing targets student and other single
                  person households and may meet the needs of lower income persons.
     •   Owner occupancy has dropped to 34% from 36% since 2000. The decline is due to a
         combination of multifamily unit development and conversion of owner occupied

Arcata General Plan                                                                           Page 4
         housing to rental housing. Since last period, an estimate 84 multifamily units and 24
         single family units have been built.
     •   While overcrowding is not a large issue for Arcata (<5% of Arcata’s population), owner
         overcrowding has declined since 2000 and “severely overcrowded” rental households
         (more than 1.5 persons/room) has doubled to 211 households. This shift and the
         ownership rates suggest a trend towards rental group non-family housing – conversion
         to student rental housing.
             o Need additional owner occupancy opportunities.
             o Need additional off-campus student housing opportunities to relieve pressure on
                  single-family housing market.
             o Need more multifamily housing.
             o Need to accept owner occupancy will be low due to need for multifamily housing
                  opportunities for students and lower-income permanent residents.
     •   Half of Arcata’s housing stock is greater than 40 years old; but roughly 1,000 units have
         been added to the housing stock each decade since 1950. Arcata’s housing stock is in
         relatively good condition.
             o City should continue rehabilitation programs
     •   A significant proportion of lower income renter households are overpaying housing
         costs; whereas, a moderate proportion of lower income owner households are
         overpaying.
             o Affordable housing projects and programs are critical, especially for lower-
                  income renters, in meeting the City’s housing goals.
     •   Arcata’s seniors generally live in homes they own; but this may be because there are
         few rental options available.
             o Need more senior housing options of all types for all income levels.
3.4      REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
The State of California (Government Code, Section 65584), requires regions to address housing
issues and needs based on future growth projections for the area by developing a Regional
Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) to distribute the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) as
determined by HCD. HCD provides the County’s total RHNA to the Humboldt County Association
of Governments (HCAOG) and that entity then develops the RHNP, which allocates to cities and
the unincorporated county their “fair share” of the total county RHNA. The principal use of the
allocations in the RHNP is inclusion in local housing element as the shares of regional housing

need. The state-established RHNA period of Humboldt County is 2014 to 2019 with a Housing
Element update due on June 30, 2014. Table 1 shows the City’s adopted “fair share” allocation as

The intent of the RHNP is to ensure that local jurisdictions address not only the needs of their
immediate areas but also fill their share of the housing needs for the entire region. Additionally, a
major goal of the RHNP is to ensure that every community provides opportunity for a mix of
housing affordable to all economic segments of its population. The RHNP process requires local
jurisdictions to be accountable for ensuring that projected housing needs can be accommodated
and providing a benchmark for evaluating the adequacy of local zoning and regulatory actions to
ensure that sufficient appropriately designated land and opportunities for housing development
address population growth and job generation. Based on the HCAOG’s adopted allocation, the
City of Arcata is planning for a total of 363 residential units to meet the projected housing need for
the 2014 to 2019 period. The residential units are distributed into four household income groups
for the City of Arcata. The income groups are defined by HCD as follows:
     •   Very low-income: 31 to 50 percent of AMI;
     •   Low-income: 51 to 80 percent of AMI;
     •   Moderate-income: 81 to 120 percent of AMI; and
     •   Above moderate-income: 120 percent or more of AMI.

Arcata General Plan                                                                                        Page 6
As of June 30, 2014, the City has produced and/or approved 8 housing units towards the 2014 -
2019 planning cycle RHNA allocation (Table 2). During the previous cycle (2009-2014), the City
produced a total of 137 housing units. Between 2009 and 2012 the City issued building permits
for 15 very low-income units, 40 low-income units, 79 moderate-income units and three above
moderate-income units. As a result of the building production from 2009 to 2012, the City
produced about 17% of 811 total housing allocations for the 2009-2014 planning cycle.
To meet this planning cycle’s RHNA allocation, the City of Arcata currently has about 10 acres of
vacant land zoned Residential High (RH) and 19 acres of vacant land zoned Residential Medium
(RM) for multifamily residential development. The City has an additional about 5 acres of
underutilized land zoned RH and about 19 acres of underutilized land zoned RM. The
underutilized parcels provide for 226 units.
The City has about 117 acres of vacant land available for single-family development. The City
has about an additional 138 acres of underutilized land zoned both RVL and RL. Except for the
above moderate income group the City is not relying on any of its underutilized land to meet its
regional housing need (Table A-46, Appendix A and Appendix B). The majority of vacant land
in the City is zoned Residential Very Low density (RVL), which permits two primary units per
acre. However, because of the constraints associated with developing in the RVL zone, such as
hillside development standards, creeks, and accessibility, the conservative estimate of capacity
of 1 unit per parcel was used in our analysis. There are about 89 acres of vacant land available
in the RVL zone allocating a maximum of 32 units. The Residential Low density (RL) zone has
approximately 28 acres of vacant land available, which if developed, considering site constraints
and mid-point density designations, would contribute 154 dwellings to the City’s housing stock.

3.5      QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES SUMMARY
The quantified objectives summary estimates the number of units likely to be constructed,
rehabilitated or conserved/preserved by income level during the planning period. It does not
assess the sites available to meet the RHNA; rather, it shows projects likely to be built. The
quantified objectives do not seek to represent a ceiling on development, but rather set a target

goal for the jurisdiction to achieve based on needs, resources and constraints. Based on the
goals, objectives, polices and implementation measures outlined above, the City has
established the following quantified objectives (Table 3). Over the next planning period, the
City anticipates new construction of 197 new units, assistance with the rehabilitation of 185
units, most of which will be substantial rehabilitations. New regulatory agreements associated
with rehabilitation loans for two “at-risk” projects will preserve 175 affordable housing units
beyond this planning cycle.

3.6        HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
In 1980, the State of California amended the Government Code by adding Article 10.6 regarding
Housing Elements. By enacting this statute, the legislature found that "the availability of
housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a
suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order. The
early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation of government and the
private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and accommodate the housing
needs of Californians of all economic levels. Local and state governments have a responsibility
to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to
make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community."
This chapter presents the City of Arcata’s housing program, which is based on state, regional,
and local housing policies, as well as identified housing needs of the City’s residents, housing
resources, and housing constraints. The housing program works toward the preservation,

                    zoning and development standards and that will have the public services and
                    facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of
                    types of housing for the needs of all income levels. (Reference Implementation
                    Measures: 6, 22, 31, and 32)
Policy HE-8         Provide opportunities for infill development of vacant and re-developable
                    properties in a way that allows for gradual, rather than drastic, changes from
                    surrounding development density or type. Design features such as gradual
                    increases in building height, functional open space, well-designed landscaping
                    and natural vegetation, breaks in wall and roof lines, and building separations.
                    (Reference Implementation Measures: 20, 21, 22, 30, and 32)

Policy HE-10        Eliminate unnecessary discretionary review procedures and delays in the
                    housing development process due to complex processing procedures for
                    housing projects, which may be under tight timelines imposed by state and
                    federal funding programs. (Reference Implementation Measure: 25, 31, 32, and
                    33)
Policy HE-11        Where appropriate, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance,
                    improvement, and development of housing. (Reference Implementation

                    moderate-income households through financial and/or technical assistance.
                    (Reference Implementation Measures: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 23)
Policy HE-20        Provide incentives to developers to include low and moderate income housing
                    units in their proposals; and support housing for persons with lower incomes in
                    residential developments in all areas of the City through a variety of methods to
                    ensure neighborhood diversity. (Reference Implementation Measures: 4, 5, 6, 7,

Policy HE-21        Continue to provide a housing rehabilitation program for lower income renters
                    and owners. Housing rehabilitation is a cost-effective way of keeping the
                    community’s stock of affordable housing in a safe and decent condition.
                    (Reference Implementation Measure: 4, 5, 9, and 14)
Policy HE-22        Prioritize meeting the needs of low income households, since they represent the
                    most significant area of unmet need. (Reference: Implementation Measures: 4,

D.       Equal Housing Opportunity
It is the goal of the City of Arcata to ensure that discrimination is not a factor in the ability of
households to obtain housing.
Policy HE-26        Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex,
                    marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, or sexual orientation, including
                    lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders, and gays. (Reference Implementation
                    Measure: 24)
Policy HE-27        Support state and federal mandates for fair housing practices in both public and
                    private housing developments. (Reference Implementation Measures: 24, and
                    25)
Policy HE-28        Meet the housing and supportive housing and accessibility needs of the
                    homeless and other special needs groups, including prevention of homelessness.
                    (Reference Implementation Measures: 16, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29)
E.       Natural Resources, Energy Conservation, and Sustainable Living
It is the goal of the City to promote the conservation of natural resources and energy in housing
design requirements and support the use of green building technologies and designs.
Policy HE-29        Encourage the reduction of energy use and the conservation of natural
                    resources in the development of housing through implementation of the State
                    Energy Conservation Standards. (Reference Implementation Measure: 18)
Policy HE-30        Promote new housing construction that conserves land and resources, is cost
                    effective and has weatherproofing measures to reduce utility costs. (Reference
                    Implementation Measure: 18)
Policy HE-31        Require energy efficiency in the design and construction of housing
                    developments. The long-term economic and environmental benefits of energy
                    efficiency shall be weighed against any increased initial costs of energy saving
                    measures. (Reference Implementation Measure: 18)
Policy HE-32        Promote alternative housing that seeks to increase sustainability by design by
                    incorporating measures that reduce the global footprint both during
                    construction and over the course of use. (Reference Implementation Measures:

1.0      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND PLANNING COMMISSION MEETINGS
The City of Arcata solicited public participation during the formulation of the 2014-2019 Housing
Element. The City conducted several stakeholder meetings to obtain input and recommendations
for affordable housing development in the City. The stakeholder meetings included members from
affordable and market rate housing organizations such as the Housing Humboldt, Redwood
Community Action Agency, private housing developers, Area 1 Agency on Aging, Arcata House,
and the local builders exchange. Regular e-mails were sent to solicit input to a broad group of
housing and special needs groups, agencies and service providers. The City held four meetings
with the Planning Commission that were policy focused. Based on concerns from the development
community, the City Council directed staff to review the Affordable Housing (inclusionary zoning)
regulations of the City’s Land Use Code. Several meetings were focused on this topic. Generally
the public comments were supportive of Arcata’s on-going efforts to provide affordable housing.
Two areas the public suggested additional policies for the City to consider were related to senior
and student housing.
The public meetings during the draft stages of the Housing Element were advertised through the
City website, the local newspaper, flyers, and e-mails distributed throughout the City in an attempt
to reach all residents in the City. Unfortunately, these meetings did not result in a high number of
public attendees and comments.
A public review draft of the Housing Element was made available on the City’s website and hard
copies were available for review in the Planning Department from February 7, 2014 to adoption
date. Effort was made to notify all residents of the draft Housing Element’s availability for review
through notices in the local newspaper, postings at government offices and public libraries, and on
the City’s website.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
Public hearings were held to allow for public input throughout the update process. A total of
ten public meetings were held before the Planning Commission and City Council on the draft
document prior to its submittal to the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) and at least one more public meetings will be held prior to the adoption of
the Housing Element. Notice of the public hearings and the public review draft was sent to
stakeholders (Appendix F).

2.0     REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT
State law requires the City of Arcata to review its Housing Element to evaluate:
The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
attainment of the state housing goal.
The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and
objectives.
The progress of the city, county, or city and county in implementation of the Housing Element.
Appropriateness. Attainment of the City’s share of the state’s housing goal is met through the
development and the effectiveness of the City’s housing program (i.e., housing goals, policies,
and programs) to assist in the development of housing for all income groups in Arcata. The
effectiveness directs the City to continue the housing program and develop new or discontinue
inappropriate/ineffective goals, policies, and programs.
Effectiveness. The Housing Element’s effectiveness is measured here by the degree to which
the program was implemented, the timeliness with which it was implemented, the impact
implementation had on the stated goal of the program, and whether the program continues to
be relevant with respect to satisfying state and local housing goals (Table A-1). However, many
factors influence the Housing Element’s effectiveness, such as market recessions, available
funding programs, available lenders, available developers, and the political climate. The City
has experienced many of the same economic uncertainties that the state and nation have
experienced over the 2009-2014 Planning Cycle. In addition, the City’s Affordable Housing
Programs relied heavily on the 20% set-aside funds of its Redevelopment Agency. The City
must place added emphasis on its programs and approaches to affordable housing programs in
the 2014 period.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
The City of Arcata is located on the Northern California coast, in the west-central portion of
Humboldt County, 6 miles north of the City of Eureka, the county seat. Arcata is located on U.S.
Highway 101, which connects to Eureka and the San Francisco Bay Area to the south and to
Crescent City and the Oregon Coast to the north. Arcata is at the western terminus of State
Highway 299, which connects Arcata and the north coast to Redding and the upper Sacramento
Valley to the east. Arcata is a city comprising several distinct neighborhoods and recognized
community areas. While the downtown plaza is the commercial, cultural, social, and civic center of
activity, residential neighborhoods and employment centers offer unique living, working,
shopping, learning, recreation, and community opportunities and facilities.
Through the implementation of the General Plan, the majority of the City's growth has been, and is
planned to be, located within the present city boundary and concentrated around the downtown
area, existing neighborhood commercial centers, and Humboldt State University. Growth is
directed to these areas because they have existing urban services and infrastructure and for the
protection of agriculture, open space, and forested hillsides. In addition, the City is being proactive
by preparing for potential impacts from naturally occurring sea level rise or a catastrophic tsunami
event. Although the City’s population is increasing slower than anticipated, the student
enrollment at Humboldt State University (HSU) continues to increase steadily. Currently there are
8,293 students enrolled at HSU, with maximum enrollment limited to 8,500 (full-time equivalent)
students. The enrollment increase will continue to be a factor in housing opportunities in the City.
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the City of Arcata by analyzing
population and housing characteristics and identified special housing needs among certain
population groups, evaluates housing conditions, and provides other important information to
support the goals, policies, and programs to meet the needs of current and future residents.
The data used in preparing the Housing Needs Assessment was taken from several sources.
Although a U.S. Census was conducted in 2010, much of the data for rural areas and small
communities have not been fully analyzed and/or processed. Therefore, in some cases the
2000 Census data is the bases for some of the estimates and projections. The 2000 and 2010
Census data is more accurate than the 2008 and 2013 projections. The California Department
Housing and Community Development (HCD) provided “data packages” for Humboldt County,
including the City of Arcata. These data packages were primarily used, however, other sources
such as: 2010 U.S. Census, 2013 Nielsen Report, Employment Development Department,
California Department of Housing and Community Development, California Department of
Finance, HSU were used to supplement the analysis. It is important to note the data packages
were based on the American Community Survey projections, which have error ranges, as well.

POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Current and future housing needs are usually determined in part by the age characteristics of a
community’s residents. Each age group has distinct lifestyles, family type and size, incomes, and
housing preferences. Consequently, evaluating the age characteristics of our community is
important in determining its housing needs.
Between the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, Arcata’s population increased by only 1.03%, or by 580
persons. This population growth is slightly lower than Humboldt County’s (1.06%) between the
same census periods. In comparison, the previous Planning Cycle (2009-2014) had estimated a
5.4% population increase for the City between 2000 and 2008 (0.7% annually). Arcata’s
population growth between 2000 and 2010 was lower than anticipated. However, the City’s
estimated population for 2013 is up by 605 persons since 2010 (Table A-2).

Population by Age. The estimated median age for the City of Arcata in 2013 was 28.6 years (Table
A-3). The young median age for the City is likely influenced by the HSU student population living in
the City. The two age groups that likely include most HSU students, ages 15 to 24 and 25 to 34,
account for over half of Arcata’s population. Persons aged 25 to 44 are considered to be in the
family-forming age group. This age group represented an estimated 30.19% of the population in
the City of Arcata in 2013. This group has seen a 30.96% growth, while persons aged 15 to 24
decreased in population between 2010 and 2013. Another important trend relates to seniors;
the senior age group (65 to 74) increased by 28.38% between 2010 and 2013 and represents an
estimated 5.51% of the overall population. Arcata assumes the young adult age groups will
continue to be the largest population group because of the university.

Comparing 2000 with 2010 Census data for Humboldt County, it suggests that families with young
children are moving out of the County while the young adult (ages 20-34) and senior populations
are growing. (Note: Table A-4 Population by Age – Humboldt County, was removed).
Population by Race and Ethnicity. The City of Arcata race and ethnic characteristics are shown
in Table A-5 and Humboldt County characteristics are shown in Table A-6. Census respondents
who report as White comprise 81% of Arcata’s population, despite a decrease in this group’s
number (Table A-5). This proportion is similar to that of Humboldt County, in which “White”
represented 76% of the County’s total population. Black or African American and mixed race
populations continue to grow slowly in Arcata. This may result from HSU’s work to increase
diversity on its campus. Notably, the American Indian and Alaska Native population has
decreased steadily over the past 20 years. Hispanics comprise 13% of the population. The
Hispanic population has nearly doubled since 1990, when it comprised 5% of the City’s
population.

   EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS
   Employment trends assist the City in determining the expected housing needs of employers and
   employees. Importantly, this Housing Element addresses employment by industry trends to
   anticipate impacts on the housing market and to ensure policies and programs that adequately
   address the City’s industries’ housing needs. To do this, we look at Employment by Industry
   estimates (Table A-7.1) and Employment by Occupation estimates (Table A-7.2). The County
   data do not represent solely the unincorporated County; Arcata’s numbers are included in
   Table A-7.1 Humboldt County data.
   The top four industries in Arcata and Humboldt County are the same. Arcata’s employment is
   predominately made up of jobs within the education, mental and physical healthcare,
   arts/entertainment and food service, retail trade, and professional management services
   industries (Table A-7.1).
   Employment by occupation shows little change in Arcata’s employment since 1990 (Table A-7.2).
   This table illustrates a relatively stable distribution of occupations between 2000 and 2008.
   Management, retail, and service jobs continue from previous Element periods to account for the
   majority of employment. Of these, office administration and support, sales, food service, and
   education jobs account for half of the jobs in Arcata (Table A-7.3). The City does not anticipate a
   shift in occupations within the 2014 - 2019 Planning Cycle that would significantly alter its housing

Table A-8 illustrates the occupational wages for different occupations in the North Coast Region
(Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, and Mendocino counties) as estimated by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD). Statistics for individual cities are not available
for hourly wages. This table also includes the monthly housing allocation of each annual wage;
30% of a person’s income is generally accepted as the amount allocated for housing. Based on
a survey of apartment and home rental costs in Arcata, the average monthly rental cost is $567
per bedroom. Therefore, the housing allocation for a one bedroom rental unit requires
$22,680 annual income. Four occupations listed in Table A-8 below do not meet the housing
allocation threshold. According to the Nielsen Report (Table A-19), about 41% of Arcata’s
annual household income is less than $25,000.

Jobs/Housing Balance. The jobs/housing balance is the ratio of jobs in Arcata compared to its
number of housing units. The jobs/housing balance is intended to show whether the City could
theoretically provide housing for its workforce. A jobs/housing ratio greater than one, would
require workers come from outside the City. A ratio less than one could suggest adequate housing
for the entire workforce. However, in practice, housing choice is more nuanced.
The City of Arcata has a jobs/housing ratio of 1.03, meaning that there are 1.03 employed persons
for each housing unit. This indicates a near perfect scenario with a well balanced jobs/housing
balance. Therefore, Arcata’s import and export of workers is minimal (Table A-10).
Another jobs/housing balance indicator is the ratio of persons working in their place of residence
compared to the number of housing units. According to Table A-10, there were 7,987 employed
persons and 7,772 housing units in the City. About 53% percent of the employed persons residing
in Arcata worked in the City. Comparing the number of persons working in their place of residence
and the number of housing units establishes the “worked in place of residence/housing ratio” as
0.55 in 2013 This ratio implies a lack of desirable employment opportunities in the City, or the City
is a more desirable place to reside. Just about as many residents commute outside the City for
employment. About 47% of Arcata’s residents worked outside the City and about 36% traveled 15
to 29 minutes to their place of work.

(5.02% annual). The State Department of Finance (DOF) estimates households in the City will
increase 0.42% annual over the next five years, or by 155 housing units. The City’s expected

Household Size. The average household size for Arcata in 2013 was estimated to be 2.09, down
from 2.16 in 2000. The average household size has been decreasing since 1990, but the
distribution of the household sizes is relatively stable over time (Table A-12). Based on 2013
estimates, one and two person households consisted of nearly 74% of the households in Arcata
and showed growth between 2000 and 2013. The number of three, four, five, and over seven
person households decreased over this same time period.

Household Type. As shown in Table A-13 below, the characteristics of Arcata’s households have
been shifting from fairly evenly disbursed family and non-family households in 1990, to
predominately non-family households. Households with individuals over the age of 18 have
increased by 157 between 2010 and 2013. Another household type that increased during the
same time period was married couple households. This household type increased by almost 8%,
or 131 households. The 2013 estimates show male households with own child under 18 years as
the biggest change with an almost 41% decrease in this type of household. Although there are no
2013 estimates for householders over the age of 65, there were 1,112 of this type of household in
Arcata according to the 2010 census.

Household Tenure. Rental occupancy is high in Arcata (Table A-14). Rental occupancy has been
increasing since 1990. Single family units account for approximately 42% of Arcata’s housing stock
(Table A-16). Multi-family unit production has outpaced single family production since 1990 (Table
A-16). Arcata’s owner occupied rates are consistently lower than those of Humboldt County. This
is a similar trend that occurred between 1990, 2000, and 2010.

Overcrowded Households. Overcrowding is defined as a situation where there is more than one
person per room in a housing unit.1 Overcrowding can result from a low supply of affordable and
adequate housing. Households that are unable to afford larger housing units may be forced to
rent or purchase housing that is too small to meet their needs. This may be common in low
income, large family, and student households. Table A-15 lists the City’s households that are
overcrowded (1.0 – 1.5 persons per room) and severely overcrowded (1.5+ persons per room).
The 2010 U.S. Census data has not been analyzed for our rural community, therefore there are
two projections based on the 2000 U.S. Census data. Generally overcrowding for both owner and
rental units in Arcata are estimated to have been lower for 2007-2011 than in 1990 and 2000.
Owner overcrowding has decreased while renter overcrowding has not.

HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
Housing Units by Type. Table A-16 shows housing unit types in Arcata for the last 23 years. It is
estimated that the City has 7,830 various types of housing units in 2013; this represents a 5.83%
increase in the number of units from 2000. Between 2000 and 2013, five or more unit structure
types increased by about 4%, or 76 units. The table shows that since 1990, the greatest number of
housing structures have been detached single family. This trend has decreased slightly since 1990.
However, the proportion of housing types has remained constant between 2008 and 2013.

Age of Housing Stock. Similar to many cities, home building and residential subdivisions really
took off after World War II in Arcata. As shown in Table A-17, only 16% of the City’s housing units
were built before 1950. In just a ten year period from 1950 to 1959, the number of housing units
doubled. Between 1950 and 2000 an average of 1,190 housing units per decade were added to
Arcata’s housing stock. According to the Nielsen 2013 Report, only 570 new housing units were
built since 2000. The majority of housing was built after 1970 (52.36%) versus pre 1970 (47.64%).
A large proportion of Arcata’s housing stock, 17.47% (1,356 units), was built between 1970 and
1979. About 35% of Arcata’s housing stock has been built since 1980. The 2103 Nielsen Report
indicates the median year built for the housing stock in the City was 1971, which signifies a
relatively newer housing stock.

Coastal Zone Housing Activity. Part of the southern and western area of Arcata is located
within the Coastal Zone. A majority of parcels within the Coastal Zone (CZ) are designated for
agriculture and natural resource uses. There are also sites designated for industrial,
commercial, and residential uses in the CZ. From 1982 through 2009, 176 housing units have

been constructed in the Coastal Zone. Since 2009, an additional 61 new units were constructed
in the Coastal Zone.
The City of Arcata Community Development Agency assisted in the redevelopment of an
existing mobile home park (Sandpiper) located in the Coastal Zone. The project decreased the
total number of units in the park from 21 to 19. The City of Arcata has identified the Crossing
Bridges/Arcata Bay Crossing at 280 E Street to replace the lost housing in the coastal zone. All
of the units in the Sandpiper are restricted to low/moderate residents and all of the
replacement units are restricted to low income residents. No other low/moderate-income
units have been authorized for demolition nor have any been converted to a nonresidential use
in the Coastal Zone. While no replacement units have been required as a result of
demolition/conversion activity in the Coastal Zone, 19 of the 61 new housing units in the
Coastal Zone are have affordability restrictions to provide housing to low- and moderate-
income households.
Condition of the Housing Stock. The condition of the City’s housing stock was evaluated from
the 2004 and 2009 housing condition surveys of 2,413 randomly selected housing units (about
32% of Arcata’s housing units). The “windshield surveys” were evaluated using the HCD
approved housing condition form. In addition, Building Department records and the age of the
housing stock were also considered. The City has not required a residential structure to be
demolished because of the condition of a building.
As classified by HCD, a housing unit is deemed in need of rehabilitation if it requires Minor,
Moderate, or Substantial repairs. Units with a “sound” rating are in good repair and those with a
“dilapidated” rating would require major rehabilitation or destruction. Housing units classified as
dilapidated are excluded because it is assumed that the cost of rehabilitation exceeds the cost to
replace the existing structure.
Each structure was rated according to criteria established by HCD. There are five structure
categories: foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and doors. Within each category, the housing
unit is rated from "no repairs needed" to "replacement needed." Points are added together for
each unit and a designation was made as follows:
      Sound                      6 points or less: no repairs needed, or only one minor repair
                                 needed such as exterior painting or window repair.
      Minor Repair               9-11 points: one or two minor repairs needed, or only one
                                 minor repair needed such as patching and painting of siding
                                 or roof patching or window replacement.
      Moderate Rehabilitation    12 to 39 points: two or three minor repairs needed, such as
                                 listed above.
      Substantial Rehabilitation 40 to 55 points: repairs needed to all surveyed items:
                                 foundation, roof, siding, windows, and doors.
      Dilapidated                56 or more points: the costs of repair would exceed the cost

The surveys evaluated a total of 2,413 housing units (1,083 single-family, 22 second dwelling units,
1,174 multi-family, and 165 mobile homes). Of these units, 20.6% (496 units) were in need of
minor repairs, 4.8% (117 units) needed moderate repairs, and 0.2% (6 units) needed substantial
rehabilitation (Table A-18.1). Five units were determined to be dilapidated. The 2004 and 2009
surveys had distinct differences in several categories; however the 2009 survey only included
approximately one quarter of the number of units as the 2004 survey. The 2004 survey
determined the majority of housing units were in sound condition (85.2%) while the 2009 survey
indicated the majority of housing units were in need of minor or moderate repairs (67.8%). Each
survey totals were projected over the total housing units in the City.

Interior/Not Readily Visible Housing Conditions. In addition to exterior condition that is visible in
a windshield survey, housing units also may need interior repairs, such as electrical, plumbing, or
other improvements, that are not visible from the exterior of the unit. Older housing units were
likely to be constructed with building materials that contained lead and/or asbestos, both
presenting hazards. The need for updated electrical and plumbing systems, as well as the potential
for presence of lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials, is a function of the housing
unit’s age. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has developed a
formula for determining the number of units that may contain lead; 90 percent of units built
before 1940, 80 percent of units constructed from 1940 to 1959, and 62 percent of units built from
1960 to 1979 are assumed to contain lead, with a 10 percent margin of error. For the purposes of
this Housing Element, the results from the HUD formulas were used to predict housing units that
may have asbestos-containing materials or need repairs, due to age, not visible from the exterior
of the unit. Due to the extensive requirements and costs associated with removal of lead-based
paint, all units presumed to contain lead (or to need other interior improvements) as a result of
applying HUD’s formula are considered to have a moderate need for rehabilitation.

A total of 3,677 housing units may require lead abatement or other interior improvements (see
Table A-18.2). This analysis assumes that very little lead abatement has occurred in this housing
stock.

Combining the results of the exterior and presumed interior studies, while somewhat speculative,
suggests that much of the housing stock in Arcata may require some level of rehabilitation (Table A-

Code Enforcement: The City conducts code enforcement on a complaint basis. The City’s Building
Division will conduct health and safety inspections when either the tenant or property owner
provides access to the property. In some extreme the cases when there is a clear and eminent
public health and/or safety issue the City will conduct inspections without a complaint filed. The
City also provides free public information regarding tenant rights with substandard housing and
how to get repairs corrected in rental units. The Humboldt State University provides these
handouts on their Housing website as well. If code compliance is required the City has procedures
to require the property owner to correct the deficiencies.

Household Income. According to the 2013 Nielsen Report (Table A-19), the median household
income for the City of Arcata was $34,505 in 2013, up from $27,709 in 2008. This represents a
24.5% increase in the median income between 2008 and 2013. Humboldt County residents had a
median income of $40,682 in 2011; approximately 18% higher than Arcata’s 2013 median income.
Median income in Arcata has increased, but proportional income levels remained relatively static
for the lowest wage earners between 2008 and 2013; with the exception of households earning
less than $15,000, which decreased from 2008 to 2013. As shown in Table A-19, 40.8% of Arcata
households earned less than $25,000 annually in 2013, this is a decrease from 47.4% in 2008. This
is a trend that was also shown between 2000 and 2008. Households earning more than $50,000
annually have increased by close to 5% during the same time period

HOUSING COSTS AND OVERPAYMENT
For-Sale Housing Cost. The residential real estate market in the state experienced significant price
inflation during the early 2000s due to low mortgage interest rates, declining inventory, and a
steadily growing labor market. The “housing bubble” hit its peak around 2005 and burst in 2006.
As a result, home prices have fallen dramatically throughout the state. The City is recovering from
the housing market downturn.
In 2012, the mean home sales price in the City of Arcata was $278,758, and median sales price was
$275,000 as reported by the Humboldt Association of Realtors (HAR).
Rental Housing Cost. Table A-21 shows the 2013 rental costs in Arcata by the number of
bedrooms. According to a City rental survey, the majority of rental units, for both apartments and
houses, were two-bedroom units. The median rent increased from $900 in 2008 to $982 in 2013
for a two-bedroom apartment while the median rent decreased in the same time period from
$650 to $583 for one-bedroom units in the City.

Overpayment. Overpayment is defined as monthly housing costs in excess of 30 percent of a
household’s income. Housing cost is defined as the monthly owner costs (mortgages, deed of
trust, contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the property,
and utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).
As seen in Tables A-22.1 and A-22.2 the number of households overpaying for housing was 49.4%
in Humboldt County and 59.7% for the City. Renters are more likely to overpay for housing than
owners. As incomes drop, the higher chance there is to overpay for housing.

Housing Affordability. Affordability is paying less than 30% of gross monthly income for housing
costs. Annual income limits established by the State Department of Housing and Community
Development are used to examine affordability for the designated income groups.
The median sales price for single-family homes in Arcata has stabilized since the significant
increase in 2000. The median sales price for single-family homes in the City dropped to $278,758
in 2012 as compared to 2008 when it was $337,000. It is estimated that an annual income of
approximately $77,638 is needed to qualify for a home loan of $275,000 (at 4.5% interest and with
a 20% down payment). Approximately 1,257 households (18.72%) earned over $75,000 in 2013 in
Arcata. Based on the HCD income limits for Humboldt County (Table A-23), the maximum
affordable sales price for a three-person, extremely low-income households is $58,085 which is up
about $10,000 from the 2008 HCD income limits. HCD’s 2013 three-person maximum affordable
sales price for a very low-income household is $96,683 (2008 = $80,550), for a low-income
household is $154,767 (2008 = $128,880), for a median-income household is $220,167 (2008 =
$161,010), and for a moderate-income household is $220,167 (2008 = $193,410). Based on Tables
A-19 and A-23 it would indicate that the median priced home is not affordable to three-person
households except for above moderate income levels.

 Moderate income calculated based on 120% of median using 2013 HUD Method for households.
 Note: Affordable housing costs assume that 30% of gross household income is applied toward rent or house payment. Affordable housing
 sales prices are based on the following assumed variables: 10% down payment, 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 6.0% annual interest rate.
 Assignment of 30% of gross household income to housing costs - to cover principal, interest, property taxes, and homeowner’s insurance.
Housing Vacancy. Vacancy rates are used to compare the relationship between housing supply
and demand. If the demand for housing is greater than supply, the vacancy rate is low and the
price of housing increases. According to “Raising the Roof, California Housing Development
Projections and Constraints, 1997-2020,” the desirable vacancy rate in a community is five
percent. Generally, when the vacancy rate drops below five percent, the demand for housing
exceeds the supply of housing. Consequently, prospective buyers and renters may experience an
increase in housing costs.
The vacancy rate for Arcata was 4.4%, up from the 2000 Census vacancy rate of 3.0% (Table A-24).
Although the overall vacancy rate is closer to the desirable 5%, the rates for owner housing units is
low at 1.2% while the vacancy rate for rental properties is 2.2%. The vacancy rates for rental and
owner properties suggest Arcata’s housing prices are higher based on a high demand with low
supply.

SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Household groups with special needs include seniors, mentally and physically disabled persons
(including persons with developmental disabilities), large family households, female-headed
households, agricultural workers, and homeless persons. Households with special housing needs
often have greater difficulty finding decent and affordable housing. HCD has also indicated that in
some cases special needs groups are subject to discrimination based on their special needs or
circumstances. As a result, these households may experience a higher prevalence of overpaying,
overcrowding, and other housing problems.
Senior Households. In this Housing Element, seniors are defined as persons age 65 or older. It is
noted that some funding programs have lower eligibility age limits. Seniors often require
specifically designed housing. They may have special housing needs resulting from physical
disabilities and limitations and fixed or limited income. Additionally, senior households also have
other needs to preserve their independence including supportive services to maintain their health
and safety, in-home support services to perform activities of daily living, conservators to assist
with personal care and financial affairs, public administration assistance to manage and resolve
estate issues, and networks of care to provide a wide variety of services and daily assistance.
While it is the general consensus that the senior population is going to increase due to the aging
“baby-boom” generation, the senior population actually decreased slightly between the 2000 and
July 2014                                                                                        Housing Element

2010 U.S. Census (Table A-25). Nonetheless the Department of Finance estimated the 2013 senior
population had increased by 13.7% between 2010 and 2013. Although Arcata’s median age is
28.6, and the senior population is estimated to account for about 9% of the total population, the
City anticipates faster growth in the over 65 age categories.

Table A-26 indicates that the majority of the senior population in the City is female (about
55%). A proportionately higher female senior population is a trend over the past two Planning
Cycles that is expected to continue. Although a smaller proportion of the total population is the
over 85 years of age category, this population is expected to generally require more care. With
regards to the total senior population, the percentage of persons over 85 years of age
decreased between the 2008 (17.1%) and 2013 (13.92%) estimates.

Another trend in the senior population age group is the tendency to own rather than rent housing.
The latest estimates for Arcata expect over 86% of seniors to occupy the homes they own (Table
A-27). This trend is also expected to continue during the 2014-2019 Planning Cycle. The senior
household tenure shifted towards owner occupancy between the 2000 Census (82.5%) and the
latest estimates.

Senior Housing. The City of Arcata added 28 new housing units dedicated to the senior population
during the last planning cycle. Besides the Plaza Point Senior Housing project, the Bayview
Courtyards is another senior housing project that has age and income restricted housing units. In
addition, the Lazy J Mobile Home Park is an age restricted park providing housing opportunities to
seniors. Several care facilities and service providers assist both senior and disabled persons
(including persons with developmental disabilities) in Arcata (Table A-29). In home care services

communities (Table A-29). These types of services are designed to keep a person in the home by
providing limited services at the individual’s residence. One large adult day care facility provides up
to 120 clients with services including medical as it is associated with the City’s only hospital – Mad
River Community Hospital. Three residential care facilities for senior or disabled persons are
located within the City limits. These three sites provide housing and care for up to 22 persons.
One small family home provides services to persons under the age of 18. The nearest nursing
home is located in Eureka about 11 miles south of Arcata. Nursing homes are defined as skilled
nursing facilities, intermediate-care facilities, long-term care rooms in wards or buildings on the
grounds of hospitals, or long-term care rooms/nursing wings in congregate housing facilities. Also
included are nursing, convalescent, and rest homes.

Disabled Persons. A disability is a mental or physical condition that limits a major life activity.
According to the California Government Code, a "disability" is any physical or mental disability.
A "mental disability" is any mental or psychological disorder or condition that limits a major life
activity. A "physical disability" is any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic
disfigurement, or anatomical loss that affects body. California Government Code defines a
disability as a mental, physical, or health condition that lasts over six months and an individual
may have more than one disability. SB 812 took effect in 2011 and requires housing elements
to evaluate the special needs of persons with developmental disabilities as well.
“Developmental disability” is defined as a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that individual. Although the US Census data does not include the
specific information regarding developmental disabilities, the California Department of
Developmental Services (DDS) has data on the number of persons served by zip code or city.
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities could prevent a person from working, restrict a
person’s mobility, or make caring for oneself difficult. Therefore, disabled persons often require
special housing considerations related to limited earning capacity, the need for accessible and
affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with disabilities. Additionally, people with
disabilities require a wide range of housing depending on the type and severity of their disability.
Housing needs can range from institutional care facilities to facilities that support partial or full
independence (i.e., group care homes). Supportive services such as daily living skills and
employment assistance may need to be integrated in the housing situation. The disabled person
with a mobility limitation requires housing that is physically accessible. Examples of accessibility in
housing include wide doorways and hallways, ramps, bathroom accommodations (i.e.,
countertops, grab bars, adjustable shower heads, etc.), and special sensory devices including
smoke alarms with flashing lights.
Persons with multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome (MCS) require housing that is environmentally
sensitive. MCS sufferers report hypersensitivity to a wide variety of substances. Housing built to
serve persons with MCS must be specially designed to consider the effects of the building
materials on individual chemical sensitivity levels.
As noted in earlier sections, the 2010 US Census data has not been fully analyzed and published for
many of the detailed attributes for rural communities. Thus, the 2000 Census data is used to
project one of six disability types - sensory, physical, self-care, mental, go-outside-home, and

employment for the 2014-2019 Planning Cycle. There were 4,913 disabilities counted in Arcata
(Table A-30.1). An individual may have more than one type of disability, thus accounting for the
higher number of disabilities than people with a disability. Table A-30.1 compares the City’s type
and age distribution with those of Humboldt County. For the most part, the City reflects very
similar proportion distribution as Humboldt County. However, mental disabilities in Arcata’s
population is 4% higher than the County’s for the 5-64 age category. The City has 3% less physical
disabilities than the County in the same age category. About 948 persons between the ages of 16
and 64 had an employment disability (6.5% of total population).
According to the 2009-2014 Housing Element: about 1,191 people had at least one physical
disability; females represented 53% of the disabled population; and 80.7% earned wages below
the poverty level.

receives services for a developmental disability. Of the estimated 123 developmental disability
clients, about 53% rely on home parent or guardian services. About 37% of the clients live in
“independent living” residences.

About 36% of the persons with a disability in the City are not employed (Table A-30.5). There
are about 258 disabled persons with employment; about 15% less than those unemployed.
However, these figures are skewed because the age category includes ages not typically
associated with employment.

Table A-31 compares household size and occupancy characteristics for Humboldt County and
the City. As indicated in Table A-14 and Table A-31 below, Arcata has a higher percentage of
rental housing units than owner occupied. Most of the owner occupied and rental housing
units in Arcata are two person and one person. These two household types comprise about
72% of the owner, and 74% of the rental units

Large Family Households. Large family households, defined as households of five or more
persons who are related, are considered a special needs group because there is generally a
limited supply of adequately sized housing to accommodate their needs. According to the 2013
Nielsen Report, the average household size in Arcata is 2.09 (Table A-12). Of the 6,505
households listed in Table A-31.1, 181 households or 2.8% are considered large family
households. Therefore, market pressure to develop large family units is limited. As noted in
former Housing Elements, there are currently not enough large renter housing units (those with
five or more bedrooms) to accommodate families of seven or more persons. The City has
assisted with the development of housing for larger households, such as the Courtyard in
Arcata project which has eight four-bedroom two-bath units for low-income households.
Zoning accommodates large family housing in both multi-family and single-family zones.
Single-Parent and Female-Headed Households. Single-parent households with children under
the age of 18 living at home include both male- and female-headed households. For these
households, living expenses generally require a larger proportion of income relative to two-
parent households. Therefore, finding affordable, decent, and safe housing is often challenging
for single-parent households. Because average wage disparities in gender – female-headed
households are assessed. Additionally, single-parent households have special needs involving
access to child care, health care, and other supportive services.
Tables A-13 and A-31.2 provides information on the single parent and female headed
households. Although the total number of households listed in the two tables vary greatly, the
female headed households are consistently the majority of the single parent households.
According to HCD’s data package, of the 921 female headed households in the City, almost 40%
of them (366) are under the poverty level.

Agricultural Workers. Employees of nearby farms may reside within the city limits. For
example, Sun Valley Floral Farms employs between 400 employees year round and increasing
to 700 for seasonal work in January. These employees may live in Arcata or other surrounding
communities such as McKinleyville, Eureka, and Fortuna. The City’s zoning ordinance allows
“farmworker housing for agricultural activities on-site” in the agricultural zoning districts with a
Use Permit and or Coastal Development Permit. In addition to the farmworker housing allowed
by the zoning ordinance in accordance with the provisions of Government Code §65589.5,
additional housing for agricultural workers is allowed in all multifamily zones in the City.
Agricultural workers earn their primary income through permanent or seasonal agricultural
labor. According to Tables A-7.1 – A-7.3, the City has about 125 persons employed in the
“Agricultural, forestry, fishing, hunting and mining industry. The number of persons employed
in the “farming, fishing and forestry” occupation in Arcata were around 208 in 1990, 2000 and
2008. The 2013 Nielsen Report estimates the number of persons employed in these
occupations dropped 79 in 2013. According to the Employment Development Department,
there were 1,300 persons in Humboldt County total farm employment in 2007. Many of the
farms do not employ workers year-round, with up to half the workers employed by a single
farm for less than 150 days per year. However, it is possible that workers may work at more
than one farm throughout the year. This conclusion is substantiated by monthly EDD data that
shows for the year 2007, the maximum monthly farm employment was 1,400 persons, while
the minimum monthly farm employment was 1,100 persons which only occurred two months
out of the year
Agricultural employment in Humboldt County is not primarily seasonal crop employment, as is
the case in other areas of California. Rather, the top ranking crop in Humboldt County is
timber, which accounted for $62 million in crop value in 2012 which is down considerably from

$178 million in crop value countywide in 2006. The 2012 Crop and Livestock Report for
Humboldt County indicates the second and third highest valued crops are livestock ($58.7
million) and milk and milk products ($58.4 million).
The majority of farmworkers living in Arcata are not migrant or seasonal farmworkers and do
not have any known special housing needs. Based on the trends, the City projects that the
persons employed in the agricultural business will decrease in the coming years. Therefore, no
additional housing would be needed for agricultural workers in Arcata.
Homeless Persons. Homeless individuals and families have perhaps the most immediate
housing need of any group. They also have one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to
meet, due both to the diversity and complexity of factors that lead to homelessness and to the
issues surrounding the siting of facilities that serve homeless clients. The City of Arcata is a
member agency with the Humboldt Housing and Homeless Coalition (HHHC), the County’s
federally designated Continuum of Care. HHHC has conducted Point in Time Count surveys to
estimate the number of people without housing.
Table A-32.1 shows the Point in Time Counts (PITC) for several years. The January 2013 PITC for
Humboldt County shows 1,539 homeless persons. This is slightly down from the 2009 and 2011
years. The County’s homeless population increases by about 1.4% in the summer months. It is
estimated that Arcata accounts for about 13% of Humboldt County’s total homeless population.
Thus the 2013 PITC estimates the homeless population in Arcata to be 100 during the winter
months and peak at 265 in the summer months. These numbers are expected to increase at a
rate of 1 percent per year. The 2013 PITC showed a significant decrease in homeless males
while there was a significant increase in the female homeless population. The number of
homeless families has been increasing over the past four years. HHHC recognized the increase
in homeless persons under the age of 20. They report that younger homeless persons typically
avoid areas of older homeless persons. Therefore, the 2013 PITC worked closely with educators
and other advocates to ensure the PITC had a representative sample of the under 20 age group.

California law requires Housing Elements to estimate the need for emergency shelter for homeless
people. The City adopted a zoning ordinance that fully addresses SB2 in 2009. Section 9.42.200 of
the Land Use Code incorporated the SB 2 language, identifies standards for location, design, and
operating standards; and identified 14 parcels on which emergency shelters, transitional housing,
and supportive housing are principally permitted. There are a variety of resources in the City of
Arcata that provide services for homeless persons (Table A-32.2). The City leases property to the
Arcata House Partnership which provides transitional housing for families and individuals and
permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless and disabled. Humboldt All-Faith
Partnership’s Arcata Night Shelter facilities are located on Boyd Road just outside of city limits. An
extreme weather program is operated by Humboldt All-Faith Partnership to temporarily house

In March of 2007, the City Council accepted the Homeless Services Plan: 2007-2016 (HSP). This
document sets goals, policies, and programs to eliminate homelessness over the 10-year plan
period. The plan assesses income and housing opportunities and needs for the homeless
population and sets forth implementation measures to prevent and eliminate homelessness.
While programs addressing the City’s RHNA may not completely address the goals of the Homeless
Services Plan, the Housing Element is complementary to the HSP. The HSP is the guiding document
addressing homelessness in the City of Arcata.
In addition to the existing resources, the City vested plans to develop a 40-bed transitional shelter
that Arcata House will operate. Currently due to the loss of funding and partner resources a
planned 40-bed emergency shelter in the Aldergrove Industrial Park is in hiatus. Private
developers have expressed interest in developing single-room occupancy (SRO) units in the City.
The City adopted revised Building Code standards to allow for smaller residential units – 150
square feet in size. The Housing for Homeless combining zone, addresses the requirements of SB
2, by principally permitting emergency shelters in 47.2 acres on 15 parcels throughout the City.
The Housing for Homeless combining zone has the ability to support up to 600 persons (15 acres x
40 beds = 600 persons).
HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY
Humboldt State University is located within the City of Arcata and influences the local economy
and population. The 2013 fall enrollment of 8,293 students is the largest enrollment the University
has experienced. Between 1990 and 2007, enrollment at the University did not change
significantly. Since 2007, however, the student body has been growing at a steady rate. The
average student enrollment since the 1989/1990 school year is 7,488 persons (Table A-33).

According to Humboldt State University, there were 8,293 undergraduate and graduate students
attending the University in 2013 with approximately 1,990 students living on campus. The
remaining 6,303 students live in the nearby communities. Students are housed on campus in six
complexes. These consisted of two residence halls, nine suite-style buildings, and 13 apartment
style buildings. Those students not living on campus reside primarily in the Arcata area (53%),
Eureka (8%), McKinleyville (5%), Sunnybrae (3%), other areas of Humboldt County (2%) with the
remaining number of students (1%) residing in Del Norte County (Humboldt State University
Student Housing Market Study, November 2013). Table A-35 shows the student profile of
undergraduates at Humboldt State University.

The University completed its update to the Campus Master Plan in 2004, which would institute
policy that may increase the student enrollment up to 12,000 students with an annual growth
rate of approximately 1.3 to 1.4 percent from 2004 to 2044. The 2004 Master Plan shows
approximately 756,000 gross square feet (gsf) of new construction for academic and support

The 2004 Master Plan also includes future student housing along the east side of Union Street
north of 14th Street. This would require acquisition of the property in that area and eventual
modification of the campus boundary to a greater extent than is shown in the 1990 Master Plan. A
similar situation exists at the northeast corner of L.K. Wood Boulevard and Granite Avenue, where
property would be acquired and the houses replaced by student housing buildings. The 1990
Master Plan shows this same area being acquired for parking rather than student housing. The
University anticipates pursuing an update to the 2004 Master Plan within the next few years.
HOUSING RESOURCES AND INCENTIVES
 Affordable Housing Programs and Projects in Arcata. The City of Arcata has a total of 598
dwelling units restricted to lower-income households (Table A-38). In addition, the Arcata
Homeownership Program and Housing Rehabilitation Program require affordability restrictions.
The Homeownership Program has affordability time period for 30 years, while the Rehabilitation
Program time period is typically for 5 to 15 years. Currently the Homeownership Program has
affordability restrictions for 25 housing units until at least the year 2024. The Housing
Rehabilitation Program has assisted 52 households with rehabilitation loans since 1993. Currently
there are 42 housing units with affordability restrictions as a result of the Housing Rehabilitation
Program. The City purchased 13 residential parcels and sold them to Housing Humboldt (formerly
Humboldt Bay Housing Development Corporation) which were developed as energy efficient
affordable housing. The Redevelopment Agency had plans to develop a 40-bed transitional shelter
for extremely low-income individuals. However, this and other affordable housing projects and
programs have been eliminated by the State’s elimination of Redevelopment Agencies.
Funding for Section 8 affordable housing originates from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), and the Humboldt County Housing Authority is responsible for
administering the project-based Section 8 properties. Two affordable projects in the City, River
Community Homes and Humboldt Plaza, use Section 8 as a source of rental assistance in

combination with other funding (Table A-38). Funding for Section 8 affordable housing originates
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Humboldt County
Housing Authority is responsible for administering the project-based Section 8 properties. In
addition to the project-based Section 8 rental assistance, the Humboldt County Housing Authority
also administers the Housing Choice Voucher program. Persons using these vouchers are not
restricted to the type or location of housing that they may choose to live in, so the vouchers can be
used for housing units in multifamily complexes and single-family detached housing units.
According to the Authority, the number of households using the Housing Choice Vouchers in the
City of Arcata is not known but the county as a whole, as of December 31, 2013, has approximately
962 households using Housing Choice Vouchers.
Local Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO) consists of Housing Humboldt and
Redwood Community Action Agency (RCAA). A CHDO is a private nonprofit organization with a
501(c) federal tax exemption. The CHDO must include providing decent, affordable housing to low-
income households as one of its purposes in its charter, articles of incorporation, or bylaws. It must
serve a specific, delineated geographic area, either a neighborhood, several neighborhoods, or the
entire community, but not the entire state. RCAA is a locally based, private nonprofit organization
that provides a wide range of services to low- and moderate-income residents of Humboldt
County. Housing Humboldt currently operates 79 local affordable housing units in Arcata and has
established a community land trust.

     *At risk of converting within the next 10 years.
At-Risk Housing. Housing Element law in the California Government Code (Section 65583)
requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing units which may at some
future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of affordability restrictions. There
are three general cases that create the opportunity for the conversion of affordable units
including:
    1. Prepayment of HUD mortgages Section 221(d)(3), Section 202, and Section 236;
    2. Opt-outs and expirations of project-based Section 8 contracts; and
    3. Other cases.
A prepayment of HUD mortgages Section 221(d)(3) involves a privately held project with HUD
providing either below market interest rate loans or market-rate loans with subsidy to the tenants.
In a Section 236 complex, HUD provides assistance to the owner to reduce the costs for tenants by
paying most of the interest on a market-rate mortgage. Additional rental subsidy may be provided
to the tenant. In a Section 202, HUD provides a direct loan to nonprofit organizations for project
development and rent subsidy for low-income tenants. All Section 202 handicapped units (Section
202 H.C.) are designed for physically handicapped, mentally disabled, and chronically mentally ill
residents.

In a Section 8 contract for new construction or substantial rehabilitation, HUD provides a subsidy
to the owner for the difference between the tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent. The
likelihood for opt-outs increases as the market rents exceed the contract rents.
Other cases that create the opportunity for the conversion of affordable housing include the
expiration of low-income use periods of various financing sources, such as Low Income Housing
Tax Credit (LIHTC), bond financing, density bonuses, CHFA and CDBG and HOME funds, and
redevelopment funds.
Currently the Humboldt Plaza and River Community Homes terms of affordability are at risk
because their contractual agreements end during the 2014-2019 Housing Element planning cycle
(Table A-39). The Humboldt Plaza Apartments staff has indicated they will renew their Section 8
contract, which was established in the 1970’s. River Community Homes is currently obtaining
rehabilitation financing and restructuring existing debt. This new loan includes a 15 year
affordability restriction.

Cost Analysis. The cost of preserving the assisted units is generally considered to be less than that
required to replace the units through new construction. Preserving assisted units generally
requires subsidizing the difference between market-rate and assisted rents. Since land prices and
land availability are generally the limiting factors to development of low-income housing, it is
estimated that subsidizing rents to preserve assisted housing is more feasible and economical than
new construction.
Generally, low- and moderate-income households can afford rents for two- and three-bedroom
apartments without experiencing overpayment. However, extremely low- and very low-income
households would find it more difficult to obtain rental housing at an affordable price without
overpaying. According to the Community Development Department Staff Working Group, a group
of housing advocates and developers, the general cost for construction of multifamily unit is
between $80,000 to $90,000 per unit. Based on these figures, it would cost approximately $ 16.6
million to replace the Humboldt Plaza including land and construction costs and River Community
Homes with a total of 175 units with new construction. Another option would be for a private
sector organization to purchase an existing multifamily complex, rather than build a new one,
which would lower the per-unit cost significantly. Although it is generally considered cheaper to
rehabilitate, a survey done in January 2014 showed a newly remodeled 201 unit apartment
complex for sale at $14.86 million. This apartment complex consists of one bedroom units, while
July 2014                                                                              Housing Element

the two at risk housing complexes has a mix of one, two and three bedroom units. The per-unit
cost for the 201 unit apartment complex is about $74,000.
RESOURCES FOR PRESERVATION
Two primary resources are available for preserving at-risk units: (1) public agencies, nonprofit
housing corporations, and tenant groups, and (2) public financing or subsidy programs. The City
will need to be active to identify and obtain new funding sources to assist in the preservation of
affordable housing units since the dissolution of the 20% set-aside funds associated with the
former redevelopment agency.
Regarding Section 8 projects, the property owner can opt to terminate the Section 8 contract (“opt
out”) or renew the contract. The primary incentive for Section 8 property owners to opt out of
their regulatory agreement is monetary. Market rents have risen to the point at which many
property owners can earn more by prepaying their government assistance, even if they have to
borrow money at market interest rates. For the property owner to successfully opt out of the
Section 8 contract, the owner must satisfy certain procedural requirements. A Notice of Intent
(NOI) must be filed with HUD one year before the termination date that indicates the owner’s
intent to convert the units to market rate. Upon filing of an NOI, HUD may offer several incentives
to property owners to remain in their contracts, including refinancing the property mortgage and
establishing higher rents charged for the projects. Failure to file an NOI within the specified time
frame or to follow the other procedures to opt out of the Section 8 contract results in an
automatic contract rollover for five years.
Pursuant to Section 65863.10 of the Government Code, the property owner of a Section 8 contract
must also provide six months advance notification to each tenant household if the property owner
intends to terminate the Section 8 contract. The notice must indicate the anticipated date of
conversion and the anticipated rent increase, the possibility of remaining subsidized, the owner’s
intentions, and the appropriate contacts for additional information. The property owner must also
send a copy of the statement to the city or county where the property is located, to the
appropriate local housing authority, and to the Department of Housing and Community
Development. The statement must indicate the number, age, and income of affected tenants, the
type of assistance, and the owner’s plans for the project.
Upon receipt of notice, the city may contact the owner to determine if there are financial or other
incentives that could induce the owner to maintain the rent and occupancy restrictions or to sell
the property to another owner who will maintain the affordability of the rental units. The city
cannot block the owner’s ability to prepay if state and federal requirements for notification are
followed and other procedural requirements are met prior to prepayment and the termination of
restrictions. The city can monitor the process to ensure that all state and federal requirements are
met.
Efforts by the City to retain low-income housing must be able to draw upon two basic types of
preservation resources: organizational and financial. Qualified, nonprofit entities need to be made
aware of the future possibilities of units becoming at risk. Groups with whom the City has an

ongoing association are the logical entities for future participation, such as Housing Humboldt,
RCAA, and Habitat for Humanity. However, locally the Habitat for Humanity organization is
currently not active. A list of potential preservation resources for at-risk units is provided.
RESOURCES AND INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
The following programs include local, state, and federal housing programs that are valuable
resources in assisting in the development of affordable housing, preserving at-risk housing, and
for housing rehabilitation.
     •   City of Arcata Inclusionary Housing Ordinance: The City adopted the Land Use Code in
         2008 that included inclusionary affordable housing for residential developments.
         Inclusionary Zoning has been less effective than the direct assistance model for housing
         low-income families.
     •   City of Arcata Affordable Housing Trust Fund: The City will continue to work on
         developing an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund will be
         used for the development and preservation of affordable housing in the City. As part of
         the development of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, the City will investigate the
         feasibility and appropriateness of fees and funding sources. Additionally, the City will
         apply for matching funds from the Local Housing Trust Fund Matching Grant Program
         through HCD.
     •   Community Land Trust: The City collaborates with the Housing Humboldt (HH) by using
         the City’s Homeownership Program to finance eligible applicants. Through a series of
         regulatory and purchase and sale agreements, the City and HH ensure the perpetual
         affordability of the units. Under the Community Land Trust program, HH retains fee
         ownership of the land and will sell the homes to income qualified households.
         Ownership of the homes will be subject to a 99-year ground lease that keeps the homes
         permanently affordable to low-income households while giving home owners a
         reasonable return on their investment.
     •   City of Arcata Density Bonus Ordinance: The City of Arcata has instituted a housing
         density bonus for low-income, very low–income, and senior households in accordance
         with Government Code Sections 65915 and 65917. Cities are required to grant a density
         bonus of at least 25 percent above the base zoning density and one additional
         concession or incentive. The City provides density bonuses to qualified residential
         projects through the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. In order to be eligible for a density
         bonus, the housing development must be designed and constructed to include at least
         10 percent of the units for lower-income households, or at least 5 percent of the units
         for very low-income households, or at least 10 percent of the units in a condominium
         project for moderate-income households, or the project is a senior citizen housing
         development. The City grants at least a 20 percent increase in the number of dwelling
         units normally allowed by the applicable General Plan designation and zoning, and for
July 2014                                                                                 Housing Element

Page 82                                                                                  Appendix A
        each 1 percent increase above 10 percent in the percentage of units affordable to
        lower-income households, with the allowance to be increased by 1.5 percent up to a
        maximum of 35 percent. Additionally, for each 1 percent increase above 5 percent in
        the percentage of units affordable to very low-income households, the density bonus is
        increased by 2.5 percent, up to a maximum of 35 percent. The provisions of the density
        bonus apply to all new residential developments with five or more residential dwelling
        units in the Residential – Very Low Density, Residential – Low Density, Residential –
        Medium Density, and Residential – High Density residential districts. In addition, a
        density bonus is allowed in the Commercial – Central, Commercial – General,
        Commercial – Mixed Use, and Industrial – Limited zones. In the commercial zones,
        residential units are to be located above the nonresidential uses or at ground level
        behind the street-fronting nonresidential uses.
    •   Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The Department of Housing and Urban
        Development awards Community Development Block Grant funds annually to
        entitlement jurisdictions and states for general housing and community development
        activities, including housing construction, housing rehabilitation, public services, and
        economic development activities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
        Development’s Small Cities Community Development Block Grant program provides
        funds for community development and housing activities and is administered by the
        State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). HUD also offers
        various other programs such as Section 202 and Section 108 loan guarantees that can be
        utilized by the City and by nonprofit and for-profit agencies for the preservation of low-
        income housing units.
        The annual appropriation for CDBG is split between states and local jurisdictions. The
        City of Arcata receives funds through the Small Cities program. The Small Cities program
        is competitive, meaning that the City of Arcata must submit an application for funding
        annually and compete with other jurisdictions in the state. Examples of eligible activities
        include the acquisition of housing or land, rehabilitation of housing, homebuyer
        assistance, and public facility and infrastructure improvements, among others. For all
        activities that use CDBG funding, at least 51 percent of the persons or households
        benefited must have annual incomes of less than 80 percent of the area median income.
        The rating factors used in the CDBG program consist of benefit to Targeted Income
        Group (TIG) households, the extent of poverty in the applicant jurisdiction, the
        seriousness of the problem to be addressed using CDBG funds, the applicant's efforts to
        assist in resolving the problem, the environmental, social or economic impacts of the
        proposal, and the applicant's performance with any prior CDBG grants from the State.
        The City of Arcata has used CDBG funds for its Homeownership and Housing
        Rehabilitation Programs and to provide housing and assistance for persons who are
        homeless (Table A-38). CDBG funds have also been used to fund pre-development work
        for affordable housing projects, to construct a senior day use center, and to complete
        street, sewer, and water infrastructure in support of new and rehabilitated projects.
Housing Element                                                                            July 2014

Appendix A                                                                                    Page 83
         The CDBG program currently awards grants of up to $2M with a maximum of three
         activities from a menu of housing, economic development, planning, and public service
         or infrastructure activities. The City has received approximately $4M since 2004. The
         City also maintains a CDBG program income fund which consists of income generated
         from housing rehabilitation and business loans. The City’s CDBG Program Income Reuse
         Plan regulates the management and use of CDBG funds.
     •   HOME Program: The Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was created
         under the Cranston Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act enacted in November
         1990 to improve and increase the supply of affordable housing. HOME funds are
         awarded annually as formula grants to states and participating jurisdictions. HCD
         administers HOME funds for jurisdictions, including the City of Arcata that do not
         receive an annual entitlement of HOME funds. As with CDBG funds, the City of Arcata
         applies to HCD for these funds and the grants are awarded on a competitive basis. The
         program's flexibility allows HOME funds to be used for grants, direct loans, loan
         guarantees or other forms of credit enhancement, or rental assistance or security
         deposits.
         HOME funds may be used for housing rehabilitation, new construction, and acquisition
         and rehabilitation, for both single-family and multifamily projects. The City has used the
         HOME funds that it has received to support its First-Time Homebuyer Program, which to
         date has assisted 73 low-income households. HOME funds have also been used by the
         City to build 58 units of affordable senior housing and 100 affordable apartment units
         for lower-income single individuals and families. With the use of HOME funds, the City
         purchased three lots in the Plum Village subdivision and ten lots in the Janes Creek
         Meadows subdivision, which were sold to HBHDC and were developed or are currently
         under construction for affordable housing development. These will provide lower-
         income families in the community with an opportunity for homeownership.
         The City has received approximately $8.9M in HOME grants since 2004. The City
         maintains a HOME program income fund which consists of income generated from
         housing rehabilitation and first-time homebuyer loans.
     •   Public Housing Authority (PHA): The local PHA is the Humboldt County Housing
         Authority, which manages rent-restricted public housing and the Housing Choice
         Voucher (Section 8) program.
     •   Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): The CRA, enacted by Congress in 1977, is intended
         to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities
         in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent
         with safe and sound banking operations. The CRA requires that each insured depository
         institution’s record in helping meet the credit needs of its entire community be
         evaluated periodically. That record is taken into account in considering an institution’s
         application for deposit facilities, including mergers and acquisitions.
July 2014                                                                             Housing Element

Page 84                                                                                  Appendix A
        The CRA has come to play an increasingly important role in improving access to credit in
        communities, both rural and urban. Under the impetus of the CRA, many banks and
        thrifts opened new branches, provided expanded services, and made substantial
        commitments to increase lending to all segments of society. By evaluating a financial
        institution’s lending practices, any practices that are considered discriminatory because
        of race, sex, or income can be removed, thus improving access to loans for all persons,
        including those in Arcata.
    •   Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC): In 1986, Congress created the federal
        low income housing tax credit to encourage private investment in the acquisition,
        rehabilitation, and construction of low-income rental housing. Because high housing
        costs in California make it difficult, even with federal credits, to produce affordable
        rental housing, the California Legislature created a state low income housing tax credit
        program to supplement the federal credit.
        The state credit is essentially identical to the federal credit. State credits are only
        available to projects receiving federal credits. Twenty percent of federal credits are
        reserved for rural areas and 10 percent for nonprofit sponsors. To compete for the
        credit, rental housing developments have to reserve units at affordable rents to
        households at or below 46 percent of area median income. The assisted units must be
        reserved for the target population for 55 years.
        The federal tax credit provides a subsidy over ten years toward the cost of producing a
        unit. Developers sell these tax benefits to investors for their present market value to
        provide upfront capital to build the units.
        Credits can be used to fund the hard and soft costs (excluding land costs) of the
        acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of rental housing. Projects not receiving
        other federal subsidy receive a federal credit of 9 percent per year for ten years and a
        state credit of 30 percent over four years (high cost areas and qualified census tracts get
        increased federal credits). Projects with a federal subsidy receive a 4 percent federal
        credit each year for ten years and a 13 percent state credit over four years.
        The City has leveraged HOME funds to assist HH and Pacific Communities to obtain
        LIHTC funds for the construction of 30 senior housing units at the Bayview Courtyards,
        28 units at Plaza Point, and 100 units at the Courtyards at Arcata projects.
    •   California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA): CHFA offers permanent financing for
        acquisition and rehabilitation to for-profit, nonprofit, and public agency developers
        seeking to preserve at-risk housing units. In addition, CHFA offers low interest
        predevelopment loans to nonprofit sponsors through its acquisition/rehabilitation
        program.
    •   Federal Home Loan Bank System: The Federal Home Loan Bank System facilitates
        Affordable Housing Programs (AHP), which subsidize the interest rates for affordable
Housing Element                                                                            July 2014

         housing. The San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank District provides local service
         within California. Interest rate subsidies under the AHP can be used to finance the
         purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental housing. Very low-income
         households must occupy at least 20 percent of the units for the useful life of the housing
         or the mortgage term.
     •   California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD): HCD conducts
         the Urban Predevelopment Loan Program, which provides funds to pay the initial costs
         of preserving existing affordable housing developments for their existing tenants.
         Priority is given to applications with matching financing from local redevelopment
         agencies or federal programs.
         HCD also conducts the acquisition and rehabilitation component of the Multifamily
         Housing Program to acquire and rehabilitate existing affordable rental housing. Priority
         is given to projects currently subject to regulatory restrictions that may be terminated.
         Assistance is provided through low interest construction and permanent loans. Eligible
         applicants include local government agencies, private nonprofit organizations, and for-
         profit organizations.
     •   Emergency Housing Assistance Program (EHAP): EHAP is administered by HCD and
         provides funds for emergency shelter, transitional housing, and related services for the
         homeless and those at risk of losing their housing. The funds are distributed to all 58
         counties in the state of California based on a “need” formula derived from factors
         including population, unemployment, and poverty.
     •   Arcata Redevelopment Agency: The Arcata Community Development Project Area was
         established in 1983, but was not adopted until 1995 due to legal proceedings. Effective
         February 2012, Redevelopment Agencies (RDA) were dissolved and were required to
         form Successor Agencies, whose sole duty was to wind down the affairs of the former
         RDA’s. Formerly, the RDA funded the acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of
         housing for low- and moderate-income families, seniors, and handicapped individuals.
         As required by state law, the Arcata RDA had set aside at least 20 percent of the gross
         tax increment revenues received from the Project Area into the Low and Moderate
         Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) for affordable housing activities. The 2006-2010
         Implementation Plan lists proposed housing program and estimated expenditures,
         which includes a funding total set-aside of $3,721,000. The LMIHF anticipated revenues
         and expenditures for the period from 2006 to 2010 (Table A-40). This funding source is
         no longer available.

Incentives for Affordable Housing Development. The City offer incentives to promote the
development of housing affordable to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households
through its Density Bonus zoning ordinance. Furthermore, the City has a history of successfully
partnering with developers of affordable housing to win grants to complete the housing
projects. The City assists housing developers by providing support in the following areas:
               Financial assistance,
               Improvements to public infrastructure,
               Expedited development review,
               Streamlined processing,
               Funding of public fees, and
               Modification of development requirements.

Available Multifamily Sites. The City of Arcata currently has approximately 29 acres of vacant
and 21 acres of underutilized land designated in its General Plan to accommodate multifamily
development within the city limits. Table A-41 lists the total number of multifamily units that
could be developed on available vacant RM and RH designated sites is 345. Based on the
realistic capacity methodology cited below, Table A-46 summarizes the data in Appendix B
which lists an additional 226 housing units projected for the RM and RH underutilized sites. In
addition to the adequate sites identified in Table A-46 and Appendix B, the sites in Table A-45
have either approved or proposed projects that are anticipated to result in new multifamily
construction during the planning period that are projected to result in an additional 146
housing units.
The zoning designation with the highest development capacity is Residential Medium (RM),
which requires a minimum of 7.26 units per acre and allows a maximum of 15 units per acre.
There are 37.84 acres (19.03 underutilized and 18.81 vacant) designated RM, which if
developed, considering site constraints and mid-point density (11.13 units/acre), have a
capacity of 309 units. There are 15.07 acres (3.73 underutilized and 10.14 vacant) designated
Residential High (RH) allowing up to 32 units per acre which, considering site constraints and
mid-point density (23.5 units/acre), have a capacity of 267 units.

Available Single-Family Sites. The majority of vacant land in the City is designated Residential Very
Low density (RVL) in the General Plan, which permits 2 or fewer primary units per acre. However,
because of the constraints associated with developing in the RVL zone, such as hillside
development standards, creeks, and accessibility, the conservative estimate of capacity of 1 unit
per parcel was used in the analysis. There are approximately 89.07 vacant acres in the RVL zone
that would accommodate a maximum of 32 units (Table A-46). There are 123.32 acres of
underutilized RVL lands that are capable of supporting an additional 66 dwelling units. The
Residential Low Density (RL) designation (2 to 7.25 units per acre) has approximately 28.26 vacant
acres, which if developed, considering site constraints and mid-point density (4.625 units/acre),
would contribute approximately 154 dwelling units to the City’s housing stock. An additional 59
dwelling units are projected on the 14.53 acres of underutilized RL designated lands.
Infrastructure is available for all vacant residential acreage within the City. Appendix B provides
the characteristics of the available adequate sites by General Plan designation and provides the
details on sites zoned and designated in the General Plan for residential land use. There is a total
potential for 311 single-family dwelling units and 576 multifamily dwelling units based on current
General Plan designations in the City.
Several residential sites where removed from the adequate sites analysis because they became
part of the City’s Open Space program to protect forested hillsides with steep slopes and
environmentally sensitive habitat areas. Most of these were large tracts of undeveloped lands
with RVL land use designations.
Ability of Sites to Meet RHNA. It is assumed that the RM and RH zones will provide the majority
of development, in the form of multifamily housing affordable to extremely low-; very low-; and
low-income households based on past production of affordable housing. Some single-family
developments may also provide affordable single-family units, through first-time homebuyer
assistance. Historically, single-family homes have been affordable to moderate-income
households anticipated to be served through a mix of single-family and multifamily households.
Table A-44 shows the various income groups, the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, and the
site inventory capacity (vacant lands only). The table shows there is an adequate supply of land
to provide housing opportunities for the City’s extremely low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and
above moderate-income household needs.
All available sites identified in summarized in Table A-46 and listed in Appendix B have been
analyzed to determine whether constraints exist that would reduce the development potential
of each site. Infrastructure is available to serve each site identified and is not considered a
constraint. The “Natural Hazards/Constraints” column identifies sites which are located in
forest/hillside areas associated with steep slopes, have wetlands or watercourses, geologic
hazards, and sites that are adjacent to or have a portion of the site within the 100-year
floodplain. The Wetland Protection (:WP) and Stream Protection (:SP) Combining Zones, as
discussed under Governmental Constraints, establish standards for sites with wetland and
stream constraints. While these constraints may raise the cost to develop the site and require
additional time to design and engineer development of the site, the constraints do not preclude
development of the site. Furthermore, the “Units” column identifies the number of units that

Appendix A                                                                                      Page 89
could potentially be located on the site with all constraints considered. As it is, the City has
adequate sites and enough land, as shown in Table A-44, to accommodate its RHNA even with
the constraints factored.
Realistic Capacity. Realistic capacity for vacant sites in the RH, RM, and RL zones was based on the
mid-point of the designation’s density range and all known site constraints, including slopes,
flooding , wet areas, watercourses, and geologic or seismic hazards. Capacity for sites zoned RVL
was considered 1 unit per parcel.
Realistic capacity for underutilized parcels zoned RH, RM, and RL was based on the mid-point of
the allowable density range (RH, 23.5 units/acre; RM, 11.13 units/acre and RL, 4.625 units/acre).
For those sites with at least one constraint, the developable area was reduced by 20 percent. The
resulting capacity was based on 80 percent of the total site acreage. Since the City’s Housing
Element update is subsequent to the adoption of its new Land Use Code, which has not been
borne out in actual developments, the City vetted the results of this method in two ways. First, the
capacity of several single- and multi-family parcels that were built under the previous zoning
ordinance was considered. This provided a realistic capacity using the previous code as a baseline.
Second, the City compared the few multifamily projects either approved or fully analyzed under
the new LUC. This provided a current trend, albeit with only very few data points. Finally, the City
compared the results of this approach with a theoretical model that used spatial considerations in
a conservative approach at how much area is required to develop a given housing type, this was
then applied to the parcels. The three approaches were compared with the proposed method for
determining realistic capacity. Since the projections were similar across all models, and since the
approach that was used provided the more conservative result, we used the method described
below.
Underutilized Sites. For underutilized parcels with existing units, the units were subtracted from
the total allowable capacity of each site. Sites zoned RVL and RL, greater than 1 acre, were
considered divisible based on an aerial photo analysis of the parcel. RM and RH zoned parcels
were included if there was a significant difference between current build out and projected build
out, and the parcel proved potentially developable in the aerial photo interpretation assessment.
Based on earlier analysis, the City used an aerial photo interpretation as a gross assessment tool
which effectively eliminated many parcels not suitable for inclusion in the sites inventory.
Although the City is not relying on any of the underutilized sites identified in Table A-46 to meet its
RHNA, the City believes they are appropriate to include for the following reasons:
        The City encourages infill development in its policies and programs and gives priority to
         infill development prior to rezoning vacant land.
        The incentives and concessions available to developers related to the Density Bonus
         Ordinance will aide in such development.

       The sites in the inventory are all selected based on geographic ease of redevelopment.
        Which means, adding new units will not require demolition of existing structures.
        Therefore the sites included in the inventory represent the most likely of any of the sites.
       The fact that land is limited and nearly exhausted in the City pushes the market towards
        redevelopment and infill development. The City has had successful infill developments in
        the past with redeveloping underutilized sites.
       Including these sites in the land inventory identifies them for property owners, developers
        and city staff as priority sites for infill development. Many land owners are unaware of the
        full development potential of their property. Prioritizing these parcels for development
        provides a tool for City staff to easily access necessary information to determine whether
        any given infill proposal can move forward.
Table A-42 shows three residential development examples to serve as the basis for showing the
appropriateness of including the underutilized residential sites identified in Appendix B.

Small Site Analysis. The land inventory relies in part on sites smaller than one acre to meet the
City’s need for affordable multifamily housing. The following demonstrates that development on
these sites for affordable housing is feasible based on the City’s history with small site
development and its commitment to affordable housing. The development trends and the City’s
policies, together, have facilitated small site development for affordable housing in several recent
developments. In addition, two local housing developers are heavily invested in the low-income
market, dedicating all or a significant portion of their business to affordable housing development.
Furthermore, student demand and single family home prices increase demand for multifamily
housing, resulting in increased pressure to develop even traditionally difficult sites. The City’s
density bonus zoning regulations ensure affordable housing is included in most new
developments, which are typically developed at densities higher than those predicted in the
inventory. As such, there are market forces and market will, as well as policy direction from the
City to develop small sites for affordable housing.
The City’s history with developing small sites specifically for affordable housing includes several
single-family homes but also some multifamily projects. Specifically, the Housing Humboldt (HH)
(formerly Humboldt Bay Housing Development Corporation) worked with the City to develop a
0.70 acre site for 10 units in the Janes Creek Meadows development. This development included
small parcels with “duettes", attached housing units on separate parcels. The land is held as a land
trust to assist in affordable home ownership. Another notable multifamily project completed in
the 2009-2014 Planning Cycle is the 8th & I Street senior housing development, by the DANCO
Group. This mixed-use project, with commercial on the first floor, was built on a 0.51 acre parcel
and provided 28 affordable units with one manager’s apartment unit for a total of 29 units (APN
021-154-002). This parcel, while not on the inventory as it is zoned Central Commercial, shows
how small sites can be developed. Indeed, due to the limited number of multifamily sites, the
small multifamily sites are being developed due to the market pressure exerted by the student
population. These recent examples demonstrate the trend for developing small sites in the city.
Market forces that encourage multifamily development include student housing pressure; low-
income niche market created by Tax Credit Incentives, HOME, and CDBG funding sources; and the
typically high price of single family housing. Students create market pressure for multifamily
housing in two ways. First, they create direct demand for multifamily housing since many students
rent in apartment complexes. Second, the student presence in the single family marketplace
facilitates additional need for multifamily housing to address the permanent resident family
population. This demand has in turn created a thriving low- and very low-income housing market
niche in which at least two local developers have come to specialize. This market was particularly
robust over the 2004 -2009 planning period, yielding over 100 affordable multifamily units.
However, it slowed during the last planning period due poor economic conditions nationwide. The
low-income niche market is further supported by the generally high price of market rate single
family housing in Arcata. While the recent housing market crash did affect home sale prices in
Arcata, the city’s market was affected less than other jurisdictions regionally and statewide. These
primary drivers in the housing market continue to add pressure to develop small sites.
In addition, City policy and LUC supports affordable housing development on small sites. The LUC
zoning regulations provide several options to allow for maximizing development potential through
Housing Element                                                                            July 2014

exceptions to development standards. In some cases, the exceptions may require affordable
housing requirements. On average, two hundred fifty thousand dollars of Redevelopment Agency
and additional other City and State Funding sources were committed to affordable housing
projects annually. The City has demonstrated a commitment to providing housing opportunities to
a range of income levels. As noted earlier, the loss of Redevelopment Agency funding will impact
the City’s ability to assist affordable housing projects until new funding sources are secured. While
the sites identified on the inventory demonstrate the capacity to meet the RHNA, the City’s plans,
programs, and policies have historically, and will continue in the future, to address Arcata’s need
for affordable housing. Although small lots can present challenges to developing affordable
housing, trends and market forces in combination with City policies help alleviate or eliminate the
constraints related to the feasibility of small lot development.
Finally, an assessment of the small sites that are on the inventory provides a clearer picture of how
these parcels might be developed. The following analysis of the small sites on the inventory
addresses the feasibility of developing multifamily housing. While the decision to develop
affordable housing is generally a private landowner choice, as stated above, the City assists in the
production of affordable housing through incentives and exceptions. It is also important to note
that the inventory only accounts for existing vacant residentially zoned parcels. There are several
underutilized and/or non-residentially zoned parcels on which multifamily housing may be
developed (Appendix B).
The City has listed 13 vacant, multi-family zoned parcels for a total of 77 units that are less than
one acre in size (Table A-43). The small sites identified on the inventory are considered generally
well-suited to multifamily development.
The determination of potential for development is given here for each small multi-family site listed
on the inventory. This table shows that the majority of parcels have a high or moderate likelihood
for development. Three of the sites would require considerable planning to develop adequately.
However, market forces and the City’s in-fill policies are promoting development of small and
otherwise difficult sites.

development. Trillium Creek and 30th Street Commons have vested their projects by making
substantial infrastructure improvements. Trillium Creek is continuing to construct
improvements while the 30th Street Commons has temporarily suspended the project until
market conditions improve. The Mad River Parkway, a mixed use subdivision has completed
their subdivision improvements and will be recording the Final Map soon. The other approved

Table A-46 summarizes the adequate sites analysis discussed above (see Appendix B for full
inventory). Based on the analysis, the City has adequate vacant land to meet the RHNA for the
2014-2019 planning cycle except for the above moderate income levels (Table A-44). Taking into
account the underutilized potential within the RVL and RL zoning districts, the City has adequate
land to serve the above moderate income levels. As indicated above, there are additional
opportunities for housing units in Arcata through the approved residential subdivisions listed in

5.0     HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Various interrelated factors can constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide
adequate housing and meet the housing needs for all economic sectors of the community. These
factors can be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental. Non-
governmental constraints consist of land availability, the environment, vacancy rates, land cost,
construction costs, and availability of financing. Governmental constraints consist of land use
controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code enforcement,
site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a variety
of housing.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Location. Arcata is a community with a variety of natural constraints that affect the development
of housing. A quick overview of the natural setting of Arcata reveals a city that is virtually
surrounded by natural conditions that limit housing development, such as floodplains, wetlands,
prime agricultural lands, prime timber lands with slopes greater than 15 percent, earthquake
zones, and areas of high and moderate liquefaction. Though many of these natural constraints do
not prohibit the development of housing, they may increase the cost of development and thereby
increase the cost to prospective owners or renters of this housing.
Land Availability. The City is located on the northern California coast, in the west-central portion
of Humboldt County. The City is situated on a coastal terrace, the lower portions of Fickle Ridge,
and the eastern portions of the Arcata Bottom, between Arcata Bay and the Mad River.
The City of Arcata consists of approximately 4,635 acres of land area of which 1,491 acres are
zoned for residential uses. Within the City’s land area are areas that are not considered buildable
because of environmental contamination (brownfields). This land will have to be cleaned up
before any use (commercial, industrial, or residential) can be developed on it. Brownfield sites
were not considered in Table A-46.
According to the land use survey, the City has approximately 308 acres of residential vacant or
underutilized land. This equates to approximately 6.6 percent of the total land area in the City.
Infrastructure. Natural gas and electricity are available throughout the City and are provided by
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).
Community water systems divert free-flowing and subsurface water sources for domestic use. A
system of trunk lines and mains, aboveground water tanks, and booster pumps deliver water to
the City’s residents and to business, industry, and other facilities. Water service is available to all
areas within the City’s Urban Services Boundary and limited areas outside the boundary. Not all of
the City of Arcata is located within the Urban Services Boundary (bay, agricultural, or forest lands).
Although the entire City is not located within the City’s Urban Services Boundary, all of the sites
included in Table A-46 and Appendix B, Available Sites Inventory are within the Urban Services

Appendix A                                                                                      Page 97
Boundary and have water available to them. The City currently has capacity to meets its 2014–
2019 regional housing need.
Stormwater and wastewater collection is provided by the City, as is the treatment system for
wastewater. The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS) facility treats municipal
wastewater and reuses the water for wetlands, ponds, and related wildlife habitat. The AMWS
employs natural systems to successfully treat and reuse wastewater through a system of five
marshes in the 170-acre sanctuary, where natural organisms filter the water before it is released
into Arcata Bay. The City’s Drainage Master Plan is used to identify and quantify the existing
stormwater and drainage system to determine the available capacity of the system. Sewer
infrastructure is available throughout the City. The City currently has the capacity to meets its
2014-2019 regional housing need.
To comply with Senate Bill 1087, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing Element to
its water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations to proposed
developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
Land Cost. The cost of residential land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new home and is
considered a non-governmental constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new home.
Therefore, developers sometimes seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots
allowable on a parcel of undeveloped land, allowing the developer to distribute the costs for
infrastructure improvements (i.e., streets, sewer lines, water lines, etc.) over the maximum
number of lots. The cost of land varies greatly depending on the area of the City in which the land
is located. One neighborhood with view lots has 5 residential lots for sale at $148,500 each. A
vacant, 3.3 acre rural residential parcel in the Coastal Zone is marketed at $379,000. A vacant 1.1
acre forested residential lot zoned RVL is on the market for $179,950 while another forested lot in
the RL zone is listed at $89,000. Other vacant residential land for sale in Arcata range in price from
$135,000 to $159,000. No vacant multi-family zoned lots were on the market during the land cost
survey.
Construction Costs. Construction costs can vary widely depending on the type of development.
Multiple-family residential housing generally costs less per unit to construct than single-family
housing.
Labor and materials costs also have a direct impact on housing costs and make up the main
component of housing costs. Residential constructions costs vary greatly depending on the quality
of materials used and the size of the home being constructed. According to meetings with
stakeholders, the estimated construction cost for single family residences range from $100 to $110
a square foot. With multi-family units the price per square foot is reduced, but may be increased
by as much as 20% if prevailing wages are required.
If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in Arcata could rise to a
level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore, increased

construction costs have the potential to constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of
existing housing.
Availability of Financing. The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to
purchase a house affects the amount of affordably priced housing in Arcata. Fluctuating interest
rates can eliminate many potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing
project infeasible that could have been successfully developed or marketed at lower interest rates.
Over the past few years, the interest rate has been very low, dipping below five percent. Although
lower interest rates help make housing affordable, the qualification requirements for loans have
been tightened making access to financing limited to many. For instance, the down payment can
be as high as 20% instead of the typical 10% down payment prior to the banking crisis during the
last planning cycle. The cost of housing in Arcata has leveled during the last planning cycle.
However, Arcata continues to have a higher home sale prices due in part to higher demands
versus a lower supply. As the banking industry tightened their requirements, available financing
became a constraint on home ownership in Arcata along with the high cost of housing. Many of
the homes in Arcata are unaffordable to lower-income households. Additionally, the HOME
program has a maximum purchase price for a single-family home of $227,000 (existing), $261,000
(new construction) for the First-Time Homebuyers Program, which limits opportunities for its use
in Arcata with a median housing price of $275,000 (2013).
Households in the City must earn approximately $84,000 annually with a 5 percent interest rate
to qualify for a $275,000 home loan. This assumes that the borrower has good credit and no
other debts. Approximately 559 households (7.53 percent) in the City earned between $75,000
and $99,999 annually in 2013.

LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Land Use Controls. The Arcata General Plan establishes policies that guide new development
including residential development. These policies along with zoning regulations control the
amount and distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the City. The land use
designations established by the General Plan that allow single-family and multiple-family
residential developments are identified in Table A-48. A total of four residential land use
designations provide for a range of residential densities ranging from very low residential densities
(2 du/acre) to high residential densities (32 du/acre).

                                        The allowable density is 2 or fewer primary dwellings per acre. The R-VL
                                        zoning district is applied to areas where physical constraints, the
                                        protection of natural features, and/or the preservation of semi-rural
         Residential Very Low

         Density (R-VL)
                                        considerations. The R-VL land use designation is primarily applied to areas
                                        with steep slopes and where the General Plan intends that the open space
                                        character of the City's hillsides and perimeter lands are to be preserved.
                                        The R-L land use designation is applied to areas appropriate for
                                        neighborhoods of single-family homes on individual lots. This designation
         Residential Low                is found throughout the community, including the older, historical
         Density (R-L)                  neighborhoods surrounding the Plaza Area, Sunny Brae, Sunset, Preston
                                        Ridge Area and Greenview, Terrace. The allowable density ranges from 2
                                        to 7.25 dwellings per acre.
                                        The R-M land use designation allows medium density residential unit types
         Residential Median             that include duplexes, townhouses, co-housing, low density apartments,
         Density (R-M)                  and modular housing located in mobile home parks. The allowable density
                                        ranges from 7.26 to 15 dwellings per acre.
                                        The R-H land use designation provides residential uses in central Arcata to
         Residential High               allow increase in density above present levels (prior to 2000). The
         Density (R-H)                  allowable density ranges from 15.01 to 32 units per acre.

The Arcata Land Use Code (LUC) implements the policies and goals of Arcata’s General Plan. The
LUC further delineates the General Plan’s residential classifications into four residential zoning
districts and nine other nonresidential zoning districts that allow residential uses. Combining
zones are applied to property in conjunction with a primary zoning district (for example, RVL:CZ on
the Zoning Map would indicate that a site is designated Residential – Very Low Density (RVL) and is
also within the Coastal Zone (:CZ)). The combining zones note where important site,
environmental, safety, compatibility, and/or design issues require particular attention in project
planning and design. The combining zones provide guidance for development within the
combining zones through standards that apply to proposed development in addition to the
standards and regulations of the primary zoning district. Zoning districts that allow residential uses
are summarized in Table A-49.

Residential Development Standards. The City of Arcata’s zoning ordinance, the Land Use Code
(LUC), was adopted in October 2008. The LUC is the primary guide for all development, including
residential, in the City. The LUC establishes development standards that control the type of land
use activity, allowable land uses within each specific zoning district, building setbacks from
property lines, structure heights, off-street parking, and density of residential development in
Arcata. The zoning regulations serve to protect and promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of community residents and also implement the goals and policies of the General Plan. The
specific residential land use zoning districts established in the LUC and their respective maximum
densities are shown in Table A-50.

In addition to development standards and density zoning limitations (Table A-50), Tables A-51 and
A-52 describe additional development standards that are applied to residential development in
the City.
All residential zoning districts have limitations on the amount of land that can be covered by
structures and other impervious surfaces. The maximum site coverage, yard setbacks, floor area
ratio, and recreation space all affect the level of development allowed for individual parcels.
These development standards are important factors in determining the amount of development
and the number of dwelling units that can be constructed. Individually and collectively these
development standards may be considered restrictive to development; however the requirements
have multiple benefits to the residents and community at large. Specifically, the recreation space
development standard is intended to ensure a minimum amount of common and private
recreation space is available for the exclusive use of the residents of a multi-family residential
project in order to fulfill their needs for outdoor leisure and recreational opportunities.
The major factor in determining housing density under the City’s current zoning system is the use
of floor area ratios (FAR) in residential zones. The FAR is the ratio of total floor area to the lot area.
A development with 25,000 square feet of floor area on a lot of 100,000 square feet would have a
FAR of 25 percent, regardless of the number of stories contributing to the floor area. All the
residential zones use FAR for determining the size and bulk of structures for the area, except for
the RM and RH zones, which only use maximum site coverage. In addition, the FAR is not
applicable in the RVL and RL zoning districts when affordable housing uses are provided according
to the City’s Density Bonus.

        *Density bonus allows for a reduction in setbacks and an increase in height.
Other development standards that affect the amount of land developable is the off-street parking
and open maximum site coverage. The off-street parking requirements can factor into housing
development opportunities for all new construction by consuming land that could otherwise be
used for housing. The Land Use Code reduced the number of off-street parking spaces required for
new residential developments. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for
residential uses is one per dwelling unit, while the maximum is two per dwelling unit. Parking
spaces for multifamily units are also based on the number of dwelling units. For example, a new
triplex would require a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 6 off-street parking spaces. Excessive
parking requirements reduce the amount of buildable area and can add to the cost of housing.
Therefore, the City discourages providing more off-street parking spaces than required to avoid
the inefficient use of land, unnecessary pavement, and excessive stormwater runoff from paved
surfaces. The Land Use Code includes provisions for applicants to adjust the number of parking
spaces required in cases based on quantitative information that documents the need for fewer (or
more) spaces, e.g., project located near public transportation.
The current zoning ordinance was also revised recently to further reduce the amount of off-street
parking if a new curb cut is required. This typically is associated with second dwelling units on an
existing lot. In some cases, a new off street parking space would be required for the new dwelling
unit. However, if the new parking space requires an elimination of on-street parking because of
the new curb cut, the Director can waive the off-street parking requirement. In the past, off-street
parking requirements may have been considered a constraint, but the LUC and its recent revisions
have lessened parking as a constraint.
Bicycle parking spaces are also required in multifamily development and are based on the number
of required vehicle parking spaces. For areas where 3 to 10 parking spaces are required, the
bicycle parking requirement is 100 percent of the vehicle parking spaces. In areas requiring over 11

parking spaces, the required bicycle parking is 50 percent of the vehicle parking. The City
encourages the use of alternative and mass transportation and does not consider bicycle parking
requirements as a constraint because it is significantly much more cost effective than traditional
automobile costs.
The amount of a site covered by parking, driveways, and structures, i.e. site coverage, directly
affects the amount of land developed (Table A-52). The higher the residential density the more
land can be covered by development. The LUC proportionally reduces the site coverage based on
the lot size. For example if a RL zoned parcel is 3,000 square feet in size, which is half the standard
lot size (6,000), than the amount of site coverage is increased at the same proportion. Thus, the
allowable site coverage is 75% instead of the standard 50% in the RL zoning district. To encourage
pervious surfaces, the LUC does not include driveways or parking surfaces that are pervious as site
coverage. This further increases the actual amount of land that theoretically is “covered” by
development.
Residential development standards are used to help define the City’s desire to establish
aesthetically pleasing, people-friendly, useful, safe, and orderly residential construction and
development. Much of the regulation in the standards, such as site coverage, lot sizes, and height
limits, must be balanced with the need for additional housing in a limited area. Many of these
standards could be considered a housing development constraint; however these standards are in
place to assist in maintaining City character. The Land Use Code attempts to encourage a variety
of housing types by allowing for exceptions to several development standards such as setbacks,
reduced lot sizes, etc. In addition, the reduced parking standards changes how the City’s vital land
resources are utilized, i.e., use the land for people spaces not vehicle spaces.
Provision for a Variety of Housing. The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are
available to encourage the development of various housing types for all economic segments of the
population through appropriate zoning and development standards. Housing types include single-
family residential housing, multiple-family residential housing, residential accessory dwelling units,
mobile homes, duplexes, and residential care homes. Table A-53 shows the housing types
permitted in the various residential zoning districts of Arcata.
Multifamily Housing
The City defines multifamily housing as a dwelling unit that is part of a structure containing two or
more dwelling units excluding second units. Multifamily dwellings include duplexes, triplexes,
fourplexes (buildings under one ownership with two, three, or four dwelling units, respectively, in
the same structure); apartments (five or more units under one ownership in a single building);
transitional housing; permanent supportive housing and single room occupancy housing where
people live as independently as possible with the assistance of social services tailored to each
person’s needs.
Single-Family Dwelling
The City defines single-family home as a building designed for and/or occupied exclusively by one
family. The definition also includes factory-built, modular housing units, constructed in compliance
Housing Element                                                                                 July 2014

Appendix A                                                                                     Page 105
with the Uniform Building Code (UBC), and mobile homes/manufactured housing units that
comply with the National Manufacturing Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974,
placed on permanent foundation systems. Transitional housing and supportive housing serving six
or fewer persons (see “Shared Living”) are considered single-family homes.
Shared living is defined in the LUC as an occupancy of a dwelling unit by persons of more than one
family in order to reduce housing expenses and provide social contact, mutual support, and
assistance. Shared living facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted in all residential
districts by CA Health and Safety Code §1566.3.
The City’s review process for second units is consistent with state law (AB 1866), allowing second
units by right in single-family residential areas in the City with only a ministerial review (Housing
Element Implementation Measure HE-13). However, in some cases design review is required for
an accessory structure (second dwelling unit) when the site is in a historic district or a
Neighborhood Conservation Area In addition, design review may be required if the accessory
structure is located in front of or is greater in height of the primary dwelling unit.
Emergency Shelters
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing with
minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less
by a homeless person.”
In effect since January 1, 2008, Senate Bill 2 (SB 2) requires the City to allow emergency shelters
without any discretionary action in at least one zone that is appropriate for permanent emergency
shelters (i.e., with commercial uses compatible with residential or light industrial zones in
transition), regardless of its demonstrated need. The goal of SB 2 was to ensure that local
governments are sharing the responsibility of providing opportunities for the development of
emergency shelters. To that end, the legislation also requires that the City demonstrate site
capacity in the zone identified to be appropriate for the development of emergency shelters.
Within the identified zone, only objective development and management standards may be
applied, given they are designed to encourage and facilitate the development of or conversion to
an emergency shelter.
The City’s Land Use Code (LUC) allows emergency shelters, and drop-in centers in the General
Commercial (CG), Industrial – Limited (IL) and Industrial – General (IG) with a Use Permit. The
Public Facilities (PF) zoning currently requires a Minor Use Permit for an emergency shelter or a
drop-in center.
A Use Permit (UP) or Minor Use Permit (MUP) provides a process for reviewing uses and activities
that may be appropriate in the applicable zoning district, but whose effects on site and
surroundings cannot be determined before being proposed for a specific site. The Planning
Commission has the authority to designate special conditions of use for the proposals requiring a
UP or MUP. If the project is exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), action on a MUP may be taken by the Zoning Administrator.

Per SB 2 requirements, in February 2009, the City created the Housing for Homeless (:HH)
combining zone. The :HH combining zone is a zone in which emergency shelters, transitional
housing, or supportive housing (hereafter “facility”) may locate as a permitted use, if the facility is
within the combining zone and meets the criteria in Section 9.42.200 of the LUC, Housing for
Homeless. If a facility locates outside the combining zone, or does not meet the criteria at Section
9.42.200 of the LUC, then the facility may require permits for the appropriate zoning district (see
Tables A-49 and A-50). See LUC §9.42.200 for the City’s standards, requirements, and capacity
for emergency shelters. These standards are considered to be similar to other residential uses in
the same zoning district.
The City received a grant for both CDBG and EHAP-CD funding, to assist in the development of a
40 bed transitional shelter proposed for APN 021-122-007, which is identified in the HH:
overlay. The project has received City approvals and some site improvements have been
completed. However, the City does not have the funds for the construction or operation of this
service. The City is partnering with the Arcata House Partnership to complete the project. The
City’s plan for an emergency shelter with bus in service only has been placed on hold due to
funding constraints and lack of services providers to oversee the operation of the facility. This
proposed 40 bed emergency shelter is also in the HH: overlay in the Aldergrove area.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
SB 2 requires that transitional and supportive housing types be treated as residential uses and
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zone.
Transitional housing is defined in Section 50675.2 of the Health and Safety Code as rental housing
for stays of at least six months but where the units are recirculated to another program recipient
after a set period. It may be designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to
permanent housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing and
multi-family units and may include supportive services to allow individuals to gain necessary life
skills in support of independent living.
Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing with
linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay and occupied by a target
population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income person with
mental disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose
disabilities originated before the age of 18). Services linked to supportive housing are usually
focused on retaining housing, living and working in the community, and/or health improvement.
Both transitional and supportive housing types must be explicitly permitted in the LUC. Currently,
the City defines both transitional and supportive housing types under the definition of single and
multi-family housing types (see single and multi-family housing above). The City supports
transitional and supportive housing projects through the Housing Element Implementation
Measure HE-31.

Extremely Low-Income Housing
Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the quantification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs of extremely low-income households. Elements must also identify zoning to
encourage and facilitate supportive housing and single-room occupancy units (SROs).
Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs including
but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or near-homelessness, persons with
substance abuse problems, and farmworkers. Single-room occupancy units are listed as an
allowed use under the definition of multi-family housing (see above) and are allowed in all the
same districts as multi-family housing. The City will continue to allow for the development of
single room occupancy units. The City Building Department adopted Building Code revisions to
reduce the size of dwelling units from 220 square feet to 150 square feet in an effort to provide
extremely low-income housing opportunities.
Persons with Disabilities
The City of Arcata incorporates the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act of 1964 as a part of its building requirements. These two statutes address the
fair housing practices adhered to by the City, which include practices against housing
discrimination toward persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental
disabilities. In compliance with SB 520, a complete evaluation of the City’s zoning laws,
practices, and policies was done as a part of the Housing Element update process. No
constraints to housing development for persons with disabilities, including persons with
developmental disabilities were found at that time.
To accommodate persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities
residential care facilities of six or fewer adults or children are allowed in the City’s residential
zones by right. In addition, residential care facilities with more than six adults or children are
permitted in all residential zoning districts in the City with a use permit and in all
commercial/industrial zones with a minor use permit. Further, mobile homes as an accessory
structure (dwelling) for persons in need of care and supervision are allowed in all zoning
designations. No special design or permitting standards have been established for residential
care facilities other than the required conditional use permits.
The use permits do not have any special provisions required for the development of a
residential care facility. The conditions for the use permit do not include requirements that
apply specifically for a residential care facility; conditions do not regulate the user and generally
deal with the size and intensity of the use, health, safety, and general welfare concerns, and
consistency with the General Plan. A public hearing must be held before the Zoning
Administrator or Planning Commission, depending on the zoning district. The City requires no
minimum distance between residential care facilities. The conditions of the use permit do not
result in additional costs to the residential care facility. The City does not have any occupancy
standards that apply specifically to unrelated adults.

Parking standards for housing for disabled persons, including persons with developmental
disabilities are the same as all residential development. No specific program has been designed
for the reduction of parking standards; however Measure HE- 25 requires the City to cooperate
with housing developers in the production of housing for disabled persons, including persons
with developmental disabilities. Through this cooperation, a reduction of parking standards
may be one incentive to promote housing development for disabled persons, including persons
with developmental disabilities.
The City has established a Handicapped Access Appeals Board to provide persons with
disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities an opportunity to request
exceptions to the City’s standards and specifications. The Board consists of five members of
which one is an expert on handicap access. In cases of practical difficulty, unnecessary hardship,
or extreme differences, exceptions to the City’s standards and specifications for development
may be requested to the Handicapped Access Appeals Board. The Board is used as a means to
review the decision of the Building Inspector on handicap access matters. At the applicant’s
request, the Appeals Board will review the Building Inspectors decision and has the power to
overturn the decision. There is no fee associated with the Handicapped Access Appeals Board.
In addition to the Handicap Access Appeals Board process, the City has developed and
formalized a general process that a person with disabilities, , will need to go through in order to
make a reasonable accommodation request in order to accommodate the needs of persons
with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities and streamline the permit
review process. The City will provide information to individuals with disabilities, including
persons with developmental disabilities regarding reasonable accommodation policies,
practices, and procedures based on the guidelines from the California Housing and Community
Development Department (HCD). This information will be available through postings and
pamphlets at the City and on the City’s website.
The City makes every effort to satisfy reasonable requests for accommodation. The City also
offers ADA retrofits through its Housing Rehabilitation Program. The City Hall which includes
the Community Development Department/Building Department is ADA compliant and the City
makes every effort to accommodate persons with disabilities, including persons with
developmental disabilities including providing access to public hearings and other services to
special needs populations. If any constraints are found the City will initiate actions to address
these constraints, including removing the constraints or providing reasonable accommodation
for housing intended for persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental
disabilities per SB 520 and Housing Element Implementation Measure HE-25. To further
comply with SB 520 the City defines family as “(1) two or more persons related by birth,
marriage, or adoption, (2) an individual or a group of persons living together who constitute a
bona fide single-family housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, not including a fraternity, sorority,
club, or other group of persons occupying a hotel, lodging house or institution of any kind”.
Although not adopted within the last planning cycle, the City will consider the adoption of
universal design standards incorporating ADA standards for all housing developments. The use

persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities. Currently, all City
funded or facilitated housing projects must include at least one dwelling that can accommodate
disabled residents, including persons with developmental disabilities.

Historic and Design Review. The City of Arcata requires design review by the Arcata Historic and
Design Review Commission for all multi-family residential new construction projects and
subdivisions. Generally, single-family dwelling projects are exempt from design review unless they
are located in one of the Neighborhood Conservation Areas, Specific Plan or Historic Districts or a
Coastal Scenic Area. Furthermore, design review is required if the project involves a historic

resource. The LUC identifies special design criteria for single-family developments located in
hillside areas. The purpose of Design Review is to ensure that the design of proposed development
and new land uses assists in maintaining and enhancing the natural beauty, historic, and rural
character of the community (see LUC §9.72.040 for the goals, purposes, and procedures).
 Generally Design Review is required for all new construction in the City, including all structural
modifications in exterior appearance, including paved areas, revegetation plans, and all other
exterior work and signs which require a permit from the City. However, the LUC includes
exemptions for single family and minor repairs when not located in one of the City’s Neighborhood
Conservation Areas (NCA). Design Review is required for all exterior alterations to a designated
Landmark Historic structure. In addition, design review could also be required for accessory
structure (secondary dwelling units) if located in front of or is greater in height than the primary
dwelling unit.
The applicant is required to submit a complete application for design review including a detailed
site plan; architectural elevations; floor plans; landscape plan; and other items such as
photographs of the site or neighborhood to assure compliance with design review criteria.
The Historic and Design Review Commission consists of a seven-person board with various
requirements and experience to serve on the Commission. Although the Commission has the
ability to disapprove a submitted design it is very rare for the Commission to outright deny a
project. However, the Commission may suggest or require changes, modifications, or alterations
to the design. The Design Review process typically takes approximately three to four weeks to
complete and is not considered a constraint to the development of housing in the City.
Solar Siting and Solar Access. The City’s Land Use Code includes solar siting and solar access
regulations for all future development in Arcata over which the City has discretionary review
authority. Multifamily developments, subdivisions, and Planned Developments are required to
follow these regulations. The Solar Siting and Solar Access section of the Code was established in
response to the requirements of Section 66473.1 of the California Subdivision Map Act. These
provisions are intended to permanently protect access to solar energy by requiring adequate
building orientation and placement on a lot. Proper building placement and orientation is
fundamental to fully utilize solar energy. The City’s Energy Committee assists the City and
applicant with recommendation to improve solar access. Furthermore, in compliance with CA Civil
Code §714 the City processes permits for photovoltaic systems without any discretionary review.
Natural Hazards Combining Zone. As a result of Arcata’s unique mix of geologic conditions, steep
slopes, weather, soils, and existing development, the City has established a variety of development
limitations in the interest of public safety. The Natural Hazards Combining Zone (:NH) has been
developed to regulate land use in areas of the City subject to natural hazards. This regulation is
intended to protect lives and property from destruction and damage and to protect the
community from the cost of damages which may be incurred when unstable or premature
development is allowed without consideration of the natural hazards. Natural hazards addressed
by the :NH combining zone are flooding, liquefaction, severe slope stability hazards, ground
shaking, and fault-rupture. The Arcata General Plan and Land Use Code both identify different

Appendix A                                                                                      Page 111
geologic hazards – earth-quake shaking; fault rupture; slope stability; and liquefaction hazards.
General Plan Figure PS-a “Hazards Map” shows locations of these hazards. General Plan (Table
PS-1) and Land Use Code (Table 6-1) are tables to identify geologic and soil report requirements
based on the types of land use activity and the related geologic hazard.
Earthquake Shaking and Fault Rupture Hazard Areas: Most notable of documented Earthquake
Fault Hazard areas is the Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone, a potentially active earthquake fault
zone. New development and substantial improvements to existing structures located in the
Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zone requires special geologic engineering reports to determine fault
locations and appropriate development limitations. Depending on the risks associated with a
particular land use activity, a geologic engineering report is required for properties that are
mapped with a potential active fault. The Land Use Code (LUC) specifies that no structure
intended for human occupancy shall be constructed over or within 50 feet of the trace of a known
fault. Many of the City’s geologic report requirements are based on the California Building Code
or the California Division of Mines and Geology special publications. The high cost of completing
the necessary reports may be considered prohibitive; however these reports are necessary for the
welfare of the City and its residents. The City’s former Redevelopment Agency had initiated a
grant program to assist in the geologic investigations, report development, and peer review
process to decrease the burden on development within the Special Study Zone. The City of Arcata
has adopted policies to assist in earthquake fault rupture report preparation and review for
projects located in the Redevelopment Area. However, the loss of the Redevelopment Agency has
eliminated this program.
Landslide Hazard Area: The City of Arcata contains a significant area of hilly terrain. Due to both
public safety, environmental, and aesthetic concerns, the City has strictly limited hillside
development. The LUC relies on the General Plan Figure PS-a “Hazards Map” to establish Hillside
Development standards for parcels that contain slopes greater than 15 percent. As a result of new
zoning requirements of the LUC, a significant portion of the City east of U.S. Highway 101 are
encumbered with Hillside Development Permit requirements due to the presence of slopes
greater than 15 percent. The Land Use Code specifies that no development shall occur on slopes
more than 25 percent and each new hillside lot shall contain a “contiguous buildable area of at
least 4,000 square feet, with a natural slope of 15 percent or less”. Existing lots that do not cannot
meet the 15% slope requirement above may develop a buildable area of 1,500 square feet if the
City determines there is no alternative building site.
Liquefaction Hazard Area: Portions of the City are in areas which are considered as having a
potential high and moderate liquefaction hazard. Most development in the :NH combining zone is
subject to reporting requirements and may require special construction techniques to develop the
property. As with the Earthquake Fault Hazard Areas, these reporting requirements may be
prohibitive but are considered necessary for the welfare of the City and its residents.
Special Flood Hazard Areas: The City of Arcata has several waterways that are managed in order to
reduce flood hazards. All developments located in Zone A as delineated on the Flood Insurance

Rate Map are subject to review procedures and certification requirements. The City administers
the flood hazard standards of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Arcata General Plan conservation and safety elements include policies to protect the public,
property, and flora and fauna from impacts associated with flooding and development. The Land
Use Code (LUC) development standards implement the conservation and safety policies of the
General Plan. All developments, including housing are reviewed for compliance with the
development standards. The City of Arcata Public Works Director is the designated Floodplain
Administrator and regularly reviews the City’s flood management development standards and
policies during development project review. In addition, the City regularly evaluates the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps in relationship to the Arcata General Plan
safety, conservation and housing policies. FEMA is currently updating the flood zone maps for the
City of Arcata. The revised flood zones maps are expected to be released in 2016.

Wetland Protection and Stream Protection Combining Zones. The Wetland Protection (:WP) and
Stream Protection (:SP) Combining Zones are used to identify and protect wetlands, streams,
tidelands, and their borders from destruction and degradation. These zones provide standards for
development that incorporate streams and wetlands into the site design for the development and
also seek to ensure that legally created lots in riparian and wetland areas contain a building site.
These combining zones require setbacks typically between 25 and 100 feet from streams and
wetlands; however, additional standards apply for projects located within the Coastal Zone. In
some areas with significant riparian vegetation the stream or wetland setback may be a maximum
of 250 feet. Permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses are allowed within the :WP and :SP
zones, using the same standards and conditions that would apply in the primary zone. Because of
Arcata’s natural characteristics a significant amount of the community has development
restrictions associated with wetlands and creek zones. As with all jurisdictions in California –
watercourse and wet areas are regulated by both Federal and State regulations. In some cases the
regulations or review authority are overlapping, and in some cases conflicting with one another.
The City through its General Plan recognizes the importance of protecting environmentally
sensitive habitat areas. Over the past several decades Arcata has successfully restored biological
systems to improve the quality of habitat as well as provide the community with open space.
Coastal Zone. Nearly all of the land to the west and southwest of the City, as well as a substantial
portion within city limits, is located in the California Coastal Zone. The Coastal Zone boundary and
jurisdiction map – “Post LCP (Local Coastal Program) Certification Permit and Appeal Jurisdiction”,
adopted in 1990, establishes the areas of the city within the California Coastal Zone and the permit
and appeal jurisdiction. As part of the General Plan and Land Use Code Updates, the City is in the
process of updating the Local Coastal Program. In some cases, the state retains the review
authority for coastal development; however, through the Local Coastal Program the state
authorizes some coastal development to be administered locally. Typically the jurisdiction
boundary (California vs. Arcata) is based on the sensitivity to coastal resource impacts. Through
Arcata’s LCP, some coastal development is exempt from coastal development permits. However,
in cases where a coastal development permit is required by either the State or City of Arcata, three
to six months may be added to the project timeline.
The City of Arcata has identified policies in its Local Coastal Program designed to protect the
coastal area. These policies address a variety of areas such as new urban development, public
access and recreation, water and marine resources, industrial development, hazards, agriculture,
and public works. The majority of these policies does not have an impact on housing and are
consistent with the General Plan Land Use Designations. Policy GM-4a Urban Services Boundary
does limit the housing in certain areas of the Coastal Zone. This policy stipulates “only the
Agriculture-Exclusive (A-E), Natural Resources (NR), and Public Facilities (PF) land use designations
shall be applied to areas outside the Urban Services Boundary and within the Coastal Zone.” This
policy limits the amount of residential development that could occur in Coastal Zone areas and
therefore may be considered a constraint to housing development. However, the majority of this
land is considered irreplaceable agricultural and natural resources land and should be reserved not
only for its productive value but also for the natural beauty and open space value it gives to the
Housing Element                                                                               July 2014

City. The Coastal Zone of the City is considered a very important element of the City and should be
protected as such from the encroachment of urban development and its inherent problems.
Article 10.7 Section 65590 of the California Government Code establishes minimum requirements
for housing within the Coastal Zone for low- or moderate-income households. Generally, the
statute requires that the “conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied
by persons and families of low and moderate income…shall not be authorized unless provision has
been made for the replacement of those dwelling units with units for persons and families of low
or moderate income.” The statute has certain location and time limits for the replacement of
housing to the affected persons or families. Also, according to the statute, “new housing
development constructed within a coastal zone shall, where feasible, provide housing units for
persons or families of low or moderate income.” However, the section has a number of exceptions
to the replacement rule: a residential structure with less than three units, the city coastal zone is
less than 50 acres in size, if the city has an in-lieu fee program in place for replacement housing,
etc. In addition, new development may provide affordable housing at another location within 3
miles of the Coastal Zone. This article may be considered a constraint to new housing as it may
raise the cost of this housing and discourage developers from constructing new housing in this
area. However, the City has no control over this statute, as it is a state code.
Housing Codes and Code Enforcement. The purpose of the building-related codes is to provide
minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property, and public welfare by regulating
and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, use and occupancy, location, and
maintenance of all buildings and structures in the City. Additional codes are designed to limit the
State’s consumption of resources and limit greenhouse gases.
According to the City Building Official, there are some recent changes in Building Code
requirements that will affect the cost of housing development. These new code requirements are
initiated at the State level so would be considered a constraint not unique to Arcata. The Green
Energy Code previously required specific standards on new residential construction to minimize
water and energy consumption. However, beginning in January 2014, the standards will also apply
to residential remodel and addition projects. For example, all the plumbing fixtures will have to be
replaced within an existing dwelling unit with certified fixtures to reduce water consumption if a
portion of the dwelling is remodeled or if there is an addition. This will apply to all residential units
completed before January 1, 1994. This may increase to initial cost of preserving housing.
Another Building Code change is that new residential dwelling units shall be equipped with
automatic fire sprinkler systems.
The codes used by the City of Arcata are mandated by the State of California and were adopted by
Ordinance 1438, January 2014. The City adopted local amendments to the building codes adopted
from Ordinance 1337 (November 2002) that have an effect on housing standards. Adopted codes
are as follows:
     •   2013 California Building Code
     •   2013 Uniform Administrative Code

     City residents.
Site Improvements. Arcata has on- and off-site improvement requirements for new residential
development based on the location and size of the development. Residential subdivision projects
are required to provide street, curb, sidewalk, driveway, and transition improvements to the
frontage of each lot. Typical street widths including curb and gutters are as follows: local streets
require 24 to 36 feet and collector streets require 24 to 48 feet in width. In the Planned
Development (:PD) Combining Zone, standards vary and are determined on a case-by-case basis.
Storm drainage and street lighting is required for subdivision development. Each residential
project is also required to connect to an approved sanitary system and domestic water supply and
to power.
Off-site improvements are required where necessary to allow for the proposed density of the
development. For instance, a proposed high density residential development at the end of a gravel
road would be required to upgrade to full street improvements along the access road. Typical off-
site improvements include street construction consisting of sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and sewer
and water line extensions.
Development Impact Fees and Processing Fees. Two aspects of local government have been
criticized as placing burdens on the private sector's ability to build affordable housing. These are
(1) the fees or other exactions required of developers to obtain project approval, and (2) the time
delays caused by the review and approval process. Critics contend that lengthy review periods
increase financial and carrying costs and that fees and exactions increase expenses. To maintain
acceptable investment rate of returns, these costs are in part passed onto the prospective
homebuyer in the form of higher purchase prices or rents.
A variety of development impact fees are often assessed on new residential projects that include
City-controlled fees (such as development application fees and building permit fees) and utility
service connection fees (e.g., sewer and water connection fees). The various planning review and
processing fees, development impact fees, and utility service connection fees collectively can add
significant costs on housing.

Development fees are a necessary City program and are in place to offset the cost of development
the City incurs as a result of new construction. These fees, as with development standards, must
be balanced with the production of housing. Table A-55 provides the proportion of estimated fee
cost to estimated overall development cost, Table A-56 provides a breakdown of all typical
residential fees for both a single and multi-family development and Table A-57 provides a list of all
City development fees.
 As of 2014, a single-family housing unit typically costs $8,502 in fees (making up 2.7%of the total
project cost) and multifamily units cost $4,351/unit in fees (making up 1.9% of the total project
cost). The fees are not considered to constrain development and many of these fees are reduced
or waived for affordable housing projects in order to assist the production of these units.

Development Permit and Approval Processing. The development review and permitting process is
utilized to receive, evaluate, and consider approval of new development applications. The
development review and permitting process ensures that new residential projects reflect the goals
and policies of the General Plan and meet the intent and requirements of the zoning code.
Applications vary depending on the permit being requested. In addition, some planning
applications require public hearings. Development permit approval processing in Arcata does not
create any unnecessary delays or increases to the cost of housing. The City recently set up a
database application, which is available at the front counter (and at each planner’s desktop) that
tracks, streamlines, and coordinates processes from initial application to file closure. The system is
designed to mechanize certain aspects of the process in an effort to increase efficiency and
shorten permit processing times. The database application also prepares status reports for each
project to ensure that projects aren’t falling through the cracks. This system is linked to the City’s
Housing Element                                                                               July 2014

PROCESSING AND PERMIT PROCEDURES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
     A. Where the land is zoned and subdivided for the type of development proposed, the
         typical application review time for residential development is summarized as follows:
             1. Single-Family Dwellings and Secondary Dwelling Units: 15 Days from filing a
                 completed application to issuance of a building permit.
                       EXCEPTIONS - Three months may be required to process projects within
                       Neighborhood Conservation Areas, for new construction on properties with
                       a designated historic landmark, or for City Jurisdiction Coastal
                       Development Permits.
             2. Duplexes and Multiple Family: Three months filing a completed application to
                 issuance of a building permit (the City contracts for the review of multifamily
                 projects, this adds several weeks to the review process).
             3. Mobile Home Park: Estimated three months from filing a completed application
                 to issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. The City has not process a Use Permit
                 for a Mobile Home Park in over 25 years.
     B. Where the land is zoned but not subdivided for the type of development proposed, the
         typical application review time for this discretionary process is summarized as follows:
             1. Minor Subdivision. Once a complete application is received by the Community
                 Development Department, the Zoning Administrator can usually process a minor
                 subdivision within a four-month time period. If there are unanticipated
                 modifications to the project by the applicant and/or a recommended review by
                 the Planning Commission, then the average processing time in Arcata will extend
                 to seven months.
             2. Major Subdivisions and/or Planned Developments. Once a complete application
                 is received by the Community Development Department, a major subdivision
                 and/or Planned Development can usually be processed within a seven-month
                 time period. The increase in time is attributed to the additional environmental
                 work that is required. If there are unanticipated modifications to the project by
                 the applicant, Planning Commission, or City Council, then the average processing
                 time in Arcata will extend to 12 months.

Page 122                                                                                  Appendix A
The costs associated with development project review will vary between projects. Arcata
utilizes an efficient and comprehensive approach toward development review and permitting
that allows for quick response to developer applications. Prior to application submittal the
applicant can request a Pre-Application meeting with City departments, utility providers and
federal or state regulators. This is a valuable service utilized to identify opportunities and
concerns regarding a proposal. The Pre-application service is free of charge. The City utilizes
many practices to expedite application processing, reduce costs, and clarify the process to
developers and homeowners. Increased development costs resulting from delays in the City’s
development review, public hearing, and permitting process are not considered a constraint on
housing development.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION
Energy-related costs could directly impact the affordability of housing in Arcata, particularly with
California in a midst of an energy crisis. Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth
mandatory energy standards for new development and requires the adoption of an “energy
budget.” Subsequently, the housing industry must meet these standards and the City is
responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. As noted earlier, the City Building
Department adopted the 2013 California Energy; Plumbing; Green Buildings Standard Codes that
are will ensure new development meets the latest standards for resource and energy
conservation.
The City adopted a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction Plan (GHG Plan) that set a 20% below 2000
GHG levels. The City’s municipal emissions were reduced by 30%, however the overall emission
for residential, commercial, and industrial users has not been reduced to target levels. The Cities
GHG Plan focuses on energy efficiency; renewable energy; sustainable transportation; waste and
consumption reduction; sequestration and other methods; and other cross-cutting approaches.
Arcata’s overall energy policy and program relies on the General Plan Resource Conservation, Land
Use Code Energy Conservation, and Solar Siting standards; the GHG Plan; the Energy Committee;
Green Fleet Policy; Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan; and the Anti-Idling Ordinance. As a part of
the City’s General Plan Environmental Quality and Management Element, policies have been
implemented to encourage the use of energy-efficient materials and appliances in home
construction. These programs and policies serve as informational resources for residents and
business owners interested in seeking ways to include energy efficiency practices in their daily

PG&E serves the electrical and gas needs in Arcata. PG&E offers energy savings assistance
programs for lower-income households to help these households to conserve energy and control
utility costs. These programs include California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) and Relief for
Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH). PG&E has a number of energy reduction tips
and information available such as home weatherization, energy saving tips, a residential energy
guide and more. All information is available through PG&E and on their web site at
http://www.pge.com.

The CARE program provides a 20 percent monthly discount on gas and electric rates to households
with qualified incomes, certain nonprofit organizations, homeless shelters, hospices, and other
qualified nonprofit group living facilities. For a household with 4 persons the gross annual income
cannot exceed $47,100 to qualify for the CARE program.
The REACH program, administered through the Salvation Army provides one-time energy
assistance to customers who have no other way to pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to
assist low-income households, particularly the elderly, disabled, including persons with
developmental disabilities, sick, working poor, and unemployed, who experience hardships and
are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.
In addition, the State Department of Health and Human Services funds the California Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP provides financial assistance to eligible low-
income persons to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling their housing unit. In addition, the
Weatherization Program and Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) also provide funding to
local government and nonprofit organizations to assist low income households.
Arcata is a member of the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), a joint powers authority
whose purpose is to develop and implement sustainable energy initiatives that reduce energy
demand, increase energy efficiency, and advance the use of clean, efficient and renewable
resources available in our region. RCEA provides the community with educational material,
products, and assistance to both the business and residential sectors for reducing energy and
resource consumption.

     •   Appreciate many amenities this community offers to older residents;
     •   Support the creation of affordable senior housing because there are more poor seniors in the
         future;
     •   Seniors want to age in place;
     •   Housing Element should keep the elderly in mind;
     •   Support HSU research on mapping the location of seniors and the related services/resources to
         improve those services;
     •   Support inclusionary zoning to avoid segregation of groups;
     •   Increasing number of seniors are becoming primary caregivers to grandchildren – need to
         ensure occupancy requirements (age restrictions) do not preclude a grandparent caring for a
         grandchild

SB 244 ANALYSIS
According to legislative findings in SB 244, hundreds of unincorporated communities in California lack
access to basic community infrastructure like sidewalks, safe drinking water, and adequate waste
processing. The purpose of SB 244 is to begin to address the complex legal, financial, and political
barriers that contribute to regional inequity and infrastructure deficits within disadvantaged
unincorporated communities. SB 244 requires LAFCos to identify disadvantaged unincorporated
communities in their Municipal Service Reviews (MSR). Local governments are required to identify
unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy communities inside or near their boundaries. Cities and
counties are not required to analyze or update their Land Use and Housing Elements as provided in SB
244 if: 1) the aforementioned communities are not present; or 2) if present, the communities are not
defined as disadvantaged communities based on the analysis of the data available through the U.S.
Census Bureau, Department of Finance, California Franchise Tax Board, or determined by LAFCo.
The City addressed SB244 during the 2014 Housing Element update. The analysis was based on
information included in the Humboldt County “Detail of Infrastructure and Service Needs of Legacy
Communities” included in its 2014 Housing Element update and the MSR of LAFCo. LAFCo has not
identified any disadvantaged unincorporated communities as the reviews have not been updated since
the SB 244 requirements were established. The County analysis, which is the most robust analysis to
date, does not identify the communities outlying the City of Arcata as being disadvantaged. As such, the
City of Arcata does not have evidence that such communities exist in or outlying its borders.

                                        NOISE ELEMENT
6.4     INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element is one of the seven required General Plan Elements that must be
prepared by California cities and counties (Government Code Section 65302). The
                                        California General Plan Guidelines state that the Noise
                                        Element of the General Plan provides a basis for
                                        comprehensive local programs to control and abate
                                        environmental noise and to protect citizens from excessive
                                        exposure. The Noise Element is required to identify and
                                        appraise noise in the community and follow the guidelines
                                        adopted by the Office of Noise Control in the State
                                        Department of Health Services. Local governments must
                                        analyze and quantify noise levels, and the extent of noise
                                        exposure, through actual measurements or the use of noise
                                        modeling.
The air into which noise is emitted, and on which it travels, is a common resource of the
community. It is a public good and as such its use, as well the responsibility of
maintaining it, belongs to everyone.
     THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES* FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS OF
                                           THE NOISE ELEMENT ARE:
   • To provide sufficient information concerning the community noise environment so that noise may be
       effectively considered in the land use planning process. In so doing, the necessary groundwork will
       have been developed so that a community noise ordinance may be utilized to resolve noise
       complaints.
   • To develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost-effective mitigating measures
       in combination with zoning, as appropriate, to avoid incompatible land uses.
   • To protect those existing regions of the planning area whose noise environments are deemed
       acceptable and also those locations throughout the community deemed "noise sensitive."
   • To utilize the definition of the community noise environment, in the form of CNEL or Ldn noise
       contours as provided in the Noise Element for local compliance with the State Noise Insulation
       Standards. These standards require specified levels of outdoor to indoor noise reduction for new
       multi-family residential constructions in areas where the outdoor noise exposure exceeds CNEL (or
       Ldn) 60 dB.
   (*Appendix A of the Guidelines)
Loud noise is a health issue. The human ear is not designed to accommodate loud noise
for long durations. Exposure to sounds louder than 90 decibels (e.g., a power lawnmower)
for more than one or two hours begins to damage the inner ear. Therefore, all people,
businesses, industry, and organizations have an obligation to respect the health and

comfort of others, and to acknowledge that the effects of broadcasted noise are not limited
to their own private property. In sharing the community’s common resources, everyone
has an obligation to respect the health of others in ways that are compatible with, and do
not detract from, other uses. Noise levels from sources commonly found in the community
are shown in Figure N-a.
     Definitions of noise, potential effects on people, and existing ordinances. Noise,
commonly defined as unwanted sound, is an environmental phenomenon to which people
are exposed throughout life. Noise is among the most pervasive pollutants, a waste product
generated primarily by human activities.
As urbanization and development have intensified globally, regionally, and locally in
Arcata, noise levels have also increased. Studies have shown that increased noise levels
have a direct adverse impact on the quality of home, work, and recreational environments.
In recognition of these adverse impacts, the Arcata City Council passed a Plaza Area Noise
Ordinance (City Ordinance #1249) prohibiting unnecessary, excessive, and annoying noise
from all sources. The Noise Ordinance states that excessive noise levels, offensive noise,
and unreasonably disturbing noise are detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety
and are contrary to the public interest. Detrimental noises interfere with: sleep,
communication, relaxation, and the full use of private property; use and enjoyment of the
Arcata Plaza by the general public; noise-sensitive land uses, particularly residential
apartments and lodging; and productive commerce. Detrimental noises contribute to
hearing impairment and a range of adverse physiological stress conditions and adversely
affect the value of real property.
It is the intent of the Noise Ordinance to protect the public health,
comfort, convenience, safety, welfare, prosperity, peace, and quiet by
reducing excessive noise levels and by prohibiting the generation of
offensive, or unreasonably disturbing, noise.
     Noise environment overview. Arcata has experienced change from its small, rural
town beginnings to a growing, urban community with more intensive and diverse uses.
Preservation of surrounding open spaces, and General Plan policies for more efficient land
uses, have promoted in-fill urban development which intersperses residential uses (noise
receptors) with commercial and industrial land uses (noise generators). The proximity of
noise generators to noise receptors such as higher volume vehicle travel on local roadways
has resulted in increased noise levels at receptor sites. Future development of commercial
and industrial uses will increase the potential for future noise conflicts.

Noise complaints received by the City also measure noise levels. The Arcata Police
Department has received increasing numbers of noise complaints over the last several
years. Police activity reports show 866 noise complaints in 1995; 951 in 1996; and 1,043
in 1997, which is a twenty percent increase. Some of the most frequent noise complaints
within the City of Arcata are associated with barking dogs, loud parties, boom boxes, car
stereos, existing industrial activities, and existing on-site commercial noise sources such as
outdoor speaker systems, street sweeping, and early morning garbage pickup. Some of
these noises are considered infractions, and are covered in the penal code. Others are
referred to other agencies, or determined to be unenforceable, and are not included in the
complaint records.
    Future noise environment overview.
Community noise levels can increase with
development. This is especially true for noise
along major roadways, such as State Routes 101
and 299. The projected future noise controls are
shown in Figure N-b. As development continues,
there is a growing potential for noise increases due
to commercial or industrial operations. It is now
recognized that noise pollution can often be reduced through attenuation measures such as
barriers, mufflers, and insulation, with little or no penalty to progress.

    Responsibilities of a Noise Element. The Noise Element advances the ethic that a low-
noise-level environment is a common resource that can be enjoyed by all, and that noise
generated by some has the potential to negatively affect others. The Noise Element
provides a mechanism for evaluating and mitigating the potential effects of noise on the
community. It identifies potential noise sources that exceed acceptable standards and noise
sources that may be considered annoying. It also provides criteria for determining
acceptable noise exposure. The California General Plan Guidelines state that the Noise
Element will be as detailed as necessary to describe the local situation and mitigate local
noise problems. This means that the City is not limited to applying noise controls and
noise reduction techniques to projects and other activities requiring City review and
permits, but can address other noise generating activities in the community.
The Noise Element sets policy direction for evaluating the potential effects of noise due to
new industrial processes or commercial noise sources. (Projected future noise contours are
shown on Figure N-b.) Many times, however, noise sources are overlooked during the
review process, or are added on-site at a later date. Once the project is approved, the
administrative actions for responding to complaints of these noise sources generally fall
outside of the City’s review process. In these cases a noise ordinance is required in order
to determine compliance with local standards or the potential for annoyance.
In the event of an individual being annoyed due to a neighbor’s barking dog or an existing
commercial activity, a noise ordinance would provide a complaint and enforcement
mechanism. These types of noises, however, are most effectively addressed through
educating community members about “good neighbor policies,” since dog ownership, or
existing commercial activities, are not subject to City review, and enforcement is usually
considered as a last resort. Complaint and enforcement mechanisms include:
        •   Ordinance 1249, for the Plaza Area only.
        •   Penal code 415 – Disturbing the Peace.
        •   Land Use and Development Guide regulations.
    City responsibilities. The City of Arcata can set an
example for business and industry by considering the
acoustic concerns and future noise impacts of City
operations and business. The City can lead the way by
demonstrating that ongoing operations and new noise-
producing uses and products can meet specified noise
criteria by making effective noise attenuation information
available, and by providing a procedure for mediating noise
disputes. The City can accomplish this by preferential
purchasing of quieter equipment; reducing use of noisy
equipment (as demonstrated by City Council action to eliminate the use of leaf blowers in
certain public areas); limiting hours of operation for public works projects (except for
emergencies) in residential areas; and incorporating acoustic materials and barriers in all

Public surveys on noise show that many people do not know how to effectively address
noise issues. Community members in general appear to lack knowledge of how to reduce
noise conflicts. There also seems to be a pattern of governmental agencies responding to
noise complaints with little or no enforcement or action against noise violations. This
pattern may be as typical of Arcata as other urban settings. To address this issue,
procedures and educational materials are being developed, including a noise control
manual.
    Community responsibilities. The quality of the soundscape is a growing environmental
concern and is an important aspect of the City’s livability. To increase pubic awareness of
achieving and maintaining a high quality soundscape, the community can draw on noise
attenuation techniques, such as those in the Noise Control Manual.
One of the most effective ways to contribute to the solution is to be a good neighbor. Most
importantly, this means taking responsibility for reducing noise at the source. Businesses
and industry can contain noise generating uses and activities within buildings, or construct
barriers so that noise does not reach adjacent areas. Residents should also consider how
the noise they generate could affect others and reduce the level accordingly. Motorists and
other vehicle operators should be conscientious of the potential for vehicle noise to disturb
others. Figure N-c shows noise control measures for all neighbors and neighborhoods.
    Guiding Principles and Goals.
    A. Reduce noise at the source.
    B. Protect City residents from the harmful and disturbing effects of noise through
        controls on noise-producing activities.
    C. Promote noise mitigation techniques in the design of both noise receptors and noise
        generators.
    D. Encourage state-of-the-art land use planning methodologies and acoustic control
        techniques (refer to City Noise Control Manual) to reduce existing and potential
        noise conflicts.
    E. Encourage cooperative and voluntary action by businesses and industry, to reduce
        noise emissions from annoying noise sources.
    F. Promote mediation as a means of reducing noise complaints which result from
        existing noise sources.
    G. Educate community residents about good neighbor policies, the benefits of reduced
        noise levels, and living in a community with a high quality soundscape.
    H. Bring all noise sources into compliance with noise guidelines by strongly
        encouraging voluntary compliance, pursuing funding for noise attenuation measures
        to mitigate any financial hardships, and through enforcement of a Noise Ordinance.

Page 6-30                                                                         Health and Safety
POLICY N-1 NOISE ATTENUATION
    Objective. Reduce, or eliminate, noise impacts at their source by providing enclosures,
barriers, and other on-site noise attenuation measures for noise generating activities.
Monitor noise levels to ensure that acceptable noise levels are maintained on adjacent
sites.
N-1a Noise attenuation measures. Noise attenuation measures, and stationary noise
        source controls shall include the use of barriers, setbacks, site design, baffles,
        enclosures, silencers, and improved facade construction techniques.
N-1b Noise attenuation guidelines. Noise attenuation measures and stationary noise
        source controls shall follow the guidelines provided in the technical document
        entitled: Noise Control Manual (which is considered an implementation measure).
N-1c Noise mitigation. Where noise mitigation measures are required, the emphasis of
        such measures shall be placed upon site planning and project design. The use of
        noise barriers shall be considered a means of achieving the noise standards only
        after all other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been
        integrated into the project.
N-1d Noise level reduction. To reduce existing, objectionable, industrial, and stationary
        noise levels at the source, the City shall work with local industries to incorporate
        noise control technology through building and site design and engineering
        solutions. The City shall make available current acoustical attenuation techniques
        (Noise Control Manual) for new and retrofitted industrial development.
N-1e Noise standards enforcement. Enforcement of noise standards shall be
        accomplished through development and implementation of a noise control
        ordinance, post-project compliance testing, and through the use of mediation.
N-1f    Mediation of noise conflicts. Where noise conflicts may occur, all affected parties
        shall strive to use innovative and positive solutions to solve those disputes,
        including the use of trained mediators. The City recognizes that many noise issues
        can be resolved before they get to the complaint stage if there is a procedure for
        airing the issue with an impartial third party.
N-1g Resolution of noise disputes. The City shall establish positive ways to discuss and
        resolve noise issues and disputes, including the use of trained mediators.
POLICY N-2 STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES AND LEVELS
    Objective. Establish acceptable noise levels for land uses and activities that will protect
community residents from the harmful effects of excessive noise exposure from stationary

noise generators. Maintain interior and exterior noise standards that will achieve land use
compatibility with respect to community noise.
N-2a Noise contour maps. The noise contour map (Figure N-b) and other estimates of
        noise source levels shall be used in conjunction with the noise source criteria to
        evaluate the feasibility of a proposed project.
N-2b New development of noise-sensitive uses. New noise receptors shall not be
        allowed where the noise level from non-transportation noise generators will exceed
        noise level standards (Table N-1), unless effective noise mitigation measures that
        meet City standards are incorporated.
N-2c Noise created by new or proposed stationary noise sources. Noise created by new
        or proposed stationary noise sources, or the expansion or alteration of an existing
        use, shall be mitigated so as not to exceed noise level standards (Table N-1) at
        noise-sensitive land uses. All noise generators not in compliance with these
        standards will be encouraged to mitigate impacts.
N-2d Acceptable noise levels. New construction and retrofits at existing buildings shall
        include appropriate insulation, glazing, and other sound attenuation measures so
        that they comply with standards contained in Table N-1. These standards are
        intended to set levels for external noise sources that could potentially impact a new
        dwelling or other noise-sensitive use.

1.      The City can impose noise level standards which are up to 5 dB less than those specified above
        based upon determination of existing low ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the project site.
2.      These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with
        industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings).
3.      The standards will be applied at the outdoor activity areas of the receiving land use, and at the
        building facade for upper floor receivers which do not have an outdoor activity area facing the noise
        source. Where no outdoor activity area is identified, the City has the option to apply only the
        interior noise level performance standards.

POLICY N-3 TRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES AND LEVELS
         Objective. Establish acceptable noise levels, for land uses and activities, that will
protect community residents from the harmful effects of excessive noise exposure due to
transportation noise sources. Maintain interior and exterior noise standards that will
achieve land use compatibility with respect to community noise.
N-3a New development of noise-sensitive land uses. New development of noise
         receptors will not be permitted in areas exposed to existing or projected levels of
         transportation noise exceeding levels specified in Table N-2, unless exterior noise or
         noise levels in interior spaces can be reduced to meet City Standards (Table N-2).
N-3b Transportation noise. Transportation noise sources shall be periodically measured,
         and significant increases mitigated, so as not to exceed the levels specified in Table
         N-2 for outdoor activity areas or interior spaces of existing receptors.

 1. Where the location of outdoor activity areas is unknown, the exterior noise level standard shall be
      applied to the property line of the receiving land use.
 2. As determined for a typical worst-case hour during periods of use.
 3. Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn/CNEL or less using a
      practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65
      dB Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been
      implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
 4. In the case of hotel/motel facilities or other transient lodging, outdoor activity areas such as pool areas
      may not be included in the project design. In these cases, only the interior noise level criterion will
      apply.
N-3c Roadway projects. To minimize noise impacts, the following criteria may be used
         as a test of significance for roadway projects:
         1. Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity
Noise Element                                Amended October 2008                       Arcata General Plan: 2020

            areas of noise receptors, a +5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to a roadway
            improvement project will be considered significant.
        2. Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn at the
            outdoor activity areas of noise receptors, a +3 dB Ldn increase in noise levels
            due to a roadway improvement project will be considered significant.
        3. Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor
            activity areas of noise receptors, a + 1.5 dB Ldn increase in noise levels due to a
            roadway improvement project will be considered significant.
POLICY N-4 ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
    Objective. Establish a consistent procedure and framework for conducting and
reviewing acoustical analyses.
N-4a Noise-sensitive land uses. Where receptor land uses are potentially exposed to
        existing or projected exterior noise levels exceeding the levels specified in Table
        N-2 or the performance standards of Table N-1, an acoustical analysis shall be
        required as part of the environmental review process, so that noise mitigation may
        be included in the project design. An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the
        Noise Element shall:
        1. Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
        2. Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental
            noise assessment and architectural acoustics.
        3. Include noise level measurements, with sufficient sampling periods and
            locations, to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise
            sources.
        4. Estimate existing and projected cumulative (twenty years) noise levels in terms of
            Ldn or CNEL and/or the standards of Table NI, and compare those levels to the
            adopted policies of the Noise Element.
        5. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted
            policies and standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site
            planning and design over mitigation measures which require the construction of
            noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which contain noise-
            sensitive land uses.
        6. Estimate noise exposure after prescribed mitigation measures are implemented.
        7. Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the
            effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.

POLICY N-5 INTRUSIVE AND INTERMITTENT NOISE SOURCES
    Objective. Protect community residents from the effects of excessive, intrusive, and
intermittent noise. Set standards for intrusive and intermittent noise sources for both
daytime and nighttime periods. Intrusive noise sources have a qualitative aspect that can
be annoying. These sources may contain a tonal component which is absent from the
existing general background noise. They may also be rhythmic, reoccurring or impulsive
in nature, or comprised mainly of music or speech. Intrusive noise can result in annoyance
or interference with sleep. These types of noise sources can include, but are not limited to,
industrial processes, warning horns, backup alarms, and pressure release devices.
N-5a Intrusive noise. When intrusive noise sources have been identified, the detrimental
        effects (sleep interference or the potential for annoyance) shall be disclosed to
        neighboring receptor properties.
N-5b Noise levels due to non-transportation sources. Noise levels due to non-
        transportation sources which may be intermittent or recurring, impulsive noises,
        pure tones, or noises consisting primarily of speech or music, shall be subject to the
        criteria contained within Table N-1, with a -5 dB penalty applied to the criteria.
N-5c Rhythmic, reoccurring, or impulsive noise sources. When noise sources have been
        identified to be rhythmic, reoccurring, or impulsive in nature or comprised mainly
        of music or speech, they may comply with applicable noise level criteria and still be
        annoying to individuals. When these types of noise sources have been identified,
        they may be subject to additional mitigation or mediation.
N-5d Construction site tool or equipment noise. The following shall apply to
        construction noise from tools and equipment:
        1. The operation of tools or equipment used in construction, drilling, repair,
            alteration or demolition shall be limited to between the hours of 8 A.M. and 7
            P.M. Monday through Friday, and between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Saturdays.
        2. No heavy equipment related construction activities shall be allowed on Sundays
            or holidays.
        This shall apply to construction noise from tools and equipment which are subject
        to the review of the City, and which may affect receptor uses. This policy shall not
        apply to emergency work of public service utilities or by variance under a noise
        ordinance.
N-5e Stationary and construction equipment noise. All stationary and construction
        equipment shall be maintained in good working order, and fitted with factory
        approved muffler systems.

                              OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
4.1     INTRODUCTION
    Overview of Arcata's Open Space Resources. Arcata’s open spaces take many forms
and serve a variety of functions. Open space areas represent a significant and desirable
component of the community’s character and maintain natural, recreational, and visual
resources for future community use and enjoyment. Open space is valuable for both
passive and active uses. Designating or otherwise protecting lands as open space provides
for: protection of natural habitats and species; managed production of natural resources
such as agricultural and forest products; recreational uses; coastal access; scenic, aesthetic
resources; and avoidance of development on such areas as steep slopes, faults, and flood
zones that are potentially hazardous to the community. Open space is also valuable for
preserving scenic views and other aesthetic considerations. The overall system is also
enhanced when open space lands are linked by natural biological corridors, greenways,
easements, and other types of connections. Open space categories are described in more
detail below, and mapped on Figure OS-a located in the map pocket at the end of this
chapter.
    Open Space for the maintenance and enhancement of natural resources protects plant
and animal habitat, especially in areas where rare, endangered, or threatened species exist.
 Arcata’s creek watersheds and watercourses, McDaniel, Gannon, Butcher and Mad River
sloughs, Arcata and Aldergrove Marshes, wetlands, baylands and tidelands, and ecological
and scientific study areas, may also be included in this category.
    Open space for the managed production of resources includes forest lands on the west
slopes of Fickle Hill, agricultural lands in the Arcata Bottom and Bayside areas, aquaculture
areas in Arcata Bay, and the aggregate deposits along the Mad River. These areas are
important for their production of food, wood, and mineral products, as well as for
maintaining water quality and other ecological functions.
    Open space for outdoor recreation
includes City parks and ballfields, such
as Redwood Park and the Community
Center; cultural and special use areas
such as the Arcata Ball field, Skate park,
and Plaza; neighborhood parks such as
 Sunny Brae and Stewart Parks; and
natural areas such as the Arcata Marsh
and Shay Park.

    Open space for public health and safety includes earthquake fault zones, liquefaction
areas, steeply sloped hillsides, and 100-year floodplains.
In many cases, open space can provide multiple benefits.
Agricultural lands in the Arcata Bottom and forested lands on the
western slopes of Fickle Hill are important for their natural and
resource production capabilities. These lands also retain natural
drainage systems, sustain natural habitats, enhance the
community’s viewshed and provide an aesthetic resource.
Designating these and other open spaces in the General Plan
documents their value to the community. It also allows City decision-makers to identify
open space as an important resource when considering proposed changes in community
form.
Within the city and surrounding Planning Area, natural resource lands that are part of the
open space system include: ocean beach; sand dunes; back-dune woodlands; Arcata Bay;
Mad River; Mad River Slough; and buffer strips along the
Mad River, and Jacoby, Jolly Giant, Janes, Sunset,
Grotzman, Beith, and Campbell Creeks.                          General Plan Parks and Recreation

OS-1c    Relationship to Resource Conservation and Management and Public Safety
         Elements. This element identifies hazard areas that shall be maintained as open
         space for the benefit of the community. The policies of this element and policies
         found in the Public Safety Element provide common direction for the designation
         and avoidance of hazard areas. The natural open space features of these areas,
         such as vegetation, shall be retained, except where they contribute to instability or
         increase hazards.
OS-1d    Linkages between open space areas. Linkage of open space lands, especially
         along biological corridors and greenways, is important for animal migration, non-
         motorized vehicle transportation, and community recreation, and shall be
         encouraged. Trails along levees or adjacent to railroad tracks and street rights-of-
         way can serve as links to parks, open space, and natural areas. Easements shall
         also be considered as a lower cost alternative to preserving links between open
         space.
OS-1e    Appropriate uses and development limitations within open space lands. Certain
         open space areas contain wetlands and other critical habitat, and must be
         preserved in a natural condition and enhanced. Other areas can accommodate
         managed activities such as mining and timber harvesting, subject to sustainable
         yield policies RC-6 and RC-8 in the Resource Conservation & Management
         Element, while other areas shall be designated for interpretive and recreational
         use. Each designated open space area of the City shall be evaluated by the
         appropriate City advisory board (e.g., Creeks & Wetlands Committee) to
         determine the resources present, the acceptable level of use, and appropriate
         preservation. The management of, and development in, open space areas are
         subject to applicable policies of the Resource Conservation and Management and
         Land Use Elements.
OS-1f    Designation of lands with scenic, aesthetic,
         historic, and cultural value. The City has
         scenic routes, including State Route 101 and
         Samoa Boulevard; vistas, including the forested
         slopes of Fickle Hill and the Arcata Bottoms;
         and areas of historic and cultural value, such as
         the Plaza. The open and natural characteristics
         of these areas shall be maintained. Policies for
         retaining scenic vistas and landscape features
         are included in the Community Design

       PUBLIC FACILITIES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
2.10     INTRODUCTION
    Overview of Arcata's Water Supply and Delivery System. Community water systems
divert free-flowing and subsurface
water sources for domestic use. The
City of Arcata recognizes that water
and other natural resources are vital
to the community, but also must be
conserved. The City provides
economic incentives and
educational materials for water
conservation, and also integrates
water reclamation and wastewater
treatment at the Arcata Marsh and
Wildlife Sanctuary.
The City of Arcata uses a system of trunk lines and mains, above ground water tanks, and
booster pumps to deliver domestic water to residents, businesses, industry, and other
facilities within the City’s Urban Services Boundary. The City water supply, drawn from
wells located in the bed of the Mad River, is provided by the Humboldt Bay Water District
which pumps, treats, and sells the water to the City. The City’s Urban Water Management
Plan defines water sources, conservation measures, usage, projections and shortage
contingencies. In addition to the existing Mad River water source, the Management Plan
also identifies a moderately deep groundwater aquifer in the north Arcata area as an
additional water source. The City’s Water Master Plan addresses the function and capacity
of the water system, including equipment efficiency and life expectancy, water storage,
pumping, storage, and fire flows.
    Overview of Arcata's Stormwater and Wastewater Collection and Treatment Systems.
                                 Arcata’s best known public facility is the Arcata Marsh and
                                 Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS) where municipal wastewater is
                                 treated and re-used for wetlands, ponds, and related
                                 wildlife habitat. The AMWS complies with California State
                                 Water Quality Board and California Coastal Zone Wetlands
                                 Enhancement Program policies and standards. But more
                                 importantly, the AMWS employs natural systems to
                                 successfully treat and reuse wastewater that most other

natural organisms filter the water before it is released into Arcata Bay. The resulting
nutrient-laden water and habitat attracts more than 200 species of birds, as well as other
species. The City has a Wastewater Treatment Plant Master Plan to guide plant operations.
The City also manages a stormwater drainage system, and has a Drainage Master Plan to
guide management practices. The Plan includes a hydrological analysis, drainage
management alternatives, a capital improvement program, needs-assessment and financial
summary, and a recommended operational plan. The Plan’s objectives are: to identify and
quantify the existing stormwater and drainage system, including channels, wetlands,
creeks, culverts and pipes; to determine the available capacity of the system; and to
identify design, maintenance, and repair alternatives to improve the capability of the
system.
DRAINAGE MASTER PLAN MANAGEMENT GOALS
• Minimize increases in the volume and the flow of stormwater runoff associated with new development
    so as to minimize an increase in the hazards and the costs associated with flooding.
• Minimize the erosion potential from a development or construction site so as to prevent deposition of
    sediment into streams and other receiving water bodies.
• Maintain the integrity of stream hydrology by preventing stream channel erosion so as to sustain the
    hydrologic functions of streams.
• Reduce the pollutant load in stormwater runoff from developing and urbanizing areas so as to preserve
    the natural biological functions of streams and other receiving water bodies (and flood management and
    stream habitat quality)
• To the extent practical, acquire easements and properties necessary for effective drainage management.
    Overview of Arcata's Educational and Public Facilities. The educational opportunities
available in Arcata include public and private schools for kindergarten through twelfth
grades, vocational training programs, and Humboldt State University. These facilities have
been integrated into the community and represent an important facet of Arcata’s identity as
a place to live, work, and learn.
There are three public school districts (Pacific Union, Arcata, and Jacoby Creek Elementary
School Districts) and several private schools that provide kindergarten through eighth grade
education. High school education is provided by the Northern Humboldt Union High
School District, which also serves the community of McKinleyville to the north. The
College of the Redwoods Community College, located approximately fifteen miles south of
Arcata, offers occupational, transfer and Associate degree programs.
Humboldt State University, the northernmost of California State University’s system of
twenty campuses, offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in more than fifty subject
areas. The University also offers cultural activities, music, art, theater and athletic events
that are open to the community. The University’s Master Plan includes a maximum
enrollment limit of 8,500 full time equivalent students.

Public facilities offer locations for community interaction and events, ranging from
community-wide celebrations to group meetings,
instructional classes, and weddings. The City has
enclosed spaces such as the Community Pool,
Community Center, City Hall, schools, and places of            Arcata
worship. The City also has twenty-four separate parks          Community
including Redwood Park, the Marsh and its interpretive Pool
center and the Arcata Ballpark. Collectively, they
provide gathering places for all manner of social,
cultural, political, recreational, religious, educational, and entertainment events. Their
physical form and design are also important in representing recognizable features that
strengthen community identity. Arcatans have come to recognize that their public facilities
are important components of community character.
    Overview of Arcata's integrated waste management program. Arcata residents have a
long-standing tradition of active commitment to resource conservation. Being far from the
production centers of consumer goods, local native peoples and the City’s early settlers
were resourceful and “made do” with what they had. The civic and church-led drives for
scrap metal and newspapers during WWI and WWII, and the youth and volunteer drives of
the 1950 and 1960 set the stage for the citizen recycling activism following Earth Day
1970.
Since 1990, the City’s role in source reduction, recycling and composting components of
integrated waste management has shifted from facilitative to managing
contracts for collection and processing of recyclable materials,
composting organic debris from the City’s operations, and direct
performance of public education responsibilities. In 1989, the State of
California passed Assembly Bill 939, requiring every city and county in
the State to develop an integrated waste management planning
document called a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE).
AB939 and its accompanying regulations specify the content for the
City’s SRRE and require that the SERE provide a detailed plan for achieving “landfill
diversion” goals of 25% by 1995, and 50% by 2000. The plan includes a “Waste
Generation Study,” (WGS) which reports the composition and quantity of solid waste
disposed and diverted from disposal by Arcata. It is from this study, and its baseline
projections of solid waste generation, that the City of Arcata is accountable for 25% and
50% diversion targets.
Prior to AB939, municipal solid waste management focused on collection and landfilling.
With the passage and implementation of AB939, California cities and counties are required
to adopt the "Integrated Waste Management Hierarchy". Emphasizing the “highest and
best use” of secondary resources, the IWM Hierarchy establishes the following priority
order for dealing with discarded materials:

4. Landfill Disposal.
The City of Arcata has been in the forefront of recycling and has the oldest community-
owned recycling center in the State. The Arcata Source Reduction and Recycling Element
has eight main components are:
1. The Source Reduction Component identifies programs to be implemented by the City
    to reduce the quantity of waste generated.
2. The Recycling Component defines programs to be implemented to increase the type
    and quantity of materials recycled.
3. The Composting Component identifies programs to be implemented to increase the
    composting of organic wastes.
4. The Special Waste Component identifies wastes requiring special handling and
    disposal, and programs to manage special wastes which cannot be handled at current
    or future permitted disposal facilities.
5. The Education and Public Information Component describes educational and
    informational programs to be implemented to educate and increase public participation
    in the adopted Source Reduction and Recycling Element’s programs.
6. The Disposal Facility Capacity Component identifies disposal capacity needed to meet
    the community’s needs for fifteen years.
7. The Funding Component identifies costs and funding for the City’s Source Reduction
    and Recycling Element plan implementation and how the City will fund those
    programs.
8. The Integration Component demonstrates that the programs to be implemented are
    sufficient to achieve a 25% diversion rate by 1995 and a 50% rate by the year 2000.
(Note: The Arcata Source Reduction and Recycling Element is not part of the General Plan.)
Each of these components includes the following integrated waste management goals:
   ARCATA INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT GOALS:
   1. Reduce the quantity of waste generated.
   2. Educate Arcata residents to reduce, re-use, repair, compost, and recycle.
   3. Maximize public involvement.
   4. Minimize negative environmental impacts of solid waste management.
   5. Increase economic incentives for source reduction, re-use, repair, composting, and recycling.
   6. Improve measurement and standardize accounting of source reduction, re-use, composting,
       recycling, waste hauling, and disposal activities to increase knowledge and create a database for
       long term use.
   7. Integrate source reduction, re-use, repair, composting, and recycling programs into all City activities.

        are funds available to compensate the University.
POLICY PF-3 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
    Objective. Implement the City’s drainage
master plan to utilize natural drainage systems;
minimize increases in stormwater runoff,
flooding, and erosion; maintain the integrity of
stream hydrology; reduce pollutant loads; and
acquire easements and properties for effective
drainage management.
PF-3a Utilization of City streams and
        watercourses as natural drainage
       systems. Arcata’s network of creeks provide a natural drainage system, however,
        they are very susceptible to damage from urban pollutants carried by runoff, and
        from drainage facilities that alter creek flows and natural functions. The City shall
        utilize creeks for urban drainage only when the basic natural functions will not be
        degraded.
PF-3b Control of stormwater runoff, flooding, and erosion. Stormwater runoff, especially
        at peak flows, can cause significant flooding and erosion if adequate precautions
        have not been taken. As stated in the Drainage Master Plan, the City shall manage
        the storm and surface water system in Arcata to maintain a hydrologic balance in
        order to protect water quality, prevent property damage, provide for the safety and
        enjoyment of citizens, and preserve and enhance habitat and sensitive areas.
PF-3c Stormwater quality. Enforce surface water controls, facilities such as detention
        basins and natural infiltration areas, and education programs to protect surface and
        ground-water quality.
PF-3d City drainage system. The City shall take a comprehensive approach to drainage
        system management in order to effectively control the quantity of stormwater runoff,
         assure water quality, and reduce potential flood damage from peak flows. As stated
        in the City Drainage Master Plan, the City shall gradually expand the City managed

        1. Continue maintenance of all drainage facilities within public right-of-way,
            regardless of size.
        2. Extend responsibility onto private property only when permanent easements are
            dedicated or otherwise available from the private property owner, and need is
            established based on technical criteria.
        3. Define service limits upstream of the City as the point at which runoff from a
            publicly (not county) dedicated street enters the drainage system, or when a
            drainage feature needs repairs/improvements which have public benefits that
            exceed the cost of said repairs/improvements.
PF-3e Easements and properties for drainage management. The City shall secure the
        easements and properties necessary to complete and maintain the
        drainage system identified in the Drainage Master Plan.

projected future population of the City, and coordinate with local school
(public and private) districts, Humboldt State University, and other
education providers to maintain and improve educational facilities and
services, while preserving established community/student ratios.
PF-4a Coordination with Arcata, Pacific Union, and Jacoby Creek school districts. The
        City shall provide demographic information to assist the School Districts in
        projecting future student enrollments. The City shall encourage the school districts
        to expand existing schools rather than designating new sites for this purpose.
PF-4b Coordination with private and specialized education providers. The City shall
        accommodate providers of private, vocational, and specialized education that fills
        an identified community need, when they desire to locate in
        the City.
PF-4c Coordination and development review with Humboldt
        State University. The City shall designate at least one
        member of the City Council and one Planning Commission
        member as liaisons to Humboldt State University and
        request that the designated Council member be appointed to
        the University President’s Advisory Council.
PF-4d Joint use of school facilities for community events and
        recreation. School facilities are primary locations for neighborhood level events
        and recreational activities. The City, school districts, and community organizations
        shall develop and maintain partnerships for the joint use of school facilities.

        use, and that it is set back and screened to reduce visual and safety impacts. Any
        proposed city construction projects involving trenching shall be reviewed for
        opportunities to extend high speed networking infrastructure.
PF-5e Maintenance of City streets and right-of-ways. The City's streets and right-of-ways
        shall be adequately maintained for public use. Utilities within rights-of-way shall be
        placed underground, when feasible, to reduce obstructions such as poles and
        above-grade utility boxes on sidewalks. Pavement and landscape management
        programs shall be periodically reviewed and prioritized.
POLICY PF-6 INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT
    Objective. Reduce solid waste generation at the source; maximize re-use and repair of
appropriate items and material; promote composting and recycling; and properly transport
non-recyclable solid waste to approved disposal sites.
PF-6a Source reduction. Source reduction and materials re-use are the most cost effective
        ways to minimize solid waste. Source reduction, or waste prevention, reduces the
        growing costs of collection, recycling, and disposal systems. Source reduction and
        re-use shall be promoted through educational programs and incentives. Examples
        of effective source reduction and re-use activities that shall be promoted are:
        1. Backyard composting, landscaping with low water needs, and grass mulching.
        2. Purchasing durable re-usable goods instead of disposable items (e.g., cloth
              diapers, rechargeable batteries).
        3. Repairing equipment and appliances.
        4. Purchasing goods from second-hand stores, flea-markets and swap meets.
        5. Reducing the use of packaging by buying in bulk or purchasing fresh food at
              farmers markets.
        6. Electronic mail and forms, double-sided copying and re-use of scrap paper.
        7. Reusable coffee cups and beverages provided in dispensers.
        8. Termination of unwanted mail.
        9. Incentives such as on-call garbage collection and differential solid waste fees
              shall be used to encourage source reduction.
        The Source Reduction and Recycling Element shall be updated every five years and
        shall incorporate the most efficient and cost-effective source reduction programs.
PF-6b Recycling. The City’s recycling program shall continue and expand, unless a more
        efficient and cost-effective method of collecting and reusing materials is identified.
        The City shall continue to contract for recycling, collection, and processing, in order

        to help meet and exceed the State diversion goal. The following programs shall also
        be promoted:
        1. Collection of commercial corrugated cardboard.
        2. Collection of office paper.
        3. City procurement policies and practices favoring reusable and recycled
            products.
        4. Implementation of density bonuses for buildings designed to promote recycling.
        5. The City’s active involvement in the Humboldt County Recycling Market
            Development Zone.
        6. Educate the public to “close the loop” and buy locally-made products with
            recycled content.
        7. Recycling education that includes self-haul services for recyclable materials not
            collected curbside.
        8. Encourage the development and expansion of recycling-based manufacturing.
        After the year 2000, in order to minimize increases in solid waste volumes and
        maximize the amount of material returned to productive use, the City shall continue
        these programs with a target of reducing landfill volumes 10% every five years.
PF-6c Collection, transport and disposal of non-recyclable solid waste. The City shall
        continue to contract for solid waste collection, transport, and disposal. Solid waste
        collected for disposal shall be transported to an approved landfill, or other approved
        solid waste processing or disposal facility. The City will provide education
        materials about proper use and disposal of household hazardous waste, non-toxic
        alternatives to household hazardous waste, and recycling of materials (e.g., motor
        oil, anti-freeze, paint, batteries) in conjunction with recycling centers and local
        businesses.
