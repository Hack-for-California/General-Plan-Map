Planning for the Future
The Rialto General Plan does three things:
     1. It provides a snapshot of the Rialto of today (2010).
     2. It outlines a vision of what Rialto will be tomorrow through our
         Guiding Principles.
     3. It defines the steps to get from today to tomorrow.
The General Plan is a long-range planning document that puts forward a
path for realizing the community’s vision through specific goals and
policies. The Plan provides the City a framework for action and the
direction for the physical development of the community over the next 20
to 30 years. This General Plan planning horizon is the year 2040.
The Rialto of Today (2010)
Rialto is located in western San Bernardino Valley. The City shares its
boundaries with the cities of Fontana and Colton, and unincorporated
Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The City is four miles wide and eight
and one-half miles long. In 2008, the population was 98,700.
Our Vision for the Future
Based on community input gathered during the General Plan update
process, residents, business owners, and elected officials defined a vision of
Rialto that is articulated in the following Guiding Principles.

and Community Values                                  Valores de la Comunidad del Plan

Purpose of the General Plan
In 1937, the State of California began to require all cities and counties to
adopt a master plan and to update it regularly. By 1965, the name had been
changed to the “General Plan.” A major change occurred in 1971, when
the State passed the “consistency law” and put the General Plan at the top
of the legal hierarchy of land use law. Since 1971, all specific plans, the
zoning ordinance, and every other land use regulation have had to be
consistent with the General Plan. In fact, the various chapters of the Plan
have to be consistent with one another. The General Plan is the policy
document from which all local land use decisions must be derived.
Many of the specific ways to achieve the goals and policies in the General
Plan are spelled out in other policy and regulatory documents. While the
General Plan can be updated up to four times per year, the Plan must – and
should – provide clear direction to City leaders regarding land use and
related decisions affecting growth and development.

A How-to Guide: Using the General Plan
The Rialto General Plan is designed to be easy to use. The text focuses on
the future, with clear statements of purpose and vision. Graphics and
photographs are used to illustrate the City’s ideas and ideals. The General
Plan has been created for specific users, including:
       Rialto residents;
       Decision makers such as City staff, City Council members, and
        commissioners;
       The business community; and
       Developers and property owners who plan on building in the City.
The following describes how the General Plan can be used.
Rialto residents can use the General Plan to:
       Verify the types of land uses around their home
       Understand the benefits from potential new development within the
        community
       Determine how the goals and policies in the Plan may affect their
        quality of life
       Learn about the City’s plans to improve transportation facilities,
        infrastructure, parks, schools, police, fire, and other community
        facilities and services, and to protect residents from the risk of
        natural and human-made hazards
Rialto decision makers can use the General Plan to:
       Carry out the community’s vision for established neighborhoods in
        the City, as well as for new development
       Establish ways for meeting the needs of Rialto residents for
        community services and facilities
       Identify goals and policies to help guide their decisions regarding
        budgeting, community facilities and services, new and existing
        development, and infrastructure in Rialto
                                                                            Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Rialto businesses can use the General Plan to:
       Follow the City’s direction to protect economic investments and
        encourage future business success
       Determine the different businesses Rialto intends to attract and
        retain that will provide goods, services, and jobs the community
        desires
       Know policies that can require business operations to be
        compatible with other businesses and residential areas
Land owners and developers can use the General Plan to:
       Understand the level of quality development and urban design that
        is demanded by the City
       Determine the land use type and level of density and intensity that
        can be built on a particular property, as well as the services and
        facilities that will be needed to serve new development
       Understand the conditions and measures aimed at protecting
        established residential uses, existing community facilities and
        services, and the environment, including natural resources
General Plan Organization
To meet State requirements, respond to Rialto’s needs, and provide an easy-
to-read document, the General Plan is organized into eight chapters. These
chapters are:
    1. Introduction
    2. Managing the Land Supply: Land Use, Open Space, Community
        Design, and Conservation
    3. Investing in the Future: Economic Development, Redevelopment,
        Infrastructure, and Public Services and Facilities
    4. Making the Connections: Circulation
    5. Creating Great Neighborhoods: Safety and Noise
    6. Where We Live: Housing
    7. Our Roots: Cultural and Historic Resources
    8. The Operating Manual: Implementation Plan
Each chapter begins with a general introductory statement that summarizes
the content and overarching vision. The chapter also includes a series of
goals and policies.
       GOAL: A goal is a statement defining a desired end result

                                                         INTRODUCTION
        POLICY: A policy is a plan of action that guides decisions to achieve
         a goal
Together, goals and policies provide direction to guide development and
provide services in the City of Rialto.
Chapter 8, The Operating Manual: Implementation Plan, lists the programs
and actions, called implementation measures, that the Rialto community will
undertake to accomplish many of the goals and polices set forth in this
General Plan.
Goals and Policies
Goals are the wants, desires, and necessities of the City. These are items the
residents and businesses want to accomplish to create their future. Goals are
developed in such a way that they can be accomplished. Goals play a part in
developing policies around certain issues, such as managing growth, and
land use districts. Goals should be rigid enough to withstand unforeseen
changes, but flexible enough to adapt to new circumstances.
Policies are used to define and implement goals. Policies are specific
statements of principle or action that imply a clear commitment, but they are
not mandatory. Policies link goals with actions. There are three elements to a
policy:
    1. An end that needs to be achieved,
    2. A means by which to achieve the end, and
    3. An administrative mechanism by which the means are carried out.
Citizen Participation in General Plan
Preparation
Participation from the public was a critical component in developing a vision
and Guiding Principles for tomorrow. In the development of the Plan, the
City utilized a number of community participation tools. The objective was
to ensure that the Plan would reflect the needs and desires of the broadest
cross section of the community. The tools used in this process included:
        Visioneering: To reach out to a broader community, the City used an
         innovative approach called “Visioneering.” A group of volunteers
         known as Visioneers polled the community to identify issues and
         opportunities to be addressed in the General Plan. Visioneers
         representing a cross-section of Rialto were trained to solicit and
         document public input into the General Plan process through a
         series of facilitated workshops.
                                                                               Chapter Page
                                                                                  1     1-7

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
        Community Education Booths: General Plan informational booths
         were held in conjunction with community events to allow residents
         to identify issues and provide input for the Guiding Principle
         statements.
        General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC): The General Plan
         Advisory Committee, or GPAC, consisting of representatives from
         members of the Planning Commission, City Council, and other City
         departments, met several times to discuss all General Plan topical
         issues. The GPAC discussed major issues, reformulated goals and
         polices, and determined the preferred land use alternative that was
         recommended to the Planning Commission and City Council. The
         GPAC was also responsible for creating and refining the General
         Plan Guiding Principles.
General Plan Planning Area
The General Plan covers the entire City of Rialto and its sphere of influence.
The sphere of influence is an unincorporated area within the jurisdiction of
the County of San Bernardino that may have a bearing on planning
activities in Rialto. Rialto has two large sphere of influence areas:
Bloomington and Lytle Creek. There are also several small pockets of
unincorporated San Bernardino County “islands” located in the northern
area of Rialto, near the SR-210 freeway and Linden Avenue (see Exhibit
1.1).

                                 LAND USE, COMMUNITY DESIGN,
                               OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
Introduction
The Managing Our Land Supply Chapter combines three elements of the
General Plan required by State law, plus community design:
       Land Use
       Community Design
       Open Space
       Conservation
These four topics have similar threads and intentions. The focus is on guiding
physical changes over the long term, while providing and conserving
community and natural resources. The Managing Our Land Supply Chapter:
       Describes the building blocks for the community’s land and natural
        resources policy;
       Establishes the City’s preferred land use patterns and intensities;
       Guides the visual character of public places and private
        development; and
       Creates the conservation and protection plans for natural resources
        and open space.
Managing the supply of land, whether through designating land uses,
community design, or setting aside open space and conservation areas can
make a difference in Rialto. Thoughtful and responsible management of land
assets can create a place to admire and appreciate.
The primary role of the Managing Our Land Supply Chapter is to direct the
use of the City’s land resources in the most equitable and productive manner
possible, with the aim of providing a high quality of life for residents and the
overall community.
Land Use
The Land Use section describes the general location, type, and intensity of
development, and designates the distribution of land uses throughout Rialto.
Land uses such as residential, commercial, industrial, open space, and public
uses are planned to meet the needs of residents, support the local economy,
achieve the City’s fiscal goals, and create an environment that fosters a high
quality of life in Rialto.
This section sets policies for land uses in the City and the Sphere of
Influence, establishing the foundation for future development. Also
addressed are the permitted density and intensity of various land uses.
                                                                                 Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Density and intensity are quantitative measures used to describe how much
development may occur on a property.
Using maps and text, this Land Use section defines the distribution and
intensity of development for residential neighborhoods, commercial and
employment districts, industrial space, parks and other open spaces, and
governmental and public uses of property in Rialto.
                                           The term density refers to the
                                            population and housing units
                                            placed upon a property. The
                                            Rialto General Plan describes
                                            density in terms of the number of
                                            dwelling units allowed per acre
                                            (du/acre), exclusive of streets and
                                            public rights-of-way.
                                           Development intensity addresses
                                            the amount of building square
                                            footage on a particular parcel or
                                            lot. Intensity can be described in
                                            many ways, including building
                                            height, total floor area, the
                                            percent of the lot the building
                                            occupies, or floor-area ratio (FAR).
                                            The Rialto General Plan uses
                                            floor-area ratio to measure non-
                                            residential intensity. The FAR
                                            defines the ratio of the total gross
                                            floor area of all buildings on a lot
                                            to the total land area of the lot.

The Land Use Plan section contains the Land Use Policy Map, which
provides a two-dimensional description of land use policy. This map
prescribes the preferred location and types of permitted uses throughout the
planning area.
Physical Context for the Land Use Policy
Rialto’s land use pattern is defined by nearly 100 years of historical growth.
The historic Downtown and surrounding older neighborhoods, with smaller
residential lots and small central business district, provide a walkable urban
core. Suburban tract homes from the 1950s and 1960s, away from

                                LAND USE, COMMUNITY DESIGN,
                               OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
Downtown, have defined much of the                  City.   Newer     residential
neighborhoods have filled in the northern areas.
Commercial uses are focused along Foothill Boulevard (Historic Route 66),
Riverside Avenue, Valley Boulevard, and Baseline Road at Riverside Avenue.
These corridors and intersections, along with Downtown, constitute the
City’s major commercial areas.
Industrial and warehouse facilities are clustered along Rialto’s rail lines,
where access to shipping facilities was important through the mid-1900s,
particularly for the citrus industry. Other industrial activities have clustered
north of SR-210 and south of I-10. Other industrial areas include land
adjacent to the Rialto Airport in the north and near SR-210, and I-10 and the
Union Pacific railroad line in the south. Many of the industrial businesses
take advantage of the City’s location and access to this distribution network.
Vacant Land and Infill Opportunities
New development pursuant to General Plan policy will focus on infill of
vacant and underutilized sites. Opportunities include:
       Vacant land surrounding the Rialto Airport (the Renaissance Specific
        Plan) and the SR-210 freeway that allow a mix of new uses, including
        residential, commercial, industrial, and open space
       Infill and redevelopment potential along Foothill Boulevard, with
        extensive vacant land located along the western edge of the
        boulevard and redevelopment opportunities along the eastern end
       Pockets of vacant land around Downtown that are suitable for
        higher-density housing to support commercial uses in Downtown
       Additional areas of vacant land and redevelopment potential
        scattered throughout southern Rialto, particularly along Riverside
        Avenue and San Bernardino Road, industrial areas along Riverside
        Avenue south of the I-10 freeway, and along Cedar Avenue within
        the Sphere of Influence area of Bloomington
The General Plan allows for an increase in residential densities on selected
vacant and underutilized lands adjacent to appropriate infrastructure, as well
as redefinition of some lands previously designated for commercial and/or
industrial uses to mixed use. New development should complement
established development patterns by ensuring compatibility of uses, provide
appropriate buffers to safeguard health and well-being of residents, and be
consistent or compatible in design. New development should also reinforce
connections between neighborhoods and activity centers, creating an
                                                                                  Chapter Page

Land Use Plan
In response to the community’s desire to:
       Maintain Rialto’s long-established land use patterns,
       Protect established neighborhoods,
       Stabilize revenues that allow for consistent delivery of community
        services, and
       Enhance the quality of life through proper design of the public realm,
the Land Use Plan guides the development, maintenance, and improvement
of land and properties for the next 30 years.
Land Use Designations
The following land use designations, together with the Land Use Map
(Exhibit 2.2), represent the planned distribution, density, and intensity of land
use citywide. The colors shown on the map correspond to land use

O - Office (Intensity: maximum 0.75 FAR)
      Provides sites for small- and large-scale professional
          offices and related uses that accommodate a broad
          range     of    low-intensity,    service-oriented,      and
          employment-generating uses.
      Where located adjacent to residential neighborhoods,
          office development must be sensitive in scale, site
          design, and activity level to the neighborhood. This
          means that it is important to establish landscape buffers
          between office development and the adjacent
          neighborhoods; limit or restrict office/business traffic to
          major streets and not use neighborhood streets; limit building heights                Office
          at the boundaries to safeguard residential private spaces; etc.
      Additional permitted uses, consistent with zoning regulations, include
          community care facilities, public facilities, and utility support systems.
DMU - Downtown Mixed Use (Intensity: 6.1- 60 du/ac; maximum 1.50 FAR)
      The designation applies to Rialto’s historic downtown
          core.
      The designation is established to facilitate development
          of a complementary mix of retail and service
          commercial, dining, entertainment, and residential uses
          within walking distance of each other and the nearby
          Metrolink station and Civic Center.
      Businesses along Riverside Avenue shall be oriented
          toward the street and facilitate pedestrian access.
      Residential uses within the Downtown district may be
          developed as a stand-alone structure or as part of                         Downtown Mixed Use
          mixed-use development. However, any mixed-use structures with
          both commercial and residential uses that front Riverside Avenue
          must have a ground-floor use that enlivens the environment and
          invites pedestrian access, such as retail or dining.
      The overall net density of new residential development, inclusive of
          shared open space, shall not exceed 60 units per acre.
      Population Density: 23-229 persons per acre.
Additional permitted uses, consistent with zoning regulations, include public
facilities and utility support systems. Uses specifically prohibited due to their
incompatibility with a pedestrian-oriented mixed-use district include vehicle
sales and repair, industrial and manufacturing businesses, wholesaling
activities, and bars not associated with restaurants.

CC - Community Commercial (Intensity: maximum 0.35 FAR)
     Provides for a variety of retail, office, and service-oriented business
       activities that serve the local community, including
       supermarkets,       restaurants,     small-scale      service
       businesses, and specialty retail stores.
     Where located adjacent to residential neighborhoods,
       Community Commercial development must be
       sensitive in scale, site design, and activity level to the
       neighborhood. This means that it is important to
       establish landscape buffers between the commercial
       development and the adjacent neighborhoods; limit or
       restrict office/business traffic to major streets and not
       use neighborhood streets; limit building heights at the              Community Commercial
       boundaries to safeguard residential private spaces; etc.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Development Opportunity Areas
Rialto still has potential for tremendous development growth in the City and
the Sphere of Influence. This growth, if properly managed, can provide new
opportunities through economic activity, new amenities and community
facilities, attractive development and commercial centers, and expanded
employment growth. Exhibit 2.3 displays the Development Opportunities
Areas. Although development opportunities exist throughout the City, the
majority of the City’s growth will be focused in the following four areas:
         Foothill Boulevard. With bus rapid transit (BRT) coming to Rialto,
          this General Plan encourages transforming Foothill Boulevard into a
          lively, pedestrian- and transit-friendly boulevard that creates a positive
          impression to visitors. The Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan provides
          development details and guidelines. The focus of the Specific Plan is
          to revitalize the corridor by introducing pedestrian-friendly
          development that complements BRT. New development will focus
          on pedestrian nodes, including pedestrian-oriented commercial,
          mixed use, and residential uses. The Specific Plan emphasizes high-
          quality architectural design for all new development, supports new
          “rooftops” to enhance economic vitality, promotes flexibility to
          respond to market demands, provides for public enhancements, and
          promotes property investment and maintenance. See Table 2-1 for
          the potential build out of Foothill Boulevard area.
         Downtown Rialto. Downtown is a focal point for the City that will
          integrate mixed uses, residential development, bus and Metrolink
          transit services, a lively “Main Street,” and civic uses to create a
          dynamic downtown village and a pedestrian-friendly environment.
          Downtown will re-emerge as a vibrant City center where economic
          activity, culture, civic identity, transportation options, and distinct
          urban experiences can thrive and inspire the community. See Table
          2-1 for the potential build out of the Downtown Rialto area.
         Renaissance Rialto. Renaissance Rialto is designed as an integrated
          community of various housing types, employment, retail, recreation,
          services, and schools all connected by a system of open spaces and
          amenities. Renaissance Rialto offers open spaces, paseos, walkable
          streets, proximity of uses, and strategically located recreational
          facilities. See Table 2-1 for potential build out of the Renaissance
          Rialto area.

General Plan
        Lytle Creek Ranch. The Lytle Creek Ranch Specific Plan will include
         a collection of neighborhoods consisting of high-quality single-unit
         homes, condominiums, and apartments. Neighborhoods will be
         designed around schools and neighborhood parks. Some residential
         areas will be devoted to active adult housing. Commercial mixed use
         areas will serve residential areas and be accessible to surrounding
         local neighborhoods on Riverside Avenue. Natural open spaces will
         be preserved along Lytle Creek. See Table 2-1 for potential build out
         of the Lytle Creek Ranch Specific Plan area.

Implications of Land Use Policy
Table 2-2 summarizes the dwelling units, population, and level of non-
residential development that can be expected from full implementation of
land use policies established by this General Plan. Table 2-3 identifies the
planned distribution of land uses. Over time, as properties transition from
one use to another or property owners rebuild, land uses and intensities will
gradually shift to align with the intent of this Chapter.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Community Design
The Community Design section, in conjunction with the Land Use section
works to create guidelines for the physical characteristics of the built
environment, the scale of buildings, their relationship to one another,
architectural details, neighborhood appearance, and streetscapes. Together,
community design and land use create unique, community-oriented places
throughout Rialto.
Community Design Context                                                            Public art and

The foundation of Rialto’s physical environment is derived from its historical      signify the entry
beginnings. The compact Downtown served by the railroads and the vast               into Downtown
citrus groves that covered the area have shaped the City’s suburban form            Rialto
and continue to influence design and development. Today’s Downtown
celebrates the citrus industry, and the grid street pattern reflects the historical
ownership patterns. The design and character of some of the buildings along
Foothill Boulevard create a feel reminiscent of historic Route 66.
However, many commercial strip and commercial centers lack character and
identity. Creating a sense of “place” is a key objective for Rialto, both to
inspire property investment and maintenance, and to distinguish Rialto from
its Inland Empire neighbors.
Creating a Sense of Place for Rialto
A sense of place means that the community’s values and culture are
projected upon the built environment. Identifying those qualities and

encouraging the enhancement and embellishment of the public realm are
critical to the success of Rialto. Public realm design elements – which are
entirely within the City’s authority to design, implement, and maintain –
foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging.
This approach will foster tighter partnerships between private development
and the City, which adds value to both the public and the private realms.
Over time, the improved quality of the streetscapes will encourage
additional investment. The emphasis will be on improved streetscapes and
corridors, clearly defined districts, gateway elements that let you know that
you have arrived, and other design treatments.
Rialto will set standards for development and construction. Those standards
must respond to community values of architectural integrity and
distinctiveness. Foremost, the City will promote the construction and
preservation of buildings which will prove to be assets to the community
over time.
Public Realm - Gateways, Corridors, and Districts
The public realm includes properties, right-of-ways, and larger areas that the
City owns and controls and can enhance through urban design strategies.
Districts and Neighborhoods
Districts and neighborhoods are areas that have conforming design themes
and strategies that are consistent throughout the area. Each district and
neighborhood has its own character in terms of development patterns,
streetscape design, building scale and mass, and periods of history. Residents
celebrate the uniqueness of their own neighborhoods and respect the desire
of others to maintain the qualities that distinguish their surroundings.
Examples of districts include the Gateway District, Downtown, and
Renaissance (see Exhibit 2.4). Within those districts regulated by a Specific

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Plan, the design criteria will be defined by that planning document. Outside
of the Specific Plan areas are many other residential neighborhoods where a
design consistency exists due to the historic nature of the development. The
City should strive towards preserving the fabric and consistency of
neighborhoods by requiring that new construction or renovations to
structures within defined neighborhoods are sensitive to existing design, use
of materials, scale, and form. The integrity of a neighborhood’s aesthetics
should also be preserved by the proper enforcement of codes relating to
proper maintenance of properties, as well as the continual efforts of
suppressing graffiti and other types of vandalism.
Wherever feasible, neighborhoods should be walkable and pedestrian
friendly. This means that neighborhoods should be compact and easily
walkable from end to end. Parks and schools should be within easy walking
distance from homes. Those who do not have access to other modes of
transportation (mainly the elderly and children) should have to ability to
reach key destinations and daily activities within walking distance.
Neighborhoods that are adjacent to defined districts such as those that
surround the Renaissance District along Baseline Road (see Exhibit 2.4)
should provide linkages in the forms of paths and walkways that allow for
residents in neighborhoods to have multiple options for greater accessibility.
City Gateways
Gateways signify a transition from one area to another. The goal of gateways
are to enhance Rialto’s "front doors" by not only constructing improvements in
the areas seen by the most people, but by doing so in a way that provides a
unique identity along the City’s prominent entrances. Gateways include design
features such as signage, landscaping, and other elements to create a distinct
aesthetic tone. In addition, gateway features help to slow traffic at these key
locations, functioning as traffic-calming devices. Gateways at many residential
neighborhoods have historically been important design features in Rialto that
provide identity and distinguish the City from surrounding areas. Those
gateways should be retained and enhanced, and new gateways should be
considered for new major development projects.
Two types of gateways are established in Rialto: Major Gateways and Minor
Gateways. Major Gateways are larger entryways typically located on major
streets near freeway on- and off-ramps that identify entry into the City. Minor
Gateways are smaller entryways on streets that cross City boundaries or
identify smaller districts, including residential neighborhoods (see Exhibit 2.4).
                                                                                   Examples of gateway

districts by generating foot traffic along store fronts; it creates additional
means of access to service; it improves the quality of life for those without
access to motorized vehicles; it can be conducive to healthier lifestyles and
exercise; and it may help foster a sense of community and social connection
in residential neighborhoods by improving the interaction and chance
encounters of neighbors. To enhance pedestrian friendliness, commercial
developments and neighborhoods should be compact and include a
network of paths and walkways that connect people to key destinations. As
described in the districts and neighborhoods section above- activities,
schools, and amenities such as parks, should be within walking distance to
everyone, especially those who have limited transportation options such as
the elderly and children.
Left: Street furniture such as trash receptacles, street lamps, and planters are oriented toward the
pedestrian and provide comfort and safety. Center: Trees and landscaping along the sidewalks of
a residential neighborhood provide shade and a pleasant natural element for a walk. Right: Street
signs, benches, and sidewalk seating create a vibrant public realm that elevates the pedestrian
experience.
The physical design of projects should also cater to the pedestrian.
Commercial buildings should be on the scale of pedestrians, with windows
and store fronts facing sidewalks avoiding long expanses of blank walls.
Intersections and crossings should be well-marked and pedestrian scaled,
ensuring the safety of pedestrians amongst motor vehicles and to avoid
intimidating pedestrians from crossing a street. Both commercial and
residential developments should integrate pedestrian amenities such as
benches, street-lighting, and attractive and functional landscaping. Amenities
such as trees along sidewalks can provide shade and comfort in warm and
sunny weather, as well as adds to the walking experience. Decorative street
lighting can help improve the aesthetics of a development as well as
provides safety and visibility for pedestrians during the night time.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Signage
Signage includes all the signs that we see around the community- free
standing commercial signs that advertise a shopping center, signs affixed to
the facades of buildings, and public signs such as directional signs or
gateway signs. Although these signs serve a very important function for
aiding businesses and providing information, the uncontrolled use of signage
can lead to signs that dominate the landscape, distract the public, and
negatively affect the aesthetics of the community. To avoid such issues, the
City will ensure that equal attention and focus is paid to the design and
placement of signage that accompanies developments. Signs should
complement the quality and design of the developments they intend to serve
by utilizing the same architectural style, similar color palette, and matching
materials. Poor sign construction and haphazard placement of signs should
be avoided. To maintain the integrity of developments, the City should
monitor and ensure that signs are properly maintained, and that inoperable
or unused/outdated signs are removed.
Corridors/Streetscapes
Corridors improve the visual quality of the community’s major streets with
abundant landscaping and trees. These corridors should have generous
medians and/or parkways that support extensive landscaping and street
trees. They should also accommodate distinctive gateways at the City’s
boundaries. Buildings along these corridors should also complement the
streetscape and provide an atmosphere that accommodates both
pedestrians and automobiles. Special consideration should be given to street
furniture and pedestrian friendly lighting.
                                                                                 Riverside Avenue,

Corridors should include continuous sidewalks with wide parkways that
establish pedestrian connections from the residential neighborhoods to
commercial districts, parks, job centers, and other activity areas. Street trees
should be of appropriate height and stature for the scale and function of the
street. Corridors and streetscapes are important for Rialto because they help
promote the City’s commitment to improve public spaces and corridors such
as Riverside Avenue, Base Line Road, and Foothill Boulevard. Exhibit 2.4
identifies key corridors in Rialto.

  CITY OF RIALTO
  General Plan
  Streetscapes refer to the views we see of, and along, the streets.
  Streetscapes encompass virtually everything along the street- the street itself,
  the landscaping on public right-of-ways, sidewalks, street furniture on the
  sidewalks, and even the buildings that face the streets. When residents and
  visitors alike travel through the City, it is the view of streetscape that can
  immediately impact a person’s perception and image of the City. Streets that
  are unkempt may evoke a sense of negativity towards that area that may be
  unfair. To address this issue, the City should take great care to design
  streetscapes in a manner that enhances the experience of those that travel
  through the City. Enhancements should take the form of screening any
  visual blight from the public right-of-way, and providing well designed and
  well-maintained landscaping along corridors.
  Public Art
  Public art enhances the aesthetic and cultural quality of the community,
  provides opportunities for public exposure to the visual arts, acknowledges
  our local artistic community, and inspires pride. Public art is an opportunity
  for creating a connection between the public and the unique history of the
  City. The City will establish policies or ordinances that encourage Public Art
  as part of private and public projects.
Public art can come in multiple forms such sculptures, murals, mosaics, classic statues, etc. and can
serve to reflect upon Rialto’s history, inspire creativity and thought, and provide a forum for local
artists to share their work.
  Scenic Vistas
  Scenic vistas are the picturesque views that are visible from certain parts of
  the City. In Rialto, the views of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino
  Mountains and the foothills provide the perfect backdrop for creating scenic
  vistas throughout the City. Protecting natural landforms views help develop a
  “sense of place.” In a sense, these scenic vistas signify to the person that
  they are in a special place, and the view they are experiencing is unique to
  that moment and to that location alone. In order to protect scenic vistas, the
  City should take great care in ensuring that building heights and scale of
  projects do not hinder or impede scenic view. In addition, building materials

in such locations should also be carefully selected as to not produce glare or
other distracting occurrences.
Private Realm – Architecture, Landscaping, and Quality
Development
The private realm consists of those portions of private properties that are
readily accessible and visible from public streets, and that thereby contribute
to the community aesthetic.
Architecture
Architectural style gives each building a distinct character and feel. A
building, development, or neighborhood can be designed in a variety of
diverse architectural styles that are prominent throughout Southern
California. Cohesiveness in a development and/or neighborhood can be
achieved by the use consistent architectural themes that are applied
throughout. New development and renovations should pay respect to site
context and the predominant existing style as to maintain visual harmony.
Examples of Architectural Styles:
The Craftsman style emerged in California in the early 20th century and is characterized by the use
low roof lines, wide welcoming porches, and use of rustic materials such as stone and exposed
wood beams. Organic and natural colors are dominant.
The California Mediterranean/Spanish style, popular throughout Southern California, borrows
elements from architecture found in Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Spain. Popular
elements include the use of low-pitched tiled roofs, and arches and the incorporation of materials
such as stone and stucco.
                                                                                Chapter   Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Form, or the physical design of the building, can be manipulated to produce
buildings that are visually pleasing are stimulating and show that property
owners have confidence and pride in their investments. Visual interest and
diversity can be achieved through the use of varying heights, mass, density,
and fenestration (placement of windows) of buildings so as to not have the
same building design repeated. Developments should utilize high-quality
materials that are durable and properly reflect the chosen style of
architecture. As with style, new buildings and renovations should continue to
be compatible with the form of adjacent buildings.
The architecture of the developments should incorporate sustainable design
practices that produce buildings that are environmentally friendly. The
placement and orientation of buildings should fully analyze the amount of
light and heat that penetrates the interior as to find the ideal configuration
for natural climate control. Maximizing natural climate control of the
building can result in lowered energy use for heating, cooling, and lighting.
Design should incorporate building materials that are environmentally sound
(recyclable, quickly regenerates, and produced with limited impacts to the
environment) and should incorporate any latest widely-available
technologies that help reduce the impact of the building on the environment
without inflating design costs.

Architecture in both residential and commercial developments plays an
important role in providing the desired quality, feel, experience that Rialto is
seeking. Architecture used properly in residential developments can help
create neighborhood identity; build community cohesiveness; and can
create a desirable, dynamic, and attractive place to live.
With multi-unit development, the City can request architects to utilize
creative techniques such as articulating the façade of a larger structure
through varying color, depth, and heights to present the illusion of multiple
smaller developments that are connected as opposed to one large
intimidating structure. In creating multi-unit developments that seem more
compact than they are, architects can blend a variety of densities within a
neighborhood to provide a variety of housing units available, yet maintaining
a quaint, small-town feel.
Creating interesting residential blocks by varying setbacks, encouraging
diverse forms in a unified architectural style, attractive landscaping, and
encouraging the use of high-quality materials can boost curb appeal to
potential residents and improve the desirability of a neighborhood.
Commercial architecture should adapt similar design principles as described
above to help create commercial and industrial developments that are
attractive, well designed, people oriented, and are environmentally
sustainable.
Quality architecture that draws on Rialto’s history and culture can help
create a focal point and sense of place.
Landscaping
Landscaping within commercial areas and parking lots can soften the
character of otherwise bland, asphalt-dominated environments. The City will
require all new nonresidential development to incorporate well-designed
landscaping that is diverse, colorful, and sustainable. This will make these

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
areas attractive and consistent with the overall landscaped character of
Rialto. New development shall use drought-resistant vegetation and smart-
water systems as sustainable methods for reducing water use. Shrubs and
trees should be used along major roadways to protect surrounding
residential neighborhoods from noise and pollution. Street trees offer many
benefits: they provide shade and cooling effects, create beautiful canopies,
and soften the hard edges of urban development. The City will continue with
strong street tree programs.
Parking lots that incorporate vegetation and trees appear more natural, are more appealing,
and have the added benefit of providing a permeable surface for absorption of water runoff.
The mass of asphalt in parking lots shall be broken up with trees and
landscaping, providing a more natural feel and aesthetic. The provision of
landscaping and permeable soils will also assist with drainage of water that
would otherwise collect on non-permeable asphalt surfaces. Parking lots
should also incorporate design techniques such as textured paving along
pedestrian paths to provide a safe path of travel from a parking space to an
entrance as well as provide visual diversity in the parking lot.
Planned Development
A planned development is a large-scale building development that is
carefully designed, planned, and unified in its entirety and is usually all
contained within one development or subdivision. Planned developments
within Rialto should be of the highest quality and reflect all the principles
described above. In order to create a desired small town feel, planned
developments should incorporate housing design features such as patios that
face the street, and zero lot lines, as to blend public and private space, and
create moments of spontaneous social interaction. A wide rage of housing
types should be incorporated to create a diversity in scale and sizes. Visibility
of, and orientation towards the sidewalks and streets also provides the
added benefits of increased safety for pedestrians and discouragement of
graffiti and vandalism. Houses in planned developments should also be
clustered and include access to a large shared common space surrounding

the house as well as a smaller private yard, as to provide a wider amount of
amenities to a larger population.
Sidewalks, trails, and bicycle paths of planned developments should
supplement and complement street systems in establishing the character of
the neighborhood. Sidewalks should be located on at least one side of every
street to enable the walkability of planned developments. The network of
sidewalks, trails, and bicycle paths should be link residential areas to open
space areas, schools, and local shopping areas. Landscaping and greenbelts
should be used effectively as buffers to provide a safety buffer between
incompatible land uses.
Small-town Character and Neighborhood Preservation
Rialto started as small town and grew to become a city with many distinct
residential neighborhoods. General Plan policy looks to preserve the small-
town roots of Rialto by protecting the important qualities of the residential
neighborhoods that make up the City. Those qualities include safe
neighborhoods, a tree canopy, well-maintained yards, and amenities such as
sidewalks and street lighting. To maintain this small town atmosphere, new

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Open Space and Recreation
Open space can be broadly defined as land that is not developed with
buildings or is developed with limited improvements complementary to their
intended use, such as parks. Open space can be found in a variety of forms
throughout the City. The City’s attractive landscaped medians along
Riverside Drive, for example, are considered open space just as much as are
the City’s parks.
The Open Space and Recreation component of this General Plan outlines
strategies to preserve the special open space areas in Rialto and to meet the
community’s recreational and conservation needs. Open space serves many
functions in Rialto:
       Public parks and private recreation areas allow residents to engage in
        healthful exercise and build relationships with neighbors.
       Open space areas along Lytle Creek help protect against flooding.
       In conservation areas, open spaces provide habitat for wildlife and
        plant species.
       Landscaped areas between buildings and the street represent private
        open spaces that provide greenery and visual enhancement.
       All open spaces enhance the beauty and character of Rialto.
Parks in Rialto
The Rialto park system consists of neighborhood parks, community parks,
and mini-parks of varying sizes to meet the needs of residents.
Mini-Park/Pocket Park: A mini-park (sometimes referred to as a pocket park)
serves the immediate neighborhood and typically occupies infill parcels.
Mini-parks generally are no larger than one acre, address limited recreation
needs, and offer only a few amenities such as benches and/or play
equipment.
Neighborhood Park: These parks are the basic unit of the City’s park system.
Neighborhood parks range in size from one to ten acres and generally
accommodate spaces for informal activities and active recreation. These can
include picnic areas and playing fields.

Community Park: Community parks serve a broader purpose than                          Rialto City Park
neighborhood parks, and meet recreation needs for more formal and highly
programmed activities. Frisbie, Jerry Eaves, and Rialto City Park are classified
as Community Parks and can include recreational facilities, community
pools, and other amenities.
School Open Space: School open space areas include recreational facilities
on school property. They may include open fields, playgrounds, tennis
courts, asphalt play areas (e.g., basket ball courts hand ball courts), and other
recreational amenities. These facilities, as a general rule, are open to the
public during non-school hours. These facilities are included in the inventory
due to joint-use agreements between the City and the Rialto Unified School
District.
Exhibit 2.5 displays open space and recreational resources in Rialto and
areas with potential to supplement active and passive open space resources
within the planning area. Table 2-4 identifies the location and amenities for
each park.
Regional Park: Regional parks meet the recreational needs of a regional
population and usually include a wide variety of active and passive
recreation amenities. Active amenities include sports fields, community
centers, etc. Passive amenities include trails and pathways. Regional parks
are operated and maintained by the San Bernardino County Regional Parks
Department.
There are no regional parks in Rialto. However, the Glen Helen Regional
Park is located adjacent to Rialto’s Sphere of Influence in the Devore area of
San Bernardino County.

Park Needs
The City has a moderate shortage of parks space to serve its population. As a
rule of thumb, many cities throughout California use three to five acres of
parkland per 1,000 residents as a benchmark for sufficient park space. The
Rialto City Council has adopted a standard of three acres per 1,000 residents
and uses this ratio for park dedication/fees requirements.
Table 2-5 identifies the park acreage, population, and the ratio of park acres
per 1,000 residents, as documented in 2008 and projected for 2040. It also
distinguishes between the park acreage and City parks and the Rialto Unified
School District open space areas.

As shown in Table 2-5, the City does not meet the ratio of three acres per
1,000 residents if only City-owned parks are considered. However, the City
mitigates this deficit through joint-use agreements with the Rialto Unified
School District, particularly within the eastern area of the City. Local public
elementary, middle, and high schools provide additional open space totaling
nearly 172 acres.
This joint-use partnership has an indeterminable timeline of availability
because of concerns regarding impacted and expanding campuses,
vandalism, and wear and tear on school grounds, with associated
maintenance and liability issues. Also, to meet new student growth, open
field areas may be occupied by portable classrooms or permanent school
expansion to meet future needs, thereby limiting recreational acreages.
The City also mitigates for deficiencies in parkland acreage through capital-
intensive community facilities located throughout the City, such as a
community center, an indoor swimming pool, a racquet and fitness center, a
senior center, and a community theatre.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Because Rialto is largely built out, limited opportunities are available to
develop new parks or similar open spaces. Thus, the City’s efforts are
focused on making improvements to established parks that enhance safety,
maintenance efficiency, aesthetics, and conservation; completing
programming and construction on undeveloped portions of established
parks, and developing additional acres of planned parks and open spaces
with Specific Plan areas.
Locational Park Needs
Providing sufficient parkland means more than setting aside an adequate
number of acres. Equally important in parks planning is locating parks to
provide ready access for all residents. When taking into account park
location, service area standards recommended by the National Recreation
and Parks Association (NRPA) indicate that a park typically should cover a
one-quarter to one-half-mile service area radius, depending on the size of the
park. In general, most residential sections of the City are within one-half mile
of a park facility, with the exception of some neighborhoods along the
western boundary and some portions of Bloomington. Exhibit 2-5 shows the
service area of City parkland, school open space land, and Bloomington
parkland.
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
Lytle Creek Wash provides an environment for plant and animal species, as
well as water resources for the City. The majority of biological resources in
Rialto are associated with Lytle Creek Wash, as discussed in the
Conservation section. Water from Lytle Creek is treated before it is put into
the local water system. Because Rialto’s primary sources for water are local
groundwater and surface water, maintaining clean and sufficient water in
Lytle Creek is an important goal.
Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
Certain open space areas remain critical for the managed production of
resources, including mineral resources and groundwater resources. By
protecting these areas from urban encroachment, the City can help ensure
that critical resources are used responsibly and managed for use by future
generations.
Rialto’s location at the edge of an alluvial fan that extends from the base of
the San Gabriel Mountains creates opportunities for aggregate mining. In
addition, there are two significant aggregate mining operations that have
long existed within Lytle Creek and north of SR-210, along Alder Avenue.
These areas have been designated to remain as Open Space to protect these
resources as long as mining activity is feasible. Once mining activity is
completed, careful planning will be required, and should include provision of

appropriate open space and recreation facilities to meet evolving community
needs. The Mineral Resources section of this Chapter highlights the issues
and opportunities that come with aggregate mining.
A remnant orange grove located on Cactus Avenue and Carter Street serves
as a reminder of Rialto’s heritage and produces a local source of citrus.
Because the property owner has made a commitment to preserve the grove
as a heritage grove, the Land Use map designates the property as Open
Space – Resources and applies the Historic Agriculture Overlay, ensuring its
conservation and protection.
The Cactus Basins, operated by the San Bernardino County Flood Control
District, serve the dual purpose of:
        Providing flood protection, and
        Serving as percolation grounds where storm water can be captured
         and used to replenish the groundwater supply.
Given that Rialto’s potable water source has been compromised and
restricted for use by perchlorate contamination in some groundwater wells,
the basin has become even more critical to meet the City’s water needs for
the future. However, low-intensity, passive recreation and landscaping
around the basin’s perimeter are encouraged to increase active recreation
space.
Open Space for Public Health and Safety
Open space for public health and safety refers to lands restricted from
development via easements, dedication, or other regulatory controls due to
hazardous conditions or important flood control functions. For example,
drainage channels and detention basins protect people and property from
flood hazards. Open space buffers along fault zones or on otherwise
geologically unstable lands prevent development from occurring in these
potentially unsafe areas.
Expected effects of global climate change may include increased potential
for wildfires, flooding, and drought. The Safety and Noise section identifies
areas where these conditions occur.
Conservation
The establishment of Rialto can be traced to the area’s abundance of natural
resources, including water sources from Lytle Creek and the Santa Ana River,
the mineral resources of the alluvial plains of both the San Bernardino and
San Gabriel Mountains, and climate and soil resources that were supportive
of a wide range of agriculture activities beneficial to Rialto’s founders.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
This Conservation section addresses the conservation, protection,
development, utilization, and reclamation of Rialto’s natural resources. Local
natural resources include wildlife and plant communities and their habitat,
air, water, energy sources, and minerals. As these of natural resources are
largely non-renewable, with the exception of possible wind energy
resources, today’s community has an obligation to conserve and manage
them. General Plan policies aim to protect the quality of natural resources
and make them available to future generations.
Water Resources
Nearly all of Rialto’s water sources come from local surface water and
groundwater supplies. Nearly two-thirds of the City’s potable water comes
from the groundwater basins directly beneath Rialto. Water is pumped from
many wells that tap into the Lytle, Rialto, Bunkerhill, and North Riverside
aquifers. Surface water is available from treated water coming from Lytle
Creek in the San Bernardino Mountains and Lake Silverwood, a California
State Water Project facility. Open space areas along Cajon Wash, Lytle
Creek Wash, and the Santa Ana River allow for recharge of the groundwater
basins.
With Rialto relying largely on local water sources, improving the long-term
management and sustainability of these sources is critical. Water resources
are discussed in greater detail in the Investing in Our Future Element.
Sustainable Building Practices and Energy
Conservation
Although sources of energy, unlike water, come from locations far removed
from Rialto, energy conservation must be locally based. Rialto residents and
the business community should employ simple conservation techniques to
reduce energy use and minimize depletion of energy resources.
AB 32, codified as The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, was adopted
by the California Legislature in 2006 to require the State to adopt regulations
that require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas
emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The bill
requires the State to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions to levels
equivalent to those in 1990 by 2020.
The State has long been a leader on energy conservation and environmental
stewardship efforts, and AB 32 continues this tradition by providing direction
to local governments on how to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas
emissions. AB 32 initiatives address ways all Californians can contribute to
reducing the adverse consequences of climate change. Programs put in
place toward this objective will result in more sustainable building practices.
Sustainable building practices include:

Mineral Resources
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA)
requires that all cites address significant aggregate resources, classified by
the State Geologist and designated by the State Mining and Geology Board,
in their General Plans. SMARA was enacted to promote conservation and
protection of significant mineral deposits. Therefore, the Rialto General Plan
establishes protection of these resources through the use of special land use
designations.
The law provides for significant aggregate resources to be recognized and
considered before land use decisions are made that may compromise the
availability of these resources. The State Geologist classifies lands in
California based on geological factors, without regard to existing land use
and land ownership. Because available aggregate construction material is
limited, four designations have been established for the classification of sand,
gravel, and crushed rock resources:
        MRZ-1 Mineral Resource Zone: No significant mineral deposits are
         present or likely to be present.
        MRZ-2 Mineral Resource Zone: Significant mineral deposits are
         present or there is a high likelihood for their presence.
        MRZ-3 Mineral Resource Zone: The significance of mineral deposits
         cannot be determined.
These mineral resource designations are intended to prevent incompatible
land use development in areas determined to have significant mineral
resource deposits. Permitted uses within a designated area of regional
significance include mining, uses that support mining such as smelting and
storage of materials, or uses that will not hinder future mining, such as
grazing, agriculture, and low-intensity recreation.
Exhibits 2.6 and 2.7 identify designated aggregate sector areas and mineral
resource zones and sectors within the Rialto planning area.

Recycling
With several landfills located in Rialto, the importance of recycling waste
materials is readily apparent. Landfills occupy substantial land area and limit
the types of uses that can be established in their vicinity. Associated impacts
include truck traffic, noise, and sometimes odors. By recycling waste
materials, Rialto residents and businesses can help minimize the waste
stream entering landfills and reduce efforts required (energy, resource
consumption) to produce new goods and products. The City manages local
trash collection and recycling programs through contracts with private
service providers. Waste Management staff also conducts presentations to
school groups, youth groups, service clubs, and businesses on such topics as
recycling, waste reduction, composting/gardening, and household hazardous
waste management.
The City sponsors free dump days to assist residents in disposing/recycling of
special wastes or bulky items. The City also provides information and
assistance for the disposal of hazardous waste and electronics. These
programs all aim toward the goals of reduced waste production and safe,
responsible disposal of household hazardous materials.
Air Quality and Climate
Rialto sits at the base of the Cajon Pass, where high winds are common
meteorological events within the region. Consequently, on windy days, air
quality in Rialto can be good, but on days where there is no wind, the quality
of air can be unhealthful to sensitive people like young children, the elderly,
and people with diminished lung capacity. This has been a characteristic of
the air quality in the San Bernardino Valley region for decades.

                                OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
Rialto is home to several logistics and warehousing uses that have heavy
trucking operations. However, Rialto’s local air quality conditions result
largely from sources outside the immediate area, as prevailing westerly
breezes push air pollution from the valleys up against the mountains. Rialto
benefits from being located at the mouth of the Cajon Pass as clean, cool air
drains into Rialto each evening from the top of the pass.
South Coast Air Basin
Rialto lies within the South Coast Air Basin, a geographic area that extends
from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel Mountains, and from the Ventura
County boundary east to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. The
air basin is a “non-attainment” area for Federal and State air quality standards
for ozone and State standards for particulate matter less than 10 microns in
diameter (PM10). The South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD) regulates air quality improvement programs within the basin,
and works to improve regional air quality to achieve Federal and State
standards. Rialto has continued to work with the SCAQMD and in
accordance with the applicable Air Quality Management Plan to improve
local and regional air quality.
Sources of Air Pollution
Sources of air pollution include but are not limited to:
        Motor vehicles, which represent the major source of regional
         emissions throughout the basin and within Rialto
        Land use patterns which inefficiently distribute housing densities,
         employment centers, and mass transit facilities, leading to significant
         automobile usage
        Vehicles idling in heavy traffic congestion, such as those crawling
         along the freeways during peak hours of the day, which contribute to
         significant exhaust
        Common sources of fine particulate matter, or PM10, including road
         dust, construction activity, grading, and fireplaces
        Other sources of air pollution such as auto repair businesses, dry
         cleaners, and businesses that regularly use chemical solvents
Atmosphere and Climate
The scientific consensus is that global climate change is an increasingly
acknowledged environmental problem and that it is caused as greenhouse
gases are released into the atmosphere faster than the Earth’s natural
systems can re-absorb them. Global climate change is likely to be one of the
largest problems this generation faces.
                                                                                 Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
In response to these concerns, California enacted legislation in 2006 and
2008 that requires jurisdictions to comprehensively address how long-range
plans will begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve
statewide air quality goals. AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of
2006, established a comprehensive program of regulatory and market
mechanisms to achieve real, quantifiable, cost-effective reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions. The law aims to reduce carbon emissions in
California to 1990 levels by 2020.
SB 375, Redesigning Communities to Reduce Greenhouse Gases, passed
into law in 2008, is implementing legislation for AB 32. This legislation
endeavors to control greenhouse gas emissions by curbing sprawl (the
unplanned, uncontrolled spread of urban development). The legislation
encourages compact development patterns that reduce the need to drive,
thereby reducing air pollution from car exhaust, conserving water, and
protecting habitat, among other benefits. To achieve these goals, this law is
designed to align regional land use, housing, and transportation plans with
greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, global changes affecting
Rialto in the future could include:
        More frequent heat waves
        More extreme weather events
        More frequent and increased severity droughts
        Increased potential for tropical insect-borne diseases
Rialto recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to
preserve a high quality of life for generations to come. Many actions
undertaken by the City directly or indirectly improve air quality. These
actions include:
        Revitalizing Downtown Rialto. Downtown is considered a focal
         point for the City that will integrate mixed uses, residential
         development, bus and Metrolink transit services, and civic uses to
         create a dynamic downtown village within a pedestrian-friendly
         environment. Future downtown residents can walk to Riverside
         Avenue to get a bite to eat, board a Metrolink train to travel to
         destinations throughout Southern California, or walk to the public
         library. One of the goals of revitalizing downtown is to create a
         pedestrian environment where walking and public transit will help
         reduce automobile use, both locally and in the region. See Goal 2-5
         and Policies 2-5.1 to 2-5.9.
        Enhancing Foothill Boulevard. The Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan
         aims at capitalizing on bus rapid transit (BRT) with new development
         that will focus on pedestrian nodes, including pedestrian-oriented
         commercial, commercial and residential mixed use, and residential

         uses. These developments will be strategically located on the
         boulevard and take advantage of potential BRT transit stops. These
         land use and transit strategies will decrease vehicle miles traveled
         and increase pedestrian activity along this corridor, thus reducing
         automobile emissions. See Goal 2-4 and Policies 2-4.1 to 2-4.4.
        Focusing on Alternative Transportation. This General Plan
         encourages and supports fixed-route transit, BRT, regular bus service,
         a comprehensive bicycle network, and walking. These approaches
         can help reduce vehicle miles traveled and reduce automobile
         emissions. See goals and policies in Making the Connections: the
         Circulation Chapter.
Considering air quality issues in the decision-making process will provide for
new development to result in limited emission levels.
Transportation and energy production are among the leading activities
associated with greenhouse gas emissions. As such, understanding how long-
range planning decisions and daily activities impact local air quality can
better inform decisions. As SB 375 recognizes, air quality issues are
intricately related to policies in the Managing Our Land Supply and Making
the Connections chapters that reduce use of and dependence on
automobiles. Implementation of sustainability policies throughout this
General Plan will help minimize the City’s contribution to global climate
change.
Biological Resources
Although Rialto is mostly developed, some areas remain that have not been
substantially disturbed. The majority of local biological resources are
associated with Lytle Creek Wash, which occupies the northern edge of the
City. Smaller pockets of open spaces exist east of the former Rialto
Municipal Airport and south of 7th Street.
                                                                                Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
   Biological resources in the Lytle Creek Wash area
Lytle Creek Wash provides a unique and valuable habitat for a diverse
collection of plants and animals within the following plant communities:
Riversidian sage scrub, Riversidian alluvial fan sage scrub, riparian habitat,
and ruderal1. Lytle Creek Wash does not connect regions of open space and
therefore does not function as a regional corridor. It does function as a local
(or small scale) corridor for wildlife movement within the creek and the San
Bernardino Mountains. This local corridor reaches beyond the Rialto
boundary to flood control channels approximately two miles southeast of
Highland Avenue.
The City of Rialto will continue to protect local biological resources through
careful land designation of resource areas, and by requiring development
projects in proximity to wildlife corridors to incorporate mitigation measures
to minimize impacts to such biological resources.
Areas Subject to Flooding
According to State law as revised in 2007 (AB 162), General Plan land use
chapters must identify and cities must annually review areas that are subject
to flooding, as identified by floodplain mapping by either the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Water
1
  A ruderal species is a plant species that is first to colonise disturbed lands. The disturbance may be
natural (e.g., wildfires or avalanches), or due to human influence - constructional (e.g., road construction,
building construction or mining), or agricultural (e.g., abandoned farming fields or abandoned irrigation
ditches).

Resources (DWR). Flooding concerns are discussed in detail in the Safety
and Noise Chapter. See Exhibit 5.2, Flooding Hazards, in the Safety and
Noise Chapter for identification of flood hazard areas.
FEMA, through the National Flood Insurance Program, produces Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that identify property and buildings in flood
insurance risk areas. FIRMs (2008) indicate areas that are subject to 100-year
and 500-year floods. The areas subject to 100-year floods are located along
Lytle Creek and Cajon Wash in the northern Sphere of Influence area and
the Santa Ana River in the southern portion of the City.
The State Department of Water Resources has initiated the Awareness
Floodplain Mapping project, with the goal of identifying all pertinent flood
hazard areas in California by 2015 for areas that are not mapped under the
FEMA National Flood Insurance Program, and to provide the community and
residents with an additional tool for understanding potential flood hazards
that are currently not mapped as a regulated floodplain. The awareness
maps identify the 100-year flood hazard areas using approximate assessment
procedures. As of 2010, the State Department of Water Resources had not
prepared any flood studies for San Bernardino County.
Goals and Policies
Land Use
Foothill Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan
Foothill Boulevard has been an important and vital transportation corridor
through Rialto for many years. It has served as part of the historic Route 66.
To create sense of place and identity unique to our community, the thematic
concept for streetscape improvements will be inspired by the Rialto Bridge in
Italy and will feature brick and river rock materials. The following goals and
policies promote that identity and encourage new development along the
corridor.
Goal 2-1:            Revitalize and enhance the Foothill Boulevard Corridor
                     into a place that supports economic development and
                     creates a sense of place and identity through the use of
                     appropriate streetscape design inspired by the Rialto
                     Bridge.
Policy 2-1.1:        Provide new opportunities along the Foothill Boulevard
                     Corridor for mixed-use residential, retail, and commercial
                     uses.

Policy 2-1.2:        Incorporate the Rialto Bridge streetscape theme —
                     including design, architecture, signage, landscaping, and
                     other visual elements.
Policy 2-1.3:        Require that properties fronting Foothill Boulevard
                     physically connect to each other to create continual
                     pedestrian connectivity along the corridor. Provide
                     pedestrian-friendly amenities such as shaded walking
                     areas, pedestrian-scale architecture, and commercial
                     buildings with pedestrian street entries.
Policy 2-1.4:        Improve the aesthetics of Foothill Boulevard to
                     encourage new development and revitalizing existing
                     development and make Foothill Boulevard a distinct
                     place, with identifying gateway treatments, that lets
                     people know when they have entered or exited the City
                     of Rialto.
Riverside Avenue Corridor
Riverside Avenue is the main roadway that connects the very northern tip of
Rialto to its very southern end. At nearly 12 miles long, this roadway
traverses a variety of neighborhoods and districts throughout Rialto. It
provides convenient connections to major transportation routes, including
the I-15, I-10, and SR-210 freeways. Riverside Avenue must be a corridor that
balances economic development while respecting the residential areas and
providing connections throughout Rialto. A portion of Riverside Avenue will
be regulated through the Downtown Rialto Plan.
Goal 2-2:            Develop the Riverside Avenue Corridor to become an
                     economically viable local service area.
Policy 2-2.1:        Prevent strip commercial development and other
                     inappropriate land uses such as industrial or logistics on
                     Riverside Avenue. Uses such as commercial, multi-unit
                     residential, and office would be deemed appropriate.
Policy 2-2.2:        In the Downtown area, require development to enhance
                     the corridor by framing the street with structures and
                     minimal setbacks. Structures should be from two to three
                     stories with storefronts or restaurants along the ground
                     floor. Shading for pedestrians such as arcades should be
                     encouraged.
Policy 2-2.3:        Encourage adaptive reuse of single-unit houses for office
                     and commercial uses on Riverside Avenue to strengthen
                     the compatibility of residential/commercial zones while
                     preserving the small-town quality of Downtown.

Valley Boulevard Corridor
As a roadway that includes frontage along the I-10 freeway, the City
recognizes the value of revitalizing and attracting development that can
provide sales tax revenues and employment opportunities, and takes
advantage of freeway visibility.
Goal 2-3:           Enhance and improve Valley Boulevard.
Policy 2-3.1:       Improve the visual characteristics of Valley Boulevard by
                    seeking funding to investment in infrastructure, signage,
                    design guidelines, etc. that enhance the public realm.
                    Such investment may attract additional private sector
                    investment, which will maintain the viability of the
                    corridor. Establish programs that outline the timing of the
                    installation of such infrastructure.
Policy 2-3.2:       Attract new development and revitalize established
                    commercial and industrial uses through economic
                    development and redevelopment strategies. The first
                    priority for development shall be areas within the City
                    borders. Areas within the Sphere of Influence are a
                    secondary priority.
Policy 2-3.3:       Enforce code enforcement actions to advance
                    maintenance of commercial and industrial properties,
                    storage areas, landscaping, and other maintenance issues.
Gateway Area
As one of the major southern gateways into the City of Rialto from the I-10
freeway, this area has the opportunity to make a great first impression on
residents and visitors.
Goal 2-4:           Create an attractive gateway into Rialto from the I-10
                    freeway.
Policy 2-4.1:       Improve the visual characteristics of the gateway area by
                    removing overhead power lines, developing a street
                    enhancement program for Riverside Avenue, removal of
                    abandoned buildings, and enhanced and themed
                    landscaping along the corridor.

                    place to shop and dine.
Policy 2-5.5:       Incorporate improvements necessary to upgrade alleys to
                    current standards, and refine their appearance, function,
                    and safety with landscape treatment, textured paving,
                    rear façade treatments, and parking and loading
                    improvements.
Policy 2-5.6:       Encourage a mix of retail shops and service centers to
                    meet the needs of residents living or shopping in the
                    Downtown and adjacent neighborhoods.
Policy 2-5.7:       Expand and enhance programs to revitalize Downtown
                    by enhancing its merchant promotions, merchandising,
                    beautification programs, and marketing.

Neighborhood Preservation
Rialto has many distinct neighborhoods. Each neighborhood was developed
during different periods of time, and each has a character of its own in terms
of housing style, development pattern, streetscape design, and building mass
and scale.
Goal 2-8:           Preserve     and    improve      established    residential
                    neighborhoods in Rialto.
Policy 2-8.1:       Promote neighborhood identity and preservation of
                    individual neighborhood character by preserving or
                    creating neighborhood gateway features. This includes
                    the Las Colinas Core Group and the North End (Pepper
                    Avenue) Neighborhood Group.
Policy 2-8.2:       Improve neighborhood housing maintenance and home

Policy 2-8.3:       Require all new housing built adjacent to designated
                    major or secondary highways to face a residential street,
                    with driveways on the side street. Require landscaped
                    barrier walls to preserve the privacy of residential side
                    yards and protect them from traffic noise and pollution.
Policy 2-8.4:       Discourage extreme changes in scale between adjacent
                    structures (i.e. multi-story building walls immediately
                    adjacent to single-unit residences). Encourage appropriate
                    setbacks and other architectural features that provide a
                    gradual change in scale.
Incompatible Land Uses
Goal 2-9:           Protect residential, schools, parks, and other sensitive

                    and retail areas.
Policy 2-9.1:       Require mitigation and utilize other techniques to protect
                    residential development and other sensitive land uses
                    near industrial land uses or within identified health risk
                    areas from excessive noise, hazardous materials and
                    waste releases, toxic air pollutant concentrations, and
                    other impacts.

                  pedestrian crossings, particularly near pedestrian activity
                  areas such as Downtown.
Policy 2-12.3:    Install curb extensions (i.e., bulb out or similar
                  enhancements) at pedestrian crossings to shorten the
                  crossing distance required, wherever feasible. Additional
                  pedestrian protections, including bollards and defensible
                  space landscape treatments, should be utilized as well.
Policy 2-12.4:    Enhance pedestrian walkways directly under building
                  canopies by one or more of the following techniques:
                  interlocking or textured paving, turf block walls, theme

                  REDEVELOPMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Sustainable Economic Future
A sustainable economic future is achieved through investments in economic
development, redevelopment, and infrastructure. Investments mean using
capital at the present time with the expectation of defined future benefits.
This chapter establishes objectives for the strategic investments of capital
that will allow the community to prosper into the future.
Economic Development
A healthy, sustainable local economy is managed through a number of tools.
First, the City must have a diverse businesses sector and a trained workforce,
railway and freeway accessibility, available land resources, and a business-
friendly environment. In addition, the City must have adequate and
appropriate infrastructure to support businesses and the community. Having
a proactive approach toward economic development will foster a balanced
economy and growing tax base, with revenues to sustain Rialto’s ever-
increasing public service demands and needs.
Economic development has the potential to:
        Create new jobs in the City so that people can work closer to home
        Create entry-level jobs for residents who are currently unemployed
         or underemployed
        Create higher-paying jobs so that people can move up the career
         ladder and afford homeownership
        Provide opportunities for local residents to start their own businesses
        Help existing businesses to grow and be more successful
        Expand goods and services available locally so that residents can
         shop in Rialto
        Attract more entertainment opportunities (theaters, restaurants, etc.)
         to local residents
        Improve the physical appearance of the community by redeveloping
         old, dilapidated or unsafe commercial buildings with new businesses
        Increase the tax base to generate revenues to support essential
         services such as police protection, fire protection, education, street
                                                                                 Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
         maintenance, infrastructure improvements and installation plus park
         and recreation programs.
        Encourage private investment in the City
This element describes the challenges facing the business community and
sets forth goals and policies to guide the City’s economic development
decisions.
Physical Context for Economic Development
Nearly 20 percent of Rialto’s land is devoted to industrial uses (2009), with
approximately half of this area devoted to light industrial business activity,
and the other half comprised of heavy manufacturing, processing, and
warehousing/trucking uses. The industrial areas are focused in three
locations: the northwestern portion of the City, west of downtown, and
south of Interstate 10.
Less than four percent of Rialto’s land is occupied by commercial and office
uses, which is generally located along major arterials such as Foothill
Boulevard, Valley Boulevard, Baseline Road, and along Riverside Avenue
near the entrances to I-10 and SR-210. Downtown is made up of an eclectic
mix of small offices, boutique retail, limited restaurant, and long-established
quasi-industrial uses which contribute to the diverse character of the area.
Challenges
The economic development challenges facing Rialto are related to the City’s
market position in the region. Given the dominance of regional retail centers
in neighboring cities, Rialto has long experienced “leakage” of resident retail
demand. That is, Rialto residents must make a significant portion of their
retail purchases (including general merchandise, apparel, furniture, and other
specialty sales) in other cities due to the absence of major shopping facilities
in the City. Many commercial centers in Rialto show signs of age and
deferred maintenance, making recruitment of new tenants difficult.
Given Rialto’s location and job centers located in San Bernardino and
Ontario, Rialto is likely only to experience modest demand for new office
space over the next 20 to 30 years. This is due to the leveling of demand for
office space within the region and aggressive development from the
surrounding communities. However, ample land is available through the
redevelopment of the Rialto Airport area for industrial, commercial, office,
and residential uses with great potential for local and regional draw due to
its proximity to SR-210.

                                           INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE:
                                           ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,
                 REDEVELOPMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Confronting these Challenges
The City’s economic development programs and policies must respond to
these known challenges and take advantage of Rialto’s strengths.
       Rialto has limited freeway frontage and visibility on both the SR-210
        and I-10 freeways due to physical constraints at the City/freeway
        boundaries. Much of the I-10 frontage is blocked by the railroad
        tracks or is part of the City’s Sphere of Influence. The SR-210
        frontage is depressed in a trench, impeding the visibility of projects.
        However, these physical challenges can be overcome with strategies
        involving economics and development incentives.
       The City has good regional railway and freeway accessibility.
        Proximity to Los Angeles and Orange Counties has allowed Rialto
        and the Inland Empire to be one of the fastest-growing industrial
        areas in the nation. Rialto experienced more than a doubling of
        industrial space between 2004 and 2007.
       Recycling and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized buildings
        and land has the potential to stimulate and foster economic
        revitalization in key areas of the City.
       Future development on the Rialto Airport site and along SR-210
        offers new opportunities to increase the City’s economic base
        through the development of a wide array of uses.
With limited vacant land remaining, the few areas available for future
development (or redevelopment) represent the last best chance to create
economic benefits on a large scale and for the long term.
Expanding or relocating businesses requires space, infrastructure,
surrounding amenities, and local government cooperation. The City will
collaborate with the business community to facilitate growth, development,
and infrastructure improvements that benefit residents and businesses alike.
Decisions will be made with an eye toward the long-term vision and goal for
economic viability and not simply to respond to immediate proposals or
market fluctuations.
Redevelopment
Over time, neighborhoods and communities follow a cycle of creation,
growth, stabilization, and ultimately decline if private investment does not
continue. Redevelopment is one of the most effective ways to revitalize
older, deteriorated areas, foster neighborhood stability, and encourage
private investment.
                                                                                Chapter Page
                                                                                   3     3-3

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
California redevelopment law allows cities to create redevelopment agencies
and associated project areas. Through redevelopment, project areas receive
focused attention and financial investment to reverse deteriorating trends,
create jobs, revitalize the business climate, rehabilitate, preserve and expand
the housing stock, and encourage increase private investment, which would
not otherwise occur. Redevelopment agencies are also able to acquire
property, consolidate parcels into larger sites to attract developers, and fund
new investments in public improvements, and affordable housing
development.
The key tool that redevelopment agencies have to finance these
improvements is called tax increment financing. When an agency adopts a
redevelopment plan, the assessed property values within a redevelopment
project area become fixed. As property values within the project area
increase over time, the agency garners the additional tax growth in tax
revenues above the base year. Agencies may use this “increment” on an
annual basis or pledge the projected revenues to issue bonds for larger
capital projects guaranteed by projected future tax revenues. The agency
uses this financing mechanism to make public improvements that benefit
businesses located within the project areas.
Redevelopment Context
The Rialto Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was formed with the goal of
eliminating blight and provides the means to grow the City’s economic base.
The RDA is overseen by the Agency Board, which is made up of City
Council members, coordinates City efforts associated with industrial, retail,
office, and residential development within redevelopment project areas.
These efforts include the provision of off-site public improvements, financing,
redevelopment assistance, site evaluation, and infrastructure construction.
Rialto has a Merged Redevelopment Plan area, which includes five separate
redevelopment areas that originally were separately established:
        Industrial (adopted in 1979)
        Gateway (adopted in 1985)
        Agua Mansa (adopted 1988)
        Central Business District (adopted 1990)
        The Added Territory (adopted 2002)
Industrial Project Area
The Industrial Project Area consists of the two sub-areas shown in Exhibit 3-
1. Sub-Area A contains a large expanse of land located in north Rialto and
includes the Rialto Municipal Airport facility. With the planned closing of the
airport, the area will be redeveloped as a jobs-focused district supported by
new neighborhoods. Sub-area B, which is located west of the Central
Business District, contains a variety of businesses and industrial uses.

                  REDEVELOPMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Gateway Project Area
The Gateway Project Area spans the area around I-10. The focus of this
project area is to reduce visual blight at the southern entrance to the City.
Additional efforts include planning for efficient use of underutilized
properties and relieving traffic congestion. This area is well suited for retail
development opportunities given its freeway frontage and proximity and
available land.
Agua Mansa
The Agua Mansa Project Area, located in part of southern Rialto is part of a
large, regional industrial district that has had significant investment.
Objectives for this area include maintaining and enhancing opportunities for
industrial activity, employment creation, and infrastructure improvements.
Central Business District
The Central Business District Project Area covers the core Downtown area.
From the community’s earliest agricultural days, Downtown has served as
the heart of Rialto. The City’s oldest residential neighborhoods surround
Downtown, which supports a mix of retail, service, and quasi-industrial
businesses. A Metrolink rail station is also located within the Central Business
District. The City recognizes the potential of Downtown to regain its place as
a community focal point, land use policies must aim to intensify and diversify
Downtown, and to gradually phase out uses inconsistent with this vision.
The Added Territory
The Added Territory, which was annexed into an older planning area called
the Merged Project Area, consists of 3,400 acres of non-contiguous sites
scattered throughout the City. A key area within the Added Territory is
Foothill Boulevard. The Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan establishes a
revitalization strategy for the City’s key east-west arterial.

Infrastructure
Public utility infrastructure, although often invisible, is an essential physical
support system that enables us to live healthy, productive lives. These
include reliable water supply systems, effective sewage collection and
treatment facilities, storm water control, and energy and telecommunications
systems. In Rialto, the City maintains a portion of the water distribution
system and local sewage collection/treatment and storm drain systems.
Water
Rialto residents and business are served by three water agencies: the City of
Rialto Department of Public Works Water Division, the West Valley Water
District (WVWD), and the Fontana Water Company (FWC), as shown in
Exhibit 3-2. Each agency has an adjudicated supply of water from several
sources, including groundwater basins in the area.
Rialto Public Works Department Water Division
The Water Division services approximately 8.5 square miles in the central
portion of the City, from Baseline Avenue to Rialto Avenue, with a narrow
extension in the south to I-10. In 2006, residential users in the service area
consumed an average of 6.3 million gallons of water per day (mgd).
Commercial, industrial, and agricultural users consumed an additional 4.1
mgd.
The City’s primary source of water is City-owned water wells. These wells
draw water from four water basins. In 2006, nearly two-thirds of the total
production of the water supply was pumped out of these water basins: Lytle
Creek Surface Water Basin, Rialto Ground Water Basin, Bunkerhill Ground
Water Basin, and Chino Hill Ground Water Basin. The City is also
contractually entitled to receive 2,500 acre-feet per year of water from the
San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (SBVMWD) through the
baseline feeder and an additional 1.5 mgd from the WVWD’s Water
Filtration Plant. In 2006, SBVMWD provided 26 percent of City’s total water,
and seven percent came from the WVWD.
The Rialto Water Division has experienced a reduction in its groundwater
supplies as a result of two primary factors: 1) declining water levels caused
by long-term drought conditions, and over-exploitation of groundwater from
various water agencies and 2) the shutdown of several available wells due to
perchlorate contamination. The City has installed wellhead treatments on
several wells to remove the perchlorate to non-detection levels and has
removed other wells from service. As a result of shutdowns, the available
                                                                                  Chapter Page

production capacity was reduced by nearly 48 percent, placing the City in a
water supply emergency.
In addition to providing water to customers within its service area, Rialto’s
Department of Public Works Water Division has an agreement with the
Marygold Mutual Water Company (MMWC) to deliver a maximum of 12
mgd to MMWC. This water is used to service the unincorporated
community of Bloomington within the City’s Sphere of Influence.
West Valley Water District
The West Valley Water District serves Rialto residents and businesses north
of Highland Avenue, as well as an area south of Rialto Avenue to the
southern City limit.
West Valley Water District is a public agency which operates as a semi-
autonomous special district, with some aspects of its operations monitored
by the SBVMWD. WVWD encompasses approximately 29 square miles. The
average water demand is nearly 19 mgd, and approximately 50 percent is
used to serve Rialto residents.
WVWD derives water from three sources: local surface water, groundwater,
and State Water Project. WVWD is authorized to draw water from five
groundwater basins: Lytle Creek, Rialto/Colton, Bunker Hill, North Riverside,
and Chino.
Fontana Water Company
The Fontana Water Company serves properties along Rialto’s western edge
(Exhibit 3.2). Unlike the other agencies operating in the City, the Fontana
Water Company is a private investor-owned company regulated by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
Fontana Water Company produces water from wells in the Chino Basin,
Lytle Basin, Rialto Basin, and an Unnamed Basin, and from surface water
flow diverted from Lytle Creek. The Company also purchases untreated State
Water Project water from SBVMWD.
Perchlorate Contamination
Perchlorate has been found in the local groundwater basins, a major source
for the City’s drinking water supply. Perchlorate is a major ingredient in solid
rocket fuel, munitions, and fireworks. Since the 1950s, several companies in
northern Rialto have manufactured products that use perchlorate. During
2005, levels of perchlorate contamination increased significantly in wells
near the former rocket fuel facility, forming a plume that is moving in a
                                                                                 Chapter Page

southeasterly direction. This plume, as it expands, will continue to impact the
supply of water to Rialto customers.
The City has instituted a zero-policy measure, whereas if any trace of
percholrate is found in a drinking well, the well is shut down. The City’s goal
is ensure that no detectable perchlorate is allowed into the Rialto water
system. The City has also installed wellhead treatments to remove
perchlorate. These wellhead treatments remove the perchlorate to non-
detection levels. Some of the wells affected have been shut down and are no
longer in service, but are targeted for treatment in the near future. As a result
of these shutdowns, the available production capacity was reduced
significantly and has placed the City in a water supply emergency.
The City is working hard to pursue those who are responsible for the
contamination and that they compensate for the removal of the perchorate
from the City’s water system.
Recycled Water
Recycled water is former wastewater that has been treated to remove solids
and certain impurities, and is available for non-potable uses. In an effort to
conserve potable water and utilize reclaimed water as a substitute for the
landscape irrigation demands of larger users, the City installed a 16-inch
transmission pipeline from the Rialto Waste Water Treatment Plant to
smaller distribution lines. This pipeline supplies reclaimed water to Caltrans
for the irrigation of landscaping along I-10. In 2006, the City supplied
Caltrans with over 40 million gallons of reclaimed water.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program calls for the expansion of tertiary
treatment plants and reclaimed water systems to meet demand for irrigation
water and reduce the need to purchase water from wholesalers. Rialto is
pursing Federal grants to help fund capital improvements projects to expand
recycled water. The City also prepared a Wastewater Master Plan that
investigated recycle water systems as a way to supplement the City’s water
supply and reduce the need to purchase water. The plan analyzed the
feasibility of converting an unused water main along Riverside Avenue for
recycled water distribution and identified potential landscape irrigation
customers.
Water Conservation
Water conservation represents a cost-effective and environmentally sound
way to reduce current and future water demand and energy usage.
Homeowners and business owners can take many actions to reduce water
use, such as using water-conserving fixtures and appliances, fixing leaks,
planting drought-tolerant landscaping, and avoiding unnecessary water use.

In an effort to reduce the amount of water that must be obtained from
regional and local sources, some of the municipal water districts have
initiated efforts to conserve water by all Rialto customers. Water
conservation is an integral part of sustainably ensuring the long-term
reliability of the water supply.
The City should work with municipal water districts to provide implement
strategies and programs to effectively conserve water. The City should also
revised landscaping requirements in the Zoning Ordinance by limiting the
amount of turf in new development, requiring the use of drought-tolerant
plants, and implement other methods in reducing water use. Drought-
tolerant planting should also be incorporated into all City landscape projects.
Wastewater
The City of Rialto owns, operates, and maintains the local public sanitary
sewer system, which includes a wastewater collection system and treatment
plant that serve most properties within the City limits. Unsewered areas lie
south of Santa Ana Avenue, and include a small number of older residential
structures on the eastern and western edges of the City.
Wastewater Collection System
The wastewater collection system consists of more than 150 miles of vitrified
clay pipes and was designed and laid out as a gravity flow system to take
advantage of the general northwest to southeast slope of the City. The
system ends in the southeast section of the City, close to the Santa Ana
River, where the sewer treatment plant is located.
The life expectancy of a sewer system, barring the expansion necessary due
to growth, ranges from 50 to 100 years. The City has plans to expand its
sewer services to all lands within the City and Sphere of Influence. The
capacity of the sewer system is adequate to handle the demand of existing
development within the City, but expansion of the plant is necessary due to
capacity strains caused by new development and storm water overflows.
Constructed originally in 1956, the Rialto Wastewater Treatment Plant treats
domestic and commercial/industrial wastewater generated within the City of
Rialto and portions of the city of Fontana. The facility consists of the original
plant and four independent treatment plants built successively in 1965,
1981, 1994, and 1998 to accommodate Rialto’s growth. The combined total
treatment design capacity of the plants is over 12 mgd.
The transmission – conveyance infrastructure system is adequate for the
existing developed areas. The conveyance system will need to be upgraded
capacity wise to convey sewer flows from new development to the
treatment plant. New development may pursue other alternatives such as
                                                                                  Chapter Page

Various components of the treatment plant are in need of repair. The Capital

continuous use. Inefficiency and poor quality in the filtrate systems and
underground tanks are in need of upgrade and component repairs. The
Wastewater Treatment Plant Master Plan has been prepared to outline a
phased approach to improving the reliability of the operating systems.
Solid Waste
Rialto contracts with private waste haulers for the collection, transfer,
recycling, and disposal of waste. Most refuse is disposed of at the Mid-Valley
Sanitary Landfill located within the City limits.
The Mid-Valley Sanitary Landfill is owned and operated by the County of San
Bernardino Solid Waste Management Division and is located north of
Highland Avenue, between Alder Avenue and Sierra Avenue. The site
encompasses 498 acres, of which about 222 acres (as of 2009) are being
used for waste disposal activities. Once the landfill has reached capacity, the
County has pledged to reclaim the site as open space with recreation
amenities appropriate for the site. Unit 1 has reached capacity, and the
County should develop the site as part of an agreement made in 1998.
Energy Utilities
In Rialto, the Southern California Gas Company and Southern California
Edison’s Eastern Division provide natural gas and electric power services,
respectively. These service providers install and maintain mainline systems
throughout the City. Generally, the distribution systems adequately serve
local customers, and the companies provide upgrades over time as needed
to meet changing demands. Both encourage conservation by consumers.
Telecommunications
Telecommunications is the communication of information over a distance.
This covers many media and technologies, including radio, fiber optics,
television, telephone, data communication, and computer networking. The
advancement of telecommunications has changed dramatically with the use
of the Internet, wireless networking, portable computers, cell phones, global
positioning systems (GPS), and other technological advancements.
Increasingly, campuses, business complexes, hotels, and coffee houses offer
wireless connections. In the years to come, technology will continue to
advance, and the nature of telecommunications will continue to evolve.
The City approves exclusive franchise contracts to service providers.
However, as telecommunications technologies continue to evolve, the City

                 REDEVELOPMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE
will need to respond to consumer demand for enhanced or expanded
services. Through state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure, Rialto
can attract a broader array of businesses and better serve residents.
Meeting Demand for Evolving Utility Services
All types of utility services can be expected to change over time due to
technological advances and changing consumer demands. The City’s role –
because it does not provide these services directly – is to work with utility
companies to plan for expanded services to meet growth; ensure the
provision of reliable energy and other utilities; and enhance
telecommunication services in all geographic areas of Rialto. The City must
and will look to see how infrastructure and services can be enhanced to
meet the specific needs of businesses Rialto looks to attract.
A major issue in Rialto is high winds, which can weaken electrical and
telephone overhead lines and lead to outages from storm events. While
overhead cable are less expensive to install, maintenance can quickly add to
costs. The City encourages underground utilities to be provided to minimize
interruption and maintain high-quality services.
Public Services and Facilities
The quality of public services and facilities in a city reflects the importance
city leaders place on the social and physical health of its residents. The City
of Rialto is dedicated to providing quality recreation, leisure, and community
services to its residents. The Recreation and Community Services
Department manages a multitude of diverse City programs and facilities that
respond to the needs of an ever-changing demographic. The facilities
represent a significant investment and show Rialto’s commitment to
providing places to build community (see Exhibit 3.3).
As the population of Rialto grows and changes, so will the demand for public
services and facilities. However, with high maintenance costs and limited
public funding, the City will need to continually assess appropriate allocation
of resources.
Education and Library
Rialto is served by three school districts: the Rialto Unified School District
(RUSD), Fontana Unified School District (FUSD), and Colton Joint Unified
School District (CJUSD), which serves a small portion of southern Rialto and
Bloomington. RUSD serves over 30,000 students with a 55-square-mile area.
RUSD has 17 elementary schools, five middle schools, three high schools,
one continuation high school, and one alternative high school (see Exhibit
3.4). For younger children, families have access to over 15 pre-school

Introduction
The Circulation Element is one of seven mandated elements of the General
Plan and is intended to guide the development of the City's circulation
system in a manner that is compatible with the Land Use Element. Due to
the importance of a well-planned circulation system, the State of California
has mandated the adoption of a citywide Circulation Element since 1955.
The current State mandate for a Circulation Element is found in Government
Code section 65302(b), which states that the General Plan shall include:
         “... a circulation element consisting of the general location
         and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
         transportation routes, terminals, and other local public
         utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element
         of the plan."
The anticipated level and pattern of development will generate demand for
travel throughout the City that must be accommodated by the roadway
system, public transportation, and non-motorized forms of transportation. In
addition, Rialto’s increasing prominence as a logistics hub will create a
demand for goods movement throughout the City that must be
accommodated by commercial vehicles and railroads. To help meet these
demands and achieve balanced growth, the City has adopted specific goals
and policies which serve as the basis for the Circulation Element. 4-
Circulation and land use planning are intertwined. The nature, routing, and
design of circulation facilities are among the major determinants of the form
of human settlement and uses of land, and the intertie of land uses creates a
demand for circulation facilities. State law requires consistency among all the
elements of the General Plan.
The Circulation Chapter provides policy direction to create a system of
Complete Streets. Complete Streets refers to a multi-modal transportation
network designed and operated meet the needs of all users. Pedestrians,
bicyclists, motorists, persons with disabilities, movers of commercial goods,
and public transportation users of all ages and abilities are able to safely
access and use streets and transportation modes to reach their destinations.
Implementing a Complete Streets program involves:
        Identifying the hierarchy of travel corridors in the City;
        defining a Citywide Transit Plan;
        identifying a Citywide Bicycle Network;
        including provisions for bike lanes on many roadway types in the
         roadway design standards; and
        includes policies and implementation actions to encourage the use
         of transit, bicycling, and walking.
                                                                                Chapter Page
                                                                                   4     4-1

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
This Chapter implements the Complete Streets concept by identifying a
hierarchy of travel corridors that accommodates car trips, bike trips,
pedestrian movement, trucks, and transit.
Exhibit 4.1 establishes a hierarchy of street classifications that allows vehicles
to move efficiently through Rialto, with arterials adapted to provide for safe
pedestrian movement at intersections. Complementing the road network
are designated routes for transit (Exhibit 4.2), including bus rapid transit
along Foothill Boulevard, and a Citywide Bicycle network (Exhibit 4.4) that
will make bicycling more convenient and safer. Exhibit 4.5 shows routes for
trucks.
Through the goals and policies of this Chapter, the City will strive to meet
diverse mobility needs and reduce vehicle miles travelled, which will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, address climate change, and mitigate roadway
congestion. Other benefits that come with implementation of Complete
Streets will be a higher level of public safety.
Circulation Context
Rialto began as a railroad town. Rialto’s historic core and Downtown
developed around two historic rail lines that connected Rialto and the Inland
Empire to the rest of Southern California. These rail lines allowed the
movement of citrus, goods, and people into the region. But more
importantly, they allowed people from elsewhere to be introduced to Rialto.
And many found it to be a place to call home.
Today, major roadways and freeways move Rialto residents and visitors
throughout the City and to regional destinations. However, the historical
transportation roots are still planted in Rialto, serving Rialto residents with
alternative methods of travel other than the automobile. One rail line is now
used for commuter rail transit connecting to San Bernardino and Los Angeles
and elsewhere via Metrolink. The former Pacific Electric line, now an
abandoned rail line but currently undeveloped within Rialto, will emerge as a
regional bike route, connecting designations throughout the Inland Empire.
Rialto is served by several major regional freeways, two major
freight/commuter railroad lines, an extensive roadway network, and several
transit lines. The regional and local roadway system is a hierarchal system of
highways and local streets developed to provide regional traffic movement
and local access. Interstate 10 (I-10) and State Route 210 (SR-210) traverse
the City in an east-west direction, providing regional access to most of the
City. Interstate 15 (I-15) also provides access to the northern portion of the
City. The City’s roadway network is generally based on a grid system, with
major arterials spaced one to two miles apart. Along the northern City
border, Riverside Avenue runs from northwest to southeast, paralleling the
Lytle Creek Wash.

A Plan for Our Streets
Rialto has established a roadway classification system with the following five
functional classifications: Major Arterial Highway, Major Arterial, Secondary
Arterial, Collector Street, and Local Street. In addition, four modifications of
the Major Arterial classification have been established for selected locations
with special or unique characteristics.
Freeways
Freeways are multi-lane, limited-access, high-volume, high-speed roadways
constructed for regional and interregional vehicular travel. Access to these
facilities is restricted to interchange ramps at selected roadways along their
route. Freeways are under the jurisdiction of the California Department of         SR-210 freeway
Transportation (Caltrans).                                                         through Rialto

Major Arterial Highway
A Major Arterial Highway can accommodate six lanes of traffic and has a
raised median. Driveway access to this roadway is typically limited to
provide efficient high-volume flow. Bloomington Avenue is the only Major
Arterial Highway in Rialto.

Major Arterials are generally the largest of the local surface street roadways,
linking freeways with local streets to accommodate larger volumes of
through traffic moving at higher speeds than local streets. These facilities
carry high traffic volumes and are primary thoroughfares that connect Rialto
with adjacent cities and the regional highway system. Typically, Major
Arterials have at least two lanes of travel in each direction, left-turn lanes at
intersections, and parking lanes, and are designed to accommodate high
speeds. To provide a sufficient level of safety and traffic flow, the number of
driveways along Major Arterials is limited.

Secondary Arterials have two lanes of travel in each direction and left-turn
lanes, and typically accommodate or accommodate intermediate traffic
speeds. Travel lanes must be narrower than on Major Arterials. Parking is
often permitted along the curb. Although through traffic will utilize
Secondary Arterials, their primary purpose is to link Local Streets with Major

Minimizing Local Congestion and Protecting Our
Neighborhoods
The City of Rialto’s Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan (NTMP)
provides the City and its residents with options to address traffic-related
impacts that involve local neighborhood streets. Such impacts include
speeding, other vehicle code violations, high traffic volumes, and pedestrian
and bicycle safety. The NTMP encourages the formation of traffic
management associations in neighborhoods. The City’s Capital Improvement
Program (CIP) allocates annual funding for implementation of traffic
improvements identified by the associations.
The NTMP includes the establishment of policy guidelines, opportunities for
public participation, education and enforcement strategies, and the
recommendation of traffic control devices and criteria for their use. The
NTMP provides for traffic management that actively solicits resident
involvement. Resident concerns that are recurrent around a specific issue
would require the establishment of a more comprehensive plan to address
the specific issue.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
The traffic management strategies outlined in the NTMP follow the same
steps for evaluation and implementation. In some cases, it may be necessary
to follow every step, whereas some cases would only require certain steps to
be followed. The steps include the following:
     1. Input and identification of reported issue
     2. Confirmation and investigation of reported issue
     3. Consideration of potential alternative solutions
     4. Review of selected solutions
     5. Modification of selected solutions
     6. Transportation Commission recommendations
     7. City Council action
     8. Polling of residents in the affected area
     9. Design of solution to be implemented
     10. Construction
     11. Evaluation of effectiveness
This plan works effectively to allow residents identify concerns, and the City
to investigate and resolve neighborhood traffic issues.
Unique Parking Conditions
Rialto permits on-street parking on most Local, Collector, and Secondary
Arterial streets. Many Major Arterial streets do not have on-street parking
available, as such parking can interfere with traffic flow. However, along
Riverside Avenue through Downtown, on-street parking provides easy
access to the shops and other business fronting on the avenue. Consistent
with Downtown enhancement goals, unique on-street parking approaches
will continue to be used on Riverside Avenue.
As Rialto encourages mixed-use development in certain areas to take
advantage of nearby transit, non-standard parking requirements will be fully
explored to respond to requests for shared parking facilities or parking
districts.
Park-and-Ride Facilities
As the commuter population grows, so does the need for parking at park-
and-ride facilities. Park-and-ride lots at the Rialto Metrolink Station and Cedar
Avenue (to serve commuters using I-10) will be expanded as necessary in
response to commuter demand, and the City will monitor the need for
similar facilities near SR-210.

Riding Rail and Bus Transit
Public transit service in Rialto includes local fixed-route bus services provided
by Omnitrans and Metrolink commuter rail service. Omnitrans also provides
para-transit services to persons with disabilities.
Fixed-Route Services
Omnitrans is the transit operator for the San Bernardino Valley area. In 2010,
Omnitrans operated five bus routes serving Rialto, with destinations to
locations outside the City as well (Exhibit 4.2). As Exhibit 4.2 shows,
Omnitrans and Metrolink routes generally provide most residents and
businesses with ready access to bus or rail service. Underserved areas are
along SR-210 and in the industrial areas at the southern end of the City.
Omnitrans’ Systemwide Transit Corridor Plan for the San Bernardino Valley
identifies key transit corridors for the introduction of higher-quality transit
service, such as higher frequency express, or Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
services. Corridor 2 (Foothill East) will include BRT service on Foothill
Boulevard through Rialto. Another corridor being looked at for long-term
growth includes San Bernardino Avenue.
Metrolink commuter ridership generally consists of people using the train to
get to jobs in downtown Los Angeles or other job-dense areas. While the
Rialto station serves mostly as an embarkation point, if a broader jobs base
develops around the area, it may also become a commuter destination.
Rialto is fully committed to supporting transit that allows Rialto residents to
easily travel within and beyond the City without a car, and to bring people
into Rialto for work, shopping, and recreation.
Para-Transit Service
Omnitrans also provides persons with physical or cognitive disabilities
specialized transit service through its Access program. Access is a service
designed to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA). Access provides curb-to-curb service to complement the Omnitrans
fixed-route bus system. The Access service area is defined as up to three-
quarter miles on either side of an existing bus route.

Bikeway Classifications
Bikeways are classified in three categories as follows:
         A Class I Bikeway (Bike Path) is intended for the exclusive use of
          bicycles. While it may parallel a roadway, it is physically separated by
          distance or a vertical barrier.
         A Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) shares the right-of-way with a
          roadway or walkway. It is indicated by a bikeway pictograph on the
          pavement and a continuous stripe on the pavement, or is separated
          by a continuous or intermittent curb or other low barrier.
         A Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) shares the right-of-way with a
          roadway or walkway. It is not indicated by a continuous stripe on the
          pavement or separated by any type of barrier, but it is identified as a
          bikeway with signage.
The schematic diagrams in Exhibit 4.3 illustrate the width and features of
each bikeway classification.
Bikeway Network
The Bikeway Master Plan illustrated in Exhibit 4.4 promotes a safe and
efficient network of bikeways for recreational and commuter use within the
City. The planned bike network is not a contiguous network. Efforts should
be made to expand the network and provide continuity within the City and
to the networks of adjacent jurisdictions. Utility easements, flood control
channels, and unused rail rights-of-way provide opportunities for locations of
Class I bikeways. A “rails-to-trails” conversion of the former Pacific Electric
Railroad right-of-way will be pursued once funding is acquired and all rail
activities cease operation. The line is still active from the easterly city limits to
Lilac Avenue. It serves a lumber yard at Lilac Avenue and Rialto Avenue. The
rail line is inactive west of Lilac Avenue.
These routes are located both on street and off street to reduce bicycle
conflicts with automobiles and pedestrians while maintaining connectivity.
Continuing challenges for bikeways in Rialto include improved crossings
over the SR-210 freeway, improvements at intersections, and improved
cross-town connections and routes to schools.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Walking
Almost every trip begins and ends with a pedestrian trip. In addition, walking
is often the only means of transportation that can satisfy the many short trips
required in a city's central business district. The safety and convenience of
pedestrians are important quality of life factors. A safe pedestrian system that
links commercial, residential, and open space uses offers several benefits:
improved health for those who walk, reduced vehicle emissions, and
improved security with “eyes on the street” as people move within their
neighborhoods to nearby destinations.
Pedestrian circulation and recreation are primarily provided for on the
sidewalk. Sidewalk access is sometimes reduced by the intrusion of sidewalk
impediments such as newspaper boxes, signs, plantings, and garbage cans.
Sidewalk paraphernalia often appears in clusters at intersections, the most
critical points in the pedestrian circulation system, where pedestrians wait for
and potentially come into conflict with traffic.
To improve pedestrian safety and encourage walking, specific improvements
can be made based on site-specific issues:
        Sidewalk widening
        Use of special paving or markings at pedestrian/vehicle interfaces
        Improve sidewalk signing
        Improve signal phasing and pedestrian flow patterns at intersections
        Use turning restrictions on vehicles at intersections
        Provide sidewalk curb cuts for the physically challenged
        Use auditory cross walk signals for the hearing impaired
        Increase the number of street trees along sidewalks to provide shade
        Provide for safe, well lighted rest areas such as shaded benches or
         planter boxes
        Countdown Pedestrian Signal
As part of all development proposals, the City will require developers to
investigate and provide features that will enhance the pedestrian
environment. Also, the City will conduct comprehensive audits of the
following areas to identify strategies to create better pedestrian experiences:
        Riverside Avenue from Foothill Boulevard to Merrill Avenue
        Foothill Boulevard
        Downtown

Goods Movement
One of Rialto’s great strengths is its location. With easy access to I-10 and
SR-210, three major rail lines, and proximity to LA/Ontario International
Airport, Rialto is attractive to goods movement businesses. Many logistics
companies continue to locate in Rialto.
Truck Routes
To accommodate the large volumes of truck traffic associated with goods
movement, ensure appropriate road construction and maintenance, and to
protect the residential neighborhoods, certain arterials have been designated
as truck routes. These arterial truck routes are illustrated in Exhibit 4.5.
Caltrans has designated two trucks route classes based on California
legislation: National Network and Terminal Access routes. The truck routes
in Rialto are defined as Terminal Access routes, which is a State or local
road. These routes are portions of State routes or local roads that can
accommodate Surface Transportation Assistance Act standard trucks. TA
routes allow STAA trucks to: 1) travel between National Network (NN)
routes, 2) reach a truck’s operating facility, or 3) reach a facility where freight
originates, terminates, or is handled in the transportation process.
Freight Rail
Three railroad corridors traverse Rialto. The primary corridor, owned by
Union Pacific Railroad (UP), parallels the I-10 freeway and carries large
volumes of rail freight traffic, including traffic between the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach and the Colton rail hub east of Rialto. This rail
corridor is grade separated through the City, with crossings at Cedar Avenue
and Riverside Avenue.

                                       THE CIRCULATION CHAPTER
A second rail corridor traverses the City parallel to and one-quarter mile
south of Rialto Avenue. This corridor is owned by the Southern California
Regional Rail Authority, which operates the Metrolink commuter rail
network. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) trains also utilize this
corridor. Several at-grade rail/roadway crossings exist along this corridor.
The third rail corridor traverses the City parallel to and north of Rialto
Avenue. This corridor was once used by the Pacific Electric Railway and is
now owned by Union Pacific. No trains traverse this corridor, and
neighboring cities have reinvented the corridor as a multi-use trail. West of
Riverside Avenue, Rialto will pursue development of a similar “Rails-to-Trails.”
Regional Airports
Several municipal and regional airports are near Rialto. The closest
commercial airport is Los Angeles World Airport’s (LAWA) LA/Ontario
International Airport, located approximately 12 miles to the west. Ontario
serves international travelers and is a significant shipping hub. San
Bernardino International Airport, located eight miles east, has limited general
aviation and cargo service but looks to expand its operations in the future.
With the closing of Rialto Municipal Airport in late 2010 or early 2011,
general aviation service will continue to be available at Cable Airport at
Upland, Chino Airport, Riverside Municipal Airport, Flabob Airport in
Rubidoux, and Redland Municipal Airport (see Exhibit 4.6).

                                THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
Introduction
Rialto emphasizes a proactive approach to planning which involves
mitigating hazards present in the environment that may adversely affect
property and threaten lives. Government Code Sections 65302(g) and
65302(f) and California Health and Safety Code Section 56050.1 identify
hazards that this element must address if conditions are present in the City.
Hazards of concern in Rialto are:
        Seismic and Geologic Hazards
        Flood Hazards
        Fire Hazards
        Hazardous Materials
        Gangs
        Emergency Response
        Wind Hazards
Rialto recognizes the importance of providing a safe living environment for
its residents. While the City may not be able to prevent most of these
hazards, it can set forth policies that can help minimize their effects. By
addressing issues of crime, hazardous materials use, and other human-
caused conditions, and preparing a response to uncontrollable natural
hazards, such as earthquakes and fires, Rialto can be better prepared to deal
with emergency situations and adverse conditions and events that threaten
the community.
Seismic and Geologic Hazards
Rialto is located in a region with sharp contrasts in terrain. The gently sloping
lands in south Rialto abruptly confront the rise of the San Gabriel Mountains
to the north – a result of tectonic movement of the San Andreas Fault and its
subsidiary faults. The poorly consolidated alluvium underlying virtually all
properties in the City can result in devastating effects in the event of an
earthquake. Seismic and geologic hazards have the greatest potential for
causing devastating damage citywide.
Earthquakes can affect widespread areas, trigger many secondary effects,
and overwhelm the ability of local jurisdictions to respond. Although it is
impossible to predict the timing of seismic events, sound planning practices
and public education can help minimize the associated effects.
Surface Fault Rupture
Surface fault rupture refers to the physical displacement of the ground during
an earthquake. Although ground rupture usually results in minimal damage,
structures located close to a rupturing fault may be severely damaged. The
State Alquist-Priolo Fault Zoning Act was enacted with the purpose of
                                                                                  Chapter Page
                                                                                     5     5-1

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
mitigating the hazard of fault rupture by prohibiting buildings along all active
fault lines. Current Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones in and near Rialto
area are shown on Exhibit 5.1.
As Exhibit 5.1 indicates, significant faulting occurs along the Lytle Creek
Wash. The San Andreas fault — the feature that defines the coming together
of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates — crosses just to the
northeast, through the city of San Bernardino. Rialto sits atop the Pacific
Plate, which is moving north relative to San Bernardino. In about 15 million
years — a short time in the context of Earth’s history, but not significant
regarding real estate purchases — Rialto will be hundreds of miles north of
San Francisco.
Ground Shaking
The greatest source of earthquake damage is caused by ground shaking.
Rialto is susceptible to ground shaking caused by the several local fault
systems. Historically, Rialto has experienced moderate to strong ground
shaking associated with such events as the 1812 Wrightwood earthquake
(estimated 7.5 magnitude), 1899 Cajon Pass earthquake (estimated 5.7
magnitude), 1933 Long Beach earthquake (6.4 magnitude), 1971 Sylmar
earthquake (6.6 magnitude), and 1994 Northridge earthquake (6.7
magnitude). Several earthquakes were associated with the San Jacinto, San
Andreas, and Cucamonga faults (see Exhibit 5-1).
The San Jacinto, San Andreas, and Cucamonga faults have the potential of
generating earthquakes of maximum magnitudes ranging from 6.7 to 8.0.
Shaking at these levels would cause even moderate damage to buildings
constructed with the latest building codes.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Flooding Hazards
Rialto and surrounding areas are subject to unpredictable seasonal rainfall.
During intense rainfall, the geographic and geologic characteristics typical of
the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, where Rialto is located, make this area
especially vulnerable to flood hazards. The gently sloping alluvial fan upon
which Rialto sits emanates from a deep canyon within the San Gabriel
Mountains; this contributes to the City’s vulnerability to flood hazards.
In the early 1900s, the region was subjected to episodes of severe flooding.
In response, the Army Corps of Engineers, the San Bernardino County Flood
Control District (SBCFCD), and the City built numerous structures to control
flood hazards. The first line of defense against flooding is a series of eight
levees constructed along the western edge of Lytle Creek (see Exhibit 5.2).
Next, a regional storm drain system was built and is maintained by the
SBCFCD. Within Rialto, this system includes three buried pipelines (the East
Fontana Storm Drain, the East Rialto Storm Drain, and the Rialto-Baseline
Storm Drain). The region’s most significant and largest drainage facility is the
Rialto Channel, a mostly open, earthen and concrete-lined channel that
extends from the Cactus Basins in the central part of the City south to the
Santa Ana River. The County system also includes several retention basins
that not only provide flood control but also serve as recharge basins.
The developed portions of Rialto are served by an extensive municipal storm
drain network that is maintained by the City and designed to collect all
urban runoff. These drain eventually to the Santa Ana River. While existing
flood control structures have provided significant protection from
uncontrolled flooding, inadequacies in the local drainage system have
caused occasional localized flooding.
Exhibit 5.2 shows that portions of Rialto are still vulnerable to inundation
from 100-year flood events associated with Lytle Creek and in a low-lying
area of Sycamore Flat. In the event of a major storm, several roadways could
flood over, including Glen Helen Parkway, Sycamore Creek Road, and
Clearwater Parkway.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Fire Hazards
Wildland Fires
Wildland fire hazards are of concern where development is adjacent to
wildland areas, particularly in north Rialto. Fires starting in the foothill areas
can easily spread south and consume urban development, especially if
pushed by the Santa Ana winds that blow from the Cajon Pass.
In areas identified as susceptible to wildland fire, land development is
governed by special State, County, and local codes, and property owners are
required to follow maintenance guidelines aimed at reducing the amount
and continuity of the fuel (vegetation) available. Starting in 2008, CAL Fire
identified areas as Fire Hazard Severity Zones. Within those areas, the local
government has the financial responsibility for wildland fire protection,
known as Local Responsibility Areas (LRA). Only lands zoned very high are
identified within the LRA. Exhibit 5.3 identifies the high fire hazard areas
and the local responsibility coverage areas
The Fire Hazard Severity Zone maps were developed using a science-based
and field-tested computer model that assigns a hazard score based on the
factors that influence fire likelihood and fire behavior. Many factors are
considered such as fire history, existing and potential fuel (natural
vegetation), flame length, blowing embers, terrain, and typical weather for
the area. Urban and wildland areas are treated differently in the model, but
the model does recognize the influence of burning embers traveling into
urban areas, which is a major cause of fire spread.
With the devastating wildfires of 2003 that affected mountain/urban
interface areas in San Bernardino County (and other areas throughout
Southern California), fire codes have become much more restrictive. Also,
Rialto will look critically at any development proposal for foothill areas to
ensure appropriate safeguards are integrated into subdivision design,
including ample buffers and many access points.
Urban Fires
Structural fires, although less than one percentage of the incidents that the
Fire Department responds to on an annual basis, account for 55 to 60
percentage of the yearly property losses in Rialto. To reduce these losses, the
City requires development to include protections. For example, structures
exceeding 5,000 square feet must have fire and life safety systems in place,
including automatic fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In newer structures,
these safety requirements help confine structural fires to the building or
property of origin. But in the older areas of Rialto, where building materials

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
may not be fire rated and structures are not fitted with fire sprinklers, the
probability of structural fires spreading to adjacent buildings is much higher.
Structural fires are of particular concern in high-density areas, where the
potential for fire to spread from one building to the next is greater.
Additionally, Rialto’s commercial and industrial districts have many uses with
a high potential for chemical fires, which could impact nearby residential
areas.
Hazardous Materials
The primary concern associated with hazardous material release is the short-
and long-term effects on the public. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a hazardous material as any material
which, due to quantity, concentration, and physical or chemical
characteristics, poses a significant potential hazard to human health or the
environment. The best way to reduce the possibility for a hazardous material
release is by implementing and enforcing stringent regulations governing the
storage, use, manufacturing, and handling of hazardous materials. Federal,
State, and local agencies enforce regulations for hazardous waste generators
and users, these regulations help prevent and mitigate pollution of hazardous
waste.
Contaminated Sites and Generators of Hazardous
Materials
Historically, some areas of Rialto were used for the manufacturing of rocket
fuel and fireworks. U.S. Department of Defense contractors began making
rockets locally in the 1950s, and fuel residue has since leaked into the
region's underground water basin. The seepage has created a massive plume
of perchlorate in the groundwater that in 2007 was approximately six miles
long and two miles wide. The City has a zero-tolerance policy, meaning it
will not tolerate any detectable levels of perchlorate in drinking water.

                                    THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
Since Rialto has a significant industrial land use base, many businesses use,
store, transport and handle hazardous materials (see Exhibit 5.4). These
include several Large-Quantity Generators and a handful of Small-Quantity
Generators, including several in the unincorporated area of Bloomington.
There are also over a dozen registered transporters of hazardous waste
within the planning area.1
Leaking Underground Fuel Tanks
According to the State Water Quality Control Board, nearly four dozens
leaking underground fuel tank (LUFT) facilities have been reported in the
Rialto. Most have been remediated. The California Regional Water Quality
Control Board, in cooperation with the Office of Emergency Services,
provides oversight and conducts inspections of all underground tank
removals and installation of new ones. Consistent with State laws, the City
will continue to pursue remediation of LUFT sites.
Hazardous Materials Transportation Routes
Hazardous materials are transported through or near Rialto along I-15 and I-
10, SR-210, and local roads and railroad lines. Releases of hazardous
materials from trucks or trains can occur during an accident. The California
Highway Patrol is the responding agency in the event of a spill on the
freeways, but local emergency response agencies, such as police and fire
departments, are responsible for additional enforcement and routing
assistance. Per federal and State laws, all transportation of hazardous
materials is conducted under strict protocol. Material data sheets for each
substance being transported are carried by the conductor. These data sheets
are designed to help emergency response personnel identify the most
appropriate action to contain the specific substances involved in the spill.
Emergency Response
The possibility of a major disaster impacting Rialto is constant, given the
City’s exposure to a multitude of hazards: wildfires, floods, windstorms,
hazardous materials releases, civil disturbance, and earthquakes. Procedures
for mitigating such events are outlined in the City’s Standard Emergency
Management System (SEMS) Multi-Hazard Functional Plan (MHFP). The
MHFP incorporates and coordinates all the facilities and personnel of the
City into an efficient organization capable of responding to any emergency.

  Large Quantity Generators (LQG) generate 1,000 kilograms per month or more of
hazardous waste, or more than 1 kilogram per month of acutely hazardous waste. Small
Quantity Generators (SQG) generate more than 100 kilograms, but less than 1,000 kilograms,
of hazardous waste per month.

                                THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
Evacuation Routes and Emergency Shelters
Pre-planning for evacuation in response to a disaster is difficult. The nature,
size, and location of a disaster cannot be predicted, so it is impractical to tell
people where they should evacuate prior to an event. The decision to
evacuate an area will be determined by the appropriate emergency response
agencies. However, in the event of a disaster, actual evacuation route
movement is conducted by the Rialto law enforcement agencies. A public
notice utilizing California’s Emergency Alert System (EAS) is broadcast over
local radios and television stations to alert the community of disaster-related
events. Evacuation warning information includes:
       Evacuation type (voluntary or mandatory)
       Routes available out of area
       Location of evacuation centers
       Duration of emergency (anticipated)
       Time remaining before the situation becomes critical
In the event of a disaster and subsequent evacuation order, affected persons
are directed to the most appropriate emergency shelter. Rialto City staff
works closely with the Red Cross and the Rialto Unified School District to
coordinate the availability of shelters.
Fire Department
Rialto Fire Department is an all-risk fire agency providing fire suppression,
emergency medical, technical rescue, hazardous material, and other related
emergency services. The Fire Department also conducts public education
programs and investigates and mitigates hazardous situations. The
Department activity practices hazards mitigation and fire prevention. Fire-
fighting resources in Rialto include four fire station (see Exhibit 5.3 for fire
station locations), emergency response personnel, firefighters/paramedics,
and a Hazardous Materials Response Team. The Department is continually
looking at its ability to meet the needs of the community and to make sure
the Department has adequate and appropriate levels of personnel and
equipment. The Department tries to adhere to standards recommended by
the National Fire Insurance organization as well as the National Fire
Protection Association. Those standards allow one minute alarm time, one
minute turnout time (time it takes personnel to put on their turnout gear),
and first units to respond to a fire or medical emergency within four (4)
minutes; the remaining equipment must respond within eight (8) minutes.
Police Department
The Rialto Police Department provides a full range of law enforcement and
community safety programs, including field patrol, K-9, School Resource
Officer (SRO), Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), Street Crime
Attack Team, investigations, traffic, narcotics, training/backgrounds, Strategic

encourages innovation, use, and implementation of technology.
Gangs
Rialto historically has had recurring problems with gangs; gangs threaten the
safety of neighborhoods and create an unfavorable image of the City that
may discourage investment in the community. Gangs are differentiated from
other youth groups by their frequent and intentional involvement in illegal
activities and a more developed leadership structure. Many street gang
activities in Rialto come from gangs located in the City, with several loosely
knit Rialto gangs dating back several generations. Gangs that have
originated in Los Angeles and other areas of Southern California have also
infiltrated the community. The City recognizes that gangs present a
significant safety concern.
As part of its operational plan, the Police Department has established the
Multiple Enforcement Team (MET). The MET investigates gang, narcotics,
and career criminal cases. The team also addresses specific problems and
crime trends by using innovative investigative techniques and available
resources until the problem are solved or controlled. The team is highly
trained and motivated. In addition, Department personnel routinely attend
gang training, participate in gang-related enforcement efforts in surrounding
communities, and are members of various gang intelligence and training
groups.
The City will continue to provide diverse after-school programs for the City's
youth and families to discourage youth involvement with gangs. Such
programs will engage youth in volunteer and recreational programs that
strengthen family and healthy and safe social networks. Job placements and
internship programs will help Rialto youth gain job skills and spark positive
interests.
Noise
Excessive noise can disrupt our lives. Noise can interrupt our conversations,
thoughts, and leisure activities. Noise sensitivity varies depending on the
time of day, its duration and pitch, and preferences of individuals. Despite
this variability, most residents agree that too much noise or the wrong type
of noise can be irritating and interfere with sleep, speech, recreation, and
tasks that require concentration or coordination. Therefore, noise not only
decreases environmental quality but can also adversely affect our physical
and mental health.

                                  THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
In Rialto, street and freeway traffic represent the primary source of noise.
The SR-210 freeway, which traverses the northern portion of the City, and I-
10, which runs through the southern portion, present concerns where they
run adjacent to residential neighborhoods. Other significant sources of noise
include arterial roadways and intersections, as well as the Union Pacific
Railroad lines running adjacent to I-10 and Metrolink, which runs directly
through the City’s downtown.
Because Rialto is largely built out and the street system well established, the
City faces challenges in separating noise-sensitive land uses from primary
noise sources. Thus, the Noise Element establishes policies to guard against
creation of any new noise/land use conflicts and to minimize the impact of
existing noise sources on the community.
Noise Metrics
Sound intensity is measured and expressed by decibels (dB), with an
adjustment referred to as the A-weighted measure (dBA) to correct for the
relative frequency response of the human ear. Decibels are measured on a
logarithmic scale, representing points on a sharply rising curve. For example,
a noise level of 10 decibels is 10 times more intense than one decibel, 20
decibels represents a noise 100 times more intense, and 30 decibels reflects
a noise condition 1,000 times more intense. A sound as soft as human
breathing is about 10 times greater than a zero decibel level.
The decibel system of measuring sound gives a rough connection between
the physical intensity of sound and its perceived loudness to the human ear.
A 10-decibel increase in sound level is perceived by the human ear as only
doubling of the loudness of the sound. Ambient sounds in the urban
environment generally range from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very
loud), as indicated in the Typical Sound Levels table.
Because people generally are more sensitive to noise intrusions during the
evening and night hours, State law requires, for planning purposes, use of
such metrics as the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or Day-Night
Noise Level (Ldn). These metrics add an artificial decibel increment to quiet
time noise levels in a 24-hour noise descriptor to account for increased
sensitivity during late hours. The CNEL descriptor requires that an artificial
increment of 5 dBA be added to the actual noise level for the hours from
7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and 10 dBA for the 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. period.
The Ldn descriptor uses the same methodology, except that no artificial
increment is added to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Both
descriptors yield roughly the same 24-hour level, with the CNEL being only
slightly more restrictive (that is, higher).

Effect of Noise on People
In general, noise may affect the average individual in the following ways:
         General Hearing Loss or Damage
          Sound levels which exceed 85 dBA, when experienced for long
          durations during each working day, may result in severe temporary
          or even permanent hearing loss. State and Federal safety and health
          regulations currently protect workers at levels of exposure that
          exceed 90 dBA for each eight-hour workday.

                                  THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
        Interference with Oral Communication
         Speech intelligibility is impaired when sound levels exceed 60 dBA.
         The amount of interference increases with sound level, and with
         distance between speaker and the listener.
        Sleep Interference
         Sound levels that exceed 40 to 45 dBA are generally considered
         excessive for sleeping areas within a residence.
Regulatory Environment
The intent of this Noise section is to set goals to limit and reduce the effects
of noise intrusion on sensitive land uses and to set acceptable noise levels
for varying types of land uses. To this end, the City has the authority to set
land use noise standards and place restrictions on private activities that
generate excessive or intrusive noise. However, it should be recognized that
the City, and that various agencies, such as the Federal Highway
Administration, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
and the California Department of Health Services, may supersede City
authority as discussed below.
California Administrative Code Section 65302(f)
California Government Code Section 65302(f) requires that all General Plans
include a Noise Element to address noise concerns in the community. State
law also requires that current and future noise level contours be developed
for the following sources:
        Highway and freeways
        Primary arterials and major local streets
        Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid
         transit systems
        Commercial, general aviation, heliport, and military airport
         operations, aircraft flyovers, jet engine test stands and all other
         ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport
         operation
        Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad
         classification yards
        Other stationary ground noise sources identified by local agencies as
         contributing to the community noise environment
City of Rialto Municipal Code
The City’s Municipal Code provides a basis for controlling excessive and
annoying noise. Some of the more pertinent chapters of the Municipal
Code are:
        Chapter 9.50.030, Prohibited Acts
        Chapter 9.50.040, Excessive Noise and Vibration emanating from a
         Motor Vehicle
        Chapter 9.50.050, Controlled Hours of Operation

Federal Highway Administration
The freeways and State routes that run through the City (I-10/SR-210/I-15)
are subject to Federal funding and so are under the purview of the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA).            The FHWA has developed noise
standards that are typically used for Federally funded roadway projects or
projects that require either Federal or Caltrans review.
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issues formal
requirements related specifically to standards for exterior noise levels along
with policies for approving HUD-supported or assisted housing projects in
high noise areas. In general, these requirements established three zones:
        65 dBA ldn or less: An acceptable zone where all projects could be
         approved
        Exceeding 65 dBA ldn but not exceeding 75 dBA ldn: A normally
         unacceptable zone where mitigation measures would be required
         and each project would have to be individually evaluated for
         approval or denial. These measures must provide 5 dBA of
         attenuation above the attenuation provided by standard construction
         required in a 65 to 70 dBA ldn area and 10 dBA of attenuation in a 70
         to 75 dBA ldn: area.
        Exceeding 75 dBA ldn. An unacceptable zone, in which projects
         would not, as a rule, be approved
Federal Railroad Administration
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with the regulation of
railroad noise under the Noise Control Act.              The Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) is responsible for enforcement of EPA regulations
related to railroad noise developed as part of the Noise Control Act. FRA’s
Office of Safety is responsible for enforcing the Railroad Noise Emissions
Compliance Regulation that set maximum sound levels from railroad
equipment and for regulating locomotive horns. The Union Pacific rail
corridor that follows I-10 in the southern portion of Rialto falls under the
regulation described above.
California Department of Health Services
The California Department of Health Services (DHS), Office of Noise Control
studied the correlation of noise levels and their effects on various land uses.
As a result, the DHS established four categories for judging the severity of
noise intrusion on specified land uses. DHS standards suggest “normally
acceptable,” “conditionally acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,” and
“clearly unacceptable” exterior noise levels for various land uses. A
“conditionally acceptable” designation implies new construction or

                                  THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise
reduction requirements for each land use is made and needed noise
insulation features are incorporated in the design. By comparison, a
“normally acceptable” designation indicates that standard construction can
occur with no special noise reduction requirements.
Noise/Land Use Compatibility
Most cities and counties in California have adopted noise/land use
compatibility criteria that reflect DHS standards and based on the general
assumption that higher noise levels are acceptable in business districts and
industrial areas. However, the introduction of mixed-use development
principles into traditionally suburban environments has changed thinking
with regard to acceptable noise levels. People who choose to live in vibrant
mixed-use districts know that the excitement and activity levels bring with
them a noise environment distinctly different than that of traditional
residential-only neighborhoods. For example, music played in outdoor
dining areas or bars can extend into late-night hours. Garbage collection
early in the morning and the noise from heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning equipment also occur with greater frequency and intensity in an
urban setting.
In addition, at locations along major roadways, greater traffic volumes
contribute to ambient noise conditions. Projected noise levels throughout
most of the Downtown, including the area designated for new mixed-use
development, are expected to exceed traditionally accepted noise/land use
compatibility guidelines for residential uses. Exhibit 5.5 shows Rialto’s noise
guidelines for land use planning that incorporate these principles.
This General Plan encourages mixed-use development to achieve several
objectives: to work toward more sustainable development approaches, to
increase access to affordable housing for more people, to create a lively
Downtown, and to allow people to live closer to their jobs. To meet these
objectives, Rialto has adopted the flexible noise guidelines for mixed-use
districts set forth in Exhibit 5.5.

                                  THE SAFETY AND NOISE CHAPTER
Coupled with these guidelines are regulations for noise control contained in
Chapter 9 (Noise Regulations) of the Municipal Code and State standards for
interior noise control for residential uses. Specifically, Title 24 of the
California Health and Safety Code stipulates a maximum of 45 dBA CNEL for
interior residential noise levels. In loud environments, insulation, double- or
triple-pane windows, and special ventilation systems are among the tools
used to achieve acceptable interior noise levels.
Existing and Future Noise Environments
The most significant noise‐producing activity within the City of Rialto is
transportation. Transportation noise consists of several elements: 1) arterial
traffic; 2) traffic on aircraft operations at Rialto Municipal Airport (which are
scheduled to cease in 2010); 4) rail movements on two lines; and 5)
activities at a railroad classification yard. Activities at commercial/industrial
properties also contribute to the noise environment in Rialto.
Using measurement sites located along Rialto’s streets, highways, and
railroads, the City has developed noise contours for year 2008 baseline
conditions. Future condition noise contours have been generated based on
projected traffic levels.
The noise contours represent the average measurements of noise exposure
and are used to provide a general visualization of sound levels in the City.
As an example, a person in an area located within a 60 dBA noise contour
would hear a constant noise level roughly equivalent to 60 dBA, although
unique events would generate noise levels both below and above 60 dBA.
The noise contours do not reflect possible noise attenuation that could occur
from structural or geographical barriers, and acoustical analysis should be
conducted for each individual site in the case of a specific project.
Noise contours for year 2008 are shown in Exhibit 5.6, and projected
contours for the year 2040 are shown in Exhibit 5.7.
Noise level increases are projected to occur along the Metrolink Rail Line
corridor; I-10, I-15, and SR-210 freeways; Riverside Avenue; Foothill
Boulevard; western Baseline Road; Rialto Avenue; and Cedar Avenue.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Wind Hazards
The City of Rialto has a history of extensive windstorms, often related to
Santa Ana winds that push through the Cajon Pass. The Santa Ana winds are
strong, extremely dry offshore winds that characteristically sweep through
the area in late fall and early winter. High winds can also result from
thunderstorm inflow and outflow or high and low pressure systems moving
through the region. High winds have speeds reaching at least 50 miles per
hour, and gusts can exceed 100 miles per hour. Wind events constitute one
of the most frequent major hazards in the City. Not only do windstorms
happen frequently, they can be costly in terms of property damage and can
cause injury to people.
The winds sometimes reach gale-force strength. As a result, there are usually
high wind advisories, particularly along the I-15 and SR-210 freeways with
signs posted throughout the area. It is not uncommon to see overturned
trucks during windy events.
The winds affecting Rialto can damage structures, uproot small trees, and
create dust storms in the City where the soil type is susceptible to wind
erosion. Winds can also push wildland fires in the Lytle Creek area.
Additionally, as the northern part of the City has shifted to developed lands,
the severity and frequency of high winds has been reduced moderately.

                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
Introduction
The Housing Element provides the City with a coordinated and
comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent, and
affordable housing for all within the community.
Role and Organization of the Housing Element
The Housing Element is one of seven mandatory General Plan elements.
The Element identifies ways in which the housing needs of current and future
residents can be met. Consistent with State Housing Element laws, it must be
updated every five years unless otherwise extended by legislation. This
Housing Element covers the period extending from July 1, 2008 to June 30,
2014.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
       An introduction of the purpose and organization of the Housing
        Element
       An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics
        and trends
       A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental
        constraints to meeting the City’s identified housing needs
       An evaluation of land, administrative, and financial resources
        available to address the housing goals
       A review of past accomplishments under the previous Housing
        Element
       A Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs, including
        housing goals, policies, and programs
State Requirements and Legislative Changes
The California Legislature has determined that a primary housing goal for the
State is ensuring every resident has a decent home and suitable living
environment. Section 65580 of the California Government Codes describes
the goal in detail:
a.      The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the
        early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment
        for every Californian, including farmworkers, is a priority of the
        highest order.
b.      The early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation of
        government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing
                                                                                Chapter Page
                                                                                   6     6-1

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
          opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of
          all economic levels.
c.        The provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income
          households requires the cooperation of all levels of the government.
d.        Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers
          vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of
          housing to make adequate provision for housing needs of all
          economic segments of the community.
e.        The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility,
          each local government also has the responsibility to consider
          economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set
          forth in the general plan and to cooperate with other local
          governments and the state in addressing regional housing needs.
State law requires housing elements to be updated every five years to reflect
a community’s changing housing needs, unless such timeline is otherwise
extended by State legislation. The Government Code also requires that each
draft housing element be reviewed by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) and that HCD’s findings be
incorporated prior to adoption, or that specified findings be made in
response to HCD’s comments.
In response to changing State laws pertaining to the housing element, this
updated Housing Element addresses recent changes to State laws intended
to facilitate and expedite the construction of affordable housing:
         Extremely Low Income – AB2635 requires local jurisdictions to
          assess the housing needs of extremely low-income households, in
          addition to the established requirement to examine the needs of
          very-low, low-, and moderate-income households. Extremely low
          income are those that earn 0 to 30 percent of the Area Median
          Income. The community needs assessment includes extremely low-
          income households in discussions on housing need.
         Land Inventory and Analysis – AB2348 (Chapter 724) amended
          housing element law to include more specific requirements for the
          content of the land inventory and analysis section. Specifically, the
          land inventory must include site-specific listing of available land
          inventory, including the parcel number or “unique” reference. The
          land inventory is included at the end of the Element in Table H-48.
         Constraints for Persons with Disabilities – SB520 requires that
          housing elements identify potential and actual constraints upon the
          development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons
          with disabilities. The Constraints section addresses possible
          constraints for housing for persons with disabilities.

                                                       HOUSING ELEMENT
       Emergency Shelters – SB2, Chapter 633 requires that local
        government assess homeless need and identify opportunities for
        addressing this need. Program 7 is included in the Housing Plan to
        comply with State law.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Rialto General Plan consists of the following elements: Managing the
Land Supply, Investing in the Future, Circulation, Safety and Noise, Housing,
and Cultural and Historic Resources, as well as an Implementation Program.
The Housing Element builds upon the other Elements and is consistent with
the General Plan’s policies and proposals. The Housing Element draws upon
the development capacity levels provided for in the Managing the Land
Supply Element to determine the appropriate location for affordable housing
development.
Public Participation
As a part of the comprehensive update of all General Plan elements, the
General Plan team undertook a series of more than 35 interviews with
stakeholders and a citywide visioning effort that touched more than 500
people. In addition, a General Plan Action Committee — made up of 20
Rialto residents appointed by the City Council, the Planning Commission,
and other key City bodies and departments — met three times to formulate a
set of Guiding Principles, act as the lead group for Visioneering (an informal,
grassroots process for obtaining community input), and review and approve
the draft Land Use Plan.
To capture input from Housing Element stakeholders, a draft copy of the
Element will be provided to the groups identified below, whose feedback
will be incorporated into the final Housing Element as appropriate. In
addition, the draft Element will be published on the City’s website and
available for public comment.
Housing Element stakeholders include:
       Home AID
       Southern California Presbyterian Homes (SCPH)
       National CORE: Housing Action Resource Trust (HART)
       Neighborhood Housing Services of the Inland Empire, Inc.

Data Sources
Data from a variety of resources inform the crafting of the Housing Element.
One of the most cited sources is the 2000 U.S, Census. The Census,
although dated, provides consistent demographic characteristics that are
widely accepted. California Department of Finance (DOF) 2007 Population
and Housing Estimates supplement the 2000 Census data. Additional
information has been drawn from the 2004 Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data. CHAS data are based on special
tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) from sample Census data.
Population and Housing Profile
This section provides an overview of housing and population conditions in
Rialto. This profile serves as a foundation and starting point for the update to
the City’s Housing Element as required by HCD. Housing needs vary by
demographic and household characteristics, cultural backgrounds and
preferences, and income, as well as other special circumstances.
Determining housing needs in Rialto requires understanding population
growth trends, age, race/ethnicity, and employment characteristics.
Data Limitations
The data used in this needs assessment have been collected from the U.S.
Census (1990 and 2000 Census, 2005 American Community Survey),
California DOF 2009 estimates, and various other sources. Utilizing
estimates for demographic data shows changes in conditions since the 2000
Census. However, many of these estimates (such as the 2005 American
Community Survey and DOF data) are shown solely as percentages. The raw
numbers carry a significant margin of error, especially for smaller
geographies such as counties or cities. Nonetheless, the percentages
presented give a general indication of population and employment trends.
Additional information is drawn from the 2004 CHAS data, which is drawn
from Census 2000 data. CHAS data are based on special tabulations from
sample Census data. Thus, the number of households in each category often
deviates slightly from the 100 percent count due to extrapolations to the
total household level. Because of this, interpretations of CHAS data should
focus on proportions and percentages rather than on precise numbers.
Summary
The City of Rialto is composed of diverse and vital, predominantly detached
single-family home neighborhoods. Continuing to provide adequate and
affordable housing to its residents is a goal of the City and this Housing

Element. One of the largest cities in San Bernardino County, Rialto’s
population is expected to continue to grow, especially with young residents.
Over two-thirds of the population is Latino or Hispanic, and the median
income is slightly higher than San Bernardino County average. The majority
of households in the community own their homes, with a housing stock
composed primarily of single-family homes. Due to the increases in home
prices over the last ten years, half of the residents experience a housing cost
burden (paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing), and over
ten percent live in overcrowded conditions. The Southern California
Association of Governments’ Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
has determined that Rialto’s fair share allocation is 4,323 new housing units
for this planning period (2008-2014).
Community Location
Rialto is located in the western portion of San Bernardino County,
approximately 60 miles east of Los Angeles. The City is intersected (east to
west) by two major freeways: the I-10 freeway in the south and the SR-210
freeway in the north. The City neighbors the city of Fontana on the west and
the city of Colton on the east. Originally an agricultural town, Rialto’s
development was heavily influenced by the establishment of Route 66
(Foothill Boulevard) and the Pacific Electric railroad. These two
developments increased regional connectivity to Los Angeles and influenced
overall growth in Rialto.
Population Characteristics
According to the 2000 Census, the population of Rialto was 91,873 persons.
In 2007 the State Department of Finance estimated a population of 100,022,
representing nearly nine percent growth since the Census. A demographic
profile by the geographic information system software company ESRI
showed an 11 percent population growth, with a 2006 population of
101,563.1 The population is close to evenly split between male and female
residents (51 percent and 49 percent, respectively2).
Rialto is the sixth largest city in the San Bernardino County, behind the cities
of San Bernardino, Fontana, Rancho Cucamonga, Ontario, and Victorville.
Like many cities in the Inland Empire, Rialto experienced significant
population growth in the past 20 years and can be expected to continue to
grow due to available land resources and relative affordability. The Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) indicates that by 2025, one

Future growth estimates predict a slower increase in population over the
next 20 years. SCAG estimates that the population of Rialto will top 111,000
by the year 2030, an average population increase of 2.58% per year
between 2010 and 2030. The average annual population change for Rialto
between 1980 and 2000 was 7.13%.
Age Composition
The age structure of a population is an important factor in evaluating
housing needs. The traditional assumption is that in many communities,
young adults tend to prefer apartments, low- to moderate-cost
condominiums, and smaller or more affordable single-family units, while
mature adults provide the market for moderate- to high-end condominiums
and single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends
to generate demand for low- to moderate-cost apartments and
condominiums, community residential settings, and mobile homes.
San Bernardino County as a whole can be characterized as having a young
population. Among Southern California counties, San Bernardino has the
youngest median age at 30.2 years (compared with Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Diego and Ventura counties).4 Rialto is representative of this
characteristic, with a median age in 2005 of 28.2. In Rialto, preschool and
school age residents comprised over a third of the population in 2005.
Young adults between the age of 25 and 44 comprised close to 30 percent
of the population. Although residents 65 years and older make up only
about eight percent of the total population, the large proportion of adults
over 45 years of age is indicative of the aging baby boomer population that
will likely change the demographic and economic dynamic of the City over
the next 15 to 20 years.

Race and Ethnicity
In 2005, most Rialto residents were Hispanic or white. Constituting 45
percent and 38 percent of the population, respectively, this population
characteristic is indicative of the demographic shifts that have occurred in
Rialto over the past 15 to 20 years. In 1990, white residents comprised
almost half of the population. As the Hispanic population has grown, the
proportion of white and African American population has declined.
The racial and ethnic composition of a community affects housing needs due
to the varying household characteristics and preferences sometimes
associated with different groups. In 2000, for example, the average
household size in Rialto was 3.7. Hispanic and Asian households had a
comparatively larger average household size (4.52 and 4.16, respectively),
indicating a potential increase in demand for larger housing units if the
Hispanic population continues to grow.

Employment
Rialto residents are employed in diverse industries, with the largest percent
employed in the educational, health, and social services sector. This sector
includes those who work for the largest local employer, the Rialto Unified
School District. The second-most common sector to work in is
manufacturing, with over 16 percent of residents employed in the industry.
Retail trade ranks third, with 14.4 percent working in retail. This sector is
important to consider when assessing housing affordability, as retail salaries
tend to be lower, which decreases the amount of income available for
housing. The retail sector also generally does not offer health and other
employment benefits, further increasing economic strain.

Rialto has been particularly hard hit by job losses in the recession following
the real estate, banking, and credit crises of 2007 and 2008. Whereas the
unemployment rate in the City had generally hovered about two percentage
points higher than that of San Bernardino County as a whole, in 2009 that
gap increased to three and even four points. By November 2009, the
unemployment rate for the City was over 18 percent, meaning that nearly
one in five City residents was unemployed. For the County during the same
month the rate was just over 14 percent, or nearly one in seven.

Household Characteristics
Household type and size, income level, the presence of persons with special
needs, and other household characteristics may affect access to and demand
for housing and housing programs. This section details the various
household characteristics in Rialto.
A household is defined by the Census as all persons occupying a housing
unit. Families are a subset of households and include all persons living
together who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption.              Single
households include persons living alone in housing units, but do not include
persons in group quarters such as convalescent homes or dormitories.
Other households are unrelated people living together, such as roommates.
Household Type
In 2000, the U.S. Census estimated that Rialto had 24,659 households. In
2005, the Census estimated a 2.4 percent increase in the number of
households. The distribution of households as indicated by 2000 and 2005

Census data show that the majority of households in the Rialto are families.
Families headed by single parents made up 15 percent of all households.

Household composition and size are often two interrelated factors.
Communities with a large proportion of families with children tend to have a
large average household size. Such communities have a greater need for
larger units with adequate open space and recreational opportunities for
children. While the Census in 2000 and 2005 showed that household size
remained relatively stable, there was a slight increase, and household size
remains higher than that of San Bernardino County. The County average
household size was 3.15 in 2000 and 3.26 in 2005.
Tenure
Tenure in the housing industry typically refers to the occupancy of a housing
unit – whether the unit is owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Tenure
preferences are primarily related to household income, composition, and
age of the householder. The tenure distribution (owner versus renter) of a
community’s housing stock influences several aspects of the local housing
market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing
evidencing a much lower turnover rate than rental housing. Rialto’s housing
stock is predominantly owner-occupied, at a slightly higher rate than the
County as a whole. Although the level of owner-occupied housing dipped
slightly in 2000, it has remained relatively stable since 1990.

Foreclosures
The 2007-2009 economic crisis has resulted in a dramatic increase in the
number of foreclosures for households with sub-prime loans. In many cases,
financing for these homes was made through the sub-prime credit market.
Sub-prime loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than
prime loans, and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. The
foreclosure problem overall has been a significant problem throughout
Southern California, particularly in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.
Household Income
In 2005 the median household income in Rialto was estimated at $50,446,
only slightly higher than the San Bernardino County median income of
$49,026. Household income is an important consideration when evaluating
housing conditions because lower incomes typically constrain people's
ability to obtain adequate housing. Income in Rialto varied significantly for
different types of households, indicating that specific family types will have
greater need for affordable housing and housing services. For example,
married couple families had a much higher median income ($64,262) than
families headed by a single female ($29,013). As explained above, 82
percent of households in Rialto identify themselves as families. Table 6-5 is
representative of families only, and does not include the other 18 percent of
households that are singles or do not identify as part of a family.

Housing Stock Characteristics
The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as a house, an apartment, a
mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or, if
vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate
living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any
other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside
the building or through a common hall.
Housing Growth
The number of housing units in Rialto has increased 12 percent since 1990.
New development in Rialto is expected to increase the housing stock further
over the next five to 15 years, particularly in northern Rialto where proximity
to SR-210 is creating expanded opportunities for development within the
Pepper Avenue, Lytle Creek, and Rialto Renaissance Specific Plan areas. The
recession that began in late 2007 has significantly affected homebuilders’
decisions to continue the prior pace of growth, and this condition is
anticipated to continue during a portion of this Housing Element cycle.

Housing Type
The housing stock composition in Rialto has remained stable since 2000.
Single-family detached houses are the principal housing type in the City;
multi-family units make up 20 percent of the total housing units.
Nearly seven percent of the housing units in Rialto are mobile homes, which
have filled an affordable housing niche for years. As land values rise,
however, the parks on which mobile homes are standing have increased
likelihood of being sold and redeveloped. The City created a Mobile Home
Development zone in 1980 to preserve mobile homes for affordable

Age of Housing Stock
The age of housing is commonly used as a measure of when housing may
begin to require repairs. In general, housing units over 30 years old are
likely to have rehabilitation needs, including new roofing, foundation work,
and new plumbing. The median year built for housing units in the City is
1978. This makes more than half the City’s housing units 30 years of age or
older. The figure below also indicates that the City experienced tremendous
growth in the 1980s and very little growth since 2000.

Housing Problems
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) was developed
by the Census for HUD. It uses Census data to evaluate housing problems
for different groups, including elderly and large families. The CHAS identified
the following housing problems in Rialto:
        Severe Housing Cost Burden, including utilities, greater than 50
         percent of household income
        Housing Cost Burden, including utilities, between 30 and 50 percent
         of household income
        Overcrowded conditions (homes with more than one person per
         room, excluding kitchens and hallways)
        Units with physical problems or lack of suitable conditions (lacking
         plumbing facilities, for example)
In general, renters in Rialto are more likely than owners to experience
housing cost burden or other housing problems. However, low-income (with
incomes of 50 to 80 percent of the MFI) owner households are significantly
more likely than low-income renter households to experience a cost burden,
and more low-income households own than rent.
CHAS data also reveal that nearly half (44 percent) of Rialto households are
extremely low, very low, or low income, earning less than 80 percent of the
MFI. Of these households, over three quarters (76.5 percent) experienced
one or more housing problems, especially housing cost burden.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding occurs when housing costs are so high relative to income that
families have to live in small units or double up to devote income to other
basic needs such as food or medical care. However, cultural differences also
contribute to the overcrowded conditions since some cultures tend to have
larger household size than others due to the preference of living with
extended family members. The federal government defines an overcrowded
household as one with more than one person per room, excluding
bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Severely overcrowded
households are households with greater than 1.5 persons per room. By
these definitions, approximately 21 percent of households in Rialto live in
overcrowded conditions in 2000.
The 2005 American Community Survey showed a decline in overcrowded
conditions. Generally, low-income families are disproportionately affected by
overcrowding. Overcrowding is also more prevalent among renters than
among owners. Rialto households in renter-occupied units experienced
overcrowding and severe overcrowding at a significantly higher proportion
than households in owner-occupied units. Over 2,250 renter households and
more than 2,750 owner households experienced overcrowded conditions in
2000.

Housing Cost Burden
State and federal standards specify that a household experiences a housing
cost burden if it pays 30 percent or more of its gross income on housing.
Housing cost burden typically is linked to income levels and occurs when
housing costs increase faster than income.
In Rialto, housing cost burden is more prevalent among renters than owners.
In 2000, the Census estimated that almost half (48 percent) of renter
households paid 30 percent or more of their gross income on housing. Over
two-thirds of renters with incomes of less than $35,000 per year experienced
a housing cost burden. In owner-occupied housing units, cost burden was
experienced by 36 percent of the households. Again, this burden was more
often felt by lower-income households, with nearly three-quarters of
households with incomes less than $35,000 paying more than 30 percent of
their income on housing.
The cost burden increased for both renters and owners in 2005 according to
the American Community Survey, estimated at 54 percent and 41 percent
respectively. Housing cost burden remains higher in Rialto than average for
San Bernardino County. Severe cost burden (paying 50 percent or more of
gross income on housing) was experienced by 12 percent of owners and
nearly a quarter of renters in 2000.
Low-income households are those that make less than 80 percent of the
median income. The median income for a family of four in San Bernardino
County is $59,200. As such, households (with four members) making less
than $47,350 per year are considered lower income. Exhibit 6-6reveals that
lower-income households are significantly more likely to experience housing
cost burden than higher-income households.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Overall, approximately 3,550 renter households and over 5,600 owner
households experienced housing cost burden in 2000. According to the
CHAS (2004), almost all rental households (3,488 households) experiencing
housing cost burden were lower income (0-80% MFI), and over 3,600 lower
income owners paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs.

Substandard Housing Conditions
A variety of housing conditions can cause a home to be considered
substandard. These homes often require extensive renovation to make a
home safe. The number of homes that are likely to need major renovations
can be estimated by examining the percentage of older housing units and
Census reports of residents regarding their housing conditions.
Because half of the housing stock (over 14,000 units) will be more than 30
years old by 2009, significant rehabilitation needs are likely. The older
residential neighborhoods in Rialto are likely to require the most significant
rehabilitation, including seismic reinforcement in addition to maintenance
and repairs. The eastern portion of the City has the oldest housing stock and
therefore is likely to have the highest number of rehabilitation needs.
Additionally, the likelihood of homes with lead paint hazards increases for
those built before 1980. City staff estimates that 30 percent of single family
and 50 percent of multi-family housing need substantial rehabilitation.
The Census reports the number of housing conditions that each individual
household reports. These conditions include housing cost burden,

overcrowding, and lack of plumbing or kitchen facilities. Nearly five percent
of owners and almost 11 percent of renters reported two or more housing
conditions in 2005.
Foreclosure Rates
Foreclosure is a process by which lenders sell or take ownership of a
property because a homeowner has defaulted on the loan. The foreclosure
process begins after a homeowner has not paid for three consecutive
months, and the lender files a public Notice of Default, or lis pendens. The
process proceeds in one of four ways:
1.   The homeowner pays the default amount during a given grace period.
2.   The homeowner sells the home to another party.
3.   The home is placed on public auction.
4.   The lender takes possession of the house.
The 2007-2010 economic crisis has resulted in a dramatic increase in the
number of foreclosures for households with sub-prime loans. In many cases,
financing for these homes was made through the sub-prime credit market.
Sub-prime loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than
prime loans, and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. The
foreclosure problem overall has been a significant problem throughout
Southern California, particularly in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.

Unfortunately, many households losing their homes are the low-income
families that “predatory lenders” target. Denied conventional home loans,
their only avenue may have been the “subprime” credit market. Subprime
loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than prime loans,
and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. These predatory
lenders typically offer to refinance an existing loan with one that is filled with
excessive or unnecessary fees and usually provides no tangible benefit to the
borrower. These loans also often include adjustable rate mortgages with
steep built-in rate and payment increases and more onerous prepayment
penalties – and are usually approved with little or no income documentation
required.
In a recent change, most homeowners who default are unable to refinance,
sell their home, or become current with payments in another way, and
emerge from the foreclosure process without losing their homes. According
to DataQuick, the overall weakness of the real estate market has made
lender “work-outs” much more difficult then they had been in the past. In an
October 2008 news release from the real estate information company, only
20 percent of California homeowners who went into default that year were
able to keep their homes from being taken over by the mortgage lender. This
number was down from 60 percent the year before and 91 percent the year
before that. When households lose their home through foreclosure, it is
likely they will seek rental housing, and this may result in a higher demand
for rental units and thus push rents higher in Rialto and other communities in
San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.
Housing Cost and Affordability
The cost of housing in a community is directly correlated to the number of
housing problems and affordability issues. High housing costs can price low-

income families out of the market, cause extreme cost burdens, or force
households into overcrowded or substandard conditions.
Ownership Housing
Nearly three-quarters of households in Rialto live in owner-occupied
dwellings, with 73 percent of the housing units being single-family residential.
Beginning in mid-2007 the housing market collapse started to have a serious
effect on housing prices in Rialto, as it did throughout the State and most of
the nation. In May 2007, the median price of a home sold in Rialto was
about $380,000; by December of that year it had dropped $90,000 to
$290,000. By May 2009, it was $130,000. It remains unclear when or if the
housing market will return to its former heights, though the end of 2009 did
see a slight increase in median price.

Rental Housing
According to the Census, 29 percent of Rialto households live in rental
housing. These housing units are composed primarily of apartments, as well
as some condominiums, townhomes, and single-family residences.

During January 2009, rents in Rialto ranged from $675 to $900 for a studio
apartment, $800 to $1,200 for a one-bedroom, between $995 and $1,525
for a two-bedroom, and between $1,100 and $1,900 for a three-bedroom
apartment. These rents are roughly equivalent to the HCD-determined fair
market rent for the County of San Bernardino.

Due to the large number of single-family homes in Rialto, a number are also
for rent. A survey of homes for rent on Realtor.com reveals that home rental
prices vary by size, number of bedrooms, and location, with the median rent
being $1,750 per month. Most homes for rent are either three- or four-
bedroom homes.

Housing Affordability
Income Levels and Affordable Housing Payments
Housing affordability levels are determined by HCD and divided into the
following categories:
       Extremely Low Income = income less than 30 percent of area
        Median Family Income (MFI)
       Very Low Income = income greater than 30 percent and less than 50
        percent MFI
       Lower Income = income greater than 50 percent and less than 80
        percent MFI
       Moderate Income = income greater than 80 percent and less than
        120 percent MFI
The California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 provides the
following definition of affordable housing cost based on income level:
              Calculation of Affordable Housing 
                             Cost                      Owner               Rental 
           Extremely Low (0-30% MFI)                30% of 30% AMI     30% of 30% AMI
           Very Low (0-50% MFI)                     30% of 50% AMI     30% of 50% AMI

           Moderate Income (81-120% MFI)           35% of 110% AMI     30% of 110% AMI
HUD conducts an annual household survey to determine MFI and related
income amounts for low-income groups. Housing affordability for various
levels of income can be determined by estimating the costs of owning or
renting a home, including utilities, and applicable taxes or insurance, in
addition to the monthly payment on a mortgage or to a landlord.

The citywide home median price of $380,000 puts affordable
homeownership out of reach for most very low-, lower-, and moderate-
income households. Many newer low-income residents of Rialto are
confined to rental housing because the price of homes remains so high. The
problem of affordability remains in the rental market as well. It is difficult to
find any housing available in Rialto for less than $700 per month, pricing out
all very low- and extremely low-income households unless they are able to
receive subsidies.
Very low-income residents and families in Rialto cannot afford any of the
median priced rental units in the City, with a studio renting for a median
$799. Lower-income small families (three persons) can afford the median
price for a one-bedroom apartment, and a four-person lower-income family
can afford the median price for a two-bedroom apartment. Large lower-

income families, however, would not be able to afford a three-bedroom
apartment at the median price.
Housing Affordability Index
The California Building Industry Association publishes a quarterly housing
affordability index. The index calculates the percentage of homes that were
sold during a three-month period that would be affordable to a family
earning the region’s median income. The index assumes buyers will finance
90 percent of the purchase price with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and
takes into account prevailing interest rates, property taxes, and insurance
costs.
During the second and third quarters of 2008, the Riverside-San Bernardino-
Ontario metropolitan area moved from 35th to 64th in a listing of the least
affordable metro areas in the country. By comparison, in the last quarter of
2006 and the first of 2007 the rankings were 11th and 14th, respectively.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, only 6.8 percent of the homes in the
metro area were affordable for a household earning the median income of
$57,500. The median home price for the region was $391,000. By the third
quarter of 2008, however, the percentage of homes affordable to
households earning median income increased to 48.4 percent. This increase
was largely due to the fact that the median home price dropped to
$220,000, while the median family income saw a modest increase to
$62,000.
Vacancy
Housing vacancy rates - the number of vacant units compared to the total
number of units - reveal the housing supply and demand for a city. Some
amount of housing vacancy is normal to allow for moving time and changing
locations. In Rialto, the housing vacancy rate has decreased significantly over
the last 15 years, to 3.76 percent (including rentals and owned homes), less
than half its rate in 1990.

According to the 2000 Census, vacancy rates for owner and renter-occupied
units differed. Homeowner vacancy rate was only 2.9 percent, while rental
vacancy rate was 5.6 percent, signifying a tight homeownership market.
Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty finding decent,
affordable housing due to their special needs. In Rialto, these special needs
groups include the elderly, disabled persons, large households, female-
headed households, and homeless.

Elderly
The elderly population (generally defined as those over 65 years of age) has
several concerns: limited and fixed incomes, high health care costs, transit
dependency, and living alone. Specific housing needs of the elderly include
affordable housing, supportive housing (such as intermediate care facilities),
group homes, and other housing that includes a planned service component.
The Census estimates that Rialto’s elderly population has decreased in recent
years. In 1990, Rialto’s elderly composed 6.6% of the population, 6.4% of
the population in 2000, and 4.6% of the population in 2005.
Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most often
retired and have fixed income (retirement funds and Social Security Income).
The elderly population in 2005 had a median income of $29,977, according
to the American Community Survey, which is considered low income by

HCD. The 2004 CHAS report revealed that more than one-third of seniors
paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, experiencing a
housing cost burden. While the vast majority of seniors are homeowners, the
percentage of renter seniors who overpaid was much higher than the
average; more than half of senior renters overpay for housing.
In 2000, over two-thirds of the elderly population was disabled. Despite the
large number of seniors who have disabilities, nearly 40 percent live alone,
according to the U.S. Census. However, the majority of elderly in Rialto own
their home, estimated at 87 percent in 2005, an increase of eight percent
from 2000.

Programs including assisted care, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation
assistance can help seniors live comfortably. There are 10 assisted living care
centers for seniors in Rialto, with the capacity to serve 115 residents. For
senior homeowners, Rialto contracts with the Old Timers Foundation to
provide a Senior Minor Home Repair Program to residents over 60 years of
age. This successful program provides grants (usually between $150 and
$250) to low-income seniors and disabled persons. These home repair grants
can help pay for architectural design features that help accommodate
physical disabilities and make a home safer for seniors. During fiscal year
2005/2006, 129 low-income households received grants.
Large Households
In general, large households (with five or more members) are identified as a
group with special housing needs based on the limited availability of
adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large households, when of lower
income, often find themselves living in overcrowded, smaller dwelling units
which in turn, can accelerate unit deterioration. The 2000 Census estimates
that nearly a third of Rialto households (31 percent) are large households.
The 2005 American Community Survey revealed a slight decrease in percent
of large households, to 29 percent.
                                                                                Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
The existing housing stock in Rialto provides large families with a variety of
options. The 2000 Census estimated that over 62 percent of the housing
units in Rialto contained three or more bedrooms. The majority of these
units are owner occupied (84 percent). Correspondingly, the majority of
large families are home owners: 71 percent in 2000 and 77 percent in 2005.
Because of the large number of large units, the existing housing stock likely
could meet the needs of the City’s large families, although affordability (both
price and availability of mortgage financing) issues may limit the accessibility
of these units to many low-income large families.
Female-headed households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance
because of the greater need for day care, health care, and support. Female-
headed households with children in particular tend to have lower incomes,
thus limiting housing availability for this group. The 2000 Census revealed
that of the 3,712 female-headed households with children under 18 in Rialto,
nearly 30 percent were living in poverty. As described previously in the
income section, female-headed households with children had a median
income of $22,474, classified as very low-income, earning only 38 percent of
the area median income for a family of four.
Disabled residents
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and
safety challenges. Disabled persons may face difficulty in finding accessible
housing (housing that is made accessible to people with disabilities through
the positioning of appliances and fixtures, the heights of installations and
cabinets, layout of unit to facilitate wheelchair movement, etc.).
In Rialto, nearly 20 percent of residents were identified as disabled in the
2000 Census. The age group in which disabilities are most common is
seniors above age 65. However, the age group of 16 to 64 also has a sizable
portion of the population with a disability. This age group is especially
important as it almost entirely encompasses the working population, and
disabilities may often affect a person’s ability to work consistently and
regularly.

The U.S. Census defines and estimates the number of persons with six
categories of disabilities:
        Sensory disability: blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing
         impairment
        Physical disability: a condition that substantially limits one or more
         basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching,
         lifting, or carrying
        Mental disability: a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting
         six months or more that made it difficult to perform activities such as
         learning, remembering, or concentrating
        Self-care disability: a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting
         six months or more that made it difficult to perform certain activities
         such as dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home
        Going-outside-the-home disability (also known as mobility
         disability): a physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting six
         months or more that made it difficult to go outside the home alone
         to shop or visit a doctor’s office (tallied only for residents over 16
         years of age)
        Employment disability (also known as work disability): a physical,
         mental, or emotional condition lasting six months or more that made
         it difficult to work at a job or business (tallied only for residents
         between 16 and 64 years of age)
In Rialto, the most common disability is an employment disability,
accounting for 26 percent of total disabilities. Going-outside-the-home-
disability was the second-most common disability, revealing limited mobility
for nearly a quarter of people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities
have multiple disabilities that often fall into separate categories. Because of
this, disabled persons must often consider a variety of complex factors when
attempting to find adequate housing.

Disabilities Services Act, which provides that state-authorized, licensed
community care facilities serving six or fewer persons be permitted by right
in all residential zones. In addition, there are currently 63 community care

          Notes:
          1. Small family homes provide care to children who are mentally
          disabled, developmentally disabled, or physically handicapped.
          2. Group Homes provide social, psychological, and behavioral
          programs for troubled youths.
          3. Adult residential facilities provide care for adults with various
          disabilities or disorders.
          4. Also known as assisted living facilities, elderly residential
          facilities provide care for persons age 60 and above.
Farmworkers
The 2000 Census revealed 81 Rialto residents to have occupations in the
farming, forestry, and fishing industries. These residents are most likely
employed by gardening and landscaping companies, with only 16 individuals
actually working in farming. The low number of farmworkers is due to the
lack of farming-related land uses in the region. As such, the City does not
have a need for farmworker-specific housing. The City allows affordable

housing in all residential zones; therefore, affordable housing needs of
people within the “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing” occupations can be
accommodated.
Homeless
Homelessness can be triggered by a variety of factors, including mental
illness, family violence, severe and sudden economic burdens, and housing
costs. In 2003, the Community Action Partnership (CAP) of San Bernardino
County published the results of a daily canvass of the County to assess the
number of homeless persons on the streets and in emergency shelters. The
San Bernardino County 2003 Homeless Census and Survey estimated the
point in time (daily) number of homeless residents in San Bernardino County
to be 5,270 persons. A 1990 Census one-night survey documented only ten
homeless people in emergency shelters and one homeless person visible on
the street in Rialto. The CAP homeless census revealed a much larger
number: 237 homeless persons. Thirty-three (33) people were a part of
homeless families and 26 were youth. The majority of the homeless
population was living on the street, with only five people staying at
emergency or miscellaneous shelters. Areas that tend to attract homeless
people include the Downtown area, the area near the railroad tracks, and
along the freeway interchanges.

Another sector of homeless that is much less visible than those in shelters
and on the streets is the informal homeless sector. These people are much
harder to enumerate, as they stay with friends and relatives, in motels, and
other informal housing arrangements. It is likely that an even larger number
of individuals and families fall into this category, but estimates are
unavailable.
Rialto participates in the San Bernardino County Continuum of Care Plan,
which helps bring homeless people into shelters, provides supportive
services, and helps in the transition to permanent housing. Most of the
homeless shelters in San Bernardino County are located in or near the city of
San Bernardino.

Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion
Several affordable housing options in Rialto are funded by federal, local, and
nonprofit sources. Over the next 10 years (2008-2018), a number of assisted
developments that provide a total of 301 affordable units have expiring
affordability covenants (Table 6-19). Affordability covenants include
restrictions placed on developments financed with County Mortgage
Revenue Bonds, redevelopment set-aside funds, State low-income housing
tax credits, and federal programs, including HOME, HUD Section 8, and

Two affordable housing developments were recently converted to market-

affordable units to market rate as the property’s loans matured; the
development no longer accepts Section 8 vouchers. In 2004, the owner of
the Quail Point Apartments at 1651 Riverside Avenue prepaid the County
Mortgage Revenue Bonds early, releasing the property owner from an

Section 8 housing developments with a total of 268 units. The California
Housing Partnership Corporation indicates that all of these developments -
Southpointe Villa, Willow Village, and the new TELACU senior housing
development - have Section 8 contracts that expire before 2018.
Both the Southpointe Villa and Willow Village projects are owned by profit-
motivated companies, and are as such may be considered at risk of
conversion to market rate. However, as rental rates and fair market rents in
Rialto are comparable, the risk of conversion is lower because there is less
incentive to convert to market rate because the gain will be nominal. For
example, an average two-bedroom apartment in Rialto rents for $989 per
month. The fair market rate is only $15 per month less than that, at $974 per
month. For three-bedrooms, the risk of conversion decreases even further, as
average rents are actually lower than the fair market rent of $1,383 per
month. Furthermore, HUD offers funding priority for extending Section 8
assistance to housing for seniors and persons with disabilities. The City will
continue to monitor the status of these at-risk units. Should a Notice of Intent
to opt out of the Section 8 program be filed, tenants will be properly notified
of their rights under California law. In addition, both Southpointe Villa and
Willow Village Section 8 contracts have expired in the past, and they have
both opted to remain in the HUD Section 8 program. The TELACU senior
housing project has an affordability covenant ensuring that the property
remains affordable for 55 years based on the Redevelopment Agency
agreement. Further, the property is owned and operated by a non-profit
organization, further lowering the risk that it would be converted to market
rate at a later date.
The Green Tree Senior Apartments are also held by a profit-motivated
owner. However, the rehabilitation of these 272 units was funded partially
with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which places an affordability
restriction on the 270 affordable units for a period of 55 years.
State, County, and local governments have the authority to issue tax-exempt
mortgage revenue bonds, which result in financing that is approximately two
percent below conventional interest financing rates. State and federal law
require that multi-family projects built with tax-exempt bond proceeds
establish a portion of units as affordable to lower-income households for a
specified period of time. The typical contractual period is 10 to 15 years.
After the term expires, the property owners may rent the units at market
rates. Two projects in the City were financed through County Mortgage
                                                                                 Chapter Page

Revenue Bonds and remain affordable: Heritage Park Rialto and Orchard
Heights (formerly known as Meadowland Apartments). However, the
original contractual period has expired for both of these projects, and they
may prepay the bonds at any time to release the affordability requirement.
Rialto has four affordable developments that are held by non-profits, as
indicated in the above table. The likelihood of conversion is much lower for
these units. Long-term affordability is fairly secure for these projects as this is
consistent with the nonprofits’ missions to provide affordable housing for the
elderly and low-income families.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways, with
adequate funding availability. These include:
        Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing
         organizations
        Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding sources
        Purchase affordability covenants
        Refinance mortgage revenue bonds
Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with
new assisted multi-family units with specified affordability timeframes.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a nonprofit housing
organization is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long term
and increases the amount of government resources available to the project.
The feasibility of this option depends on the willingness of the owner to sell,
funding sources to actually buy the property, and the existence of a
nonprofit organization with sufficient administrative capacity to manage the
property. Additionally, projects in which all units are affordable, and not just
a portion of units are affordable, can participate in ownership transfers more
simply and are therefore more likely to be feasible.
In Rialto, the estimated market value for the 301 affordable units in the at-
risk projects is evaluated in Table 6-20. The current market value for all
affordable at-risk units is estimated to be over $10 million.

Rental Assistance
State, local, or other funding sources can be used to provide rental subsidies
to maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be
structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy covers the
cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for the tenant’s
household income (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value
of the apartment. Given the mix of unit sizes of the at-risk developments, the
total annual subsidy to maintain the 301 at-risk units is estimated at over
$1.5 million.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Purchase Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide
an incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as low-income
housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the
remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy
received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether
the complexes require rehabilitation or are too highly leveraged. By
providing lump-sum financial incentives or on-going subsidies in rents or
reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some
or all of the units remain affordable.
Refinance County Mortgage Revenue Bonds
When County Mortgage Revenue Bonds are refinanced, property owners
are required by the 1986 Tax Reform Act to commit their 20 percent low-
income units for 15 years or as long as the bonds are outstanding, whichever
is greater. Because these bonds are County-managed bonds, the City is
somewhat limited in its ability to effect this option. However, the City can
encourage the County to negotiate with the project owners to refinance the
bonds. The cost to the County to negotiate the bond includes the difference
in interest rates on the remaining debt between the previous and re-
negotiated bonds, an issuance cost of three percent of the bond to be paid
by the County up front, and administrative costs.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace at-
risk units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of
factors, including density, size of units, construction quality and type,
location, and land cost. Assuming a development cost of $150,000 for a
multi-family rental unit, the cost of replacing all 301 affordable at-risk units
would be approximately $45 million.
Estimates of Housing Need
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in
Rialto. The four major needs categories considered in this element include:
        Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City
         and the surrounding region
        Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units
        Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can
         afford for housing
        Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large
         families, female-headed households, households with a disabled
         person, farmworkers, and the homeless

Projected Housing Need
HCD determined that the projected housing need for the Southern
California region (including the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside,
San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial) was 504,758 new housing units.
SCAG allocated this projected growth to the various cities and
unincorporated county areas within the SCAG region, creating the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The RHNA is divided into four
categories: very low-, low-, moderate-, and above-moderate income. As
determined by SCAG, the City of Rialto’s fair share allocation is 4,323 new
housing units during this planning cycle. The 2007 Rialto RHNA allocation is
nearly twice that of the previous cycle (2,199), reflecting increased growth in
the San Bernardino County region.

Constraints on Housing Development and Maintenance
The City of Rialto is committed to creating adequate and affordable housing
opportunities for all income levels. However, certain governmental, market,
infrastructure, and environmental factors may make it difficult to produce
decent housing. State law requires that cities analyze potential and actual
governmental and non-governmental constraints to the production,
maintenance, and improvement of housing for all persons of all income
levels and disabilities. Should constraints preclude the achievement of
housing goals, State Housing Element law requires jurisdictions to address
and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
The constraints analysis must also demonstrate local efforts to remove
barriers to development of housing for persons with disabilities.
Market Constraints
Many factors affecting housing costs are related to the larger housing
market. Land costs, construction costs, and labor costs all contribute to the
cost of housing, and can hinder the production of affordable housing.
Additionally, the availability of financing can limit access to homeownership
for some low-income households. The market impacts discussed in this
section are prevalent throughout the region and as such, these factors do
not represent unique or unusual constraints. Nonetheless, the City strives to
encourage and facilitate new home purchases and maintenance of housing
through homebuyer assistance programs and homeowner rehabilitation
programs.

  While SCAG data is not represented this way, State law assumes that 50 percent of the very
low-income category is represented by households of extremely low income (less than 30
percent of the MFI).

Development Costs
Development costs can severely affect development of potential affordable
housing developments. Limited supply, combined with a high demand,
keeps land costs relatively high throughout Southern California.
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with
multi-family housing generally less expensive to construct than single-family
homes. However, there is wide variation within each construction type,
depending on the size of the unit and the number and quality of amenities
provided.
An indicator of construction costs is Building Valuation Data compiled by the
International Code Council (ICC). The unit costs compiled by the ICC
include structural, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work, in addition to
interior finish and normal site preparation. The data are national and do not
take into account regional differences nor include the price of the land upon
which the building is built. The national averages for costs per square foot
unit of apartments and single-family homes are as follows:
        Type I or II, Multi-Family: $111.73 to $126.43 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $86.28 to $90.83 per sq. ft.
        Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $94.06 to
         $99.79 per sq. ft.
The unit costs for residential care facilities generally range between $109
and $150 per square foot. These costs are exclusive of the costs of land and
soft costs, such as entitlements, financing, etc.
Another factor related to construction costs is development density. With an
increase in the number of units built in a project, overall costs generally
decrease as builders can benefit from the economies of scale.
The price of land is also one of the largest components of housing
development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is
vacant or has an existing use that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints
such as environmental issues (steep slopes, soil stability, seismic hazards, or
flooding) can also be factored into the cost of land. Local realtors indicate
that residential land in Rialto averages $467,000 per acre. Depending on
location and desirability of the site, costs can range from a low of $221,000
per acre to a high of $691,000 per acre. In addition to assisting developers
in finding properties that are lower priced, the City can support affordable
housing by writing down the cost of land on Agency-owned property in
exchange for affordability controls.

projects exceeding $1,000 in value. Public works projects include
construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work performed
under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. State law
exempts affordable housing projects from the prevailing wage requirement if
they are financially assisted with only redevelopment housing set-aside funds.
However, if other public funds are involved, which is often the case,
prevailing wage rates may still apply. While the cost differential in prevailing
and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the occupation,
prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case
of affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could
effectively reduce the number of affordable units that can be achieved with
public subsidies.
Home Financing
Interest Rates
Interest rates substantially impact home construction, purchase, and
improvement costs. A fluctuation in rates of 2.5 percent can make a drastic
difference in the annual income needed to qualify for a loan. In the recent
past, Rialto has seen interest rates at historically low levels, which has
enabled many households to purchase a home. These rates have risen over
the past few years, and many adjustable rate mortgages have created
situations whereby households are unable to pay new mortgage rates.
However, the Federal Reserve lowered rates in September 2007, and has
continued to lower rates in response to national and international economic
conditions. Even so, the availability and cost of capital required for pre-
development costs for new housing, such as land purchase option money
and project design and entitlement processing, as well as uncertainty in the
larger housing market, remain a deterrent to development of affordable
multi-family housing.
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve
a home; the cost of borrowing money for residential development is
incorporated directly into the sales price or rent. Interest rates are

determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is very
little a local government can do to affect these rates. Some local
jurisdictions, such as Rialto, offer assistance to residents to make home
buying more affordable.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions
must disclose information on the disposition of loan applications by the
income, gender, and race of applicants. This applies to all loan applications
for home purchases and improvements, whether financed at market rate or
through government assistance. HMDA data can be used to evaluate lender
compliance with anti-discrimination laws and other consumer protection
laws. The anti-discrimination laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
(ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA). These laws prohibit discrimination
in home mortgage lending, among other things, on several bases such as
race, national origin, sex, and, age.
Table 6-25 presents the reason for denial of conventional home loans in
2008 by income of the applicant. The data is for the Riverside-San
Bernardino-Ontario MSA, of which Rialto is a part. The data includes
purchases of one- to four-unit homes, as well as manufactured homes. The
table shows that, as is to be expected, insufficient income is by far the
primary cause of denial for applicants in the lower income categories. The
second most common single cause for applicants with incomes below the
area median is a poor credit history.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Following the housing market collapse that began in 2007, banks
significantly tightened requirements on mortgages; essentially eliminating the
riskier subprime lending that had so inflated the market and led to the
collapse in the first place and cutting back even on prime loans. By the
beginning of 2010, however, there were some signs that banks were starting
to loosen lending restrictions slightly. Loan originations were still decreasing,
nevertheless, because of a drop in demand due to wariness on the part of
consumers in the face of widespread job insecurity and a continuing
recession.6
Interest rates fluctuations have also resulted in an increase in the number of
foreclosures for households with sub-prime loans. In many cases, financing
for these homes was made through the sub-prime credit market. Sub-prime
loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than prime loans,
and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. The foreclosure
problem has continued to significantly impact the Inland Empire, while
spreading throughout the region and the State. The greatest year-on-year
increases are now being seen in places like Orange and Ventura Counties,
which had previously been less affected by the wave of foreclosures.

Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can affect the price and availability of housing
and in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site
improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing
procedures, and other factors can constrain the maintenance, development,
and improvement of housing. State and Federal regulations, which the City
has no control over, also affect the availability of land for housing and the
cost of producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection,
building codes, and other topics have significant, often adverse, impacts on
housing cost and availability. While constraints exist at other levels of
government, this section emphasize policies and regulations that can be
mitigated by the City.
Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element sets forth policies for guiding local development.
These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the
amount and distribution of land to be allocated for different uses within the
City. Table 6-27 below details major land use categories, their density levels,
and residential types permitted.

One aspect of land use controls that limit the location and types of housing
is density. The City’s residential designations allow densities up to 45
dwelling units per acre in multiple-family category and up to 60 dwelling
units per acre in the Downtown Mixed Use designation.
The City’s Zoning Code (Title 18 of the Municipal Code)
As the 2010 General Plan update changes land use categories, the City will
be required to amend its zoning code to reflect new and modified
categories. This Zoning Code revision is included as Program 13 in the
Housing Plan.
Specific Plans
The City has adopted a number of specific plans which provide for further
variety in residential types and locations. The four large-scale specific plans
with substantial residential components are the Central Area Specific Plan
(currently being updated), the Northwest Area Specific Plan, the Rancho El
Rivino Specific Plan, and the El Rancho Verde Specific Plan. In addition to
these specific plans, the Rialto Airport Specific Plan is being comprehensively
updated to allow for significant land use changes, including closure of the
airport in favor of industrial, commercial, and residential uses. The
Renaissance Rialto, the cornerstone of the specific plan, is expected to be a
mixed-use project that is planned to contribute 1,747 new homes to the City
at target densities of up to 25 dwelling units per acre and an average density
of about 16 dwelling units to the acre.
The Northwest Area Specific Plan was adopted to accommodate housing in
that area of the City. The specific plan created a new residential zone which
allows single-family residences to be constructed on 6,000 square foot lots,
allowing for greater density of detached homes. While this area once had
the highest proportion of vacant land in the City, the area has developed
rapidly in recent years.
The El Rancho Verde Specific Plan was amended to allow for an increased
number of residences within the plan area, up to 300 homes. The plan
establishes a minimum lot size of 4,000 square feet, with a 4,500-square-foot
                                                                                            Chapter  Page

average for the development. Residential densities are required to be
between three and six dwelling units per acre.
The Rancho El Rivino Specific Plan area was annexed to the City of Rialto in
2007. The area provides for single-family housing ranging in density from 3.0
to 6.0 dwelling units per acre.
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential
development primarily through the Zoning Code (Title 18). Zoning
regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of residents, as well as implement the policies of the City’s
General Plan. The Zoning Code also serves to preserve the character and
integrity of existing neighborhoods.
Title 18 sets forth specific residential development standards. The specific
plan areas have specific residential development standards established in
those plans. Table 6-28 summarizes the most pertinent development
standards of the non-specific plan areas in the City. These development
standards are considered standard for communities in San Bernardino
County and Southern California, and do not impede the ability to develop
housing at appropriate densities.
The updated General Plan, to be completed in 2010, includes provisions for
mixed-use developments. The City will follow the General Plan update with
adoption of mixed-use and residential standards in Title 18 that include
higher densities.

Parking
The City’s parking standards for residential development are tailored to
vehicle ownership patterns associated with different residential uses, as
outlined in Table 6-29. Currently, two garage spaces are required for single-
family homes. In multi-family developments, one covered space and one
open space (two total) are required, plus one additional space for guests for
every four units. These standards reflect City goals for quality, safe housing
and developers’ response to market demands.

General Plan
requirements. Title 18 eases parking requirements for senior apartments,
with only 0.75 spaces required per unit. Half of the required parking spaces
must be enclosed, excluding guest spaces. Convalescent and nursing homes,
sanitariums, rest homes, and similar facilities are required to provide only 0.5
spaces per bed at permitted capacity.
Open Space Requirements
To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods,
communities typically require housing to have a certain amount of open
space such as yards, common space, and landscaping. For single-family
homes and multi-family developments in the R-4 district, open space is
reflected in setbacks, yard sizes, and lot coverage requirements. Multi-family
projects (apartments and condominiums) in the R-3 and PRD-A zones are
also required to have dedicated open space, both common and private to
each individual unit.
Multiple-family developments in the R-3 zone must provide common
recreational and leisure areas that equal at least 400 square feet per unit.
These open space areas may include game courts, swimming pools, sauna
baths, tennis courts, play lots, outdoor cooking areas, and lawn bowling.
Private open space in the form of a patio, yard, balcony, or combination
must contribute to the required recreational and leisure areas and meet the
following minimum sizes and dimensions: for ground level units, 100 square
feet of private yard at grade level is required, with a minimum ground level
dimension of eight feet. Upper level units must be provided 60 square feet
of balcony, with a minimum dimension of six feet.
Multiple-family developments in the R-4 zone must provide front and rear
yards of at least 15 feet and an additional side yard area of at least three feet.
Dedicated, usable open space areas in this zone are not required.
Developments in the PRD-A zone are required to incorporate a minimum of
40 percent of the project area as open space. The requirements are flexible
and do not specify percentages required for private or common open space.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
Site improvements are an important component of new development and
include water, sewer, circulation, and other infrastructure needed to make
development feasible. The City requires developers of larger tracts to pay off-
site extension of the water, sewer, and storm drain systems; traffic signals;
and other needed infrastructure. Developers must construct all internal
streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and affected portions of off-street arterials.
The City also requires landscaping along arterials. These are requirements
that virtually every city imposes on developers and are reflected in housing
costs region wide. New residential construction will either occur as infill,
where infrastructure is already in place, or in undeveloped areas, where
adequate public services and facilities will be required.
   Page       Chapter
    6-48          6
                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
Requiring developers to construct site improvements, pay toward other
infrastructure costs, or provide public services and utility systems increases
the cost of housing. While these impact affordability, these requirements are
necessary to maintain quality of life desired by City residents, and are
consistent with the City’s General Plan goals to ensure that public services
and facilities are in place at the time of need, thus avoiding the overloading
of existing urban service systems. These requirements are common for all
communities throughout the region, fiscally prudent, and therefore are not
considered to be a constraint to housing development.
Density Bonus
Consistent with State law, developers who incorporate affordable housing
into a development may receive density bonuses of 20 to 35 percent,
depending on the amount and type of affordable housing provided;
developers are also entitled to “concessions,” which are exceptions from
normally applicable zoning and other development standards.
Developers may seek a waiver or modification of development standards
that have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development
meeting the density bonus criteria. The developer must show that the waiver
or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.
Developers also have the option to seek incentives or concessions, based on
the proportion of affordable units for target groups. Incentives or
concessions may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in setback and
square footage requirements and a reduction in the ratio of vehicular parking
spaces that would otherwise be required that results in identifiable,
financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.
In addition to the density bonuses required by State law, homes in the PRD-
A zone may also qualify for an additional density bonus of two dwelling units
per acre for passive solar design and two dwelling units per acre for
excellence in design, resulting in up to an additional four dwelling units per
acre.
Providing for a Variety of Housing Types
The Managing the Land Supply Element and Zoning Code contain the basic
standards that allow for the development of many housing types. These
standards allow for multi-family rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile
homes, and supportive housing. Rialto’s development standards are
considered standard for suburban communities in San Bernardino County
and Southern California, and thus do not impede the ability to develop
housing at appropriate densities.
Table 6-30 lists the allowed location of specific uses. Key provisions include:
                                                                                Chapter Page

  Second Units
  The City also has an ordinance allowing the construction of attached or
  detached accessory second units in the R-1 zone, and has adopted
  conditions under which second dwelling units may be permitted. These
  conditions are consistent with State law and include:
          Minimum lot size by district
          Owner of the property must live in one of the units
     Page        Chapter
     6-50             6

                                                        HOUSING ELEMENT
         Only one second dwelling unit permitted on any one lot, provided
          the lot does not contain an existing guest house
         Maximum square footage of an attached second dwelling unit shall
          not exceed 30 percent of the main residential structure; maximum
          square footage of a detached second dwelling unit not less than 400
          square feet but no more than 1,200 square feet.
         Minimum yard setbacks, lot coverage, height restrictions and other
          development standards for the primary unit residence shall apply to
          the secondary dwelling unit
         Mobile and trailer units prohibited
         One off-street parking space is required, not to be located in the
          driveway for the primary residence
The ordinance requires approval of a precise plan of design approved by the
development review committee (DRC).
Multi-family housing
Multi-family housing comprises over 12 percent of the City’s housing stock.
The maximum permitted range from 12 to 45 units per acre. Densities of up
to 60 units per acre are allowed in the Downtown Mixed Use land use
designation and up to 30 units per acre in the Foothill Boulevard Specific
Plan area. Also, the Planned Development Permit process for attached units
offers zoning relief by allowing flexibility for various residential uses.
Achievable densities may be increased further through density bonuses or
application for reduced minimum unit sizes and parking standards.
Residential Care Facilities
Title 18 addresses rest homes, group home facilities, room and board
facilities, boarding houses, and other group living situations. Residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons are considered a standard residential
use and are permitted in all residential districts pursuant to State law.
Residential care facilities are permitted as a conditional use in the A-P and O-
P zones.
Supportive Housing
In a supportive housing development, housing can be coupled with social
services such as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case
management for populations in need of assistance, such as the homeless,
those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the
elderly or medically frail. Supportive housing developments with fewer than
six residents operating as a residential care facility are permitted in single
family zones. In the A-P and O-P zones, supportive housing developments
of any size would require a conditional use permit.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Emergency and Transitional Housing
Emergency shelters provide short-term shelter for homeless persons or
persons facing other difficulties, such as domestic violence. Transitional
housing provides longer-term housing (up to two years), coupled with
supportive services such as job training and counseling, to individuals and
families who are transitioning to permanent housing.
Siting for emergency and transitional housing is based on the residential use
of the facility, not the population these developments serve. Consistent with
State law, small transitional housing serving six or fewer people is considered
a standard residential use and permitted in all zones where residential uses
are permitted. Currently Title 18 does not address emergency shelters and
transitional housing uses. To facilitate the development of emergency
housing and transitional housing, the 2000-2005 Housing Element required
that the City amend Title 18 to provide for emergency homeless shelters and
transitional housing in the light manufacturing (M-1) and industrial park
zones (PID and I-P) zones of the City. The City has not yet made this
amendment. To facilitate the development of emergency housing and
comply with State law,7 the City’s Zoning Code will be amended to
recognize these uses. Specifically, the Zoning Code will be amended to
permit emergency shelters by right in the I-P Zone (Program 26). Conditions
for approval will be clearly specified in the Zoning Code, and will be similar
to conditions required for similar uses in the same zones.
The I-P zone encompasses just over 100 acres, of which 36 acres are vacant.
The zone currently allows a variety of light-industrial, light-manufacturing,
and warehousing uses. The average lot size in the I-P zone is just over 2
acres. Opportunities for homeless shelter siting also exist in warehouse-type
developments with large, ready-to-occupy spaces that would be appropriate
for use as an emergency shelter. The area where the bulk of the I-P zone can
be found is centrally located and well served by major regional
transportation.
Based on the amount of available industrial land, vacant properties, range of
lot sizes available, and opportunities for adaptive reuse of existing buildings,
the zone has sufficient capacity to accommodate the identified homeless
need (237 persons) in at least one year-round shelter.
Manufactured and Mobile Homes
Currently 2,072 mobile homes exist in the City. All land occupied by mobile
home parks has been rezoned to MHD (Mobile Home Development Zone)
to protect these parks from conversion to other uses. This zone was created

  On October 15, 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law SB 2 which amends Government Code
Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5 of State Housing Element Law. This legislation requires local jurisdictions to
strengthen provisions for addressing the housing needs of the homeless, including the identification a zone or zones
where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit. This legislation will take effect
January 1, 2008 and will apply to jurisdictions with housing elements due June 30, 2008 and after.

to provide for an alternative type of residential accommodation for persons
who desire a dwelling other than a conventional single- or multi-family
dwelling. The zone also provides greater diversity in housing choices, types,
and prices. Moreover, Rialto has adopted a mobile home rent control
ordinance to further promote affordability.
Farmworker Housing
As indicated in the Population and Housing Profile, only 81 Rialto residents
have “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing” occupations according to the 2000
Census. The majority of workers in this group are most likely employed in
plant nurseries, landscaping, or gardening companies.              Agricultural
operations in Rialto are limited to a single private citrus grove, and few
agricultural activities occur in the immediate region.
The City permits general agricultural uses in the Agricultural Zone (A-1), but
this is a holdover zone from many years past. As part of planned
comprehensive amendments to Title 18, the City will eliminate this zone.
Single-Room Occupancy Facilities
Single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings house people in single rooms with
tenants often sharing bathrooms and kitchens. The Zoning Code does not
currently reference this type of housing directly, but SROs are permitted as
room and board facilities in the R-3 and R-4 zones. To facilitate the
development of SROs, the City’s Zoning Code will be amended to address
this use, specifying the zones where they would be permitted, development
standards, and conditions for approval (Program 23).
Codes and Enforcement
The Code Enforcement Division of the Development Services Department is
responsible for the enforcement of City standards governing the
construction, alteration, and maintenance of buildings. This includes
structural, electrical, mechanical engineering, plan check services;
administration of abatement programs for substandard and unsafe structures;
and providing State and local code administration interpretations.
The City of Rialto has adopted the Uniform Building Code, which establishes
standards and requires inspections at various stages of construction to
ensure code compliance. The City’s building code also requires new
residential construction to comply with the Federal American Disabilities Act
(ADA) standards, which specify that a minimum percentage of dwelling units
in new developments must be fully accessible to the physically disabled.
While the incorporation of these measures may raise the cost of construction
and therefore housing, these standards are necessary to provide access to
homes for people with disabilities. Further, uniform codes are adopted by
                                                                                Chapter Page

many cities throughout Southern California and do not pose a constraint to
residential development.
Local amendments were made to the California Building Code to facilitate
fire safety and standards related to Rialto. As part of the amendment process,
the City adopted appropriate findings as required by State law. Modified fire
standards include those tailored specifically to tall buildings so that fire
personnel may reach upper floors during emergencies. These standards
include automatic fire sprinkler systems and pressurized doors for buildings
with more than 55 feet above the lowest floor having building access.
The amendment that is most likely to be considered a constraint is the
requirement for installation of an automatic sprinkler system in all Group R,
Division 1 occupancies, which include apartment houses. This is a standard
amendment and helps prevent and quickly extinguish fires that may have far
more costly impacts.
Energy Conservation
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code mandates uniform energy
conservation standards for new construction. Minimum energy conservation
standards implemented through Title 24 may increase initial construction
costs throughout the State, but reduce operating expenses and expenditure
of natural resources over the long run.
Fees and Exactions
The City charges planning and development fees to process and review
permits for residential developments. These development review fees are
updated regularly to reflect the average cost of processing a particular type
of case.

The City also charges impact fees to ensure that services and infrastructure
are in place to serve development. The fees are intended to provide funds to
recover the cost of providing infrastructure, while not unduly constraining
the feasibility of both market-rate and affordable housing, including streets,
water, sewage treatment and disposal, storm drainage, police and fire
protection, libraries, landscaping, traffic control, etc.
State law requires that all development impact fees must have a substantial
connection to the residential development and that fees must be
proportional to the impact. The City’s development impact fees were
recently updated to reflect increasing localized costs for the provision of
infrastructure. However, the fees did not increase substantially, despite the
drastic increase in construction, land costs, and median home prices in the
area during the housing market boom of the mid-2000s. In 2000, impact fees
represented over nine percent of the median sales price of a new single-
family residence ($101,500). By 2006-2007, these same fees represented
about three percent of the median price of a new home ($380,000). With
the collapse of the housing market in 2007-2008, however, the median
home price in the City dropped to $154,000, bumping the impact fee
percentage up to seven and a half percent.

Rialto’s impact fees are comparable to those of surrounding communities in
San Bernardino County, though slightly higher than those of some smaller
communities. A 2006 National Impact Fee Survey listed the impact fees of
neighboring communities Redlands and Highland. While Rialto’s 2007
impact fees are greater than those of the other two cities listed, Redlands has
approximately two-thirds of Rialto’s population, and Highlands’ population is
nearly half of that of Rialto. Although impact fees and requirements that
force developers to make offsite improvements add to the cost of housing,
these fees and requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of life
within a community.

Processing and Permit Procedures
The development review process helps ensure that new housing meets
health and safety codes and has adequate utilities and infrastructure. Yet, the
development review process can also constrain opportunities for the
development of lower-income housing, particularly through the indirect cost
of time in the process and the direct cost in fees.

The Development Services Department is the lead agency for processing
residential development applications and as appropriate, coordinates the
processing of these applications with other City departments and agencies.
The City uses various development permits to ensure quality housing while
minimizing the costs associated with lengthy reviews, and provides a
procedural guide to facilitate the submittal process.
State law requires communities to work toward improving the efficiency of
their building permit and review processes by providing “one-stop”
processing, thereby eliminating the unnecessary duplication of effort. The
Permit Streamlining Act helped reduce governmental delays by limiting
processing time in most cases to one year and requiring agencies to specify
the information needed to complete an acceptable application. The City
makes available a procedural guide for submitting proposed projects.
Planning staff is actively involved in maintaining efficient permit processing
procedures. Processing times for residential projects vary according to the
complexity of the proposal.

Note: Processing times may be substantially longer if an environmental impact report (EIR) is required.
Precise Plan of Design
To ensure high-quality development, the City requires a Precise Plan of
Design (PPD) to be approved by the City’s Development Review Committee
prior to issuance of any building permit for the new construction of housing
or for new development or expansion of an existing use in a Commercial,
Industrial, and overlay zones. The Development Review Committee is
comprised of Building, Engineering, Fire, Planning, Public Works, and Police
staff. The purpose of the Precise Plan is to promote an orderly and
aesthetically pleasing environment, and to ensure that development
complies with all City ordinances and regulations. This process is similar to
the plan check process.
A PPD application to construct a single- or multi-family home takes two to
three months to process. Additional time is needed to review grading plans,
building plan checks, etc. Generally, this process takes two months. Complex
projects involving a general plan amendment, zone change, subdivision, or
                                                                                          Chapter       Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
conditional development permit may take considerably longer to process.
For example, a development project with a zone change would require three
to four months to process. Nonetheless, many of these processes can occur
simultaneously, reducing the time associated with consecutive approvals.
Mobile home developments in the MHD zone and multi-family
developments in the R-3, R-4, and PRD-A zones must receive PPD approval
by the City’s Development Review Committee (DRC). Additionally, single-
family homes in the R-1D and PRD-D zones must also receive PPD approval.
The DRC is comprised of Building, Engineering, Fire, Planning, Public Works,
and Police staff, who work together to ensure that projects conform to
adopted codes and standards.
Conditional Development Permits
The purpose of a conditional development permit is to allow City staff and
decision makers to conduct review of development proposals that have the
potential to create impacts on surrounding uses, and to impose conditions
on such development and operation of uses to ensure compatibility. Multi-
family projects in the R-3 zone consisting of five or more units have a longer
review timeline, as they are subject to approval of a conditional
development permit (CDP) by the City Planning Commission. While this
process may take a bit longer to process residential development permit
applications, the process ensures the compatibility of multi-family
development projects within existing neighborhoods.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires jurisdictions to analyze potential and actual constraints
upon housing for persons with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove
governmental constraints, and include programs to accommodate housing
designed for people with disabilities. The City has no special zoning or land
use restrictions that regulate the siting of housing for persons with
disabilities.
In accordance with State law, Rialto permits state-licensed residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning districts by
right. Several housing types for persons with disabilities are permitted by
right or require a conditional use permit that is no more stringent than those
for other conditional uses. For example:
         Rest homes are conditionally permitted in the A-P (Administrative
          Professional) zone and permitted by right in the O-P (Office Park)
          zone.
         Room and Board Facilities are permitted by right in the R-3 and R-4
          zones.

Inclusion of an overly restrictive definition of a “family” in the zoning code
may have to potential of discriminating against group homes or other
housing for persons with disabilities on the basis of familial status. In Rialto,
“family” is defined as one or more persons living together as a single
nonprofit housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit in conformance with the
Uniform Housing Code. This definition is tailored so as to be open to a
variety of living arrangements and be non-discriminatory.
To accommodate disabled persons in public facilities, the City defers to Title
24 of the California Handicap Accessibility Code. As stated previously, the
City has adopted the 2007 California Building Standards Code. Standards
within the Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with
disabilities. These standards are consistent with the Americans with
Disabilities Act. No local amendments that would constrain accessibility or
increase the cost of housing for persons with disabilities have been adopted.
Reasonable Accommodation
Most housing in Rialto was built before modern accessibility standards were
developed. As such, modifications to homes may be necessary for a disabled
person to gain access. The City allows property owners to install features to
accommodate disabled persons upon payment of building permit and plan
check fee. City staff reviews the application and makes recommendations to
the Planning Commission. Although the minor variance expedites the
approval process for reasonable accommodation, the cost of the minor
variance, coupled with the public hearing, can be a deterrent to making
lower-cost improvements necessary for accessibility purposes. In 2001, the
State Office of the Attorney General issued a letter encouraging local
governments to adopt a reasonable accommodation procedure. Although a
variance is a permissible way to make reasonable accommodations,
situations could arise where a request could be denied under a variance
finding but still be valid as a reasonable accommodation.
The Fair Housing Act requires that cities and counties provide reasonable
accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such
accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities
equal opportunity to housing. The City’s Zoning Code makes special
provisions for the disabled through reduced parking requirements for senior
housing and rest homes. To create a process for making requests for
reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning decisions and
procedures regulating the siting, funding, development and use of housing
for people with disabilities, the City will improve its reasonable
accommodation procedure and provide information to residents via public
counters and the City’s website (Program 25).

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Environmental Constraints
Rialto has several environmental constraints that affect potential
development. These constraints are due to local and regional earthquake
faults, excessive noise levels near transportation routes, mineral extraction
activities, archaeological sensitive lands, historic properties, presence of a
landfill, biological resources, and flood hazards. This section describes these
constraints.
Seismic Conditions
The majority of vacant land in Rialto is located in the northwestern part of
the City, within the Rialto Airport Specific Plan area (to be replaced by the
Renaissance Specific Plan). With the planned closure of the airport by late
2010 or early 2011, the specific plan area is being re-envisioned to allow for
new commercial, industrial, and residential uses. Additionally, vacant area is
abundant in the City’s northern sphere of influence, near Lytle Creek.
However, this area of the City has significant geological hazards. Three faults
run through the area: the San Jacinto, Glen Helen, and Lytle creek faults. As
noted in the Safety Element, the San Jacinto Fault is considered to be one of
the most active in Southern California. The California Division of Mines and
Geology has designated this fault system as one of California’s Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zones. The State Alquist-Priolo Fault Zoning Act was
enacted with the purpose of mitigating the hazard of fault rupture by
prohibiting buildings along all active fault lines.
Noise Levels
In making decisions regarding the location of future residential development,
the City considers how the noise environment might impact residents. Areas
where noise levels either are currently or expected to exceed acceptable
levels, as identified in the Noise Element, are along the I-10 and SR-210
freeway corridors and Riverside Avenue. Additionally, residential land along
other principal arterials may experience unacceptable noise levels.
Mineral Extraction
Lands along Lytle Creek, which traverses the north and northeast sections of
Rialto, have been designated by the State as Mineral Resource Areas. These
areas contain valuable aggregate resources and will remain undeveloped
with urban uses as long as sand and gravel extraction continues, or as long
as mining activity is economically viable. Due to the noise, dust, and trucking
activity associated with mining activities, residential development in the
vicinity is not desirable.

Cultural Resources
Areas along the Lytle Creek Wash and the hills in south Rialto are known to
contain prehistoric cultural resources. Downtown and surrounding
neighborhoods have historic buildings. Prior to development in sensitive
archaeological areas, the City requires detailed studies consistent with State
law and in particular, requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). Where resources are identified, developers could be required
to leave resources in place and protected, thereby reducing sites available
for housing development. With regard to historic buildings, the City requires
a similar review and mitigation process. These processes can increase
development costs but further City cultural resource protection goals.
Flooding
Rialto and surrounding areas are subject to unpredictable seasonal rainfall.
During intense rainfall, the geographic and geologic characteristics typical of
the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, where Rialto is located, make this area
especially vulnerable to flood hazards. The gently sloping alluvial fan upon
which Rialto sties emanates from a deep canyon within the San Gabriel
Mountains, this contributes to the City’s vulnerability to flood hazards.
Though recent decades have seen major flood control efforts, there remain
significant areas of the City where development is limited due to flood
vulnerabilities.
Contaminated Sites
Historically, some areas of Rialto were used for the manufacturing of rocket
fuel and fireworks. U.S. Department of Defense contractors began making
rockets locally in the 1950s, and fuel residue from these sites as well as from
the Mid-Valley Sanitary Landfill has since leaked into the region's
underground water basin. The seepage has created a massive plume of
perchlorate in the groundwater that in 2007 was approximately six miles
long and two miles wide. The City has a zero-tolerance policy, meaning it
will not tolerate any detectable levels of perchlorate in drinking water. This
pollution and the operation of the landfill, 222 acres of which are still active,
could potentially limit housing development at some sites in the City.
Biological
Portions of Rialto are a key natural habitat for the Delhi Sands flower-loving
fly (DSF), which is an endemic insect restricted to the semi-arid sand dunes
in Southern California’s San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The DSF
was put on the Endangered Species list in 1993 by the Fish and Wildlife
                                                                                  Chapter Page

city is severely restricted by the presence of the DSF.
Housing Resources
This section addresses the resources available for the development,
rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in Rialto; provides an overview of
available land resources and residential sites for future housing development;
and evaluates how these resources can work toward satisfying future
housing needs. Also discussed are available financial and administrative
resources to support affordable housing and energy conservation
opportunities.
Availability of Sites for Housing
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
General Plan law requires every city and county to have land zoned to
accommodate its fair share of the regional housing need. This share,
described above as the RHNA, is determined by the regional planning
agency in conjunction with HCD. SCAG is the regional planning agency that
helps develop the RHNA for Rialto and other SCAG-member jurisdictions.
For the 2008-2014 planning period, the projected housing need for the
SCAG region (the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial) is 504,758 new housing units.
To determine whether a jurisdiction has sufficient land to accommodate its
share of regional housing needs for all income groups, that jurisdiction must
identify “adequate sites.” Under state law (California Government Code
section 65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and
development standards, with services and facilities, needed to encourage the
development of a variety of housing for all income levels. Rialto’s RHNA for
the 2008-2014 planning period has been determined by SCAG to be 4,323
housing units, including 1,023 units for very low-income households, 700
units for low-income households, 812 units for moderate-income
households, and 1,788 units for above moderate-income households.

Progress toward the RHNA
State law requires cities and counties to identify sites which are or will be
made available for future residential development within the designated
planning period. Furthermore, cities and counties must demonstrate how
these sites will facilitate and encourage the development of housing that is
affordable to all economic segments. In meeting this requirement,
jurisdictions can credit new housing built since January 2006, qualified
substantial rehabilitation or preservation of at-risk units, and future
development capacity.
Constructed Units
As shown in Table 6-36, a portion of the RHNA has already been achieved
with housing units constructed, under construction, and approved.
Specifically, 388 above moderate-income units and 69 very low-income units
have been constructed or approved since January 1, 2006.

Residential Sites Inventory
The Rialto General Plan establishes several land use designations that allow
for residential development at varying densities. Table 6-37 presents the
General Plan residential land use categories and their corresponding
densities.

Vacant, undeveloped, and uncommitted land in Rialto designated for
residential use totals 265.4 acres. Conservatively, these vacant properties
can accommodate development of approximately 1,053 new residential
units, excluding the downtown and Foothill Boulevard areas (addressed
below).9 Of these, 145 units could occur on properties designated and
zoned for development at 35 units per acre. Based on the provisions of AB
2348, which sets 30 dwelling units per acre as the default affordable density
for Rialto, these properties could support low- and very low-income housing.
The downtown provides a second significant location for housing
development. The General Plan introduces a mixed-use designation for the
area, which permits housing densities up to 60 units per acre. On vacant
land within downtown alone, this new land use category could facilitate
development of 503 housing units for lower-income households.10

  Development potential for vacant land was calculated by first eliminating all properties under 5,000 square feet as being
unlikely to be developed. Likewise, all properties within the environmentally sensitive habitat of the Delhi Sands flower-
loving fly, within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, or within a specific plan area were also eliminated. Gross unit
potential was calculated for the remaining properties by multiplying the acreage by the number of units per acre allowed
by the General Plan designation. Potential dwelling units were then calculated at 80 percent of maximum density to allow
for infrastructure and similar improvements. In cases where the unit calculation resulted in a fraction, the amount was
rounded down to the nearest whole number.
10
   For calculations of development potential in the Downtown Mixed-Use category, an 80 percent residential/20 percent
commercial mix was assumed.

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
The new Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan, to be adopted prior to the General
Plan (before June 2010), establishes land use patterns along this major
thoroughfare, including residential nodes that will allow densities of 30 units
per acre. On currently vacant lots alone, this means the possibility of 1,070
new units.11
The planned redevelopment of Rialto Municipal Airport properties
represents another major source of new housing. The Renaissance Specific
Plan, which encompasses the airport territory, allows for 1,747 units of
moderate- and above moderate-income housing. This new Specific Plan is
expected to be adopted within one year of the General Plan.

Taken together, the current reserve of land in Rialto can accommodate
4,590 new single-family and multi-family units (see Table 6-40). The potential
affordability of those units and a comparison with the affordability
requirements to achieve the 2008-2014 RHNA are detailed in Table 6-40.

   For vacant lots within the Foothill Boulevard Specific Plan area, potential dwelling units were calculated at 80% of
maximum density. For the mixed-use designations, 80 percent residential/20 percent commercial mix was assumed for the
Residential Mixed Use, and 30 percent residential/70 percent commercial mix for the Commercial Mixed Use.

Financial Resources
Rialto has access to varied funding sources to assist with affordable housing
programs. These include local, State, and Federal programs, as well as
private resources. This section describes some of most significant housing
funding sources currently used in Rialto, including the Community
Development Block Grant program (CDBG), redevelopment set-aside funds,
County HOME sources, and Section 8 funds.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
HUD provides funds to local governments for many community
development activities. The eligible range of activities includes, but is not
limited to: 1) acquisition and /or disposition of real estate, 2) public facilities
and improvements, 3) relocation, rehabilitation, and construction (under
certain limitations) of housing, 4) homeownership assistance, and 5)
clearance activities. In addition, these funds can be used to acquire or
subsidize at-risk units. Rialto receives approximately $1.3 million annually in
funding for housing and community development activities from the CDBG
program.
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside
State law requires Rialto’s Redevelopment Agency to set aside 20 percent of
all tax increment revenue generated from redevelopment projects for
affordable housing. The City’s 20 percent set-aside funds must be used for
activities that increase, improve, or preserve the supply of affordable
housing. Housing developed under this program must remain affordable to
the targeted income group for at least 15 years for rentals and 10 years for
ownership housing. The Rialto Redevelopment Agency expects to generate
between $4 million and $5 million per year in set-aside funds to support
housing activities during this Housing Element cycle.

HOME Investment Partnership Program
Rialto is eligible for County HOME funds, which are awarded on a formula
basis by HUD. HOME funds can be used to promote affordable rental
housing and homeownership, including but not limited to building
acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial
rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance.
A city must also provide matching contributions on a sliding scale: 25
percent local share for rental assistance/rehabilitation, 33 percent for
substantial rehabilitation, and 50 percent for new construction. The recently
completed Willow/Winchester rehabilitation was awarded $3 million in
federal HOME funds.
Section 8 Rental Assistance Funds
The San Bernardino County Housing Authority administers the Section 8
Rental Assistance Program that extends rental subsidies to very low-income
households. The subsidy represents the difference between the excess of 30
percent of the recipient’s monthly income and the federally approved fair
market rents. Two types of rental assistance are available: vouchers and
certificates. As of the February 2009, 761 very low-income households in
Rialto receive Section 8 vouchers and certificates.
CalHFA HELP funds
The HELP Program offers a 3.5 percent interest rate loan to local
government entities for their locally determined affordable housing activities
and priorities. HELP Program funds can be used to assist with the acquisition,
development, rehabilitation, or preservation of multi-family rental units and
special needs housing. In addition, this program also provides financing to
facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of ownership housing, as well as
making funds available for the implementation of subordinate loan programs
for eligible home buyers. The Willow/Winchester rehabilitation project
received $2 million in CalHFA HELP funds.
Section 221(d)(4)
Section 221(d)(4) insures mortgage loans to profit-motivated sponsors to
facilitate the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of multi-family
rental or cooperative housing for moderate-income families, elderly, and the
handicapped. This program makes capital more readily available by insuring
lenders against loss on mortgage defaults. Both Southpointe Villa and Willow
Village were financed with Section 221(d)(4) funds.
Section 202
Through the Section 202 program, HUD provides capital advances to
finance the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition with or without
rehabilitation of structures that will serve as supportive housing for very low-
income elderly persons, including the frail elderly, and provides rent
                                                                                 Chapter Page

subsidies for the projects to help make them affordable. This program helps
expand the supply of affordable housing with supportive services for the
elderly. It provides very low-income elderly with options that allow them to
live independently but in an environment that provides support activities
such as cleaning, cooking, transportation, etc. The recently completed
TELACU senior housing project was financed with Section 202 funds.
Administrative Resources
Agencies with administrative capacity to implement programs in the Housing
Element include the City of Rialto, County agencies, and local and national
non-profit private developers.
City of Rialto
The City of Rialto’s Redevelopment Agency and the Development Services
Department are the lead departments implementing many programs
outlined in this Housing Element.
Redevelopment Agency
The Redevelopment Agency is responsible for preserving, increasing, and
improving the supply of affordable housing in the community. The Agency
will also work with developers to create affordable housing opportunities for
low-income households and pursue implementation of Housing Element
programs.      As noted above, the Agency is responsible for determining
expenditure of the 20 percent set-aside fund for housing.
Recreation and Community Services Department
The Recreation and Community Services Department supports affordable
housing in Rialto through administration of the CDBG program.
Development Services Department
Within the Development Services Department are the Planning and Code
Enforcement Divisions. The Planning Department is responsible for preparing
ordinances and polices to facilitate housing development and maintenance.
The Planning Department is also responsible for tracking the number and
affordability of new housing units that will be built during this planning
period. The Code Enforcement Division is responsible for responding to
code violations for substandard housing issues.
Nonprofit Agencies
An alternative to providing subsidies to existing owners to keep units
available as low-income housing is for public or nonprofit agencies to
acquire or construct housing units to replace at-risk units lost to conversion
to market rates. Described below are agencies that can serve as resources in
the implementation of housing activities in Rialto.

Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Utility-related costs can impact the affordability of housing in Southern
California. However, Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth
mandatory energy standards for new development and requires adoption of
an “energy budget.” In turn, the home building industry must comply with
these standards, while localities are responsible for enforcing the energy
conservation regulations.
The following are ways Rialto can set the foundation for achieving these
energy standards. Alternative 1 encompasses the passive solar approach,
which requires proper solar orientation, appropriate levels of thermal mass,
south facing windows, and modern insulation levels. Alternative 2 generally
requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no thermal
mass or window orientation requirements, and Alternative 3 incorporates
passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in exchange for
less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
Rialto encourages energy conservation by offering a density bonus not to
exceed four units per net acre, which may be granted when energy

                                                         HOUSING ELEMENT
consumption per Title 24 State of California Energy Calculations can be
reduced as follows:
1)       Two unit bonus per net acre for passive solar design of units so that
         average energy savings for the units is at least 35 percent of the
         allowed energy consumption per Title 24; and
2)       An additional bonus of two units per net acre for passive solar design
         of units so that average energy savings for the units is at least 50
         percent of the allowed energy consumption per Title 24.
Additional conservation approaches that can be used include: 1) locating the
home on the northern portion of the sunniest part of the site; 2) designing
the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the building and
reduce exposure to extreme weather; 3) locating indoor areas of maximum
use along the south building face; 4) making the main entrance a small
enclosed space that creates an air lock between the building and exterior;
and 5) orienting the entrance away from winds or using a windbreak to
reduce wind velocity. This latter measure has applicability in Rialto, as
significant wind speeds from adjacent mountain passes are common
occurrences.
Utility companies serving Rialto offer programs to promote the efficient
energy use and assist lower-income customers. Southern California Edison
participates in the Low Income Energy Efficiency program to help
homeowners and renters conserve energy and control costs. Eligible
customers receive no-cost weatherization, including attic insulation, energy-
efficient refrigerators, energy-efficient furnaces, weather stripping, caulking,
low-flow showerheads, water heater blankets, and door and building
envelope repairs which reduce air infiltration. Edison also participates in the
California Alternate Rates for Energy program, which provides a 15 percent
discount on electric bills for low-income customers.
Edison offers a summer discount plan that provides rate discounts when the
customer allows Edison to turn off their central air conditioner by remote
control, for time periods chosen by the customer, when power supply gets
tight, as well as a number of rebates and incentives for homeowners using
energy-efficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, lighting, and
insulation and weatherization improvements. Also, the 2007 Residential
Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers property owners and
managers incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency improvements in
lighting, HVAC, insulation and window categories. These improvements are
to be used to retrofit existing multi-family properties of two or more units.

Evaluation of 2000 Housing Element Programs
State law (California Government Code Section 65588[a]) requires
jurisdictions to review their housing elements to evaluate:
        The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in
         contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal;
        The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the
         community’s housing goals and objectives; and
        The progress in implementation of the housing element.
These results should be quantified where possible (e.g., rehabilitation results),
but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental
constraints). Past accomplishments are compared with what was projected
or planned as part of the earlier housing element. The evaluation helps a
jurisdiction identify the extent to which adopted programs have been
successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and
how such programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future
housing needs. The evaluation provides the basis for recommended
modifications to policies and programs in the updated element, and provides
meaningful guidance for establishing new objectives.
This section summarizes Rialto’s accomplishments toward implementing the
2000-2005 Housing Element. A program-by-program review is presented in
Table 6-42. Table 6-42 summarizes the quantified objectives contained in
the City’s 2000 Housing Element and evaluates the progress toward fulfilling
these objectives.

The 2000 Housing Element was found to be in compliance by the State in
2001. The Element demonstrated that the City had adequate zoning and
sites to meet its 2000-2005 RHNA of 2,199. The City maintained adequate
sites within existing land use policy to facilitate the development of
additional housing units. However, development interest in the City did not
create all of the projected RHNA units. Based upon a review of Building
Department records, between 2000 and 2005, only 33 percent of the
regional housing construction needs were met. The 2008 Housing Element
again meets the RHNA to accommodate regional growth. Rehabilitation
efforts fell slightly short of the overall 2000 goals, but exceeded the goals by
more than 100 homes in the low-income category. The updated program
includes increased marketing to increase awareness of the programs.
Housing Plan
The Housing Plan provides direction for City decision makers to achieve the
long-term housing objectives set forth in the Rialto Housing Element. This
Plan identifies goals, policies, and programs aimed at providing additional
housing opportunities, removing governmental constraints to affordable
housing, improving the condition of existing housing, and providing equal
housing opportunities for all residents. These goals, policies, and programs
continue the City’s efforts to expand the local supply of housing while
improving quality and affordability.
As used here, a goal is a statement defining a desired end result; for
example: Create greater housing options for low- income residents. A policy
is a plan of action to guide decisions and actions; for example: Promote the
revitalization and rehabilitation of residential structures that are substandard
or have fallen into disrepair. The program identifies the method, agencies,

officials, funding sources, and time frame the City will undertake to
implement the policies and achieve the goals set forth in this Housing
Element. Together, goals, policies, and programs establish the framework for
making decisions that affect the availability of housing in Rialto.
In adopting this updated element, the City Council has translated and
expanded the goals, policies, quantified objectives, and housing program of
the prior Housing Element. The goals, policies, and program contained in the
prior Element have been reintroduced, augmented, or eliminated as
appropriate, based on input from the constraints analysis in this Element,
input from City staff, and comments received at public meetings and
hearings.
Housing Goals, Policies and Programs
Housing Conservation and Improvement
Housing and neighborhood conservation are important to maintaining and
improving quality of life. Though the majority of the City’s housing stock is
new, some of the older neighborhoods show signs of inadequate
maintenance and deterioration. Neighborhoods with large numbers of
foreclosed and abandoned homes are a particular concern, especially with
the recent collapse of the housing market. Efforts to improve and revitalize
housing must not only address existing conditions, but also focus on
preventative repairs to ensure the quality of the housing stock is maintained.
The following policies address the continued need for housing and
neighborhood conservation.
Goal 6-1:          Maintain and improve the quality of existing housing
                   and neighborhoods in Rialto.
Policy 6-1.1:      Promote the revitalization and rehabilitation of residential
                   structures that are substandard or have fallen into
                   disrepair.
Policy 6-1.2:      Promote the maintenance of existing sound quality
                   housing through preventative, rather than remedial,
                   maintenance.
Policy 6-1.3:      Encourage neighborhood and local involvement in
                   addressing housing and neighborhood maintenance and
                   improvement.
Policy 6-1.4:      Undertake comprehensive neighborhood reinvestment
                   strategies to stabilize and improve neighborhoods.
                                                                                Chapter Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Policy 6-1.5:        Preserve the existing character and quality of established
                     single-family neighborhoods and communities.
Policy 6-1.6:        Promote focused code enforcement and rehabilitation
                     efforts to reverse the decline of transitioning
                     neighborhoods.
Policy 6-1.7:        Promote the conservation of physically sound buildings
                     and neighborhoods that have historical or architectural
                     significance.
Program 1 – Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resale Program
The Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resale (ARR) Program is designed to
acquire, maintain and rehabilitate foreclosed homes (described as single-
family units, condominiums and townhomes) and resell these homes to
qualified income homebuyers. The homes will be acquired by either the City
or by for-profit or non-profit companies under the agreement of the City.
The homebuyers will be required to be low-to-moderate income. The ARR
Program is part of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP 1) grant
that was created by HUD to deal with the foreclosure crisis. The City has
applied for a second NSP grant (known as NSP 2).
Actions:                 Assist approximately 100 homes under the NSP 1
                         grant and approximately 200 homes under the NSP 2
                         grant.
Timeframe:               Ongoing
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Funding Sources:         Federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program
Program 2 – Home Sweet Home
The Home Sweet Home Program is a deferred loan program which provides
up to $60,000 for single-family property improvements. This home
improvement program works in tandem with the City’s code enforcement
activities to focus on specific neighborhoods. Code inspections are made of
each property in the target neighborhoods. Where code violations are cited,
below-market-rate loans are made available to qualified homeowners to help
correct the violations. Loan repayment terms are tailored to the
homeowner’s ability to pay. The Home Sweet Home Program is funded with
the City’s Redevelopment Set-Aside funds.

Program 9 – Multi-family Improvement Districts
The City will continue to expand it Multi-family improvement District
program. Existing districts include the Willow-Winchester neighborhood
(now known as Citrus Grove) in which all the units were acquired,
rehabilitated, and converted into an affordable apartment complex. It also
includes pilot experiment in the East Jackson Street neighborhood.
The program is multi-action oriented.            It includes implementing an
acquisition, rehabilitation and affordable rental program as noted above for
the Willow-Winchester neighborhood. It also could include creation of an
assessment district by the owners of at least two-thirds of the properties in a
neighborhood, helping to mitigate the negative effects of one or two
irresponsible landlords. If an assessment district were to be voted into
existence, membership fees would be collected from every property owner
in the district. Money from these fees could be used for improvements like
supplemental security, landscape maintenance, supplemental code
enforcement, parks, benches, and parking.
Actions:                 Evaluate the expansion of this program to other neighborhoods beyond
                         Willow-Winchester and East Jackson Street.
Timeframe:               Evaluation of neighborhoods – 1 year from adoption.

                         sources.
Program 10 – Citywide Homeowner Association Survey
The City will conduct a citywide survey of homeowner associations to
identify and analyze their strength and health. In addition, the City will
evaluate the options for enforcement legislation or incentive policies that
would encourage strong homeowners’ associations.
The strength of the homeowners association is one of the critical factors
contributing to the long term success of a common-interest development.
Factors common to effective HOAs are:
        An active Board of Directors, elected by the residents
        An approved set of CCRs and a willingness to enforce them
        Strong on-site property management
        Good potential tenant screening
        Adequate budgeting and reserves to address ongoing expenses and
         deferred maintenance

Larger multi-family properties which do not have these factors in place are
likely to experience continuing problems, eventually leading to problem
tenants, deteriorating appearance, and diminishing property values. These
troubled properties eventually contribute to the decline of the surrounding
neighborhood.
Actions:                  Conduct      citywide    survey    of   homeowners’
                          associations. Investigate and evaluate regulatory and

Program 11 – Targeted Neighborhood Approach
The major source of housing problems and other societal neighborhood
problems in the City of Rialto is distressed, poorly managed multi-family
properties. In addition, the surrounding neighborhoods where these
properties are located need attention as well. To systematically address
these problem neighborhoods, the City will adopt a Targeted Neighborhood
approach, focusing a variety of resources on specific neighborhoods in a
concentrated and comprehensive fashion.
The problem neighborhoods in Rialto could further degrade if the housing
market continues to stagnate and/or if the economy worsens. These
problem neighborhoods have the following characteristics:
        Distressed multifamily apartment projects with both property
         management problems and site/maintenance problems
        Physical decline in surrounding single-family properties
        Lack of consistent enforcement of current city codes and ordinances
        Increasing foreclosures in recently purchased ownership housing and
         refinancing of mortgage loans (single-family units and condos), both
         as a result of aggressive financing (described above)
Under the Targeted Neighborhood Approach, the City will first identify and
prioritize its problem neighborhoods. The neighborhood with the greatest
need will receive a concentration of resources, potentially including, but not
limited to:
1.       A dedicated code enforcement officer
2.       The creation of Multifamily Improvement Districts in multifamily
         residential neighborhoods

3.      A preference for rehabilitation loans for landlords to improve the
        appearance of their properties
4.      A focus of redevelopment funding
5.      The development of Neighborhood Watch and volunteer code
        enforcement programs
When an area is stabilized with an active group of local residents and
landlords taking part in its further maintenance, the City will move on to
target the neighborhood with the next greatest need.
Actions:                1. Identify and prioritize problem neighborhoods
                        2. Determine which resources would be most
                            appropriate for the targeted neighborhood
                        3. Determine measurements to be used to measure
                            success of program
                        4. Apply resources to targeted neighborhood until
                            desired measurements achieved
                        5. Move on to next neighborhood on priority list
Timeframe:              Identify and prioritize problem neighborhoods – 6

Program 12 – Receivership
To deal with blighted properties that have been vacant for an extended
period of time, the City has recourse to the option of receivership. The
primary goal of this program is not to deprive property owners of their rights,
but to assist them with remedying the problems that exist with the property.
In cases where the owner cannot be contacted, or refuses to cooperate,
however, the City has proactively sought the appointment of a receiver to
oversee the repair and maintenance of the property, and to ensure that the
property is occupied or purchased by an owner who will maintain the
property.
Actions:                Continue to implement receivership as needed.

Program 13 – Crime Free Multi-Housing
To address concerns of crimes against property and persons in multi-family
housing developments which historically have had such problems, the City
will develop a Crime Free Multi-Housing Program. This program may include
such measures as a certification process for property owners and
management companies that partner with the Police Department and
receive specialized training to keep their multi-family housing crime free.
The incentives to participate may include police-issued signs for the property,
certificates of participation, and advertising privileges that would allow
participating multi-family housing properties to be promoted in the media as
a “crime-free” property.
Another component could be a Crime Free Lease Addendum, which would
be added to rental agreements and would list specific criminal acts that, if
committed on the property, will result in the immediate termination of the
resident’s lease.
Actions:                  Develop and find funding for program; implement
                          program in multi-family neighborhoods

                    extremely low-income households through emergency
                    shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and
                    single-room occupancy units.
 
Policy 6-2.5:       Support the efforts of the Redevelopment Agency to
                    acquire surplus City-owned sites and make them available
                    for affordable housing development.
Policy 6-2.6:       Promote the phased and orderly development of new
                    neighborhoods consistent with the provision of
                    infrastructure improvements.
Program 14 – Providing Adequate Sites
The General Plan Land Use Policy Map being adopted simultaneously with
this Housing Element re-designates sufficient sites at high-enough densities
for the City to meet and exceed its Regional Housing Needs Assessment
allocation for the provision of sites adequate to the development of housing
along a broad spectrum of affordability levels. Within two years, the City is
required by State Law to update its Zoning Code to bring it into compliance
with the new General Plan. Within one year the City will also adopt the
Renaissance Specific Plan, replacing the current Airport Specific Plan and
opening up significant new residential development opportunities.
Action:                  The City will adopt the Renaissance Specific Plan and
                         update the Rialto Zoning Code to bring it into

Program 15 - Downpayment Assistance Program
The Downpayment Assistance (DPA) Program will provide down-payment
assistance to homebuyers acquiring a home through the ARR Program. A
maximum $10,000 deferred loan will be provided as the down-payment
assistance. The loan will be forgiven if the homeowner resides at the home
for at least 15 years. Homebuyers are required to be low-to-moderate
income. The DPA Program is part of the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program (NSP 1) grant that was created by HUD to deal with the foreclosure
crisis. The City has applied for a second NSP grant (known as NSP 2).
Actions:                 Approximately 100 homes under the NSP 1 grant and
                         approximately 200 homes under the NSP 2 grant.

Program 17 – Preservation of At-Risk Units
The City works with individual property owners to encourage the
maintenance of affordability of assisted units. There are 301 assisted multi-
family units at risk of converting to market rates by 2010. Of the four at-risk
projects, two are funded by federally derived Section 8. In addition, State,
local, or other funding sources can be used to provide rental subsidies to
maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be
structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy covers the
cost of the unit above 30 percent of the tenant’s household income
(including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of the apartment.
This program can be implemented through vouchers so that tenants may
choose where they want to live. However, the success of such programs
relies on the willingness of landlords to accept these vouchers.
Some of the options for preserving affordability should the owners decide to
opt out of the Section 8 program include:
       Provision of financial incentives
       Transferring ownership to a non-profit housing corporation
       Provision of rent subsidies (redevelopment set-aside, CDBG, and
        County HOME funds)
       Purchasing similar units to be maintained as affordable housing
       Building new affordable housing units to replace the lost units
Actions:                 Work with property owners to develop a strategy to
                         maintain affordability controls on assisted units.

Program 20 – Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 Rental Assistance program provides rent subsidies to very low-
income households that spend more than 50 percent or their income on
rent. Rental assistance not only addresses housing affordability, but also
addresses overcrowding by allowing families who are “doubling up” to
afford housing. Under the certificate program, prospective renters secure
housing from HUD-registered apartments that accept the certificates. HUD
pays to the landlords the difference between what the tenant can afford to
pay (30 percent of their income) and the fair market rent. Under the voucher
program, a family can choose housing that costs more than the fair market
rent, provided the tenant pays the additional rent. The County Housing
Authority administers the Section 8 program on behalf of the City.
Actions:               Continue subsidy and encourage registration of
                       buildings; provide information and referrals to
                       landlords regarding participation in the Housing
                       Choice Voucher Program.

Program 21 – Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
Through the Security Deposit Assistance Program, the County uses HOME
funds to provide financial assistance with required security deposits on rental
housing units and tenant-paid utilities to persons who can afford monthly
rent payments but lack necessary funds to get into and/or, to avoid being
displaced from, decent housing. In addition, the County provides funds to
low- and moderate-income renter households through the Monthly Rent
Subsidies Program, also funded by the County HOME Program.

Program 22 – Density Bonus
In accordance with State regulations, the City provides density bonuses for
residential developments that meet specified criteria. In the past, variances
that allow increased density have been designed to meet the needs of target
groups identified in the City’s Housing Element. The City will adopt an
implementing density bonus ordinance that complies with State law.
Actions:                 Encourage housing development through the
                         provision of density bonus/equivalent incentives.
                         Incorporate the density bonus program into the
                         zoning ordinance.

Program 23 – Energy Conservation Density Bonus Program
Rialto encourages energy conservation by offering a density bonus not to
exceed four units per net acre, which may be granted with energy
consumption, according to Title 24 State of California Energy Calculations,
can be reduced as follows: 1) two-unit bonus per net acre for passive solar
design of units for which average energy savings is 35 percent of the allowed
energy consumption, and 2) an additional two unit bonus per net acre for
passive solar design of units for which average energy savings is 50 percent
of the above standard.
Actions:                 Continue to implement the Energy Conservation
                         Density Bonus Program to reduce energy
                         consumption.

Removing Governmental Constraints
Factors that pose constraints to the provision of housing include the costs of
developing both ownership and rental housing, which are ultimately passed
to the consumers; the availability and cost of mortgage and rehabilitation
financing; and restrictive zoning or other development regulations. These
factors tend to disproportionately impact lower- and moderate-income
households due to their limited resources for absorbing the costs. The City of
Rialto will, where legally possible, remove governmental constraints affecting
the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.

Goal 6-4:           Alleviate any potential governmental constraints to
                    housing production and affordability.
Policy 6-4.1:       Periodically review City regulations and ordinances to
                    ensure that they do not unduly constrain housing
                    development.
Policy 6-4.2:       Offer financial and/or regulatory incentives where
                    feasible to offset or reduce the costs of developing
                    affordable housing.
Policy 6-4.3:       Provide for timely processing of development projects to
                    minimize project holding costs.
Policy 6-4.4:       Periodically review residential development fees and
                    service fees to ensure that they are appropriately related
                    to and do not constrain the development.
Program 24 – Second Unit Ordinance
In 1994, the City adopted a Second Unit Ordinance to provide additional
affordable housing options in the community. Subject to a Conditional
Development Permit (CDP), these units can provide independent and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households.
Actions:                Amend the Zoning Ordinance to provide for a
                        ministerial process for CDP approval. Continue
                        implementation of the Second Unit Ordinance.

Program 26 – Extremely Low Income and Special Needs
Housing
Extremely low-income households and households with special needs have
limited housing options. Housing types appropriate for these groups include
emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-
room occupancy (SRO) units. As part of the Governmental Constraints
analysis, the following revisions to the Rialto Zoning Code, as required by
State law, are identified as appropriate to better facilitate the provision of a
variety of housing types:
Actions:
     Amend the Zoning Code to facilitate housing opportunities for
        extremely low-income persons by establishing definitions,
        performance standards, and siting regulations for transitional and
        supportive housing development and single-room occupancy
        developments (SRO).
     Amend the Zoning Code to provide for emergency homeless
        shelters as a permitted use in the I-P zone, and develop objective
        standards to regulate emergency shelters, as provided for in SB2.
        Develop additional written, objective standards for emergency
        shelters to regulate the following, as permitted in SB2:
             The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be
                served nightly;
             Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to
                exceed parking requirements for other residential or
                commercial uses in the same zone;
             The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and
                client intake areas;
             The provision of onsite management;
             The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that
                emergency shelters are not required to be more than 300
                feet apart;
             The length of stay;
             Lighting; and
             Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in
                operation.

Program 27 – Amend the Zoning Code to prohibit new
single-family development on land zoned for multi-family
development.
Rialto’s current Zoning Code allows for single-family development to occur
in all residential zones. This can have the effect of using scarce land available
for multi-family development with lower-density housing.
Actions:                  As part of a focused Zoning Code amendment
                          process to ensure compliance with the updated
                          General Plan, establish minimum density limits for
                          each zone district.

Equal Housing Opportunity
To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that
housing is accessible to all residents, regardless of race, religion, family
status, age, or physical disability.
Goal 6-5:            Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in
                     the housing of their choice.
Policy 6-5.1:        Continue to enforce fair housing laws prohibiting
                     arbitrary discrimination in the building, financing, selling
                     or renting of housing on the basis of race, religion, family
                     status, national origin, disability, or other protected class.
Policy 6-5.2:        Ensure that residents are aware of their rights and
                     responsibilities regarding fair housing.
Policy 6-5.3:        Continue to cooperate with the Inland Mediation Board
                     to enforce fair housing laws, and provide fair housing
                     education services.

Program 29 – Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
The Fair Housing Act requires that cities and counties provide reasonable
accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such
accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities
equal opportunity to housing. The City’s Zoning Code makes special
provisions for the disabled through reduced parking requirements for senior
housing and rest homes. To create a process for making requests for
reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning decisions and
procedures regulating the siting, funding, development and use of housing
for people with disabilities, the City will adopt a reasonable accommodation
procedure either by resolution or included in the Zoning Code, and will
provide information to residents via public counters and the City’s website.
Actions:                Adopt a reasonable accommodation procedure
                        and/or      Zoning     Code     amendment;    provide

Introduction
The future of Rialto is linked strongly to its past. The cultural and historical
resources in Rialto remind the community of our foundation and show how
the City has evolved and changed, both physically and socially, over the
years.
Rialto has undertaken efforts to showcase its past. Downtown’s art theme
incorporates orange crate labels that reflect back to a period when the citrus
industry was the economic foundation of the community, providing local
jobs and opportunity for the families that settled in Rialto. In fact, many old-
timers can probably recount stories of working at a citrus packing house or
playing among the orange groves. Today, only one remaining citrus grove
remains: on property along Cactus Avenue, just south of Merrill Avenue.
Although Rialto has changed over the years, simply by uncovering a thin
layer of the urban fabric, we can reveal a story or two about the historic and
cultural heritage of Rialto. This Chapter provides direction for enhancing the
historical resources in Rialto. As Rialto continues to evolve, the policies in
this Chapter will help Rialto reflect and possibly preserve the history that is
still present or yet to be uncovered.

Our History and Culture: Providing Context
Rialto has a long and eventful history. Although it would take many pages to
describe the entire story of Rialto, the following captures important defining
times in the City’s history.
In 1500, Serrano Indians occupied the Rialto Bench, the top of the bluff
above the west bank of Lytle Creek between Etiwanda Avenue to Walnut.
The bench protected these first settlers from occasional flooding, but was
close enough to access the resources along the creek. Over the years, many
Indian artifacts have been located along the bench.
                                                                               Citrus groves and
The new town of Rialto was founded with the introduction of the Santa Fe       the citrus industry,
Railroad, connecting San Bernardino to Los Angeles, in 1887. The area          as represented in
began initially as a citrus-growing town with over 2,000 residents. Low land   this citrus crate
prices, soils, and other conditions made it ideal for citrus growing. Citrus   label, are important

In the 1950s, orange groves were replaced by housing subdivisions as Rialto
became one of the fastest growing cities in the region.

                expands the fur trade in the San Bernardino Mountains.
1851:           Five hundred Mormons from Salt Lake City settle in the San
                Bernardino Valley near a creek they named Lytle Creek, after
                their leader Captain Andrew Lytle. They claim rights to
                homestead potions above Lytle Creek that would eventually
                become known as the Rialto Bench.
1845-1860s:     Development of the lumber industry and discovery of gold in
                the area’s mountains occur.

1853:           Colonel Henry Washington surveys the California Base Line
                (Base Line Road), which becomes the basis for land titles and
                a major road through the San Bernardino Valley.
1860s-1870s: Rialto’s access to water and frequent winds attract citrus
                farmers.
1887:           The Semi-Tropic Land and Water Company lays out the
                townsite of Rialto on the new Santa Fe Railroad line between
                San Bernardino and Los Angeles.
1887:           A group of Kansas Methodists, headed by the Reverend T. C.
                Miller, arrived in the area looking for a site for a Methodist
                College. They eventually started the town later to be named
                Rialto.

California Historical Landmarks and Points of Interest
Grapeland Homesteads and Water Works
In 1890, the Grapeland Irrigation District was formed to capture and utilize
the waters of Lytle Creek, encouraging settlement and fruit farming north of
the Fontana and Rialto areas, formerly known as Grapeland. In the 1880s,
the community of Grapeland, covering approximately 10,600 acres,
consisted of a school, post office, and commercial businesses, as well as
small ranches along Lytle Creek Road. The water works consisted of the
former Sierra Vista Reservoir built by Chinese laborers in 1886 and various
irrigation canals, conduits, and tunnels. See Exhibit 7.1 for Grapeland
Irrigation District boundary.
Agua Mansa Community
Agua Mansa was the home of New Mexican colonists on the Bandini
Donation that was established on the north side of the Santa Ana River,
along a stretch of road constructed by the missionaries of San Gabriel. Agua
Mansa (Gentle Water) was a seemingly ideal settlement location because
the Santa Ana River flowed through the area and the soil was rich. The new
settlers built adobe homes and had their plots of land in the river bottom,

National Old Trails Highway (Route 66)
The National Old Trails Highway, a transcontinental transportation route and
the pre-cursor to Historic Route 66, was completed between 1911 and
1914, and much of the history of San Bernardino County has been made
along this trail. This route was originally a Mojave Indian travel and trade trail
from the Colorado River to the California coast.
San Bernardino County Museum
This was the original site of the San Bernardino County Museum, located at
18860 Orange Avenue in Bloomington. Originally opened to the public in
1957, the museum was started by the San Bernardino County Historical
Society and the San Pedro Pioneer Society in 1951. The former building was
demolished at an unknown date.
Bloomington Garage
The Bloomington Garage, built in 1911, is considered important to the
history of Bloomington. The garage was the first commercial business at the
corner of Cedar Avenue and Valley Boulevard, and opened to serve the new
motoring community of this portion of Southern California during the early
twentieth century. Owned an operated by the LaGue family for 77 years, it is
among the oldest buildings in Bloomington.

                                               IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Introduction
This Implementation Plan will guide City elected officials, Commissions and Committees, staff, and
the public in efforts to put into practice the adopted General Plan goals and policies. The purpose
of the Implementation Plan is to translate the direction set forth in the General Plan and the Guiding
Principles from general terms to specific actions.
Each implementation measure is a procedure, program, or technique that requires City action,
either alone or in collaboration with non-City organizations or State and federal agencies. Some of
the implementation measures are processes or procedures that the City currently administers on a
day-to-day basis (such as development project review), while others identify new programs or
projects. Completion of the identified measures will be subject to funding availability.
The implementation measures are organized by General Plan elements:
               Managing the Land Supply: Land Use, Open Space, Community Design, and
                Conservation
               Investing in the Future: Economic Development, Redevelopment, Infrastructure, and
                Public Services and Facilities
               Making the Connections: Circulation
               Creating Great Neighborhoods: Safety and Noise
               Where We Live: Housing
               Our Roots: Cultural and Historical Resources
Each implementation measure relates directly to one or more General Plan policy, drawn from
various elements. For each program, the related General Plan policies are listed, along with the
responsible agencies or City departments, the recommended time frame, and likely funding source.
The measures are not grouped by element, as the measures can relate to policies in more than one
element.
This Implementation Plan is intended for use as the basis for preparing the Annual Report to the
City Council on the status of the City’s progress in implementing the General Plan, as described in
Section 65400 of the Government Code. Because many of the individual actions and programs act
as mitigation for environmental impacts resulting from planned development pursuant to the
General Plan, the annual report can also provide a means of monitoring application of the
mitigation measures as required by Public Resources Code Section 21081.6. The programs should
be updated concurrent with the budget process and whenever the City’s General Plan is amended
or updated to provide continued consistency and usefulness.
Key to Time Frames:
    Short-term = 0-5 years
    Mid-term = 5-10 years
    Long-term = 10-20 years
    On-going = May require short-, mid-, and long-term actions

Measure 8.103: Multi-family Improvement Districts
The City will continue and expand its Multi-family Improvement District program, currently in a pilot

creation of an assessment district by the owners of at least two-thirds of the properties in a
neighborhood, helps to mitigate the negative effects of one or two irresponsible landlords. If an
assessment district is voted into existence, membership fees are collected from every property
owner in the district. Money from these fees can be used for improvements like supplemental
security, landscape maintenance, supplemental code enforcement, parks, benches, and parking.
Actions:     Evaluate the expansion of the program to other neighborhoods beyond East Jackson
             Street. If other neighborhoods are found where this program might be useful, begin a

The strength of the homeowners association is one of the critical factors contributing to the long
term success of a common-interest development. Factors common to effective HOA’s are:
       An active Board of Directors, elected by the residents.
       An approved set of CCR’s and a willingness to enforce them
       Strong on-site property management
       Good potential tenant screening
       Adequate budgeting and reserves to address ongoing expenses and deferred maintenance

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Larger multi-family properties which do not have these factors in place are likely to experience
continuing problems, eventually leading to problem tenants, deteriorating appearance, and
diminishing property values. These troubled properties eventually contribute to the decline of the
surrounding neighborhood.
Actions: Conduct citywide survey of homeowners’ associations. Investigate and evaluate regulatory
and incentive-based options to encourage strong homeowners’ associations.

Measure 8.105: Targeted Neighborhood Approach
The major source of housing problems and other societal neighborhood problems in the City of
Rialto is distressed, poorly managed multi-family properties. In addition, the surrounding
neighborhoods where these properties are located need attention as well. To systematically address
these problem neighborhoods, the City will adopt a Targeted Neighborhood approach, focusing a
variety of resources on specific neighborhoods in a concentrated and comprehensive fashion.
The problem neighborhoods in Rialto could further degrade if the housing market continues to
stagnate and/or if the economy worsens. These problem neighborhoods have the following
characteristics:
       Distressed multifamily apartment projects with both property management problems and
        site/maintenance problems
       Physical decline in surrounding single-family properties
       Lack of consistent enforcement of current city codes and ordinances
       Increasing foreclosures in recently purchased ownership housing and refinancing of
        mortgage loans (single-family units and condos), both as a result of aggressive financing
        (described above)
Under the Targeted Neighborhood Approach, the City will first identify and prioritize its problem
neighborhoods. The neighborhood with the greatest need will receive a concentration of resources,
potentially including, but not limited to:
1.  A dedicated code enforcement officer
2.  The creation of Multifamily Improvement Districts in multifamily residential neighborhoods
3.  A preference for rehabilitation loans for landlords to improve the appearance of their properties
4.  A focus of redevelopment funding
5.  The development of Neighborhood Watch and volunteer code enforcement programs
When an area is stabilized with an active group of local residents and landlords taking part in its
further maintenance, the City will move on to target the neighborhood with the next greatest need.
Actions:     1. Identify and prioritize problem neighborhoods
             2. Determine which resources would be most appropriate for the targeted
                 neighborhood

Measure 8.106: Receivership
To deal with blighted properties that have been vacant for an extended period of time, the City has
recourse to the option of receivership. The primary goal of this program is not to deprive property
owners of their rights, but to assist them with remedying the problems that exist with the property.
In cases where the owner cannot be contacted, or refuses to cooperate, however the City has
proactively sought the appointment of a receiver to oversee the repair and maintenance of the
property, and to ensure that the property is occupied or purchased by an owner that will maintain
the property.

To address concerns of crimes against property and persons in multi-family housing developments
which historically have had such problems, the City will develop a Crime Free Multi-Housing
Program. This program may include such measures as a certification process for property owners
and management companies that partner with the Police Department and receive specialized
training to keep their multi-family housing crime free. The incentives to participate may include
police-issued signs for the property, certificates of participation, and advertising privileges that
would allow participating multi-family housing properties to be promoted in the media as a “crime-
free” property.
Another component could be a Crime Free Lease Addendum, which would be added to rental
agreements and would list specific criminal acts that, if committed on the property, will result in the
immediate termination of the resident’s lease.

Measure 8.110: Preservation of At-Risk Units
The City works with individual property owners to encourage the maintenance of affordability of
assisted units. The City has 301 assisted multi-family units at risk of converting to market rates by
2010. Of the four at-risk projects, two are funded by federally derived Section 8. In addition, State,
local, or other funding sources can be used to provide rental subsidies in order to maintain the
affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be structured to mirror the Section 8 program,
whereby the subsidy covers the cost of the unit above 30 percent of the tenant’s household income
(including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of the apartment. This program can be
implemented through vouchers, so that tenants may choose where they want to live. However, the
success of such programs relies on the willingness of landlords to accept these vouchers.
Some of the options for preserving affordability should the owners decide to opt out of the Section
8 program include:

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
The City participates in the federal Mortgage Credit Certificate Program operated by San
Bernardino County. The MCC program allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take an annual
credit against their federal income taxes of up to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on the
applicant’s mortgage. Because of the tax credit allowance, homebuyers have more income available
to qualify for a mortgage loan and make monthly payments. Therefore, the MCC Program is a way
to further leverage homeownership assistance.

Measure 8.113: Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 Rental Assistance program provides rent subsidies to very low income households
who spend more than 50 percent or their income on rent. Rental assistance not only addresses
housing affordability, but also addresses overcrowding by allowing families who are “doubling up”
to afford housing. Under the certificate program, prospective renters secure housing form HUD-
registered apartments that accept the certificates. HUD pays to the landlords the difference
between what the tenant can afford to pay (30 percent of their income) and the fair market rent
(FMR). Under the voucher program, a family can choose housing that costs more than the FMR,
provided the tenant pays the additional rent. The County Housing Authority administers the Section
8 program on behalf of the City.
Actions:     Continue subsidy and encourage registration of buildings; provide information and
             referrals to landlords regarding participation in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

Glossary
Acres, Gross: The entire acreage of a site. Gross acreage is calculated to the centerline of proposed
bounding streets and to the edge of the right-of-way of existing or dedicated streets.
Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can actually be built upon. The following are not included in
the net acreage of a site: public or private road rights-of-way, public open-space, and flood ways.
Affordable Housing: Housing capable of being purchased or rented by a household with very low,
low, or moderate income, based on a household’s ability to make monthly payments necessary to
obtain housing. “Affordable to low- and moderate- income households” means that at least 20
percent of the units in a development will be sold or rented to lower-income households, and the
remaining units to either lower- or moderate-income households. Housing units for lower-income
households must sell or rent for a monthly cost not greater than 30 percent of 60 percent of area
median income as periodically established by HCD. Housing units for moderate income must sell or
rent for a monthly cost not greater than 30 percent of area median income.
Aggregate Minerals. Minerals that are comprised of sorted sand, gravel, and crushed stone material,
valued largely for their strength when blended. It is primarily used either as an engineered soil base
for stability or in the form of concrete or asphalt products.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act: California seismic zoning act passed in 1972 in
response to the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in order to prevent building across the traces of
active faults. The act establishes Earthquake Fault Zones, which are regulatory zones around active
faults. Before a project can be permitted, cities and counties must require a geologic investigation
within an Earthquake Fault Zone to demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed
across active faults. An evaluation and written report of a specific site must be prepared by a
licensed geologist. If an active fault is found, a structure for human occupancy cannot be placed
over the trace of the fault and must be set back from the fault (generally 50 feet).
Ambient: Surrounding on all sides; used to describe measurements of existing conditions with
respect to traffic, noise, air and other environments.

water supply.
Arterial Highway: Medium to higher speeds (30 to 55 miles per hour), medium to higher capacity
(10,000-50,000 average daily trips) roadway that provides intra- and inter-community travel and
access to the regional highway and freeway system. Access to community arterials should be
provided at collector roads and local streets, discouraging direct access from parcels to existing
arterials.
Assisted Housing: Generally multi-family rental housing, but sometimes single-family ownership
units, whose construction, financing, sales prices, or rents have been subsidized by federal, state, or
local housing programs including, but not limited to Federal §8 (new construction, substantial
rehabilitation, and loan management set-asides), Federal §s 213, 236, and 202, Federal §221(d)(3)
(below-market interest rate program), Federal §101 (rent supplement assistance), CDBG, FmHA
§515, multi-family mortgage revenue bond programs, local redevelopment and in lieu fee programs,
and units developed pursuant to local inclusionary housing and density bonus programs.
Attainment: Compliance with State and federal ambient air quality standards within an air basin.
(See “Non-attainment”)
Base Flood: In any given year, a 100-year flood that has a one percent likelihood of occurring, and
is recognized as a standard for acceptable risk.
Below-market-rate (BMR): (1) Any housing unit specifically priced to be sold or rented to low- or
moderate-income households for an amount less than the fair-market value of the unit. Both the
State of California and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development set standards for
determining which households qualify as “low income” or “moderate income.” (2) The financing of
housing at less than prevailing interest rates.
Bicycle Lane (Class II facility): A corridor expressly reserved for bicycles, existing on a street or
roadway in addition to any lanes for use by motorized vehicles.
Bicycle Path (Class I facility): A paved route not on a street or roadway and expressly reserved for
bicycles traversing an otherwise unpaved area. Bicycle paths may parallel roads but typically are
separated from them by landscaping.
Bicycle Route (Class III facility): A facility shared with motorists and identified only by signs, a
bicycle route has no pavement markings or lane stripes.
Bicylce Street (Class III facility): A facility shared with motorists and identified by both signs and
pavement markings.

Bikeways: A term that encompasses bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, and bicycle routes.
Blight: A condition of a site, structure, or area that may cause nearby buildings and/or areas to
decline in attractiveness and/or utility. The Community Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety
Code, Sections 33031 and 33032) contains a definition of blight used to determine eligibility of
proposed redevelopment project areas.
Bond: An interest-bearing promise to pay a stipulated sum of money, with the principal amount due
on a specific date. Funds raised through the sale of bonds can be used for various public purposes.
Brownfield: An area with abandoned, idle, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where
expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated by real or perceived environmental
contamination. (See also ”Greenfield”)
Buffer Zone: (1) An area of land separating two distinct land uses that acts to soften or mitigate the
effects of one land use on the other. (2) An area of reduced vegetation that creates a barrier

General Plan
Climate Change (see also Global Warming): Climate change refers to any significant change in
measures of climate (such as temperature, precipitation or wind) lasting for an extended period
(decades or longer). Climate change may result from:
            Natural factors, such as changes in the sun's intensity or slow changes in the Earth's orbit
             around the sun
            Natural processes within the climate system (e.g., changes in ocean circulation)
            Human activities that change the atmosphere's composition (e.g., through burning fossil
             fuels) and the land surface (e.g., deforestation, reforestation, urbanization and
             desertification)
Collector: Relatively-low-speed (25 to 30 mph), relatively low volume (5,000 to 20,000 average
daily trips) street that provides circulation within and between neighborhoods. Collectors usually
serve short trips and are intended for collecting trips from local streets and distributing them to the
arterial network.
Community Care Facility: Elderly housing licensed by the State Health and Welfare Agency,
Department of Social Services typically for residents who are frail and need supervision. Services
normally include three meals daily, housekeeping, security and emergency response, a full activities
program, supervision in the dispensing of medicine, personal services such as assistance in
grooming and bathing, but no nursing care. Sometimes referred to as residential care or personal
care. (See “Congregate Care”)
Community Design: The attempt to give form, in terms of both beauty and function, to selected
urban areas or to whole cities. Urban design is concerned with the location, mass, and design of
various urban components and combines elements of urban planning, architecture, and landscape
architecture.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): A grant program administered by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on a formula basis for entitlement
communities, and by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for
non-entitled jurisdictions. This grant allots money to cities and counties for housing rehabilitation
and community development, including public facilities and economic development.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a
variety of single-noise events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7 PM
to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) periods, respectively, to allow for the greater sensitivity
to noise during these hours.
Community Park: Land with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities beyond
those supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood
parks but smaller than regional parks.
Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA): A local agency created under California
Redevelopment Law (Health & Safety Code §33000, et. seq.), or a local legislative body that has
been elected to exercise the powers granted to such an agency, for the purpose of planning,
   Page       Appendix

                                              APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY
developing, re-planning, redesigning, clearing, reconstructing, and/or rehabilitating all or part of a
specified area with residential, commercial, industrial, and/or public (including recreational)
structures and facilities. The Redevelopment Agency’s plans must be compatible with adopted
community general plans.
Complete Streets: Roadways designed and operated to enable safe, attractive, and comfortable
access and travel for all users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and public transport users of all ages
and abilities are able to safely and comfortably move along and across a complete street.
Composting: The controlled microbial decomposition of organic matter (such as food scraps and
yard trimmings) in the presence of oxygen into a humus- or soil-like material.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP): A mechanism employing growth management techniques,
including traffic level of service requirements, standards for public transit, trip reduction programs
involving transportation systems management and jobs/ housing balance strategies, and capital
improvement programming, for the purpose of controlling and/or reducing the cumulative regional
traffic impacts of development.
Consistency, Consistent With: Free from significant variation or contradiction. The various
diagrams, text, goals, policies, and programs in the general plan must be consistent with each other,
not contradictory or preferential. The term “consistent with” is used interchangeably with
“conformity with.” California law also requires that a general plan be internally consistent and also
requires consistency between a general plan and implementation measures such as the zoning
ordinance. As a general rule, an action program or project is consistent with the general plan if,
considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not
obstruct their attainment.
Critical Facility: Facilities housing or serving many people that are necessary in the event of an
earthquake or flood, such as hospitals, fire, police, and emergency service facilities, utility “lifeline“
facilities, such as water, electricity, and gas supply, sewage disposal, and communications and
transportation facilities.
dB (Decibel): A unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human
ear.
dBA: The “A-weighted“ scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or reduces the effects of low
and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the
perceived loudness though the noise is actually 10 times more intense.
Dedication: The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public
function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses
often are incorporated into conditions for approval of a development.
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densities
specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net developable acre.
(See “Acres, Gross,“ and “Developable Acres, Net“)
                                                                                Appendix         Page

CITY OF RIALTO
General Plan
Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel
is zoned. Under Government Code Section 65915, a housing development that provides 20
percent of its units for lower-income households, or 10 percent of its units for very low-income
households, or 50 percent of its units for seniors, is entitled to a density bonus and other
concessions.
Density, Employment: A measure of the number of employed persons per specific area (for
example, employees/acre).
Detention Dam/Basin/Pond: Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve,
such as storage, diversion, or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff and
minimize the effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In one type, the
water is temporarily stored, and released through an outlet structure at a rate that will not exceed
the carrying capacity of the channel downstream. Often, the basins are planted with grass and used
for open-space or recreation in periods of dry weather. The other type, most often called a
Retention Pond, allows for water to be held as long as possible and may or may not allow for the
controlled release of water. In some cases, the water is allowed to seep into the permeable banks or
gravel strata in the foundation. This latter type is sometimes called a Water-Spreading Dam or Dike
because its main purpose is to recharge the underground water supply. Detention dams are also
constructed to trap sediment. These are often called Debris Dams.
Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can be used for density calculations. Public or
private road rights-of way and flood control channels are not included in the net developable
acreage of a site.
Development Agreement: A legislatively-approved contract between a jurisdiction and a person
having legal or equitable interest in real property within the jurisdiction (California Government
Code §65865 et. seq.) that “freezes” certain rules, regulations, and policies applicable to
development of a property for a specified period of time, usually in exchange for certain
concessions by the owner.
Dwelling Unit: A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation
facilities, but not more than one kitchen), that constitutes an independent housekeeping unit,
occupied or intended for occupancy by one household on a long-term basis.
Earthquake Fault Zone: See “Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act.”
Easement: Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes or to gain
access to another property. For example, utility companies often have easements on the private
property of individuals to be able to install and maintain utility facilities.
Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides immediate and short-term housing and supplemental
services for the homeless. Shelters come in many sizes, but an optimum size is considered to be 20
to 40 beds. Supplemental services may include food, counseling, and access to other social
programs. (See “Transitional Housing“)

Eminent Domain: The right of a public entity to acquire private property for public use by
condemnation and the payment of just compensation.
Emission Standard: The maximum amount of pollutant legally permitted to be discharged from a
single source, either mobile or stationary.
Endangered Species: A species of animal or plant is considered to be endangered when its
prospects for survival and reproduction are in immediate jeopardy from one or more causes.
Environment: CEQA defines environment as “the physical conditions which exist within the area
which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, mineral, flora, fauna, noise,
and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.”
Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act which assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area, determines what effects
or impacts will result if the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action, and identifies
alternatives or other measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See “California Environmental
Quality Act”)
Erosion: (1) The loosening and transportation of rock and soil debris by wind, rain, or running water.
(2) The gradual wearing away of the upper layers of earth.
Exaction: A contribution or payment required as an authorized precondition for receiving a
development permit; usually refers to mandatory dedication (or fee in lieu of dedication)
requirements found in many subdivision regulations.
Fair Market Rent: The rent, including utility allowances, determined by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development for purposes of administering the Section 8 Existing Housing
Program.
Family: (1) Two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption (U.S. Bureau of the
Census). (2) An individual or a group of persons living together who constitute a bona fide single-
family housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, not including a fraternity, sorority, club, or other group
of persons occupying a hotel, lodging house or institution of any kind (California).
Fault: A fracture in the Earth’s crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have shifted.
Fiscal Impact Analysis: A projection of the direct public costs and revenues resulting from
population or employment change to the local jurisdiction(s) in which the change is taking place.
Enables local governments to evaluate relative fiscal merits of general plans, specific plans, or
projects.
Flood, 100-Year: The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years,
based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a 1/100, or one percent, chance of occurring in
any given year.
                                                                             Appendix          Page

General Plan
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): For each community, the official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones
applicable to that community.
Floodplain: The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly subject to
flooding. That part of the floodplain subject to a one percent chance of flooding in any given year is
designated as an ”area of special flood hazard” by the Federal Insurance Administration.
Floodplain Fringe: All land between the floodway and the upper elevation of the 100-year flood.
Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the ”base flood” without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot. No development is allowed in floodways.
Floor-Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the
site, expressed in decimals to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net square feet
of land area, an FAR of 1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to be
built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would allow 15,000 square feet of floor area; an FAR of 2.0
would allow 20,000 square feet; and an FAR of 0.5 would allow only 5,000 square feet. FARs
typically are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average FAR for an entire land use
or zoning district.
Freeway: A high-speed, high-capacity, limited-access road serving regional and county-wide travel.
Such roads are free of tolls, as contrasted with ”turnpikes” or other ”toll roads.” Freeways generally
are used for long trips between major land use generators. At Level of Service E they carry
approximately 1,875 vehicles per lane per hour, in both directions. Major streets cross at a different
grade level.
Global Warming (see also Climate Change): An increase in the average temperature of the
atmosphere near the Earth's surface and in the troposphere, which can contribute to changes in
global climate patterns. Global warming can occur from a variety of causes, both natural, and
human-induced. In common usage, "global warming" often refers to the warming that can occur as a
result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. (Source: U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency)
Granny Flat: See “Second Unit.”
Green Building: The practice of increasing the efficiency with which buildings and their sites use
and harvest energy, water, and materials, and reducing building impacts on human health and the
environment through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and removal—the
complete building life cycle.
Greenhouse Gases: Gases in the Earth's atmosphere that produce the greenhouse effect. Changes
in the concentration of certain greenhouse gases, due to human activity such as fossil fuel burning,
increase the risk of global climate change. Greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide,

methane, nitrous oxide, halogenated fluorocarbons, ozone, perfluorinated carbons, and
hydrofluorocarbons.
Ground Failure: Ground movement or rupture caused by strong shaking during an earthquake.
Includes landslide, lateral spreading, liquefaction, and subsidence.
Ground Shaking: Ground movement resulting from the transmission of seismic waves during an
earthquake.
Groundwater: Water under the Earth’s surface, often confined to aquifers capable of supplying
wells and springs.
Groundwater Recharge: The natural process of infiltration and percolation of rainwater from land
areas or streams through permeable soils into water-holding rocks that provide underground storage
(“aquifers”).
Habitat: The physical location or type of environment in which an organism or biological
population lives or occurs.
Hazardous Material: Any substance that, because of its quantity, concentration, or physical or
chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and safety
or to the environment if released into the workplace or the environment. The term includes, but is
not limited to, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.
Historic Preservation: The maintenance of historically significant structures and neighborhoods until
such time as, and in order to facilitate, restoration and rehabilitation of the building(s) to a former
condition.
Household: All those persons (related or unrelated), who occupy a single housing unit.
Households, Number of: The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more
persons. The concept of household is important because the formation of new households
generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need for one additional
housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared by two households. Thus,
household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population, thereby
increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Community Development Department (HCD): The State agency that has principal
responsibility for assessing, planning for, and assisting communities to meet the needs of low- and
moderate-income households.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD): A cabinet-level department of the
federal government that administers housing and community development programs.
Housing Authority, Local (LHA): Local housing agency established in State law, subject to local
activation and operation. Originally intended to manage certain federal subsidies, but vested with
broad powers to develop and manage other forms of affordable housing.

General Plan
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit
may be a single-family dwelling, a multi-family dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile
home, a cooperative, or any other residential unit considered real property under State law. A
housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a dwelling
that cannot be moved without substantial damage or unreasonable cost. (See “Dwelling Unit”
“Family” and “Household”)
Impact Fee: A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city,
county, or other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will
produce. Section 66000, et seq., specifies that development fees shall not exceed the estimated
reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged. To lawfully impose a
development fee, the public agency must verify its method of calculation and document proper
restrictions on use of the fund.
Inclusionary Zoning: Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific percentage
of housing units in a project or development remain affordable to very low- and low- income
households for a specified period.
Industrial: The manufacture, production, and processing of consumer goods. Industrial is often
divided into “heavy industrial” uses, such as construction yards, quarrying, and factories, and “light
industrial” uses, such as research and development and less-intensive warehousing and
manufacturing.
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties)
within areas that are already largely developed.
Infrastructure: Public services and facilities, such as sewage disposal systems, water-supply systems,
other utility systems, and roads.
Institutional Uses: (1) Publicly or privately owned and operated activities such as hospitals,
convalescent hospitals, intermediate care facilities, nursing homes, museums, and schools and
colleges; (2) religious organizations; and (3) other non-profit activities of a welfare, educational, or
philanthropic nature that cannot be considered residential, commercial, or industrial. (See “Public
and Quasipublic Facilities”)
Intensity, Building: For residential uses, the actual number or the allowable range of dwelling units
per net or gross acre. For non-residential uses, the actual or the maximum permitted floor-area
ratios.
Inter-agency: Indicates cooperation between or among two or more agencies in regard to a specific
program.
Issues: Important unsettled community matters or problems that are identified in the General Plan
and dealt with by the Plan’s objectives, policies, plan proposals, and implementation programs.
Landfill: See “Sanitary Landfill.”

Landmark: (1) A building, site, object, structure, or significant tree, having historical, architectural,
social, or cultural significance and marked for preservation by the local, state, or federal
government. (2) A visually prominent or outstanding structure or natural feature that functions as a
point of orientation or identification.
Ldn: Day-Night Average Sound Level. The A-weighted average sound level for a given area
(measured in decibels) during a 24-hour period with a 10 dB weighting applied to night-time sound
levels. The Ldn is approximately numerically equal to the CNEL for most environmental settings.
Leq: The energy equivalent level, defined as the average sound level on the basis of sound energy
(or sound pressure squared). The Leq is a “dosage” type measure and is the basis for the descriptors
used in current standards, such as the 24-hour CNEL used by the State of California.
Level of Service (LOS) Standard: A standard used by government agencies to measure the quality
or effectiveness of a municipal service, such as police, fire, or library, or the performance of a
facility, such as a street or highway.
Level of Service (Traffic): A scale that measures the amount of traffic that a roadway or intersection
can accommodate, based on such factors as maneuverability, driver dissatisfaction, and delay.
             Level of Service A: Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no limitation on
              vehicle movement or speed.
             Level of Service B: Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays in vehicle
              movement and speed. All queues clear in a single signal cycle.
             Level of Service C: Denotes a reasonably steady, highvolume flow of traffic, with some
              limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical approaches.
             Level of Service D: Designates the level where traffic nears an unstable flow.
              Intersections still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait through
              one cycle during short peaks.
             Level of Service E: Represents traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent
              (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe, but is
              not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, longstanding queues, and
              blocked intersections.
             Level of Service F: Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by “traffic
              jams” and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized intersections usually have
              to wait through one or more signal changes, and “upstream” intersections may be
              blocked by the long queues.
Liquefaction: The transformation of loose sediment or soil into a fluid state as a result of increasing
the pressure of the fluid in between the grains due to strong ground shaking. Liquefaction typically
occurs in poorly consolidated, water-saturated sediment. Liquefaction can cause significant
                                                                                   Appendix           Page
