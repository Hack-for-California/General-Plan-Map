1.         INTRODUCTION
The City of El Segundo was incorporated in 1917 and is located in the South Bay Region of Los
Angeles County, approximately 20 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles (see Figure 1-1). The
City occupies an area of approximately 5.46 square miles, and is home to approximately 16,033
residents according to the 2000 Census. The daytime population of the City is approximately 75,000
persons. The City is bordered on the north by the Los Angeles International Airport; on the west
by the Pacific Ocean; to the south by the Chevron Refinery; and to the east by the 405 Freeway.
These barriers isolate El Segundo’s residential and downtown communities from other South Bay
communities. Figure 1 depicts El Segundo's regional location and City boundaries respectively.
There were a total of 7,217 known dwelling units in the City in 2000. All of the residential
population is located west of Sepulveda Boulevard on approximately 532.8 acres of land. The
office/industrial/commercial areas east of Sepulveda Boulevard include a broad range of businesses
including Fortune 500 companies, aerospace, computer related companies, and travel related
companies. Commercial and industrial development east of Sepulveda Boulevard has increased in
the past several years: over one million square feet of office development occurred within the last
year.
The City experienced limited residential growth over the past seven years with an increase of 130
units (1.8 percent) since 2000. However, the City was able to produce a total of 151 housing units
(193%) of its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) over the entire planning period of the
currently adopted Housing Element (2000-2005), which exceeded the City’s RHNA requirements by
21 units.
The City’s stock of 7,347 dwelling units is characterized by a relatively even balance between single
and multi-family residences, although the 2000 census documents a majority of the City’s units (58.1
percent) are renter-occupied. Similar to other communities in the South Bay area, home prices have
increased dramatically since adoption of the current Housing Element making both owner occupied
and rental housing units less affordable. However, compared with adjoining jurisdictions, El
Segundo still provides a range of housing opportunities to the varied income levels of residents in
the community.
This 2006-2014 Housing Element of El Segundo's General Plan sets forth the City's strategy to
preserve and enhance the community's residential character, expand housing opportunities for all
economic segments, and provide guidance and direction for local government decision-making in all
matters relating to housing.

A.         CALIFORNIA STATE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW
California State Housing Element Law (California Government Code Article 10.6) establishes the
requirements for Housing Elements of the General Plan. Specifically, Government Code § 65588
requires that local governments review and revise the Housing Element of their General Plans not
less than once every five years.
                               Table 1-1 summarizes State requirements and identifies the applicable
                               sections in the current El Segundo Housing Element where these
                               requirements are addressed.
                               El Segundo's Housing Element was last updated in 2000 and is
                               currently being updated through the year 2014 as part of an extended
                               update cycle for jurisdictions within the SCAG (Southern California
                               Association of Governments) region. The Element sets forth a
                               strategy to address the City’s identified housing needs, including
                               specific implementing programs and activities. The Housing Element
                               is an 8½ -year plan, extending from January 2006 to June 2014. Other
                               General Plan elements typically address a 10 to 20 year planning
                               horizon.
Various amendments have been made to State law since adoption of the City’s current Housing
Element. These include changes that allow for local jurisdictions to take “credits” for actual
construction activities in the 3-year gap period (2005-2008) that are above the growth forecasted for
the period, and apply those credits to the housing needs forecasted for the period between 2006 and
2014. Additional changes include required preparation of a more detailed inventory of sites to
accommodate projected housing needs (AB 2348); requiring sites to be rezoned within prescribed
timeframes to accommodate sites identified for housing in the prior Element (AB 1233); and
notifying water and sewer purveyors of Housing Element goals and policies and establishing priority
service for units affordable to lower-income households (SB 1087). The contents of this updated
Housing Element comply with these amendments and all other requirements of Housing Element
law including the provision of SB-2.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Government Code § 65583 sets forth the specific components to be contained in the Housing
Element. Included in these requirements is an obligation on the part of local jurisdictions to provide
their “fair share” of regional housing needs. Local governments and Councils of Governments
(COGs) are required to determine existing and future housing needs. Allocation of such needs must
be approved by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). El
Segundo is a member of the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and SCAG is
generally responsible for preparing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment for the six-county
territory that it represents.

                                                                                    1. INTRODUCTION
HCD established the planning period for the current Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2014. The planning period originally ran from July 1, 2005 to June
30, 2014, however, it was reduced by six months (eliminating the last 6 months of 2005) by HCD,
thus shortening the planning period from 9 years to 8½ years.
SCAG’s original draft allocation for El Segundo was a total of 219 units. In response, the City
prepared a letter of protest requesting a reduction in the total number of units allocated to El
Segundo. SCAG granted a reduction in the total number of units of approximately 25% to 168 total
units in the final draft allocation. The 168 housing units for El Segundo are out of the anticipated
total regional construction need of 732,710 units (13,763 of which are in the South Bay Cities in the
SCAG Region). The allocation of 168 units for El Segundo is broken down into the four categories
as follows; 44 very low income households, 27 low income households, 28 moderate income
households, and 69 above moderate income households. The City has 13 units for 2006, and 30
units for 2007 and 2008, totaling 43 units, which can be credited toward the above moderate income
requirements for the 2006-2014 planning period.
B.         ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Housing Element sets forth housing goals and policies for El Segundo to address the City’s
existing and projected needs. Specific housing programs to implement these goals and policies will
be identified in the Housing Program section of the updated document. The updated El Segundo
Housing Element will be comprised of the following major components:
1.         An assessment of past housing achievements.
2.         An analysis of the City's population, household and employment base, and the characteristics
           of the City's housing stock.
3.         An updated evaluation of housing need.
4.         Preparation of an inventory of potential housing sites in the community.
           a.      An examination of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
                   production, maintenance, and affordability of housing.
           b.      Preparation of a Housing Program to address El Segundo's identified housing
                   needs, including housing goals, policies and programs.

D. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Government Code § 65583 (c)(7) states that, "[t]he local government shall make diligent effort to
achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the
housing element, and the program shall describe this effort."
City residents have been given several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment
on the El Segundo Housing Element. The City, for example, conducted public workshops on the
Housing Element update at a regularly-scheduled Planning Commission meeting (October 25, 2007)
and at a City Council meeting (November 20, 2007). Each of these study sessions were advertised in
the local newspaper. Copies of the draft Housing Element were also made available in public
locations, including the public library and City Planning Department public counter, the Joselyn
Community Center, and sent directly to the local Board of Realtors and the Park Vista Senior
Housing Board (represents City’s low-income housing project).
Notification for upcoming hearings on the Draft Housing Element will be published in the local
newspaper in advance of each hearing and hearings. As a means of specifically soliciting input on
the Draft Housing Element from organizations representing lower income and special needs
populations, the City will send copies of the draft Element to the following non-profit housing and
service providers, along with notification of public hearings on the Element: Access Community
Housing (elderly/disabled/homeless), Habitat for Humanity-Los Angeles, Corridor Economic
Development Corporation (families), Los Angeles Community Design Center (families/special
needs), and Southern California Housing Development Corporation. Planning Commission and
City Council will consider all public comments received and will make appropriate revisions to the
Draft Housing Element before adoption.
E. SOURCES OF INFORMATION
The data collected from various sources and utilized in the preparation of this document, may reflect
totals, which are not identical. In general, the totals are not as significant as the trends illustrated in
the data collected. However, where totals of population and housing counts were reported for the
same period, they may have been adjusted to be consistent with the most valid source know.

2.         COMMUNITY PROFILE
Assuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic sectors of the present and
future population is an important goal for El Segundo. To achieve this goal requires an assessment
of the housing needs of the community and region. This section discusses the demographic, socio-
economic, and housing characteristics of the City of El Segundo in an effort to determine the
specific housing needs of the City and its residents.
A.         POPULATION
1.         Population Growth Trends
                                         The 1990 U.S. Census reported that the City of El
                                         Segundo’s population was 15,223 persons, marking a
                                         population increase of nearly 11% percent since the 1980
                                         U.S. Census. This growth rate was noticeably less than the
                                         17% percent for Los Angeles County as a whole. Cities
                                         surrounding El Segundo, such as Manhattan Beach and
                                         Redondo Beach, experienced growth patterns similar to El
                                         Segundo, with decreases in population in the 1970's and
                                         modest increases in the 1980's. The 2000 U.S. Census
                                         reported that the population of El Segundo had increased to
                                         16,033 persons by the 1990 Census. The population
increased by 5% for the ten year period from 1990 to 2000.
As of January 1, 2007, the State Department of Finance estimated that the City's population
numbered approximately 17,076, an increase of about 6% percent in the seven years since the 2000
U.S. Census. This rate of growth is just slightly below that for Los Angeles County and that of most
of El Segundo’s adjacent communities as shown on Table 2-1.

2.         Age Characteristics
Age distribution is an important indicator in determining the future demand of certain types of
housing. Traditional assumptions indicate that the young adult population (20 to 34 years old) has a
trend of choosing apartments, low to moderate cost condominiums, and smaller single-family units.
The adult population (35 to 65 years old) is the primary market for moderate to high-end
apartments, condominiums, and larger single-family homes. This age group traditionally has higher
incomes and larger household sizes. The senior population (65 years and older) generates demand
for low to moderate cost apartments and condominiums, group quarters, and mobile homes. Table
2-2 shows the age distribution of the population of the City of El Segundo in 1990 and 2000, and
the proportionate age distribution of all Los Angeles County residents in 2000.

As shown in Table 2-2, the 2000 U.S. Census indicated median age in El Segundo of 36.4 years is
higher than the County median age of 35.3 years. While the City has seen a drop in the population
of young adults (age 25-34), the City witnessed significant proportional and numeric growth during
the 1990s in its mid-adult populations (age 35-44) and higher-adult populations (age 45-54). This
increase is likely attributed to the previous existing young adult populations continuing to live in the
City. The current young adult population has been attracted to the City based on the growth of the
local employment base, particularly in the aerospace industry, and in the City’s comparatively
affordable housing relative to other coastal communities in the South Bay.
These characteristics an employment center with comparatively modest housing costs have resulted
in stable neighborhoods and a tightening of the housing market in El Segundo. El Segundo is a
predominantly renter-occupied community, with approximately 58% percent of all households
occupied by renters. Associated with growth in the young and mid-adult populations, this may be
an indication of the potential need for increasing first-time homebuyer opportunities in the City.
                                           Growth in younger age groups has seen a small increase in
                                           population. There was 1.8% percent growth in the City’s
                                           early school age population (age 0-9 years), and growth of
                                           1.5% percent increase in population for children ages 10 to

Seniors
El Segundo has a larger proportion of seniors (12.3% percent age 65 and older) than the County
(9.7% percent). Between 1990 and 2000, the City experienced only a small proportional increase in
seniors, who in 1990 represented 9.7% percent of the total population. This increase, although
small, will likely continue to grow, and may indicate a need for expanded housing programs such as
senior shared housing, senior housing repair assistance, and assisted supportive housing.
3.         Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of a community effects housing needs due to the unique
household characteristics of different groups. Table 2-5 shows the changes in the racial/ethnic
composition of El Segundo between 1990 and 2000.

There were several dramatic shifts in the years between 1990 and 2000. The most notable of these
changes were increases in the Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Black populations, although
these ethnic groups still comprise less than 20% percent of the City’s total population. El Segundo’s
ethnic composition continues to be predominately White at 80.0% percent of the population.
However, this represents a decrease from 1990 when the White population comprised 84.8%
percent of the population total.

El Segundo’s ethnic make-up does not reflect the racial diversification that is occurring elsewhere in
Los Angeles County. A greater proportion of the City of El Segundo residents are White compared
to 48.7% percent of the County, while persons from the Hispanic and Black groups comprise a
smaller proportion of the City's population than they do County-wide (44.6% percent Hispanic,
11.9% Asian, and 9.8% Black). The distribution of the American Indian population is smaller than
the County but the Other Races population of 0.6% is significantly smaller than the countywide
population of 23.5% percent.
4.         Employment
 The 2000 U.S. Census reports, as shown in Table 2-6, that there were 9,625 El Segundo residents in
the labor force, representing a labor force participation rate of 75.1 percent of persons between the
ages of 16 and 64. A majority of the City's residents are employed in managerial and professional
specialty occupations (44.5 percent) or in technical, sales, and administrative support capacities (25.6
percent). The unemployment rate reported in the 2000 Census was 3.0% percent, compared to the
countywide unemployment rate of 5.0% percent. The City’s unemployment has continued to be
below the County, with the 2006 annual average documented at 3.0% percent compared to 6.5%
percent in the County.

In 1998, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) prepared growth projections
for each jurisdiction in the region for population, households, and employment through the year
2020. The employment projections for the City of El Segundo were as follows:
     Year                  1994            2000           2010         2015             2020
     #Jobs                55,106          66,490         80,405      87,024            95,256
A general measure of the balance of a community's employment opportunities with the needs of its
residents is through a "jobs-housing balance" test. A balanced community would have a match
between employment and housing opportunities so that most of the residents could also work in the
community. Comparing the number of jobs in El Segundo in 2007 (approximately 75,000 1) to the
current 2007 population estimates (17,076) indicates a high job-population ratio of 1:4.3. This is
reflective of the large employment base in El Segundo. Large employers include the Chevron
Refinery as well as major aerospace corporations such as the Aerospace Corporation, Boeing
Corporation and Raytheon. In addition, El Segundo is a community whose daytime population far
exceeds the nighttime population due to the large employment base in the City. The SCAG
projections indicate that El Segundo will continue to grow, with an estimated increase of almost
29,000 jobs projected from 2000 to 2020. The City’s large employment base relative to the small
number of housing units, and the projected job increases for the City, indicate that there may be a
need to continually seek ways to add housing in the community.

Temporary employment levels in the City will increase as a result of major new expansions to
industrial-type facilities in El Segundo. For instance, Chevron’s planned expansion to its refinery
facility will include up to 3,000 contractors employed at the facility in the 4th quarter of 2007. In
2008, temporary employment levels will average 1,500 contractors in the first 3 quarters and leveling
off to 500 contractors in the 4th quarter. In 2009, temporary contractor workers at the refinery will
average 3,000 persons. In 2010 and beyond, the average number of temporary contractors will
number 500 persons.
B. HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Information on household characteristics is an important indicator of housing needs in a
community. Income and affordability are best measured at the household level, as are the special
needs of certain groups, such as large-family households or female-headed households.
1.         Household Composition and Size
                                          The Bureau of the Census defines a "household" as all
                                          persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include
                                          single persons living alone, families related through
                                          marriage or blood, or unrelated persons sharing living
                                          quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent
                                          homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not
                                          considered households.        The characteristics of the
                                          households in a city are important indicators of the type of
                                          housing needed in that community.
                                          Table 2-7 below describes the household characteristics for
El Segundo. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 7,060 households in the City of El
Segundo, about 55.3% percent of which were family households. This proportion is less than that
of Los Angeles County, where 68.2% percent of all households consisted of families. Single-person
households represent the second largest household group in the City, comprising about 34.2%
percent of all households. The remaining 10.3% percent of households fall into the unrelated non-
family household category, which consist of unrelated persons living together.

Household size is an important indicator of a source of population growth. A city's average
household size can depend on household trends such as a trend towards larger families will increase
the city’s average household size over time while, average household size will often decline in
communities where the population is aging.
Between 1990 and 2000, the average persons per household in El Segundo increased slightly from
2.25 to 2.27 persons per household. The California State Department of Finance estimates the
average household size in El Segundo to be approximately 2.38 persons per household as of January
1, 2007. This figure is significantly less than the estimates for the City and County of Los Angeles
(2.98 persons per household and 3.13 persons per household in 2007 respectively), and is fairly
comparable with the relatively small average household sizes of all of El Segundo’s adjacent
neighbors. Average household size in nearby cities is shown in Table 2-8.

2.         Overcrowding
The federal government defines an overcrowded household as one with more than one occupant
per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Overcrowding in households
results from either a lack of affordable housing (which forces more than one household to live
together) and/or a lack of available housing units of adequate size.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 4.8% percent (333 households) of households in El Segundo
were living in overcrowded conditions, compared to 22.9% percent Countywide. Overcrowding
among renter-households was more prevalent than among owner-households. Of the total 333
overcrowded households, 286 were renter occupied households. In contrast, of the total
overcrowded households, only 47 were owner occupied households. The 2000 U.S. Census
indicates that 76% percent of the households in El Segundo have less than .50 persons per room;
therefore, overcrowding of households does not appear to be a primary issue for the City.
3.         Household Income and Income Distribution
Income is a major factor in evaluating the affordability of housing in a community. According to
the 2000 Census the median household income in El Segundo was $61,131 per year, which is
significantly more than the County median household income of $42,189 per year. In comparison
with its neighbors, the median household income in El Segundo was higher than that of Hawthorne
and Inglewood; somewhat lower than Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach; and significantly lower
than that of Manhattan Beach.
The State Department of Housing and Community Development has developed the following
income categories based on the Median Family Income (MFI) of a Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA) established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development:
•          Very Low Income: 50 percent or less of the area MFI;
•          Low Income: between 51 and 80 percent of the area MFI;
•          Moderate Income: between 81 and 120 percent of the area MFI;
•          Upper Income: greater than 120 percent of the area MFI.
The 2006 MFI for the Los Angeles County MSA ($49,300) was used to interpolate the City's income
distribution from the census according to the above categories.
The income distribution of the City of El Segundo based on 2000 U.S. Census data is presented in
Table 2-9.

4.         Housing Affordability and Overpayment
State and Federal standards specify that a household overpays for its housing costs if it pays 30
percent or more of its gross income on housing. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there were
7,032 occupied housing units in El Segundo. Of these occupied units, 2,945 (41.8% percent) units
were owner-occupied, with 4,087 (58.1% percent) units occupied by renters. Table 2-10 summarizes
housing overpayment statistics by tenure for the City of El Segundo.

                                                                                 2. COMMUNITY PROFILE
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 1,641 of El Segundo households (23.2% percent of the City’s
total households) were spending 30% percent or more of their household income on housing costs.
Of these households, 945 (57.5% percent) were renters, representing 22.3% percent of the total
renter households in the City.
In households with incomes of $50,000 or more, the majority of
households overpaying were owner households. While the
extent of owner households overpaying for housing is not as
great as that for renter households, there still may be a need for
assistance to low and very low-income homeowners. In
particular, seniors tend to have limited and fixed incomes, as well
as physical limitations, which may hinder their abilities to
adequately maintain their properties.
5.         Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have particular difficulties in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. These special needs groups, as defined by State housing element
law, include the elderly, disabled persons, large households, female-headed households, farm
workers, extremely low-income households and the homeless. In addition, military households are a
group with special housing needs in El Segundo. Table 2-11 summarizes the numbers of
households/persons in each of these special needs groups in the City of El Segundo.

                                                                                 2. COMMUNITY PROFILE
The Census shows that roughly 7.5% percent of the City's households were headed by elderly
persons age 65 and above. Of these approximately 532 households, 173 consisted of elderly persons
living alone. Members of this subpopulation of the elderly may have special needs for assistance
with finances, household maintenance, and other routine activities. This is particularly true of
persons aged 75 and older who are more likely to among the "frail elderly."
The 2000 U.S. Census also indicates that there were at least 90 persons age 65 and over living below
the poverty level. This indicates that there may be a need for additional affordable senior housing. In
1984, the City developed Park Vista, a 97-unit senior housing project for seniors capable of
independent living. Rents are restricted to levels of affordable to very low-income households, and
occupancy is limited to El Segundo residents with incomes, which fall below moderate-income
levels. Discussions with management at Park Vista indicate that there is a need for further
affordable senior housing facilities as there are extensive waiting lists for such facilities in the City.
Additionally, management at Park Vista indicated that there is a need for assisted living facilities in
the City.
Disabled Persons
Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally designed housing units as well as
potentially limit the ability to earn adequate income. As shown in Table 2-12, the 2000 U.S. Census
indicates that approximately 7.1% percent of El Segundo's population age 16 years and older, has
some form of work or mobility/self-care disability.
Although no current comparisons of disability with income, household size, or race/ethnicity are
available, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion of disabled persons would be within
federal Section 8 income limits, especially those households not in the labor force. Furthermore,
most lower income disabled persons are likely to require housing assistance. Their housing need is
further compounded by design and location requirements, which can often be costly. For example,
special needs of households with wheelchair-bound or semi-ambulatory individuals may require
ramps, holding bars, special bathroom designs, wider doorways, lower cabinets, elevators, and other
interior and exterior design features.

Large Households
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, only 6.45% percent of all households in the City of El Segundo
consisted of large family households. In contrast to many communities where large households
consist predominately of ethnic minorities and renters, large households in El Segundo are
predominately non-minority homeowners, and therefore do not experience the same household
overcrowding problems as in many communities.
Large Households are defined as those with five or more members. The special needs of this group
are based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Because of
housing stock limitations, and the fact that large families often have lower incomes, they are
frequently subjected to overcrowded living conditions. The increased strain which overcrowding
places on housing units only serves to accelerate the pace of unit deterioration.
With one third of the City’s housing stock comprised of three or more bedroom-units, the City has
more than an adequate supply of housing units to accommodate the needs of its large family
households.
Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance due to their greater need
for affordable and accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services. In particular,
female-headed households with children tend to have lower-incomes than other types of
households, a situation that limits their housing options and access to supportive services.

The 2000 Census indicates that there are 708 female-headed households in the City of El Segundo,
393 of which have children under the age of 18. These numbers account for approximately 10%
and 5.5% respectively of all households in the city.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
seasonal agricultural work. Farmworkers have special housing needs because they earn lower
incomes than many other workers and move throughout the season from one harvest to the next.
The 2000 U.S. Census reported that less than one percent (13 persons) of the City of El Segundo’s
residents were employed in farming, forestry, and fishing occupations. Due to El Segundo’s urban
setting and nominal farmworker population, the special housing needs of this group can generally be
addressed through overall programs for housing affordability.
Military Personnel
According to the 2000 Census, there were 27 persons in the labor force employed in military
occupations. The U.S. Air Force base in El Segundo currently employs approximately 1,500 persons
of whom the majority are military personnel. Housing for base personnel is provided at Fort
MacArthur, Pacific Heights and Pacific Crest in San Pedro for all military ranks and their families.
There are currently 574 units, including two-, three- and four-bedroom units. Another 71 units are
currently under construction at Fort MacArthur. In addition, there are 52 single occupancy units
available in three dormitories.
Extremely Low-Income Households
According to CHAS data generated for the City, there are approximately 557 very low-income
households in the City. Very low-income households are those households that earn 50% or below
of the median family income (MFI) for the statistical region in which they are located. Extremely
low-income households are those households which earn less than 30% of the MFI. There are
approximately 270 such households in El Segundo (renters and owners). Table 2-13, below,
includes data characterizing housing problems in El Segundo including affordability problems for
various income categories.

There are limited opportunities to address the housing needs of extremely low-income households
in El Segundo. However, the needs of this special needs group are taken into consideration and are
generally addressed through the City’s overall programs for housing affordability.
Homeless Persons
According to the 2005 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count (published on January 12, 2006) and
sponsored by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, the overall homeless population of the
Los Angeles Continuum of Care (CoC) Region at a given point in time is estimated to be 82,291
people. Approximately 72,413 are unsheltered, and 9,878 people are living in either emergency
shelters or transitional housing programs at the time of the 2000 Census. A specific “point-in-time”
count of the homeless (2005) indicated that there were 82,291 homeless persons in the greater Los
Angeles region. This same study analyzed homelessness by separate regions in Los Angeles County
and determined that the number of homeless person in the South Bay/Harbor area (which excludes
Long Beach) numbered 7,369 person on any one night (point-in-time) but that the number people
per year that are homeless number 23,654 individuals in this region. According to the survey, most
of these individuals are male, are living outside of shelters, and have substance abuse problems.
Homelessness in El Segundo does not appear to be as critical as statistics indicate for the South
Bay/Harbor region. The El Segundo Police Department was contacted and its representatives
indicated that the City has a small number of homeless relative to its total population, with an
estimated average of seven to ten homeless individuals on any given night. These individuals are
fairly constant, and are characterized as single men with drug or alcohol dependencies, and/or

mental illnesses. The 2000 Census reported that in El Segundo there were no persons visible in
street locations or emergency shelters for the homeless.
There are no emergency shelters or transitional housing facilities in the City of El Segundo. The
closest shelters are located five miles away in Redondo Beach or in nearby Lawndale. However, the
Salvation Army continues to provide the Police Department with nominal funding on an ad hoc
basis to assist homeless persons that come through El Segundo. These funds are used to provide
fast food coupons, and bus fare, which would allow transportation to overnight facilities. Since they
are located outside of El Segundo, any resident homeless population would seek emergency or
transitional shelter in an outside jurisdiction such as Redondo Beach, Lawndale, Long Beach, Carson
or San Pedro. Table 2-14 lists some of the key service providers for homeless persons in the South
Bay region and which are capable of servicing the needs of homeless persons in El Segundo.

3.         HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, or single room, occupied as separate living quarters,
or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in
which the occupants live and eat separately from any other person in the building and which have
direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. A community's housing
stock is the compilation of all its housing units.
A.         HOUSING GROWTH
As of January 2007, the State Department of Finance documents that there are 7,457 dwelling units
in El Segundo, an increase of only 130 units (1.8 percent) since 2000. This growth rate is almost
one-half the housing growth rate for the County of Los Angeles. A comparison of housing growth
trends for El Segundo and neighboring cities is provided in Table 3-1. El Segundo's population is
estimated to have grown by 1,043 persons (6.5 percent) during this same time period. There has
been an increase in the average household size from 2.27 in 2000 and an estimated 2.38 in 2007.

B.         HOUSING TYPE AND TENURE
Table 3-2 provides the breakdown of the City's housing stock in 2000 and 2007 by unit type. As
shown, while single-family detached homes remain the predominant housing type, the majority of
growth occurring in the City has been comprised of condominium and apartment complexes with
five or more units. Due to the scarcity of vacant residential land in the City, most of the housing
unit growth has been accommodated through recycling of existing lower density residential, and
particularly of smaller multi-family projects with 2-4 units. As indicated previously, in 2000, the
proportion of owner-occupied households in El Segundo (41.9 percent) is significantly lower than
that of renter-occupied households (58.1 percent).

C.         AGE AND CONDITION OF HOUSING STOCK
                                Table 3-3 shows the age of the housing stock in El Segundo. In
                                general, housing over 30 years old is usually in need of some major
                                rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work, plumbing, etc. As
                                indicated in Table 3-3, the majority (about 68 percent) of El Segundo's
                                housing units were constructed before 1970. This represents a
                                significant proportion of the City's housing stock, and indicates that
                                preventative maintenance will be essential to ward off widespread
                                housing deterioration. Some households, such as seniors who have
                                owned their homes for many years and have relatively low house
                                payments, may just be able to afford their monthly housing costs. For
                                such households, the cost of major repairs or renovation may be
                                impossible. Assistance however, may be available through the City’s
                                housing rehabilitation assistance programs, including the Minor Home
Repair Program and the Residential Sound Insulation Programs. These existing programs can help
preserve the City's existing affordable housing stock.

                                                                             3. HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
A review of the Daily Breeze, a local community newspaper, Craig’s List Los Angeles, a regional
internet rental classified list, and South Bay Rentals, a rental real estate services; indicates that rental
rates in El Segundo are fairly comparable to those in immediate coastal neighboring cities. A
summary of these rental rate ranges is shown below in Table 3-10, as compiled from a recent review
of the three sources listed above. There are limited apartment and condominium/townhouses
opportunities in El Segundo and they are more plentiful in Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach.
In El Segundo, the available monthly rental rate range was much narrower for apartments ranging
from $1,750 to $2,500 than that for Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, which together ranged from
$1,000 to $4,000.
                                            For condominium and townhouses, El Segundo again had
                                            a much narrower monthly rental rate range from $1,800 to
                                            $3,500 while Hermosa Beach ranged from $1,650 and
                                            $7,900, with Manhattan Beach ranging from $1,990 to
                                            $14,000.
                                            Only one single-family listing was found available for rent
                                            from the entire survey of three listing for El Segundo with
                                            $1,995. However, Hermosa Beach rental rates were from
                                            $2,400 to $20,000 per month and Manhattan Beach rental
                                            rates were from $2,000 to $18,900.
Condominium/townhouses and single-family housing units’ monthly rental rates vary greatly in
Hermosa and Manhattan Beach when compared to El Segundo. This is perhaps due to the variation
in unit size, structure age, yard size, quality of construction and beach/view locations within
Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. These physical attributes vary greatly between properties in
these communities.

 Housing Costs and Affordability
 The costs of home ownership and rent can be compared to a household's ability to pay for housing,
 using the 2006 HUD-established Area Median Family Income (MFI) limits for Los Angeles County
 of $49,300. Table 3-11 illustrates maximum affordable mortgage payments and rents for a four-
 person household in Los Angeles County. Affordable housing cost is based on a maximum of 30
 percent of gross household income going towards mortgage or rental costs. These maximum
 affordable costs would be adjusted downward for smaller households.
 Comparison of these maximum affordable housing costs with the sales price data shown previously,
 indicates that not even moderate income households (81 to 120 percent MFI) would be able to
 afford the lowest priced single-family homes sold in El Segundo. It should be noted however that
 asking prices can often be higher than actual sales prices. With earning power to purchase a home
 valued up to $294,000, not even 1 and 2 bedroom condominiums and townhouses are within the
 range of affordability of moderate income households. At a maximum affordable purchase price of
 about $122,000, it is not likely that very-low income households (51% to 80% MFI) could afford
 even a small condominium unit. The high price of single-family housing, along with the shortage of
 1-bedroom condominiums, indicate that the opportunities for home ownership in the City are

                                 limited for lower and moderate income groups. In addition, the down
                                 payment and closing costs may still represent a significant obstacle to
                                 home purchase.
                                 In terms of rental housing costs (Table 3-10), low-income households
                                 can afford some 1-2 bedroom apartments in El Segundo. Very low-
                                 income households (0-50% MFI) cannot even afford a one-bedroom
                                 apartment in El Segundo. Moderate-income households (81%-120%
                                 MFI) can afford some rental options advertised in El Segundo, with the
                                 exception of three-bedroom condominiums or single-family homes.

E.         ASSISTED HOUSING AT-RISK OF CONVERSION
State law requires the Housing Element to identify, analyze and propose programs to preserve
housing units that are currently restricted to low-income housing use and will become unrestricted
and possibly lost as low income housing. Based on review of Federal and State subsidized housing
inventories, and confirmed by interviews with City staff, there are no “Assisted Housing Projects” in
El Segundo as defined by Government Code § 65583 (A) (8).

                                   The City does own Park Vista, a 97-unit senior housing project
                                   developed in 1984 using City funds which is operated and
                                   regulated by the non-profit El Segundo Senior Citizens Housing
                                   Corporation. The Articles of Incorporation for the corporation
                                   require rentals in Park Visa to be rentals only to low-income
                                   seniors. Current (2007) rents are $459 for the 414 square foot

                                   rent for $544. There are also 6 handicap accessible, 537 square
foot one-bedroom units also renting for $544. Applications for occupancy is limited to persons who
are 62 years of age and older, have lived in the City for at least one year and are capable of
independent living. Five percent of the applicants annual incomes and net worth combined, must
not exceed $30,000 for single-person households and $35,000 for two person households.
According to Park Vista managers, units in the project are in great demand. There is a three-year
waiting list for occupancy. There are no other senior or senior assisted living facilities in El
Segundo.

                                                                            4. SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
4.         SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
This section of the Housing Element summarizes the major housing need categories in the City in
terms of income groups as defined by Federal and State law. These major housing needs includes
the City's share the of regional housing need as defined by the Southern California Association of
Governments' (SCAG) Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The City recognizes the
special status of lower income households, which in many cases are comprised of elderly or disabled
persons, single-parent households, or military households. As summarized in Table 4-1, the areas of
greatest housing assistance need include the following:
1.         Households Overpaying for Housing – Twenty-three percent of all households in El
           Segundo are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Households
           paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing are classified as overpaying by the
           Federal Government. Among the overpaying households in El Segundo, 57 percent were
           renters. Among renter households, 23.1 percent were overpaying.
2.         Special Needs Households – Certain segments of the population may have a more
           difficult time finding decent, affordable housing due to their special circumstances or needs.
           The Community Profile documents the following groups with special housing needs:
                ¾    There are 532 households headed by elderly persons. Of these, 173 consist of
                     elderly persons living alone;
                ¾    1,876 Persons age 16 and over with physical disabilities;
                ¾    456 Large households (households with 5 or more members);
                ¾    708 Female-headed households, over half of which (393 households) included
                     children less than 18 years of age;
                ¾    13 Farm workers;
                ¾    270 Extremely low-income households; and
                ¾    27 U.S. military personnel
3.         Age and Condition of Housing Stock – According to the 2000 Census, 68 percent of the
           City’s housing units are greater than 30 years of age; the age at which housing typically
           begins to require major repairs. This represents a significant proportion of the City's
           housing stock, and indicates that preventive maintenance will be essential to ward off
           widespread housing deterioration.
           The City’s Planning and Building Safety Department maintains statistics that identifies
           housing units that are in need of property maintenance or substandard. For all of 2007, 44
           residential structures were identified with maintenance and structural code violations. These
           include properties determined to be out of compliance with the local building and municipal
           code, with some requiring substantial repair as well as rehabilitation.

                                                                                4. SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
4.         Housing Costs and Affordability – The 2000 census reports that the median home value
           in the City of El Segundo was $371,900. This amount is 78 percent greater than the County-
           wide median of $209,300. More recent figures from Data Quick Inc., indicate that the sales
           price of single family homes in El Segundo has increased dramatically since the 2000 Census.
           The median home value in El Segundo as of Summer 2007 was $997,000 for single-family
           homes and $558,000 for condominiums.
           The summer of 2007 saw the peak of the rise in housing market prices for southern
           California. Recent reports reveal increasing levels of loan defaults and foreclosures which
           has slowed the housing sales market substantially. This condition has been exacerbated by
           defaults in sub-prime loans. In some neighborhoods, the values of the homes have begun to
           depreciate. Still, in El Segundo, single-family housing prices in the City are well above levels
           affordable even to moderate income households, with only 1-2 bedroom condominiums
           generally priced at levels affordable to moderate income households.
           Apartments and condominiums provide the primary form of rental housing in El Segundo
           and rent for a median of $882 per month according to the 2000 Census. A recent review of
           local rental publications reveals that one-bedroom apartments rent around $1,700 per month
           and two-bedrooms rent between $1,500 and $2,500 per month. These rental rates are barely
           affordable to moderate income households. Very low and low-income households are
           priced out of the El Segundo rental market even for one-bedroom units.
5.         Overcrowded Households – Household overcrowding in El Segundo is relatively nominal,
           with only 4.8 percent of the City’s households documented as having greater than 1.01
           persons per room, compared to an overcrowding rate of 19 percent in Los Angeles County.
           Overcrowding among renter-households was more prevalent than among owner-
           households, with renters comprising 85.6 percent of the City’s overcrowded households.
6.         Regional Housing Needs – The City is required to demonstrate in its Housing Element
           the availability of adequate sites to fulfill the City’s identified share of regional housing needs
           by income category.
           SCAG completed the process of developing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
           (RHNA) model for the 2006-2014 period. RHNA figures published by SCAG identify an
           overall construction need for 168 new units in El Segundo. This construction need is further
           categorized by income level as follows: 22 extremely low income; 22 very-low income, 27
           low income, 28 moderate income and 69 upper income. The City has zoning in place to
           accommodate up to 997 additional residential units. Over 420 potential units would be
           multi-family units at densities of 18-27 units per acre. However, it was determined, using
           historical residential development records between 2000 and 2006 that the actual total
           construction expected would be no greater than 401 total units and 246 multiple family units.

5.         HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Market conditions, environmental conditions, and governmental programs and regulations affect the
provision of adequate and affordable housing. Housing Element law requires a city to examine
potential and actual governmental and non-governmental constraints to the development of new
housing and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Market, governmental, and
environmental constraints to housing development in El Segundo are discussed below.
 A. MARKET CONSTRAINTS
 1.    Construction Costs
Together, the cost of building material and construction labor are the most significant cost
components of developing residential units and act as a constraint on the construction of affordable
housing. In the current southern California market, for example, construction costs are estimated to
account for upwards of 50 percent of the sales price of a new home. Typical construction costs for
a standard quality single-family home built in the Los Angeles area is estimated to be $114 dollars
per square foot. Typical construction costs for standard quality apartment/condominiums are
estimated to be $129 dollars per square foot.
Variations in the quality of materials, type of amenities, labor costs and the quality of building
materials could result in higher or lower construction costs for a new home. Pre-fabricated factory
built housing, with variation on the quality of materials and amenities may also affect the final
construction cost per square foot of a housing project. Furthermore, the unit volume - that is the
number of units being built at one time - can change the cost of a housing project by varying the
economies of scale. Generally, as the number of units under construction at one time increases, the
overall costs decrease. With a greater number of units under construction, the builder is often able
to benefit by making larger orders of construction materials and pay lower costs per material unit.
Density bonuses granted to a project can serve to reduce per unit building costs and thus help
mitigate this constraint. The granting of a density bonus provides the builder with the opportunity
to create more housing units and therefore more units for sale or lease than would otherwise be
allowed without the bonus. Since greater units can potentially increase the economy of scale, the
bonus units could potentially reduce the construction costs per unit. This type of cost reduction is
of particular benefit when density bonuses are used to provide affordable housing. Allowances for
manufactured housing in residential zones also addresses housing cost constraints by avoiding the
use of costly building materials and construction techniques that can drive up the costs of housing.
2.    Land Costs
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total cost of
housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined with a
fairly steady demand for such development has served to keep the cost of land high and rising in
southern California. In addition, the two factors which most influence land holding costs are the
interest rate on acquisition and development loans, and government processing times for plans and
permits. The time it takes to hold land for development increase the overall cost of the project.

This cost increase is primarily due to the accruement of interest on the loan, the preparation of the
site for construction and processing applications for entitlements and permits.
Due to its desirable location, land costs in El Segundo are high, but not as high as land costs in
neighboring cities such as Manhattan Beach. Nevertheless, high land costs in this area of the South
Bay are a constraint to the construction of affordable housing. Options available to address this
constraint include, without limitation, the application of density bonuses, assistance in the write
down of land costs, and the timely processing of permits for new residential construction.
3.     Availability of Financing
Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is little that
local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-
downs to extend home purchasing opportunities to a broader economic segment of the population.
In addition, government insured loan programs may be available to reduce mortgage down payment
requirements.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan
applicants. As shown in Table 5-1, “Disposition of Conventional Loans- Los Angeles-Long
Beach—Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area” in 2006, there were 273,767 households applied for
conventional mortgage loans to purchase homes in the region. Fifty-one (51) percent of the
applications were originated (approved by lenders and accepted by applicants) and 23 percent were
denied. The remaining 25 percent were withdrawn, closed for incompleteness, or not accepted by
the applicants.

Overall, home improvement loans had lower approval rates. In 2006, 67,990 households in the
region applied for home improvement loans. Just under half (48.5 percent) were approved,
indicating the continued need for City assistance in providing rehabilitation loans.
B. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
As a City with a large industrial base, numerous environmental related factors are present which
pose constraints to residential development within El Segundo. Historically, less than 25 percent of
the land within the City has been used for residential development. The remaining land has been
used primarily for a mixture of light and heavy industrial purposes, including oil refineries, aircraft
and space vehicle manufacturing, a United States Air Force Base, chemical production and corporate
research and supporting office, as well as retail commercial, restaurants, and hotels. The
development invested in these properties is substantial, making conversion to residential uses
economically infeasible. When sufficient amounts of these properties have become available for
recycling, the City has permitted residential uses in a mixed-use environment west of Sepulveda
Boulevard, provided that infrastructure issues could be successfully addressed, and residential uses
could be buffered from non-residential uses.
In comparison to other areas in Los Angeles County, the City of El Segundo is heavily affected by
traffic, air quality, odor and safety issues related to flight operations at Los Angeles International
Airport. Those residential areas located near the northern boundaries of the City are particularly
subject to these impacts. The Circulation, Air Quality, and Noise Elements of the City’s General
Plan all contain policies that seek to minimize the negative effects upon these residential areas, and
help ensure the protection of area residents.
Many of the industries operating in El Segundo use hazardous materials in their operations and have
sites that are contaminated by toxins. Since heavy industry is the largest single land use in the City,
hazardous materials use and management is a serious consideration. Heavy manufacturing comprises
about 30 percent of the City’s area, which is made up almost entirely of the Chevron Refinery. The
uses associated with the Refinery, Hyperion Treatment Plant, and two power plants preclude the
development of additional housing in close proximity to these facilities. Although industries in El
Segundo generate a diverse mix of hazardous waste, all heavy industrial uses must conform to the
policies of the City’s Hazardous Materials Element.
C.      GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Housing affordability is affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. In the public
sector, additional city government requirements can contribute to the reduction of the affordability
and availability of new housing although the intent of local legislative action is to maintain or
improve the quality of life within a community. Necessary land use controls, site improvement
requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs intended to improve the urban
environment can add cost and perhaps time delays to the construction of new housing projects.
However, this only becomes a constraint when the goal of the developer is to build truly affordable
housing. In recent years, under pressure from the building industries, local municipalities have

made attempts at streamlining the permitting process without gutting the effectiveness of the
development requirements that protect the public interest.
Even if their projects come in under budget, most builders set sales prices or rental rates to the
highest level that the market will bear; a private sector market constraint. For market rate housing,
any private or public sector constraints come out of builder’s development budgets and profits.
1.     Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element of the City of El Segundo's General Plan sets forth the City's policies for
guiding local development. These policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the
location, amount and distribution of land to be allocated for various land uses within the City. The
City of El Segundo General Plan and ESMC provide for a range of residential land use development
densities as follows:
     a)     Single-Family Residential (R-1) (8 du/ac) – a maximum of one dwelling unit per parcel
            with a minimum parcel size of 5,000 square feet.
            A second dwelling unit is permitted when the side lot line forms a common boundary with
            the side yard abutting lots zoned for R-3, P, C-RS, C-2, C-3, CO, or MU. In no case shall
            an R-1 property proposed to be used for a second dwelling unit consist of more than one
            lot nor be more than fifty feet (50') wide.
     b)     Two-Family Residential (R-2) (12 du/acre) – up to 2 units per lot with a minimum of 7,000
            square feet required per lot. Lots less than 4,000 square feet may have only one dwelling
            unit.
            Third and/or fourth units are permitted where the side yard of an R-2 property is adjacent
            property in the C-RS, C-2, C-3, CO, MU-N, MU-S, M-1, and M-2 zones, but in no case
            shall consist of more than one lot, exceed a density of 12 units per acre, or have less than
            3,500 square feet of lot area per unit.
     c)     Multi-Family Residential (R-3) (18 du/acre, 27 du/acre) – multifamily residential with up to
            27 dwelling units per acre. On property of 15,000 square feet or less, one unit for every
            1,613 square feet is allowed. A fraction of a lot greater than 1,075 square feet will allow an
            additional unit.
            On property greater than 15,000 square feet in size, one unit for every 2,400 square feet of
            lot area is allowed. A fraction of a lot greater than 1,603 square feet will allow an additional
            unit.
     d)     Neighborhood Commercial (C-2) - residential uses as an accessory use on the floor above
            street level only, above a ground floor use, with a maximum density of 10 units per acre.
     e)     Downtown Commercial (C-RS) – residential uses as an accessory use on the floor above
            street level only, above a ground floor use, with a maximum density of 10 dwelling units
            per acre.

     f)     Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) – The DSP consists of 25.8 acres. The majority of the lots
            within the DSP are 25-feet wide by 140-feet deep and 3,500 square feet in area. As of Year
            2000, there were approximately 82 residential units in the DSP area. The DSP does not
            permit the development of any new residential units except owner and/or tenant occupied
            units at the ratio of one per legal building site or business establishment (whichever is
            greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre (above ground floor commercial use).
     g)     Medium Manufacturing (MM) - caretaker units at the ratio of one per legal building site or
            business establishment (whichever is greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre
            (above ground floor manufacturing use).
     h)     Small Business (SB) – caretaker units at the ratio of one per legal building site or business
            establishment (whichever is greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre (above
            ground floor business use).
     i)     Medium Density Residential (MDR) In addition to the residential categories described
            above, the MDR zone is used as a type of “floating zone” which can be activated within
            certain areas of the Smoky Hollow Specific Plan and used in place of the base zone
            regulations. This zone allows densities ranging from 18 to 27 units per acre with common
            open space areas while sustaining residential and supporting commercial uses in the
            Specific Plan area. Additionally, this zone allows live/work dwelling units for artists,
            artisans, and industrial design professionals with densities ranging from 18 to 27 units.
     j)     Planned Residential Zone (PRD) - An additional residential designation, the PRD zone, is
            to be used specifically for the former Imperial Elementary School Site. This zone permits
            up to 29 single-family detached units and 36 multi-family units. The purpose of this zone is
            to encourage the long-range development of residential property under an overall
            development plan for the site.
Housing supply and cost are greatly affected by the amount of land designated for residential use
and the density at which development is permitted. In El Segundo, 15 percent of the City's land
area (533 acres) is designated for residential use. Multifamily units are by far the most common
residential uses in El Segundo, accounting for over one-half of the residential units in the City. This
designation includes apartment complexes, “stacked flat” -style condominiums, and “townhome” -
style condominiums.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan, amended in 1992, documents the residential build out
in the City at 7,674 residential units. By 1998, it was estimated that there were 7,340 residential
units, 334 units less than the projected build-out. These figures include vacant residential land and
underdeveloped land. By 2007, the California Department of Finance estimated that a total of 7,357
residential units existed in the City which is 317 units less than the 1992 General Plan build-out
projection and 17 units above the 7,340 residential units existing in 1998.

2.     Vacant and Underutilized Land
There is very little vacant residential land available in the City. This is a significant constraint to the
development of new housing within the City. Another constraint to the development of additional
residential units can occur on underdeveloped properties, and particularly on R-3 and other
multiple-family zoned properties. The economy of land value and the cost of new construction can
limit what a property owner can do on an underdeveloped property. Even with the 27 units per acre
permitted by the El Segundo Municipal Code, recycling and redevelopment can be difficult.
For the Housing Element Update, vacant single-family zoned parcels were identified and
inventoried to determine the number of single-family dwellings that could be built. If a parcel was
more than twice the minimum lot size required for a single-family dwelling (5,000 square feet),
additional unit capacity was counted. Furthermore, where a single-family residential property
qualified for a “second unit,” that unit was added to the total unit capacity count. Only 31 vacant
residential parcels were found in the City. Although this is a major constraint to the development of
housing, the ESMC provides additional capacity within the R3 zone, and in other selected non-
residential zones.
The El Segundo Municipal Code allows residential uses in five non-residential zones: the
Neighborhood Commercial (C-2) Zone, the Downtown Commercial (C-RS) Zone, the Downtown
Specific Plan (DSP) Zone, the Small Business (SB) Zone, and the Medium Manufacturing (MM)
Zone. The C-2, C-RS and DSP zones allow residential units only above ground floor commercial
uses. Residential units in the SB and MM zones are permitted only as caretaker units. These
provisions of the ESMC adds significantly to the overall residential capacity of the City.
Finally, there is the Imperial School Site, an excess school district property, that is zoned Planned
Residential Development (PRD) Zone. Under the PRD zoning this property can accommodate up
to 65 new residential units.
All of the units from each parcel were totaled by category to determine the overall residential unit
capacity in the City.
The method used to determine the 1992 General Plan build-out estimate was based upon the gross
acreage for each residential land use category and calculated as a whole to determine the residential
development capacity for the City. This method, although simpler, uses a broad instrument that is
not capable of measuring the nuances of constraint and opportunities that occur at the parcel level.
The results of the current parcel inventory (See Appendix A), found a residential unit capacity quite
different from the 1992 amended Land Use Element of the General Plan. From this survey it was
determined that, under the current zoning regulations, there would be a net new residential capacity
of 523 units. This includes potential new residential units on residential and non-residential zoned
parcels. Furthermore, it was projected that 401 residential units could be built by 2014 leaving a 596
unit residential capacity and a total City-wide housing unit capacity of 8,354 units.

 3.    Residential Development Standards
The City's residential development standards are within and typical of the range of standards of
other nearby cities. The density, setback, and other standards regulating residential development
within the City are in concert with those being used by other surrounding municipalities. The
ESMC limits all residential building heights to 26 feet and two stories. Residential development
standards for the City of El Segundo are as summarized below in Table 5-2.

4.     Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law requires jurisdictions to identify available sites in appropriate zoning districts
with development standards that encourage the development of a variety of housing types for all
income levels, including multi-family rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes,
emergency shelters, and transitional housing. The following paragraphs describe how the City
provides for these types of housing:
        Multi-Family Rental Housing: Multiple-family housing is the predominant dwelling type in
        the City, comprising close to 53 percent of the total housing units. The total number of multi-
        family housing units has increased over the last seven years as single and two family homes in
        the Multiple Family Residential (R-3) Zone, are raised to make way for the development of
        new multiple-family units in two-story apartment buildings. There are still single-family
        homes located on land that is designated for multi-family use. The City’s zoning ordinance
        provides for multiple-family units in the following three zones: Planned Residential
        Development (PRD); Multi-Family Residential (R-3); Medium Density Residential (MDR),
        and in the Smoky Hollow Specific Plan (SHSP) area.
        Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing: The City provides for mobile or manufactured
        homes within its residential zoning districts if they meet specific standards. Both mobile
        homes and manufactured housing units must be certified according to the National
        Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, and cannot have been
        altered in violation of applicable Codes. The units must also be installed on a permanent
        foundation in compliance with all applicable building regulations and Title 25 of the California
        Health and Safety Code.
        Second, Third and Fourth Units: The City’s zoning regulations provide for second
        dwelling units on single-family residential zoned lots when the side lot line forms a common
        boundary line with lots zoned for higher intensity uses. The ESMC also allows a 3-family or
        4-family dwelling on two-family residential zoned lots, which meet the same criteria. The side
        lot line must be adjacent to one of the following higher intensity zones:
                a) R-3, Multi-Family Residential;
                b) C-RS, Downtown Commercial;
                c) C-2, Neighborhood Commercial;
                d) C-3 General Commercial;
                e) CO, Corporate Office;
                f) MU-N, Urban Mixed-Use North;
                g) MU-S, Urban Mixed-Use South;
                h) P, Automobile Parking;
                i) M-1, Light Industrial (Two-family residential only); and
                j) M-2, Heavy Industrial (Two-family residential only)

                                                                                  5. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
        Second units are also allowed on the front of any single-family lot that does not meet the
        above zoning conditions, if the existing unit does not exceed 700 square feet and was built on
        the rear portion of the lot before December 26, 1947.
        Transitional Housing and Emergency Shelters: There are currently no transitional
        housing facilities or emergency shelters within the City of El Segundo, and the ESMC does
        not define or specifically allow for, or prohibit these types of facilities. Programs have been
        included in this Housing Element in which the City will modify its zoning regulations to
        principally permit transitional and supportive housing in a multifamily residential zone, and
        emergency shelters as a permitted use in two industrial zones in the City.
        Housing for the Disabled: The City of El Segundo seeks to provide housing for special
        needs groups, including housing for the disabled. The Building Safety Department implements
        the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in their routine application and
        enforcement of building code requirements. Additionally, a program has been included in this
        Housing Element that requires the City to adopt a “reasonable accommodation” ordinance
        addressing the housing needs of the disabled.
5.     Development Entitlement Fees
The City collects various fees from developers to cover the costs of processing permits and
providing necessary services and infrastructure. Fees are typically collected upon filing of an
application for development projects that require discretionary approval.
Development in Single Family Residential (R-1), Two Family Residential (R-2) and Multi-Family
Residential (R-3) Zones does not require entitlements except for subdivisions of land and for
residential condominiums. Table 5-3 provides a listing of development entitlement fees the City of
El Segundo charges for residential development. Entitlements and fees for those entitlements, other
than for subdivisions of land and condominiums, are limited primarily to the Planned Residential
Development (PRD), Small Business (SB), Medium Manufacturing (MM) and Medium Density
Residential (MDR) Zones. In addition, there may be other fees assessed depending upon the
circumstances of the development. For example, the builder may need to pay an inspection fee for
sidewalks, curbs, and gutters if their installation is needed. The fees listed in Table 5-3 are those
entitlement fees which are typically charged for residential development.

6.     Development Impact Fees
Development impact fees are also collected for development projects. Most are collected at the
time the City issues certificates of occupancy. For example, for any new construction greater than
500 square feet there is a school fee collected. However, there are no “Quimby” (parkland
dedication), art or childcare fees required for any new development projects. Impact fees charged by
the City (fire, police, library and traffic) are required for new and expanded development and the
fees must be paid before the City issues a certificate of occupancy. These fees are shown in Table 5-
4. Refuse collection is free for single-family residences; however there is a fee for all other uses.
Residents are charged a utility users tax (electric, gas, phone and water).

7.     Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to land use controls, local building codes affect the cost and quality of construction of
new housing units. El Segundo has adopted the California Building Standards of the International
Code Conference (ICC) which establish minimum construction standards. These minimum
standards cannot be revised to be less stringent without sacrificing basic safety considerations and
amenities. No major reductions in construction costs are anticipated through revisions to local
building codes. Working within the framework of the existing codes, however, the City will
continue to implement planning and development techniques that lower costs and facilitate new
construction where possible. Enforcement of all City codes is handled by the appropriate
departments and is typically coordinated by the Planning and Building Safety Department. The
Planning Division enforces zoning regulations.
 8.    Local Processing and Permit Procedures
Generally, local processing times are quite comparable to those experienced in neighboring
communities. Currently it takes approximately 2 to 8 weeks to review and process non-discretionary
plans. Minor permits are issued in a much shorter time frame including “over-the-counter”
approval and permit issuance for small interior and exterior alterations and the installation of
household utilities such as water heaters. Additionally, the City allows the issuance of separate
grading and foundation permits before it issues building permits. Plans can be submitted to plan
check before the Planning Commission and City Council approval of the project with an “at risk”
letter. Planned Residential Developments (PRD) are processed within 4 to 8 months. Appeals of
Planning Commission decisions require City Council approval. City Council approval is required for
zone changes, general plan amendments, specific plan amendments, zone text amendments and
development agreements.

6.         HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the Housing Element evaluates the potential for additional residential development
that could occur in El Segundo, and discusses opportunities for energy conservation in residential
development.
A. AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
An important component of the El Segundo Housing Element is the identification of sites for
future housing development, and an evaluation of the adequacy of those sites in fulfilling the City’s
share of regional housing needs. To accomplish this, all city parcels were surveyed to determine
their development capacity. Each was analyzed in light of the development standards for its
respective zoning designation. The survey resulted in the identification of the number of residential
units permitted on each site as established by the maximum allowable densities in the Land Use
Element of the General Plan. The sites with the potential for additional residential units were
highlighted, and identified as vacant or underdeveloped.
There are ten zoning districts that correspond to land use designations in the General Plan. The
zones in which housing is permitted are: the Single-Family Residential Zone (R-1), including the
second unit provision for the Single Family (R-1) Zone; the Two-Family Residential (R-2) Zone,
including the additional unit provision of the Two-Family Residential (R-2) Zone; the Multi Family
Residential (R-3) Zone; the Planned Residential Development (PRD) Zone; the Medium Density
Residential (MDR) Zone; the Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) Zone; the Small Business (SB) Zone;
Neighborhood Commercial (C-2) Zone, Downtown Commercial (CR-S) Zone, and the Medium
Manufacturing (MM) Zone.
Residential Densities
Each zoning district that permits residential development has development standards that dictate the
maximum residential density permitted. These standards, together with existing General Plan
policies, establish the location, amount and distribution of land to be allocated for various land uses
within the City. The City of El Segundo General Plan and ESMC provide for a range of
development densities as follows:
     1. Single-Family Residential (R-1) (8 du/ac) – a maximum of one dwelling unit per parcel with
           a minimum parcel size of 5,000 square feet.
            A second dwelling unit is permitted when the side lot line forms a common boundary with
            the side yard abutting lots zoned for R-3, P, C-RS, C-2, C-3, CO, or MU. In no case shall an
            R-1 property proposed to be used for a second dwelling unit consist of more than one lot
            nor be more than fifty feet (50') wide.
     2. Two-Family Residential (R-2) (12 du/acre) – up to 2 units per lot with a minimum of 7,000
           square feet required per lot. Lots less than 4,000 square feet may have only one dwelling
           unit.

          Third and/or fourth units are permitted where the side yard of an R-2 property is adjacent
          property in the C-RS, C-2, C-3, CO, MU-N, MU-S, M-1, and M-2 zones, but in no case shall
          consist of more than one lot, exceed a density of 12 units per acre, or have less than 3,500
          square feet of lot area per unit.
     3. Multi-Family Residential (R-3) (18 du/acre, 27 du/acre) – multifamily residential with up to
           27 dwelling units per acre. On property of 15,000 square feet or less, one unit for every
           1,613 square feet is allowed. A fraction of a lot greater than 1,075 square feet will allow an
           additional unit.
            On property greater than 15,000 square feet in size, one unit for every 2,400 square feet of
            lot area is allowed. A fraction of a lot greater than 1,603 square feet will allow an additional
            unit.
     4. Neighborhood Commercial (C-2) - residential uses as an accessory use on the floor above
           street level only, above a ground floor commercial use, with a maximum density of 10
           dwelling units per acre.
     5. Downtown Commercial (C-RS) – residential uses as an accessory use on the floor above
           street level only, above a ground floor commercial use, with a maximum density of 10
           dwelling units per acre.
     6. Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) – The DSP consists of 25.8 acres. The majority of the lots
           within the DSP are 25-feet wide by 140-feet deep and 3,500 square feet in area. As of Year
           2000, there were approximately 82 residential units in the DSP area. The DSP does not
           permit the development of any new residential units except owner and/or tenant occupied
           units at the ratio of one per legal building site or business establishment (whichever is
           greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre (above ground floor commercial use).
     7. Medium Manufacturing (MM) - caretaker units at the ratio of one per legal building site or
           business establishment (whichever is greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre
           (above ground floor manufacturing use).
     8. Small Business (SB) – caretaker units at the ratio of one per legal building site or business
           establishment (whichever is greater) up to a density of 10 dwelling units per acre (above
           ground floor business use).
     9. Medium Density Residential (MDR) In addition to the residential categories described
           above, the MDR zone is used as a type of “floating zone” which can be activated within
           certain areas of the Smoky Hollow Specific Plan and used in place of the base zone
           regulations. This zone allows densities ranging from 18 to 27 units per acre with common
           open space areas while sustaining residential and supporting commercial uses in the Specific
           Plan area. Additionally, this zone allows live/work dwelling units for artists, artisans, and
           industrial design professionals with densities ranging from 18 to 27 units per acre.

     10. Planned Residential Zone (PRD) - An additional residential designation, the PRD zone, is to
           be used specifically for the former Imperial Elementary School Site. This zone permits up to
           29 single-family detached units and 36 multi-family units. The purpose of this zone is to
           encourage the long-range development of residential property under an overall development
           plan for the site.
Vacant and Underutilized Land Inventory Methodology
Housing Element law requires that local jurisdictions revising their housing elements conduct a
comprehensive inventory of sites to determine the maximum housing capacity of the city and to
assess the number of additional units that could be built within the current planning period. To
complete this analysis, the zoning districts where housing units are permitted were identified (See
Figure 6-1). The property within each zone was then examined to determine whether it was vacant,
underdeveloped, or built out. Finally, the permitted densities were applied to the vacant and under-
developed sites to calculate their residential development potential.

An inventory of parcels in the City was conducted using the following methodologies and resources:
1.         A windshield field survey was conducted to physically identify the development status of
           each parcel;
2.         The City’s GIS mapping system was used to confirm the development potential on each site
           that could not easily be determined by the windshield field survey;
3.         Building Safety Division property data files were reviewed to verify the number of legal units
           on parcels;
4.         The El Segundo Municipal Code and General Plan were reviewed to determine the
           maximum unit potential with the application of typical site development standards.
Survey information was collected for each zoning district in which residential units are permitted
and recorded on spreadsheets. City staff determined that two major categories of residential
properties had to be evaluated, which included vacant parcels and under developed parcels.
Vacant Parcels
In order to evaluate the potential for additional dwellings within the City, staff located and recorded
all of the vacant residentially-zoned properties known to exist in the City. It was determined that all
of the vacant parcels are located in the Single-Family Residential (R1) Zone. The vacant single-family
residential parcels were identified and measured for total square footage for each property. Where
the square footage of a particular parcel exceeded 5,000 square feet (the minimum lot size in the R-1
Zone district is 5,000 square-feet) the survey team calculated the number of 5,000 square-foot
parcels that could be created. Each additional 5,000 square feet of lot area was counted as one
additional single-family unit, so long as the additional area met the parcel configuration standards
prescribed by the El Segundo Municipal Code.
Underutilized Properties
Most of the potential housing development capacity for the City was determined to be from
underutilized parcels in multi-family zoned districts. Underutilized residential properties represent
the area of greatest growth potential in the City. Underutilized properties were identified by zoning
district as follows:
           Single Family Residential (R-1) – those properties with a long side yard abutting a higher
           intensity zoned parcel are permitted to be developed with second units that must to be built
           under very specific development and design standards.
           Two Family (R-2) – Many of theses properties were found to have only one housing unit on-
           site. Many of these properties had sufficient space and adequate dimensions to be eligible
           for a second unit. In addition, the R-2 development standards of the Municipal Code permit
           R-2 zoned properties to have two accessory units above the two units permitted by right,
           provided that they meet the applicable development standards.
           Multifamily (R-3) These properties have the greatest potential for providing additional
           housing units. Each R-3 zoned property was surveyed to determine whether it is “built-

           out.” Those that did not appear to be built-out were identified and analyzed for the number
           of potential future units that could be constructed. Staff was able to determine the additional
           number of units that could be built at each identified underdeveloped parcel. Staff lowered
           the estimated dwelling unit maximum by 50% of the gross housing unit capacity to provide a
           conservative but realistic assessment of the number of parcels that would support additional
           capacity either by infill development or recycling of existing development. See Table 6-1
In addition to the foregoing, the El Segundo General Plan designates the 5.7-acre former Imperial
School site as Planned Residential Development, the only location at which this land use district
occurs. This mixed density residential designation is intended to encourage design flexibility and
provide transitional densities and uses compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood.
The General Plan permits a maximum of 29 single-family detached and 36 multi-family dwelling
units on this site.
Residentially underutilized parcels were also discovered throughout the City in non-residential zones.
These non-residential zones include the Neighborhood Commercial (C-2) Zone, Downtown
Commercial (C-RS) Zone, Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) Zone, Small Business (SB) Zone, and the
Medium Manufacturing (MM) Zone. The SB and MM zoning districts allow the development of
caretaker units at a ratio of one per legal building site or business establishment whichever is greater,
as long as two (2) on-site parking spaces are provided for each dwelling unit. Using GIS aerial and
zoning maps, staff surveyed each legal building site and business establishment. Staff was also able
to determine which properties had already been developed with a caretaker unit. All of the
remaining legal building sites then became eligible for one caretaker unit.
The C-2, C-RS and DSP zoning districts allow one dwelling unit per lot above ground floor
commercial only. Staff was able to determine which properties had already been developed and
identified the remaining legal building sites eligible for a residential unit.
The City has adopted a specific plan for the area known as Smoky Hollow located north of the
Chevron Refinery, across El Segundo Boulevard. This area permits primarily light industrial uses.
The Plan designated 14 acres formerly developed with light industrial uses for transition to medium
density residential (18 du/acre). Since adoption of the Specific Plan, three residential projects have
been developed. They are the Grand Tropez with 88 units, and two other developments located at
the northwest corner of Grand and Kansas, and 1225 East Grand, containing 27 units and 9
live/work units, respectively. The remaining 6.8 acres are developed with commercial and industrial
uses. The remaining capacity to build additional units within the Specific Plan area is not anticipated
to occur during the next planning period.
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) allocation for the City of El Segundo is 168
housing units. This includes 44 units for very low-income households, 27 units for low-income
households, 28 units for moderate-income households, and 69 units for upper income households.
The City’s residential sites inventory analysis indicates the potential for 523 net new units in the City
based on existing zoning and General Plan designations and utilizing the methodology described
above to determine actual net new units that could potentially be produced for this same planning
period. See Table 6-1, below.

1Table  6-1 is a summary of the results of the parcel-specific inventory of vacant and underutilized lots in the City, which
is included in Appendix A. As such it is intended for informational purposes only and not to satisfy the requirements of
Chapter 724, amended (AB 2348). The reader is directed to Appendix A for the parcel-specific detailed inventory of
land suitable for future residential development that complies with Section 65583.2 (b) of the Government Code.
2Net  projected units refers to the number of units that could realistically be developed in the zone after compliance with
the site development standards of the applicable zone. Those standards are described in Chapter 5 of this element.
3Governmental     constraints are discussed in Chapter 5 of this element.
4Physical and infrastructure constraints typically consists of constraints that would prevent the achievement of the net
new number of units described in this chart. That would include the inability to serve the identified parcels with City
service and utilities, including water, sewer, and electrical and other utilities. With the exception of the number of
parcels available, parcel sizes and configuration issues, there are no such environmental (infrastructure-related)
constraints on residential development in the City.
5The R-2 Two Family zone permits additional units (including 3 or more units) under limited circumstances, such as on
R-2 zoned parcels located adjacent to higher intensity residential and commercial zones. Currently, there are no such
parcels that are either vacant or underutilized in the City.
6Residential uses in non-residential zones consist of caretaker units with one care-taker unit permitted per
parcel/business. The City estimates that the future construction of caretaker units in the City will be limited to
approximately 10% of all such parcels/businesses that could potentially accommodate caretaker units.

Regional Housing Needs Assessment
As indicated in Chapter 1, the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) allocation for the City
of El Segundo for the 2006 - 2014 planning period is 168 units. The allocation for these units by
income category are as follows: 44 units for very-low income households, 27 units for low-income
households, 28 units for moderate-income households, and 69 units for above-moderate income
households. The City facilitated the construction of 25 units during the second half of 2005 and 13
units during 2006, totaling 38 units, which can be credited toward the above moderate income
requirements for the 2006-2014 planning period.
Based on the results of the vacant and underutilized land inventory, there is sufficient development
capacity on vacant and underdeveloped parcels to produce an additional 497 units in residential
zoning districts and 26 additional units in non-residential zoning districts in the City. Additional
residential units in residentially zoned areas of the City largely include second dwelling units in R-1
zone district, and in-fill units in the City’s R-2 Two Family and R-3 Multifamily zone districts.
Additional residential units in non-residentially zoned areas of the City include caretaker units in the
Neighborhood Commercial (C-2), Small Business (SB) and Medium Manufacturing (MM) zones and
residential uses above ground floors in the Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) and the Downtown
Commercial (C-RS) Zones.
Many of the units described above are anticipated to be available to satisfy only the City’s moderate-
income and above-moderate income housing needs. However, opportunities for both low-income
and very-low income housing units to be constructed are available in the R1 zone district where
second units are proposed. Another area in which the potential for the development of units
affordable to low-income and very-low income households exists is the Downtown Specific Plan
area, where affordability requirements can be implemented in conjunction with the planned
introduction of a density bonus program, or in conjunction with various other programs described
in Chapter 8 of this Housing Element.
B.         OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility costs reduce the affordability of housing. The City
has many opportunities to directly affect energy use within its jurisdiction. Title 24 of the California
Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new development, and requires
adoption of an “energy budget.” The following are among the alternative ways to meet these energy
standards:
           Alternative 1: The passive solar approach, which requires proper solar orientation,
           appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
           Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no
           thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
           Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in
           exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.

In turn, the home building industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible
for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. Some additional opportunities for energy
conservation include various passive design techniques. Among the range of techniques that could
be used for purposes of reducing energy consumption are the following:
■          locating the structure on the northern portion of the sunniest portion of the site;
■          designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the building and to
           reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions; and
■          locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing
           corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north face to the
           building to serve as a buffer between heated spaces and the colder north face.
Insulation and Weatherproofing
Most homes in El Segundo were built within the past twenty-five years, so there are few homes
within the City that were constructed during times when there was little concern for the use of
electricity, oil and natural gas for heating purposes. However, to conserve the heat generated by
older heating units and minimize the heat loss ratio, the earlier-built homes in El Segundo can be
insulated in the attic space and exterior walls. Windows and exterior doors, in these less recent
homes, can be fitted with air-tight devices or caulking, or can be replaced with the more energy
efficient (dual pane) windows and doors that now available.
In addition to the foregoing, the City provides eligible property owners a means of having
improvements made to their residential property to reduce noise impacts from the Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) to the interior habitable portions of their residences. This is the City’s
Residential Sound Insulation (RSI) Program which is described in Chapter 8. Although this program
is primarily intended to insulate homes to reduce interior noise levels, the insulation improvements
that are available also result in reduced energy costs for the individual homeowner.
Natural Lighting
Daytime interior lighting costs can be significantly reduced or eliminated with the use of properly
designed and located skylights. Skylights/solar tubes can be easily installed at reasonable expense in
existing houses, thereby substantially reducing electricity costs and energy consumption.
Solar Energy
Implementing solar energy strategies, noted above, is a practical, cost effective, and environmentally
sound way to heat and cool a home. In California, with its plentiful year-round sunshine, the
potential uses of solar energy are numerous. With proper building designs, this resource provides
for cooling in the summer and heating in the winter; it can also heat water for domestic use and
swimming pools and generate electricity.
Unlike oil or natural gas, solar energy is an unlimited resource which will always be available. Once a
solar system is installed, the only additional costs are for the maintenance or replacement of the
City of El Segundo
Housing Element Update                           6-10                                            July 2009

                                                                            6. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
system itself. The user is not subject to unpredictable fuel price increases. Moreover, solar energy
can be utilized without any serious safety or environmental concerns.
Solar heating and cooling systems are of three general types: passive, active, or a combination
thereof. In passive solar systems, the building structure itself is designed to collect the sun's energy,
then store and circulate the resulting heat similar to a green house. Passive buildings are typically
designed with a southerly orientation to maximize solar exposure, and constructed with dense
materials such as concrete or adobe to better absorb the heat. Properly placed windows and
overhanging eaves also contribute to keeping a house cool.
Active systems collect and store solar energy in panels attached to the exterior of a house. This type
of system utilizes mechanical fans or pumps to circulate the warm/cool air, while heated water can
flow directly into a home's hot water system.
Although passive systems generally maximize use of the sun's energy and are less costly to install,
active systems have greater potential application to both cool and heat the house and provide hot
water. This may mean lower energy costs for El Segundo residents presently dependent on
conventional fuels. The City should also encourage the use of passive solar systems in new
residential construction to improve energy efficiency for its citizens.
Water Conservation
Simple water conservation techniques can save a family thousands of gallons of water per year, plus
many dollars in water and associated energy consumption costs. Many plumbing products are now
available which eliminate unnecessary water waste by restricting the volume of water flow from
faucets, showerheads, and toilets. In this regard, the City will continue to require the incorporation
of low flow plumbing fixtures into the design of all new residential units.
The use of plant materials in residential landscaping that are well adapted to the climate in the El
Segundo area, and the use of ample mulch to retain soil moisture, can measurably contribute to
water conservation by reducing the need for irrigation, much of which is often lost through
evaporation. A family can also save water by simply fixing dripping faucets and using water more
conservatively. In addition, such conservation practices save on gas and electricity needed to heat
water and the sewage system facilities needed to treat it. By encouraging residents to conserve water
and retrofit existing plumbing fixtures with water saving devices, the City can greatly reduce its water
consumption needs and expenses.
Energy Audits
The Southern California Edison Company provides energy audits to local residents on request.
Many citizens are not aware of this program. The City can aid in expanding this program by
supplying the public with pertinent information regarding the process including the appropriate
contacts. Energy audits are extremely valuable in pinpointing specific areas in residences, which are
responsible for energy losses. The inspections also result in specific recommendations to remedy
energy inefficiency.

New Construction
The City of El Segundo will continue to require the incorporation of energy conserving (i.e., Energy
Star) appliances, fixtures, and other devices into the design of new residential units. The City will
also continue to review new subdivisions to ensure that each lot optimizes proper solar access and
orientation to the extent possible. The City will also continue to require the incorporation of low
flow plumbing fixtures into the design of all new residential units.
South Bay Environmental Services Center
The South Bay Environmental Services Center (SBESC) partners with local agencies, including the
City of El Segundo and local utility providers. The SBESC acts as a central clearinghouse for energy
efficiency information and resources. The purpose of the organization is to help significantly
increase the availability of information and resources to the people in the South Bay region to help
them save water, energy, money, and the environment. The SBESC assists public agencies,
businesses, and residents of the South Bay to best utilize the many resources available to them
through a wide variety of statewide and local energy efficiency and water conservation programs. It
recently expanded their services through implementation of an Energy Efficiency Plus (EE+)
program to deliver energy savings to local public agencies, including the City of El Segundo.

Housing Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element includes the housing goals and policies of the City of El
Segundo currently in the adopted Housing Element. The City intends to continue to implement
these goals to address a number of important housing-related issues. Some policies, however, have
been modified from the adopted Housing Element to address current housing issues, the new
RHNA, and requirements of State Housing Element Law applicable to the current planning period.
These revised policies are presented in Section 8. With a very limited supply of land and limited
public funding sources, El Segundo’s housing objectives are primarily to protect and preserve its
existing housing stock.
Small amounts of new construction is anticipated on presently underdeveloped residential land, with
the City increasing opportunities for private development of new units through revisions of the
ESMC (specifically adding density bonus provisions) as well as facilitating new development on the
Imperial School site, and in the Downtown Specific Plan and Neighborhood Commercial Zones.
The following five major issue areas are addressed by the goals and policies of the current Housing
Element. These same goals are proposed to be carried over to this Housing Element. Several
policies, however, have been changed or updated to reflect current housing issues and these are
presented in Section 8.
         A. Conserving and improving the condition of the existing affordable housing stock;
         B. Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
         C. Providing adequate sites to achieve a diversity of housing;
         D. Removing governmental constraints, as necessary; and
         E. Promoting equal housing opportunity.
A.       CONSERVING EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK
According to the 2000 Census, about 68 percent of El Segundo's housing units are more than 30
years old, the age at which a housing unit will typically begin to require major repairs. This
represents a significant proportion of the City's housing stock, and indicates that programs which
assist with preventive maintenance may be necessary to avoid housing deterioration.
GOAL 1: Preserve and protect the existing housing stock by encouraging the rehabilitation
of deteriorating dwelling units and the conservation of the currently sound housing stock.
Policy 1.1: Continue to promote the use of rehabilitation assistance programs to encourage property owners to
rehabilitate owner-occupied and rental housing where feasible.

Policy 1.2: Encourage investment of public and private resources to foster neighborhood improvement.
Policy 1.3: Encourage the maintenance of sound owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing.
Policy 1.4: Continue to promote sound attenuation improvements to the existing housing stock.
B.       ASSISTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
There is a range of household types in El Segundo that need housing to fit their particular
circumstances. For example, the housing needs assessment indicates there may be a need for
additional senior housing in El Segundo. The City seeks to expand the range of housing
opportunities, including those for low- and moderate income first-time homebuyers, senior citizens
on fixed incomes, extremely low-,very low-, low-, and moderate-income residents, the disabled,
military personnel, and the homeless.
GOAL 2: Provide sufficient new, affordable housing opportunities in the City to meet the
needs of groups with special requirements, including the needs of lower and moderate-
income households.
Policy 2.1: Provide regulations, as required by State Law, to facilitate additional senior housing and develop
programs to serve related special needs.
Policy 2.2: Facilitate the creation of affordable home ownership opportunities for extremely low, very low and low-
income households.
Policy 2.3: Provide an allowance in the City’s Zoning Ordinance, as required by State Law, to permit transitional
housing facilities in multi-family residential zones and emergency shelters in commercial zones.
Policy 2.4: Provide funding for the development of plans for a Community Center to provide expanded and
consolidated services for seniors and large families.
C.       PROVIDING ADEQUATE SITES
As described in the Constraints chapter of the Housing Element, historically, less than 25 percent of
the land within the City has been used for residential development. The remaining land has been
used primarily for a mixture of light and heavy industrial purposes and is not available for residential
use, except for caretaker units. A total of 335 acres are designated for residential/commercial mixed
use in El Segundo. Limited land resources thus restrict the amount of residential development that
could occur in the City.
GOAL 3: Provide opportunities for new housing construction in a variety of locations and a
variety of densities in accordance with the land use designations and policies in the Land
Use Element.
Policy 3.1: Provide for the construction of 78 new housing units during the 2000-2005 planning period in order to
meet the goals of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).

Policy 3.2: Allow property designated for multi-family use which currently contains single-family development to be
recycled for multi-family residential development.
Policy 3.3: Permit vacant and underdeveloped property designated as residential to develop with a diversity of types,
prices and tenure.
Policy 3.4: Encourage new housing to be developed within the Smoky Hollow Mixed-Use district, and on the
Imperial School site.
Policy 3.5: Continue to permit a second dwelling on selected single-family lots when such lots abut higher intensity
land use designations.
Policy 3.6: Continue to permit a second dwelling on the front of select single-family lots which have a small older
dwelling at the rear of the lot.
Policy 3.7: Continue to permit a third and fourth dwelling on selected two-family lots when such lots abut higher
intensity land use designations.
D.       REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
In addition to the private sector, actions by the City and other governmental regulations can have an
impact on the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements,
building codes, fees, and other local programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing
may serve as a constraint to housing development.
GOAL 4: Remove governmental constraints on housing development.
Policy 4.1: Continue to allow second units, condominium conversions, caretaker units and second floor residential use
in commercial zones as specified in the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Policy 4.2: Continue to allow factory-produced housing according to the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Policy 4.3: Facilitate timely development processing for residential construction projects and expedite the project review
process.
Policy 4.4: Facilitate provision of infrastructure to accommodate residential development.
E.       PROMOTING EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all segments of the community, the
City must ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all residents.
GOAL 5: Provide housing opportunities including ownership and rental, fair-market and
assisted, in conformance with open housing policies and free of discriminatory practices.
Policy 5.1: Disseminate and provide information on fair housing laws and practices to the community.

Policy 5.2: Promote governmental efforts to provide equal opportunity housing for existing and projected demands in
El Segundo.
Policy 5.3: Monitor the lending practices of local lending institutions for compliance under the Community
Reinvestment Act to evaluate lending activities and goals toward meeting the community’s credit needs.
Progress in Meeting Goals and Objectives
Progress in meeting the City's 2001 Housing Element goals can be determined by measuring the
progress in production, rehabilitation, and conservation since the element was adopted. Between
2000 and 2005 the City was able to produce 151 net new housing units, exceeding the number of
units required by the SCAG RHNA. In 2006, the City produced 13 units and an additional 16 units
in 2007. Most of the housing units produced were market-rate priced housing units. Table 7-1
describes the City’s progress towards meeting its 2000-2005 RHNA obligations.

The City's rehabilitation programs have exceeded the quantified objectives set forth in the 2001
Housing Element. From 2000 through 2005, 51 units were rehabilitated annually, including units
that were rehabilitated under the senior paint/fix up program. All of the programs targeted lower-
income households.
Altogether, many programs from the 2001 Housing Element remain appropriate for the 2006-2014
period. The City will continue providing rehabilitation loan programs, homebuyer assistance, and
assisting developers in providing affordable housing. In addition, programs to remove constraints,
including expediting project reviews for residential development applications remain appropriate for
2006-2014.

                                                                         7. HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Evaluation of Past Program Accomplishments
State Housing Element law requires communities to assess the achievements under adopted housing
programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These results should be
quantified where possible (e.g., the number of units that were rehabilitated), but may be qualitative
where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental constraints). These results then need to be
compared with what was projected or planned in the earlier element. Where significant shortfalls
exist between what was planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such differences must be
discussed.
The El Segundo 2000-2005 Housing Element contains a series of housing programs with related
quantified objectives for the following topic areas: Conserve and Improve Existing Affordable
Housing Stock; Assist in the Development of Affordable Housing; Provide Adequate Housing Sites;
Remove Governmental and Other Constraints; and Promote Equal Housing Opportunity.
The following section reviews the progress in implementation of these programs, and the continued
appropriateness of identified programs. The results of this analysis will provide the basis for
developing the comprehensive housing program strategy presented in the final section of this
Housing Element.
 GOAL 1: CONSERVE EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK
Preserve and protect the existing housing stock by encouraging the rehabilitation of
deteriorating dwelling units and the conservation of the currently sound housing stock.
           Program 1a. – Minor Home Repair Program (MHR). This ongoing program is
           supported by CDBG funds that provide for minor maintenance and repairs on income
           qualified owner occupied units. The City provides zero interest-deferred loans, due upon sale
           or transfer of ownership, up to a maximum of $7,500 for low-income property owners. In
           addition, grants of up $1,500 are available to make handicapped related improvements.
           Progress to Date: The City committed to providing assistance to six households annually
           and to advertise program availability through brochures, placement on the City’s website,
           and to make information available on an ongoing basis. The City provided assistance to 1 to
           2 households annually. The City continues to advertise the availability of this program to the
           public via the methods described above.
           Program 1b. – Residential Sound Insulation Program (RSI). This program provides
           eligible property owners a means of having improvements made to their residential property
           to reduce the impacts of noise from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the interior
           habitable portions of the residence(s). There is no cost to the property owner for
           improvements deemed necessary for reducing interior noise levels, and the City does allow
           property owners to pay for certain requested improvements in limited circumstances.

                                                                          7. HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
           The program funded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the City of Los
           Angeles’ Department of Airports (LADOA), more commonly referred to as Los Angeles
           World Airports (LAWA). The City applies for and receives federal grant funding annually
           from the FAA which can only be used to cover a maximum of 80% of eligible expenses
           incurred, with remaining expenses being funded by LAWA as part of local grant funding.
           Progress to Date: The City continues to encourage impacted residents to take advantage of
           this program and advertises its availability through various methods, including posting on the
           City’s website. A total of 628 homes have been insulated under this program since its
           adoption in 1993.
           Program 1c. – Countywide HOME Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program. This
           program provides financial assistance to rental property owners for the rehabilitation of
           multi-family units that are made available to tenants at or below 80 percent MFI. It allows
           the owners to rehabilitate affordable rental housing for low-income families by providing
           financial support through the utilization of public/private funding sources to maintain
           existing rental properties.
           Progress to Date: The City continues to advertise the availability of this program through
           placement of program brochures at the public counter, on the City’s website, and in
           conjunction with its Code Compliance program.
           Program 2. – Code Compliance Program. The Building Safety Division of El Segundo
           committed to conducting a Code Compliance program (on a quarterly basis) consisting of
           compliance inspections and the monitoring of housing conditions throughout the City.
           Progress to Date: The Building Safety Division responds to violations brought to their
           attention on a case-by-case basis in addition to the pursuit of Code violations noted in the
           field. Only 44 residential Code violations were reported during 2006.
GOAL 2: ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Provide sufficient new, affordable housing opportunities in the City to meet the needs of
groups with special requirements, including the needs of lower and moderate-income
households.
           Program 3a. Countywide Affordable Homeownership Program. The City committed
           to participation in this County program, which provides loans secured by a second deed of
           trust that homebuyers may use to pay their down payment and closing costs. Where
           appropriate, this program was to be used in conjunction with new construction of
           ownership housing, as well as the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program.
          Progress to Date: Although the City advertised this program’s availability through placement
          of program brochures at the public counter, no El Segundo residents took advantage of the
          program and no loans were issued during the planning period.

                                                                           7. HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
           Program 3b. – Lease-to-Own Program. This program promotes affordable home
           ownership opportunities for low and moderate-income households earning up to 140
           percent of the MFI. This program is utilized by a growing number of cities in Southern
           California and is financed through tax-exempt bond issues and private long-term mortgage
           financing.
           Progress to Date: The City did not implement the Lease-to-Own Program during the
           planning period, therefore there were no program participants in El Segundo. Furthermore,
           this program (administered by the County Community Development Commission) is no
           longer in existence.
           Program 3c. – Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC). The City participates with the
           County Community Development Commission in implementation of a Mortgage Credit
           Certificate Program. An MCC is a certificate awarded by the CDC authorizing the holder to
           take a federal income tax credit. A qualified applicant who is awarded an MCC may take an
           annual credit against federal income taxes of up to twenty percent of the annual interest paid
           on the applicant's mortgage.
           Progress to Date: Although the City participated with the Los Angeles County Community
           Development Commission in implementing the MCC program, there were no qualified
           applicants in El Segundo who participated in the program during the planning period.
           Program 3d. – Location Efficient Mortgage (LEM). The City participated in the LEM
           Program which is a program implemented by a partnership that includes the Southern
           California Association of Governments. The program rewards homebuyers for purchasing
           homes within neighborhoods that reduce the need for a car, by allowing them to qualify for
           up to $50,000 more when applying for a home loan.
           Progress to Date: Although the City promoted the use of the LEM program through the
           City’s newsletter, flyers, and website, and through direct contact with local realtors and
           lenders, no residents of El Segundo participated in this program.
GOAL 3: PROVIDING ADEQUATE SITES
Provide opportunities for new housing construction in a variety of locations and a variety of
densities in accordance with the land use designations and policies in the Land Use
Element.
           Program 4. – Land Use Element. The City committed to continuing to provide adequate
           sites through its General Plan and zoning to increase the provision of housing for all
           economic segments of the community. This included identifying sites within the Smoky
           Hollow Specific Plan area and on the Imperial School site, promoting the development of
           second units in single-family zones, and caretaker’s units in Small Business (SB) and Medium
           Manufacturing (MM) zones.

                                                                         7. HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
           Progress to Date: No quantified goal was established for providing adequate sites through
           General Plan and zoning. However, since adoption of the 2000-2005 Housing Element, 151
           units have been constructed in the City. In 2006, 13 units were newly constructed in the
           City. These units consist largely of the addition of dwelling units on underutilized parcels
           located in the City’s Multifamily Residential (R-3) Zone.
           Program 5. – Facilitate Development on Underutilized Sites. The City committed to
           providing information to prospective developers on sites suitable for residential
           development. The City also sought to facilitate development on underutilized properties by
           providing potential housing developers with a list of underutilized Multi-Family Residential
           (R-3) and Medium Density Residential (MDR) zoned properties. In addition, the City
           undertook to advise homebuyers and developers that they may pursue a variety of public and
           private funding sources in support of affordable housing development.
           Progress to Date: The City continues to work with the development community in
           identifying opportunities for new unit construction on underutilized sites. As a result of past
           efforts, the City was able to meet and exceed the quantified housing objectives of its
           Housing Element (78 new units) by constructing 151 units over the 5-year planning period.
           Program 6. – Sites for Transitional Housing/Homeless Shelters. The City committed
           to modifying its zoning ordinance to permit transitional housing in appropriate residential
           zones and emergency housing in commercial and industrial zones, subject to approval of a
           Conditional Use Permit (CUP), by the year 2002.
           Progress to Date: The City has not modified its zoning ordinance to permit transitional
           housing in appropriate residential zones and emergency housing in commercial and
           industrial zones, subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP).
GOAL 4: REMOVE GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Remove governmental constraints on housing development.
           Program 7. – Density Bonus/Development Incentives Ordinance. The City
           committed to adopting a local density bonus ordinance, pursuant to State density bonus law
           by the year 2002 and to promote development of a brochure for distribution to the local
           Board of Realtors and local developers describing the regulatory incentives under the
           proposed “Development Incentives Ordinance.”
           Progress to Date: The City has not yet adopted a local density bonus ordinance to comply
           with State law and to specify regulatory concessions to be offered. However, the City was
           able to exceed its RHNA obligation for the planning period under existing zoning
           regulations.
           Program 8. – Expedite Project Review. The City determined that its processing times for
           development applicants were comparable to those in other communities. Additionally, the
           City offers an accelerated plan check process where applicants can pay a fee for staff to work

           overtime to complete plan check review in one-half the time that the plan check process
           would otherwise take. The City reaffirmed its commitment to implement the requirements
           of the Permit Streamlining Act and to provide prompt review of projects.
           Progress to Date: The City was able to process projects in compliance with the Permit
           Streamlining Act and to provide prompt project review services.
GOAL 5: PROMOTE EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
           Program 9. – Fair Housing Program. Fair Housing is a citywide program that El
           Segundo provides through a contract with the Westside Fair Housing Council. The primary
           services include fair housing outreach and educational information and landlord/tenant
           dispute resolution. Additionally, the City contracts with the Dispute Resolution Services
           (DRS) that provides no and low cost dispute resolution for a variety of issues including
           housing disputes.
           Progress to Date: The City continued to advertise the program services described above and
           continued to promote fair housing practices, and provide educational information on fair
           housing at the public counter. Complaints were referred to the appropriate agencies.

8.         HOUSING PROGRAMS
The goals and policies contained in the City’s adopted Housing Element address El Segundo’s
identified housing needs and are being implemented through a series of on-going housing programs
and activities. At public workshops before both the Planning Commission and City Council, these
programs were reviewed and a determination was made by both policy-making bodies to continue
implementing programs that included some level of resident participation and accomplishments for
the prior planning period, eliminate those programs that were not effective or had no participation
by El Segundo residents, and provide new programs that address the new requirements of State
Housing Element Law.
The City of El Segundo’s overall housing program strategy for addressing its housing needs has been
defined according to the following issue areas, which will remain in effect for the updated Housing
Element:
A.      Conserving and improving the condition of the existing stock of affordable housing;
B.      Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
C.      Providing adequate sites to achieve a diversity of housing;
D.      Removing governmental constraints, as necessary; and
E.      Promoting equal housing opportunity
El Segundo’s housing plan for addressing unmet needs, removing constraints, and achieving
quantitative objectives is described in this section according to the above five areas. The housing
programs introduced on the following pages include past programs that are currently in operation
and showed accomplishments during the prior planning period and new programs which have been

A. CONSERVING                        AND         IMPROVING               EXISTING              AFFORDABLE
        HOUSING
Preserving the existing housing stock in El Segundo is a top priority for the City and maintaining the
City's older neighborhoods is vital to conserving the overall quality of housing in the community.
Approximately 68 percent of El Segundo’s housing stock is more than 30-years old, indicating that
there is a strong future need for rehabilitation.
GOAL 1: Preserve and protect the existing housing stock by encouraging the rehabilitation
of deteriorating dwelling units and the conservation of the currently sound housing stock.
         Policy 1.1: Continue to promote the use of rehabilitation assistance programs to encourage property owners to
         rehabilitate owner-occupied and rental housing where feasible.

          Program 1 – Home Rehabilitation Loan Programs
          The goals of these programs are to offer residents an opportunity to live in a safe and
          sanitary environment, by offering rehabilitation assistance to lower income homeowners
          and renters. These programs include a grant program for handicapped improvements, and
          zero interest loans for single-family and multi-family rehabilitation.
                   1a. Minor Home Repair Program (MHR)
                   This program represents a major effort by El Segundo to maintain and improve the
                   City’s housing stock. The program is supported by CDBG funds that provide for
                   minor maintenance and repairs on income qualified owner occupied units. The City
                   provides grants up to a maximum of $5,000 for low-income property owners, zero
                   interest deferred loans (due upon sale or transfer of ownership) up to a maximum of
                   $15,000 for low-income property owners, or a combination of a grant and a loan
                   totaling up to $15,000 with the grant not to exceed $5,000. Handicapped related
                   improvements are allowed as a grant and/or loan.
                   Five Year Objective: Continue program implementation with 10 units to be rehabilitated
                   during the current planning period.

                   This program provides eligible property owners a means of having improvements
                   made to their residential property to reduce the impacts of noise from Los Angeles
                   International Airport (LAX) to the interior habitable portions of the residence(s).
                   There is no cost to the property owner for improvements deemed necessary for
                   reducing interior noise levels, and the City does allow property owners to pay for
                   certain requested improvements in limited circumstances.

                   Angeles World Airports (LAWA). The City applies for and receives federal grant
                   funding annually from the FAA which can only be used to cover a maximum of 80%
                   of eligible expenses incurred, with remaining expenses being funded by LAWA as
                   part of local grant funding.

                   Approximately 5,700 homes in El Segundo have been identified as eligible for
                   insulation under this program, with over 628 homes completed since inception in
                   1993. More than 300 homes were completed in 2007 and there are 1,700 residences
                   on the program waiting list.
                   Five Year Objective: Continue to make improvements at as many homes as annual funding
                   allows which is anticipated to be approximately 300 homes annually, or 2,550 homes over the
                   planning period.

                    As a participating city in the Urban County CDBG program, El Segundo is eligible
                    to participate in the County’s Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program. This program
                    provides financial assistance to rental property owners for the rehabilitation of
                    multi-family units that are made available to tenants at or below 80 percent MFI. It
                    allows the rental owners to rehabilitate affordable rental housing for low-income
                    families by providing financial support through the utilization of public/private
                    funding sources to maintain existing rental properties.

                   1d. Energy Conservation Program
                    The City supports energy conservation measures that are available to local residents.
                    For example, the City recently adopted (2008) an Environmental Work Plan and
                    formed an Environmental Committee that developed environmental action items
                    for implementation. In April 2009 this same committee made recommendations to
                    the City Council to approve a green building kiosk to be located inside City Hall.
                    This kiosk will serve as a one-stop shop for residents to gather information on
                    energy conservation techniques for their homes. Also the City will host its first
                    green building workshop in early 2010 for local residents. The purpose of these
                    workshops will be to provide ongoing information and instructions to residents on
                    incorporating green building techniques and technologies in residential construction.
                   The City also partners with the South Bay Environmental Services Center (SBESC)
                   which acts as a central clearinghouse for energy efficiency information and resources.
                   The purpose of the organization is to help significantly increase the availability of
                   information and resources to the people in the South Bay region to help them save

                   businesses, and residents of the South Bay to best utilize the many resources
                   available to them through a wide variety of statewide and local energy efficiency and
                   water conservation programs. It recently expanded their services through
                   implementation of an Energy Efficiency Plus (EE+) program to deliver energy
                   savings to local public agencies, including the City of El Segundo.
                    Finally, the City will conduct a comprehensive review and consider adopting
                    possible new regulatory incentives to promote energy conservation and green
                    building techniques in the City. This review will be conducted after implementation
                    of mandatory provisions in the California Green Building Code in order to avoid
                    duplicate or conflicting regulations between City regulatory requirements and
                    requirements in the Green Building Code.
                   Five Year Objective: Continue to undertake outreach efforts that promote energy conservation
                   and the utilization of green building techniques and continue to coordinate with the SBESC to
                   make information resources available to the community. Conduct a review and consider the adoption
                   of regulatory incentives that promote energy conservation and green building techniques after an
                   evaluation is conducted of requirements in the California Green Building Code

           Program 2 – Code Compliance Inspection Program
           The Building Safety Division of El Segundo maintains statistics pertaining to Code
           compliance inspections and monitors housing conditions throughout the City. The Building
           Safety Division responds to violations brought to their attention on a case-by-case basis.
           Although Code violations are somewhat limited (an average of 11 per quarter), their early
           detection and resolution are to preventing deterioration in residential neighborhoods.
           Residents cited for code violations are informed of rehabilitation assistance available
           through the City and County.
           Five Year Objective: Continue to conduct inspections on a complaint basis through the City’s Building
           Safety Division. Based on past experience, 264 Code violations should be inspected and corrected between
           January 2009 and December 2014.

B. ASSIST IN THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
The Housing Element proposes to introduce several new programs aimed at assisting in the
production of affordable housing. These programs replace programs from the prior Housing
Element that had little or no participation by residents. The new programs include the City’s on-
going efforts to encourage the construction of lower-cost 2nd units on R-1 zoned properties in the

City, facilitating the development of the Imperial School site with a variety of housing (including
affordable housing), and soliciting the participation of non-profit organizations to help secure
funding for affordable housing.
GOAL 2: Provide sufficient new, affordable housing opportunities in the City to meet the
needs of groups with special requirements, including the needs of lower and moderate-
income households.
Policy 2.1: Establish and maintain land use controls to accommodate the housing needs of elderly, disabled and
other special needs households.
Policy 2.2: Facilitate the creation of affordable home ownership opportunities for extremely low, very low and low-
income households.
Policy 2.3: Provide an allowance in the El Segundo Municipal Code to permit transitional and supportive housing
facilities as a principally permitted use in multi-family residential zones subject only to the same permitting processes
and regulatory requirements as other residential uses in the same zone and emergency shelters as permitted uses in
either the M-M or M-1industrial zones.
           Program 3 – Second Units on R-1 Zoned Parcels
           The City continues to encourage the development of underutilized sites to accommodate its
           RHNA for lower-income households. This includes providing for 2nd units on R-1 zoned
           lots in the City with side yards abutting properties zoned R-3, P, C-RS, C-2, COor MU. The
           City has tentatively identified 47 potential sites for 2nd units on parcels that meet the side
           yard requirement. Development of these units provides rental housing within a single-family
           neighborhood setting which is generally affordable to lower-income households.
           Five Year Objective: Continue to facilitate the development of 2nd units on R-1 zoned parcels through
           various outreach methods such as through updated handouts and information on the City’s website.

            Program 4 – Imperial School Site
            The El Segundo General Plan currently designates the 5.7-acre Imperial School site as
            Planned Residential Development. This is the only location at which this land use district
            designation occurs and represents one of the few areas in the City where design flexibility
            can be “built in” to a future mixed-use project on the site, that can provide both transitional
            densities and uses compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood, and that can
            include a mix of market rate and affordable housing.
            Five Year Objective: Facilitate the development of the Imperial School site with a mix of residential
            densities (both single-family and multi-family) that include both market rate and affordable housing units.

           development of the site.
           Program 5 – Support for Non-Profit Organizations
           The City seeks to proactively support efforts of non-profit organizations to procure
           Federal/State funding for affordable housing construction by initiating contacts with such
           organizations and financially assisting them with such efforts to the extent possible.
           Five Year Objective: Utilization of non-profit organizations as sponsors for development
           and management of affordable housing.

C. PROVIDING ADEQUATE SITES
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all segments of the community is the provision of
adequate sites for all types, sizes and prices of housing. Both the general plan and zoning regulations
identify where housing may be located, thereby affecting the supply of land available for housing.
The Housing Element is required to contain adequate sites under General Plan and zoning to
address the City’s share of regional housing needs (RHNA), identified as 168 units for El Segundo,
including 44 very low income, 27 low income, 28 moderate income, and 69 upper income units.
GOAL 3: Provide opportunities for new housing construction in a variety of locations and a
variety of densities in accordance with the land use designations and policies in the Land
Use Element.
Policy 3.1: Provide for the construction of 168 new housing units during the 2006-2014 planning period in order to
meet the goals of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA).
Policy 3.2: Allow property designated for multi-family use (which currently contains single-family development) to be
recycled for multi-family residential development.
Policy 3.3: Permit vacant and underdeveloped property designated as residential to develop with a diversity of types,
prices and tenure.
Policy 3.4: Encourage new housing to be developed within the Smoky Hollow Mixed-Use district, and on the
Imperial School site.

Policy 3.5: Continue to permit a second dwelling on selected single-family lots when such lots abut higher intensity
land use designations.
Policy 3.6: Continue to permit a second dwelling on the front of select single-family lots which have a small older
dwelling at the rear of the lot.
Policy 3.7: Continue to permit a third and fourth dwelling on selected two-family lots when such lots abut higher
intensity land use designations.
           Program 6 – Land Use Element
           The residential sites analysis completed for the Housing Element indicates the City can
           accommodate just over 520 additional dwelling units under existing General Plan and Zoning
           designations. The Imperial School site is anticipated to accommodate 65 units; however the
           development of these units would require removal of existing uses. A limited amount of
           vacant residentially zoned land is available for new housing. Most new housing in the City
           will be in-fill housing constructed on sites currently occupied with housing or in non-
           residential zones where caretaker units are permitted.
           Residential uses are also permitted as accessory uses in several of the commercial and
           industrial zones. The Neighborhood Commercial (C-2), Downtown Specific Plan (DSP),
           Downtown Commercial (C-RS), Small Business (SB), and Medium Manufacturing (MM)
           Zones all allow one residential unit per lot. The SB and MM Zones are limited to one
           “caretaker” unit per lot with a maximum size of 500 square feet per unit. These zones have
           the potential to provide new residential units, which could provide affordable housing
           opportunities due to their limited size and because they are restricted for use by a caretaker
           on the property. Additionally, the ESMC allows the opportunity for joint use, off-site,
           uncovered and tandem parking which allows more flexibility for new development of
           residential units, particularly on sites that also have commercial or industrial uses.
           Five Year Objective: Provide appropriate land use designations to fulfill the City’s RHNA,
           which is 44 very low-income; 27 low-income; 28 moderate-income; and 69 upper income
           residential units.

           September 2010.
           Program 7 –Facilitate Development on Underutilized Sites
           Due to the scarcity of vacant land remaining in El Segundo, the City can play an important
           role in providing information to prospective developers on sites suitable for residential
           development. The City will facilitate development on underutilized properties by providing
           potential housing developers with a list of underutilized Multi-Family Residential (R-3) and
           Medium Density Residential (MDR) properties. In addition, the City intends to advise
           homebuyers and developers that they may pursue a variety of public and private funding
           sources in support of affordable housing development.

           from Sate and Federal funding sources.
          Program 8 – Transitional Supportive Housing and Emergency Shelters
           The ESMC does not explicitly allow for homeless facilities or emergency shelters in El
           Segundo. Therefore, the City will modify its zoning regulations to permit emergency shelters
           in one of two industrial zones as permitted uses and transitional and supportive housing as a
           principally permitted use in a multifamily residential zone. This Code amendment will
           establish standards for said supportive housing and shelters that are no more restrictive than
           standards that apply to other residential uses of the same type permitted in the same zone.
           Five Year Objective: Revise the ESMC to permit transitional and supportive housing facilities as a
           principally permitted use in a multi-family residential zone subject only to the same permitting processes and
           regulatory requirements as other residential uses in the same zone and emergency shelters as permitted uses in
           either the Medium Manufacturing (MM) or Light Industrial (M1)industrial zones.

           Time Frame: September 2010: Adopt zone text amendment to principally permit transitional supportive
           housing in a multifamily residential zone subject only to the same permitting processes and regulatory
           requirements as other residential uses in the same zone and emergency shelters as a principally permitted use
           in either the City’s MM or M1industrial zones.
           Program 9 – Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing
           The ESMC currently does not contain provisions for Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
           housing. Therefore, the ESMC is proposed to be amended to principally permit SROs in at
           least one multifamily residential zone, as well as a principally permitted use in either the
           Medium Manufacturing (MM) Zone district or the Light Industrial (M1) Zone district.
           Five Year Objective: Revise the ESMC to permit SROs as a permitted use in a multifamily
           residential zone and as a permitted use in either the City’s MM or M1 zone districts. Code amendment to
           establish standards for SROs can be no more restrictive than standards that apply to other residential uses of
           the same type permitted in the same zone.

D.         REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS
Similar to other jurisdictions in California, El Segundo has governmental regulations that affect
housing development. These include the charging of permit processing and development fees,
adoption of the California Building Code, and the establishing of processing times for tentative tract
maps, and conditional use permits or variances. Under present State law, the El Segundo Housing
Element must address, and where legally possible, remove governmental constraints affecting the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. This also includes the removal of
constraints to allow for greater accommodation for housing for person with disabilities. The
following programs are designed to lessen governmental constraints on housing development.
GOAL 4: Remove governmental constraints on housing development.
Policy 4.1: Continue to allow second units, condominium conversions, caretaker units and second floor residential use
in commercial zones as specified in the El Segundo Municipal Code.
Policy 4.2: Continue to allow factory-produced housing according to the El Segundo Municipal Code.
Policy 4.3: Facilitate timely development processing for residential construction projects and expedite the project review
process.
Policy 4.4: Facilitate provision of infrastructure to accommodate residential development.
           Program 10 – Density Bonus/Development Incentives Ordinance
           Government Code §§ 65915, et seq. provides for the California density bonus law. El
           Segundo does not currently have its own density bonus provisions and, therefore, is
           obligated to implement State density bonus law provisions. The City does, however, intend
           to adopt a local density bonus ordinance to comply with all provisions of State law and which
           will specify regulatory concessions to be offered. The ordinance will primarily be aimed at
           providing density incentives for multi-family projects in the R-3 Zone. A range of potential
           regulatory concessions will be set forth in the ordinance, such as flexibility in height limits,
           reduced parking, reduced setbacks, and/or reduced open space requirements.
           Five Year Objective: Adopt Density Bonus/Development Incentives regulations and inform developers
           of the program availability. Provide information on City’s website.

           Program 11 – Expedite Project Review
           A community's evaluation and review process for housing projects contributes to the cost of
           housing because holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit's
           selling price. Periodic surveys conducted by the City indicate that local processing times are
           quite comparable to those experienced in neighboring communities. The City provides
           accelerated plan check service.
           Five Year Objective: Continue to monitor permit processing times and investigate ways to streamline.
           Continue computerizing information including building permits and the ESMC. Continue to provide
           accelerated plan check service.

           Program 12 – Provide Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities
           Pursuant to Government Code § 65583, the City is obligated to remove potential and actual
           governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing
           for all income levels and for persons with disabilities. According, the City will continue to
           implement provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the review and
           approval of housing projects, and will adopt a “reasonable accommodation” ordinance
           addressing the housing needs of the disabled.
           Five- Year Goal: Continue to implement Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations to assist
           disabled households with architectural modifications to their homes. Consider adopting a “reasonable
           accommodation” ordinance that expands upon the provisions of the ADA, provides for accessibility
           improvements using CDBG funds, and make information on this program more widely available to residents.
           Funding Source: General Fund
           Responsible Agency: Planning and Building Safety Department
           Time Frame: December 2010: Consider adopting reasonable accommodation ordinance and provide
           informational handouts and information on the City’s website regarding programs and resources available to
           disabled households.
           Program 13 – Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing
           Pursuant to Chapter 727, Statutes of 2005 (SB 1087), the City of El Segundo is required to
           deliver its adopted housing element and any amendments thereto to local water and sewer
           service providers. This is in order to facilitate the coordination between the City and the
           water and sewer providers when considering approval of new residential projects, to ensure
           that the providers have had an opportunity to provide input on the element, and to grant
           priority water and sewer services to projects that propose affordable housing to lower-
           income households.
           Five- Year Goal: Submit the adopted Housing Element to local water and sewer providers for their review
           and input.

E.         PROMOTE EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community, the housing program must include actions that promote housing opportunities for all
persons regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color,
age, or physical disability. More generally, this program component entails ways to further fair
housing practices.
GOAL 5: Provide housing opportunities including ownership and rental, fair-market and
assisted, in conformance with open housing policies and free of discriminatory practices.
Policy 5.1: Disseminate and provide information on fair housing laws and practices to the community.
Policy 5.2: Promote governmental efforts to provide equal opportunity housing for existing and projected demands in
El Segundo.
Policy 5.3: Monitor the lending practices of local lending institutions for compliance under the Community
Reinvestment Act to evaluate lending activities and goals toward meeting the community’s credit needs.
           Program 14 – Fair Housing Program
           Fair Housing is a citywide program that provides assistance to El Segundo residents to settle
           disputes related to violations of local, State, and Federal housing laws. Also, Fair Housing
           provides an educational program concerning housing issues for tenants and landlords. El
           Segundo contracts with the Westside Fair Housing Council for fair housing outreach and
           educational information and landlord/tenant dispute resolution. The City will continue to
           advertise the program and continue to promote fair housing practices and provide
           educational information on fair housing at the public counter. Complaints will be referred to
           the appropriate agencies. Additionally, the City contracts with Dispute Resolution Services
           (DRS) which provides no and low cost dispute resolution for a variety of issues including
           housing disputes.
           Five Year Objective: Continue providing fair housing services and continue contractual arrangement
           with the Westside Fair Housing Council and Dispute Resolution Services. Inform public of the availability
           of fair housing services.

Quantified Objectives
Progress in meeting the City's 2001 Housing Element housing production goals are assessed in
Chapter 7 of this element. As previously indicated, between 2000 and 2005 the City was able to
produce 151 net new housing units, exceeding the number of units required by the SCAG RHNA.
This averages approximately 30 dwelling units produced annually during the 2000-2005 planning
period. A strong reduction in housing production in more recent years has occurred, however,
because of a nation-wide housing recession. This is reflected in the number of dwelling units
constructed in the City in 2006 (13 units), in 2007 (16 units), and in 2008 (14 units) which averages
approximately 14 units annually. Table 8-1 acknowledges this most recent downward trend in
housing production and establishes the City’s quantified objectives for the current 2006-2014
planning period accordingly.
