The City of Rancho Palos Verdes is located on      Each of the fo u r cities on the Peninsula

coas tline land vacant.
The Peni n s ula has A unique physiography,
formed over millions of years of submerging
and lifting from the Pacific Ocean. Once an
island, the Peninsula, nine miles wide by four
miles deep, now rises above the Los Angeles
Basin, with the highest elevation at 1480 feet.
The forming of the Peninsula has resulted in
the unique terrace configurations readily
observable today and the steep, rocky cliffs at
the ocean's edge which rise from fifty to three
hundred feet. Erosion has created numerous
steep-walled canyons.
Its his tory is equally interesting, from the days
of the early peoples who migrated to the area,

Pro j e ct, the developing of cities, and to the
pres ent.
With its m agnificent views of the Los Angeles
Basin and ocean, and clean air, the Peninsula
is a very desirable place to live. Construction of
homes began in the 1920's and continued at
varying rates to the present. The rate increased
dramatically in the 1960's and i n tensified in
densities, primarily in unincorporated areas.
                                                                                                    1
  During the 1960's, the citizens of the entire
  Peninsula made repeated attempts to in-
  fluence County planning and zoning in the
  unincorporated area. The homeowners' ass o-
  ciations bonded into the Pe n i nsula Advisory
  C o u n cil, and Save Our Coastline, a citizen s
  group, was created to concentrate the sam e
  attempts on the coastal area. Ther e were
  repeated failures as the County granted m ore
  and more zone changes for higher densities,
  with little concern for the sens itive environment
  of the area.
  Incorporation attempts for a fourth city began in
  1962, i n tensifying in 1969. There was much
  litigation and m any setbacks before the
  Supreme Court, in September 1972, ruled 7 to
  0 in Curtis vs. Board of Supervisors that
  landowners could not prevent voters from
  determining their municipal government. After
  six months delay, an election was s et. In that
  election, held Au g u s t 2 8 , 1 9 73, an
  overwhelming majority of 5 to 1 voted in favor
  of incorporati o n and elected its five City
  Council mem bers, who first met September 7,
  1973.
  The City was formed. Its goals were clear. The
  major goal was s elf-determination.The right to
  determine land use, which meant l o w er
  densities, and preservation of the coastal
  resources, the canyon and rural resources,
  and the views.

ENHANCE ITS NATURAL RESOURCES, BEAUTY, AND OPEN SPACE FOR THE BENEFIT AND

and typically flows from the west-southwest in
a day-night cycle with s p eeds generally
ranging from 5 to 15 mph. The sea breeze
maintains the coot temperatures and clean air
circulation and generally prevents warmer
inland tem peratures and air pollution from
permeating into the pen insula, except under
certain seas onal conditions s uch as the
offshore Santa Ana winds.
The climate on the penins u la has been
class ified by other studies into five (5) micro
zones (Gales). Of the five, there are three (the
Coastal Zone, Upper West Face of the Hill, and
Middle Highlands/Eastern Upper Slopes) that
apply to the City of Rancho Palos Verdes. (See
Figure 3).
                                                                                                     7

  coastal zone, but nighttime temperatures are
  generally co o l e r, and there are m ore occur-
  rences of very warm days than in the coastal
  zo n e. Relative hum idity is fairly high, b u t
  fluctuates m ore than in the Coastal Zone. The
  aft ernoon sea breeze tends to k e ep
  temperatures moderate and can be brisk down
  through the valleys.
  Zone 3 - Middle
  Highlands/Eastern
  Upper Slopes
  This zone tends to have greater climatic
  variation than the previou s zones. Tempera-
  tures are slightly warmer than in Zone 2 and
  warm days can be very warm with cool days as
  cool or cooler than in any other zo n e .
  Temperatures have about a 200 range
  This mild climate combined with soil and plant
  nutrients have created a setting enabling a
  wide variety of both native and man-introduced
  plant species to grow within the City. In order
  to flourish, many man-introduced spe cies
  require a certain amount of supplem enta ry
  water and care. Other species have adapted
  well and thrive with the natural conditions. At
  one time, agricultural use of large portions of
  the City was able to take advan tage of this
  environmental qu a l i ty but has given way to
  residential development also attracted to the
  mild climate and clean air.

   Air Quality
   Air quality monitoring and control is primarily
   the respons ibility of the State Ai r Resources
   Board , the Los Angeles County Air Pollution
   Control District and the Federal Environmental
   Protection Agency. The main area of concern
   of these agenci es is control of emis sion
   sources, and they do not deal in any direct way
   in land use planning. The EPA, however, is in
   the process of deve l o ping guidelines for
   approval of comple x s ources of air pollution
   such as s hopping centers, sports s tadiums ,
   and others requiring vehicular transportation,
   which would indirectly affect land use
   planni ng cons iderations. Air quality data
   specific to Rancho Palos Verdes a r e not
   currently available, since the nearest air quality
   monitoring station is in Long Be a ch (Station
   72, Los Angeles County, APCD).

are collected for study purposes and ta ken
back to school laboratories . This research and
study though further depleting the marine life,
is ess ential in developing attitudes and
managem ent policies for proper conservation
practices in the future.
Another damaging effect o n tide pools and
rocky intertidal areas is that of abuse b y the
unknowledgeable tide pool visitor. Numerous
marine organisms attached themselves to the
underside of rocks for protection . Many of
these rocks are indiscriminately turned over by
tide pool visitors. Left in this s tate, the attached
organisms are exposed and soon die. Visitors
unwittingly wade through tide pools crushing
shellfish a n d anything in their way. People

   To further restrict taking of marine organisms
   or disruption of tide pools , the State m ay enact
   legislation creating marine life reserves. Areas
   may be declar e d ecological reserves only if
   the State has title to the l a n d or has other
   authority over the land (California Dept. of Fish
   and Ga m e , Code). The State Lands
   Comm iss ion retains authorityover those lands
   below m e an high tide line. When tide pool
   areas are declared marine life preserves, the
   authority is transferred to the Department of
   Fish and Game for their administration.
   The City may als o elect to gain control over the
   tide lands (area from m ean high tide line
   seaward 3 miles) from the State Lands Com-
   mis sion. In this manner the City may regulate
   and control uses within this area. In order to
   gain control, special enacti ng legislation
   would need to be pass ed and signed by the
   State Legislature and Governor. The City of
   Palos Verdes Estates has gained control of its
   tidelands in this m anner (Statutes of California
   1968, Chapter 316). Palos Verdes Estates has
   been authorized by the legislation to use the
   tidelands in a variety of optional uses such as
   construction of wharve s , docks, sm all boat
   harbor, marina aquatic playground, etc. but its
   prim ary purpos e is for the "es tablishm ent,
   preservation, restorati o n, improvement, or
   maintenance of intertidal and subtidal marine
   b iological reserves ....” The City by creati n g
   this type of action would then be responsible
   to enact, maintain, and enforce any regulation

   The increased construction of multiple-family

   apparent in th e table. For the mos t part,
   multiple-family construction has occurred in
   Rancho Palos Verdes, with som e l imited
   development in Palos Verdes Estates and

development, but, in general, the development
in Rancho Palos Verdes is s ignificantly newer
than for the Penins ula as a whole. In Rancho
Palos Verdes, 73.7 percent of the inventory was
constructed during the 1960-1970 decade,
while only 55 percent of the inventory for the
whole Penins ula was cons tructed during this
period. The Peninsula experienced its peak
housing cons truction activity during the l ate
1 9 5 0's and early 1960's, when more than 60
percent of the inventory was constructed. The
lack of older structures in b o th the Peninsula
and the City of Rancho Palos Verdes indicates
a low level of replacement activity during the
foreseeable future.

   Building permit trends for the other three Palos
   Verdes Peninsula comm unities are shown in
   Table 4. Data for Rancho Palos Verdes prior to
   incorporation is not available. A total of 85
   building permits for single-family residences
   were iss ued during the period September 1973
   through April 1 9 7 5. The building permit data
   shown in the table indicates that construction in
   the Peninsula comm unities has been primarily
   single-family residences. There has been
   occasional sm all multiple-family development
   in Palos Verdes Estate s . Development in
   Rolling Hills has been limited exclus ively to
   custom single-family houses on large lots. In
   Rolling Hills Estates, residential construction
   prior to 1972 was primarily single-family
   residences, with the exception of a 56 -unit
   condominium development authorized in 1967
   and cons tructed in 1968. Between Jan uary
   1973 and May 1974, multiple-family permits for
   388 condom inium units were issued in Rolling
   Hills Estates.

Recent Housing Trends in
Rancho Palos Verdes
Recent housing inventory trends i n Rancho
Palos Ver d e s are shown in Table 5 for the
period 1970 to 1973. During this period, a total
of 1,664 units were added to the inventory. Of
this total, 583 units (35% of the additions) were
multiple-family units. Most of th ese m ultiple
units developed prior to 1973 were rental
ap ar tm e nts . Since     January 1973 ,     the
deve lopment of both single-family and rental
apartments has slowed considerably due to a
construction mo ratorium placed on a large
portion of the       City, while condominium
construction has in creas ed (with perm its

Structural Factors
Single-Family Development
Since 1973, single-family development in
Rancho Palos Verdes has be en limited.
Several major subdivisions were completed
and sold out in 1972 and 1 9 73, generally
offering lots of 10,000 to 15,000 s quare feet at
prices in excess of $6 0 ,000. Current prices
represent further i ncreases over those of
previouslyconstructed single-family residences
in Rancho Palos Verdes. During th e mid-
1960's when the bulk of the single-fam ily units
were constructed, prices typically ranged from
$35,000 to $50,000 (these units are currently
reselling at prices in excess of $50,000).

   maintenance fee (a recent survey of 1,087

   maintenance fees am ounted to $58.26 per
   month), which further adds to thei r cost.
   Based on a 9%, 30 year mortgage, this
   monthly cost represents an effective
   addition of $7,000 to the purchas e price
   which means that the owner of a single
   family hom e doing his own maintenance
   would have $7,000 more real value for the
   same monthly inves tment. The higher
   peninsula tax rate, compared to other
   areas raises the effective cost of a structure
    $1,000 to $3,000.

   Impact Controls
   Building orientation greatly affects the
   operational efficiency of a structure, as well as
   how residents relate to their surroundings. The
   total problem of building orientation is
   composed of many factors; local topogra p hy,
   'the req u i rements of individual privacy, the
   pleasure of views , reduction of noise levels,
   and various climatic factors. Existing tract
   developments in the City have generally failed
   to properly ass ess specific site conditions. It is
   the intention of this Plan to generate more
   efficient and better s ite orientation in building
   design.
   The following discuss io n addresses general
   concerns for proposed housing developments.
   This section is general in nature, and is
   intended to be further s tre ngthened in the
   future.
   Topography
   The alteration of natural terrain, which has been
   so prevalent in recent ye a rs, should be
   m i nimized through the use of structura l
   techniques which conform to the terrain rather
   than altering the terrain to support the structure.
   Climate
   Residential and comm ercial activities account
   for more than half o f the electrical energy
   cons u m ption in the coastal region. A large
   amount of this consumption could have been
   reduced had proper bu ilding orientation and
   design techniques been us ed in the past. The

  Commercial Activity
  Existing
  Retail
  Retail facilities in Rancho Palos Verdes are
  limited.
In 1981. the number of licensed retail outlets had
grown to 65. Golden Cove Center remains the
largest commercial center in the City. The mall
convenience market located along Palos Verdes
Drive South has closed.
           This facility totals approximately
 86,000 square feet, of which approximately
 66,000 square feet are devoted to retail
 outlets, with the remainder used for office
 space and service establishments.
 The second largest retail facility in the City is
 located on Hawthorne Boulevard and
 contains 55,000 square feet of retail space,
 including a supermarket, bank, and a small
 department store. Other commercial centers
 in the City include Miraleste Plaza, with
 seven small retail outlets, and two small
 convenience markets at other locations.
   The number of service stations has
decreased ,from ten to six.

   largely on s im ilar site activities which are taking
   place to the west and south of the site.
   Additional limited scale commercial recreational

    inclined to the south on the southerly side. This
    particular structural relationship is one of the
    major factors respons ible for the large-scale
    landslides present on the Peninsula.
    Four basic geologic formations are present on
    th e Peninsula. The four rock types are:
    Catalina Schist, MontereyFormation,instrusive
    volcanics, and terrace deposits . (See Natural

    Two faults are present on the Peninsula: the
    Cabrillo fault and the Palos Verdes fault. The
    Cabrillo fault traverses northwesterly from the
    southeas tern corner of the area to near the
    center of the Peninsula (see General Geology

    traverses the northeastern corner of the study

    The segm ents of the fault to the northwest and
    southeast of the 1856 break are “active areas"
    that experience earthquakes of medium to sm all
    magnitude on a fairly regular basis . The 1856
    break, however, is not moving, but is s toring
    energy. The approxim ate rate of this s torage can
    be deduced from the movement to the northwest
    which is occurring at a rate of 5-6 cm/yr, while that
    to th e southwes t is approximately 8.5 cm/yr.
    Current theory sugges ts that the differential
    between the two rates is b eing taken up in the
    Transve rs e Ranges near the south end of the
    segment, and that a rate of approximately 5-6
    cm/yr is applicable to mos t of the segm ent of the
    1856 break. This rate is compatible with oth er
    consi d erations (Brune et al., 1969) relating to
    movem ent on the fault.

The mos t impo rta nt consideration is that 118
years have pas sed since thi s segment last
moved. Regardless of the rate of displacement
ass umed, there is probably enough energy
stored in this s egment of the San Andreas fault to
generate a major earthquake at any time. If a 6
cm /yr rate is valid, the energy stored already is
sufficient to generate an earthquake of a
magni tu de of approximately 8.3. This is the
estimated magnitude of the greatSan Francis co
earthquake of 1906.

                                                 a unit and are usually conceived as an entity. If

     some parcels may never be divided, either
     because the owners do not desire to do so or

The County estimate for its entire Statistical
Area No. 23, which includes the four cities,
unincorporated area, Lomita, and part of
Torrance is 195,244 as of January 1974, and
a projection to 1990 of 205,000. This is a
projected increase of less than 10,000 per-
sons. If this projection is accurate, the
projection for Rancho Palos Verdes may be
quite high, at least for 1990 as a capacity
year, since the other three Peninsula cities
are projecting almost 9,000 additional by that
time and Lomita is projecting 5,000-6,000.
Assuming the County projection is accurate,
the various cities are allowing more housing
than will be needed for the projected
population by 1990.

    areas, while restricting future developments
    from hazardous areas.
    The City will be initiating and receiving studies
    which supply additional input on proper
    treatment of the coastal region. Under State
    law, section 65451 defines specific plans as
    including:
    ". . . detailed regulations, programs and pro-
    posed legislation which shall be necessary or
    convenient for the systematic implementation
    of each element of the general plan listed in
    Section 65302 . . ."
    Based on this specific plan, decisions may be
    reached which alter use or intensity of urban
    activities. Through these studies, information
    will be conveyed which will help to better define
    bluff regions and holding capacities in coastal
    areas. This specific plan will be completed as
    soon as practical.
    The area bounded by Hawthorne Boulevard, Rancho
    Palos Verdes Park, and the Los Verdes Golf Course
    was submitted as a residential tract development in
    1976. The City did not have time to create a specific
    plan for the area prior to the development request
    Other specific Plans may also be initiated in the
    future and it is not necessary for them to be
    designated in the Plan for the City to do so.

    Based on this further refinement and analy-
    sis, it was appropriate to reject alternatives C
    and D based on environmental impact. The
    very lowest density alternative, A, as a
    maximum, was rejected as requiring too
    much control of growth, beyond what was
    required by the nature of the land. The Plan,
    as drafted, is somewhat of a hybrid, but
    included additional factors and land use
    determinants beyond what was possible in
    the hypothetical alternatives study.

    It is thus unrealistic to assume that the costs
    of implementation of the Plan can be finally
    and accurately determined at the outset. It is
    possible, however, to identify the range of
    implementation costs. Through careful
    planning and budgeting on a continuing basis,
    the City can minimize and redirect the costs of
    implementation.
    This element of the Plan indicates how
    different Plan implementation proposals
    might create either City, other public, or private
    costs. The cost to the City is determined with

    to the taxpayer is the total tax burden
    associated with plan implementation, com -

    includes those items associated with Plan

                                                 Forecasts are generally based upon the
                                                 previous fiscal pattern of the government,
                                                 together with presently known factors.
                                                 Forecasting fiscal impact, however, is fraught
                                                 with uncertainties and unknowns. Moveover,

                                                 however, this appears to be a somewhat

                                                 which the City has little control:

In order to make these projections, it is
necessary that certain assumptions be made
to control the variables. These assumptions
are:
 -  That effective levels of service provided
    will remain the same to 1990.
 -  All expenditures, costs and revenues are
    projected in 1974-75 dollars.
-   Inflation is not considered for either
    revenues or expenditures. It is assumed
    that inflation will affect revenues and
    expenditures equally over the projection
    period.

proposed added services
  and facilities – impacts

The Goals Report and other sections of the
General Plan identify an array of amenities,
facilities, and services desired by Rancho
Palos Verdes' citizens. The previous section
described possible impacts based on the
current level of service and facility commit-
ment. In order to fully appreciate the cost
impact of additional amenities, facilities, and
services, a review of possibilities is in order.

    Other Amenities
    The Goals Statements identify many other
    desirable amenities. They include archeologi-
    cal preservation, a trails system, roadside and
    median strip beautification, public restrooms
    at scenic vistas and stables. In the future
    other amenities will be identified. Although
    highly desirable, they will have a fiscal impact.
    That fiscal impact will have three elements
    just as the previous amenities have.
    Acquisition, development and the con-tinuing
    maintenance will add to the cost of operating
    the City. The citizens and City Council must
    evaluate each on its merits and its costs.
    In conclusion, it appears that the major
    proposals of the General Plan can be imple-
    mented, although with varying degrees of
    fiscal impact. It thus becomes important for
    the City to take all possible steps to mitigate
    and reduce these fiscal impacts. That subject
    is discussed in the following section.

 Landowners in the preserved areas will continue
 to own their land and may sell their rights to
 further development to other landowners or
 builders who wish to develop those areas in
 which development is feasible.
Under the system, a zoning district is established
for preservation of open space in which all
development is essentially prohibited. The
residential development potential of the zoning
district before its open space designation is
calculated as follows: For each residential
dwelling eliminated in a preservation district, a
substituted dwelling is added to a developable
district of the community. A development right is
created for each dwelling eliminated in the
preserved district and is distributed to the
landowners.      To   construct    dwellings     in
developable areas, a development right is
necessary along with appropriate zoning.

    The elements mandated by the State Government Code have been integrated into functional relationships
    in this Plan. The following list indicates the location by Element and section.

 Due to the long-range and policy nature of the General Plan, direct specific application of the requirements
 of an environmental impact report is not always practical. But because it is a purpose of the environmental
 impact report process to expose alternatives and impacts, and it is a function of the General Plan to
 analyze options and select best alternatives, it is appropriate to address the environmental impact report
 requirements within the Plan. The following summarizes the requirements and indicates the location, by
 Element and section, of the items required to be addressed.
 1. Description of the Project
 The project is a General Plan for the City of Rancho Palos Verdes. The Plan encompasses the 12.3 square
 miles within the City boundaries, indicated on Maps, in the beginning of this document.
The objective of the project is the adoption of a long-range comprehensive plan for physical development,
including goals, objectives, policies, and proposals, which meets the requirements of the California
Government Code.
 A general description of the project's technical, economic, and environmental characteristics includes:
 a.    The technical characteristic is that the project is a guide to be used by decision-making bodies
       concerning the future development of the City.
 b.    The economic characteristic is that the project will provide for land use activities that promote a stable
       economic base and the tool for analyzing fiscal impacts of future decisions.
 C.    The environmental characteristic is that the project analyzes and balances environmental
       considerations with land use planning and reflects the unique environmental character of the City.
 2. Environmental Setting
The City of Rancho Palos Verdes is part of the Los Angeles-Long Beach Metropolitan Area. While most of
the Area is heavily urbanized, the City and the rest of the Palos Verdes Peninsula have been slower to
develop and are primarily residential due to location and topography.
The City encompasses approximately 7,900 acres, with approximately 2,600 acres vacant. The majority of
the 7-1/2 miles of coastline is vacant. The land is extremely sensitive environmentally, including steep
slopes, landslides (both active and inactive), animal habitats, natu ral vegetation areas, many canyons, and
ocean resources. The climate is Mediterranean in character, and the air quality good.
More specific description of the environmental setting is found in the following sections of the Plan:

    3. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
    The project is a positive approach to reducing environmental impacts. The intent is towards preserving environmental
    characteristics and responding to those physical features restricting development for the health, safety, and welfare of
    public. Without the Plan, a potential exists for unplanned use, degradation of resources, and resulting adverse
    environmental impact if policies are not developed to protect and manage resources, environmental character, and
    physical hazards.
254
Long-range impacts include the commitment of portions of the vacant land to urban use, while preserving other land in its
natural state. The Plan proposes uses and intensities which are intended to have lesser adverse impact, while still
allowing some development.
By its nature the project is an indirect impact, since it is only a plan and does not propose specific development. It is
dependent upon numerous mechanisms and procedures for implementation. A major aspect of predevelopment
procedures is the environmental impact review process that permits specific analysis of the impacts of specific
development proposals.
More specific discussions of environmental impacts is found in the following sections of the Plan:

    4. Any Adverse Environmental Effects Which Cannot be Avoided if The Proposal is Implemented
    No significant adverse environmental effects have been identified resulting from the Plan.
    The conversion of vacant land to urban use and alteration of land forms will create potential adverse environmental
    effects. The Plan is intended to reduce these as much as possible. Other adverse impacts which cannot be avoided are
    those associated with natural forces such as earthquake, landslide, sea cliff erosion, or those regional problems such as
    air pollution.
    More specific discussion of adverse environmental effects is found in the following sections of the Plan.

5. Mitigation Measures Proposed to Minimize the Impact
In general terms, the project is a mitigation measure in itself. It proposes to protect and manage the natural environment
of the City and, through the environmental analysis of specific development proposals, it is intended that specific
mitigating measures would be required.
More specific discussion of mitigating measures (often contained in policy statements) is found in the following sections
of the Plan:

    6. Alternatives to the Proposed Action
    In general terms, extreme alternatives to the project are (a) no plan, (b) a plan accommodating maximum development, (c)
    a more restrictive plan. No plan would be illegal under State law, and even if it were not, would place the City in the
    position of having no comprehensive long-range policy direction, which could lead to no control over development and
    degradation of the environment. A less restrictive plan, accommodating maximum growth and development, could result
    in over development and over utilization of environmental resources, producing numerous adverse impacts. A more
    restrictive plan could provide lessened adverse environmental impacts, but could increase social, legal, and economic
    impacts. These three alternatives are inconsistent with the goals of the City.
    Part of the process of developing the Plan was a study to analyze several reasonable alternatives, and this study, with
    subsequent revisions and refinements, led to the Plan. This is discussed in the Land Use Plan, pp. 193-210
    Additional specific discussion of alternatives is found in the following sections of the Plan:

7. The Relationship Between Local Short Term Uses of Man's Environment and the Maintenance and
    Enhancement of Long Term Productivity
The cumulative and long term effects of the project are to maintain the natural environmental
characteristics of the City, while providing for controlled development of land capable of supporting it. The
methodology used provided for the analysis necessary to propose policies promoting a sound balance
between economic development and environmental protection. The Plan promotes a stewardship role for
the City to maintain and enhance the long term productivity of the environment as a regional asset which
should not be lost to short term pressures.

    8. Any Irreversible Environmental Changes Which Would be Involved in the Proposed Action Should it be
         Implemented
    The irreversible environmental changes involved with the project would be the commitment of vacant land
    in its natural state to development for other uses. Although the Plan proposes the preservation of land with
    severe physical constraints and proposes mitigating measures to be taken with any development of other
    land, putting land to urban use would be an irreversible environmental change within the time frame of this
    Plan.
    Additional discussion is in those sections which describe proposed urban uses:
